Even those of the children of men are God's, who know him not, nor own their relation to him. A soul that knows and considers its own nature, and that it must live for ever, when it has viewed the earth and the fulness thereof, will sit down unsatisfied. It will think of ascending toward God, and will ask, What shall I do, that I may abide in that happy, holy place, where he makes his people holy and happy? We make nothing of religion, if we do not make heart-work of it. We can only be cleansed from our sins, and renewed unto holiness, by the blood of Christ and the washing of the Holy Ghost. Thus we become his people; thus we receive blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of our salvation. God's peculiar people shall be made truly and for ever happy. Where God gives righteousness, he designs salvation. Those that are made meet for heaven, shall be brought safe to heaven, and will find what they have been seeking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is the generation of them that seek him - This describes the race of those who seek Him; or, this is their character. The word "generation" here is used evidently in the sense of "race, people, or persons." This is the character or description of the "persons" who seek His favor; or, this is the character of His true friends. The phrase "to seek God" is often used as descriptive of true piety: <a href="/psalms/9-10.htm">Psalm 9:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-17.htm">Proverbs 8:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>. It indicates an earnest desire to know Him and to obtain His favor. It denotes also humility of mind, and a sense of dependence on God.<p>That seek thy face, O Jacob - Margin, O "God of" Jacob. DeWette understands this as meaning that they would seek the face of God among His people; or that they who belonged to the race of Jacob, and who were sincere, thus sought the face of God. There is supposed to be, according to this interpretation, a distinction between the true and the false Israel; between those who professed to be the people of God and those who really were His people (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6-8</a>). It seems to me that the word is not used here as it is in the margin to denote the "God of Jacob," which would be a harsh and an unusual construction, but that it is in apposition with the preceding words, as denoting what constituted the true Jacob, or the true people of God. "This is the generation of them that seek him; this is the true Jacob, that seek thy face, O Lord." That is, this is the characteristic of all who properly belong to the race of Jacob, or who properly belong to God as his true people. The sense, however, is not materially affected if we adopt the reading in the margin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Jacob&#8212;By "Jacob," we may understand God's people (compare Isa 43:22; 44:2, &c.), corresponding to "the generation," as if he had said, "those who seek Thy face are Thy chosen people."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The generation; </span> the true progeny which God regards; whereby he reflects upon them, who boasted and trusted to their carnal generation or descent from Jacob. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That seek him, </span> to wit, God, mentioned in the end of <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/24-5.htm" title="He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.">Psalm 24:5</a></span>, or his face, as it is more fully expressed in the next clause; i.e. that make it their care and study to know him, and his mind and will, and to please and serve him, as this phrase is usually understood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy face, </span> i.e. his face, by a familiar change of the person; of which many instances have been already noted; and <span class="ital">his face</span>, i. e. his grace and favour, which is oft called God’s face, as <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/4-14.htm" title="Behold, you have driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from your face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that finds me shall slay me.">Genesis 4:14</a> <a href="/exodus/33-14.htm" title="And he said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.">Exodus 33:14</a>,15 Psa 16:11 27:2 44:3</span>. And so this phrase is used <span class="bld"><a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm" title="If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.">2 Chronicles 7:14</a> <a href="/psalms/27-8.htm" title="When you said, Seek you my face; my heart said to you, Your face, LORD, will I seek.">Psalm 27:8</a> <a href="/hosea/5-15.htm" title="I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.">Hosea 5:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">O Jacob</span>; so the sense is, that seek the true church, here called <span class="ital">Jacob</span>; that desire the knowledge of it, and conversation with it; in which sense many are said to seek Solomon’s face, as the phrase is in the Hebrew, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/10-24.htm" title="And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.">1 Kings 10:24</a> <a href="/2_chronicles/9-23.htm" title="And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.">2 Chronicles 9:23</a></span>, and the harlot to <span class="ital">seek</span> her lover’s <span class="ital">face</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/proverbs/7-15.htm" title="Therefore came I forth to meet you, diligently to seek your face, and I have found you.">Proverbs 7:15</a></span>. And so this is by some expounded of the Gentiles, who inquired after the true church, and finding it in Jacob, were desirous to become proselytes, and to join themselves to the church of Jacob or Israel. But it must be remembered that the psalmist is not here speaking of the calling of the Gentiles, but only of the character or qualification of the true Jacobites or Israelites, who cannot conveniently be said <span class="ital">to seek the face of Jacob</span>, i.e. their own. And the phrase of <span class="ital">seeking the face of Jacob</span>, or <span class="ital">of the church</span>, is no where used in Scripture. Or, as it is in the margin, <span class="ital">O God of Jacob</span>. But that seems to be too large a supplement. Or, this is <span class="ital">Jacob</span>, the pronoun this being easily understood out of the beginning of the verse. Or, the generation (which may in the same manner be supplied) of Jacob, Jacob being here put not for the person, but for the posterity of Jacob, as it is <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/49-7.htm" title="Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.">Genesis 49:7</a> <a href="/numbers/23-7.htm" title="And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.">Numbers 23:7</a>,10,23 Deu 32:9 <a href="/psalms/14-7.htm" title="Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.">Psalm 14:7</a></span>; or for the church or people of God, which is oft called <span class="ital">Jacob</span> or <span class="ital">Israel</span> as <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/14-1.htm" title="For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall join to the house of Jacob.">Isaiah 14:1</a> 41:8 44:1,5,21</span>, &c. So the sense is, This and this only is the true Jacob or Israel, or church of God, and all others are so only in name and title, although they be descended lineally from him. Or, in <span class="ital">Jacob</span>, the particle <span class="ital">in</span> being here understood, as it is in <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/2-12.htm" title="Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.">Psalm 2:12</a> 17:12</span>, and in many other places. So the sense of the place is, This is the true generation of them that seek God’s face in Jacob, i.e. either in Jacob’s land or sanctuary, the only place where God was to be sought; or among the Jacobites or Israelites; by which he insinuates what is expressed <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/9-6.htm" title="Not as though the word of God has taken none effect.

By the "face" of God is meant the favour of God, the discoveries of his love, the light of his countenance, than which nothing is more desirable to gracious souls, or more sought after by them; and by Jacob is meant the God of Jacob; and so Apollinarius has it in his metaphrase; see <a href="/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>; unless Christ should be intended, one of whose names is Israel, <a href="/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3</a>; or the words may be supplied, as they are by some Jewish writers (m), "this is Jacob"; or the persons before described are the seed of Jacob, and who are called by his name: and it may be observed, that the church of God often bears the same name, <a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>; and then the sense is, the persons whose characters are given above are fit to ascend, and stand in the holy hill of God, are Israelites indeed, in whom there is no guile. <p>Selah; on this word; see Gill on <a href="/psalms/3-2.htm">Psalm 3:2</a>. <p>(m) Aben Ezra, Kimchi, &amp; Ben Melech in loc. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">This <i>is</i> the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob.

Two words for <span class="ital">seek</span> are used in this verse. Both may be used of the outward act of visiting the sanctuary; but both come to express the inward purpose of the heart as well. So far as the two words can be distinguished the first denotes the attitude of loving devotion, the second that of inquiry or supplication.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">O Jacob</span>] The A.V. marg. and R.V. rightly follow the LXX, Vulg., and Syr. in reading O God of Jacob. If the Massoretic text is retained, it must be rendered with R.V. marg., <span class="ital">That seek thy face</span>, even <span class="ital">Jacob</span>. These are the ideal Jacob, the true people of God. But the construction is harsh; a vocative is needed after <span class="ital">thy face;</span> and <span class="ital">Jacob</span> does not by itself convey this sense.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the generation of them that seek him</span>.

This, no doubt, is possible, and removes all difficulty. But it is better to loose a Gordian knot than to cut it. We may keep the present text, and obtain a satisfactory sense, by regarding "Jacob" as grammatically in apposition with "generation," and translating, "This is the generation of them that seek him - that seek thy face - even Jacob." All they are not Israel who are of Israel (<a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6</a>). The true Jacob consisted of those Israelites who answered to the character described in  ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>. A break, or pause, here occurred, while the procession of Levites advanced to the very gates of the sanctuary. Then the strain was resumed - the choir being divided into two parts, which sang antiphonally. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Foes are now pursuing him, but prosperity and favour alone shall pursue him, and therefore drive his present pursuers out of the field. &#1488;&#1498;, originally affirmative, here restrictive, belongs only to the subject-notion in its signification nil nisi (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/39-12.htm">Psalm 39:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11</a>). The expression is remarkable and without example elsewhere: as good spirits Jahve sends forth &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; and &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; to overtake David's enemies, and to protect him against them to their shame, and that all his life long (accusative of continuance). We have now no need, in connection with our reference of the Psalm to the persecution under Absolom, either to persuade ourselves that &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is equivalent to &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>, or that it is equivalent to &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. The infinitive is logically inadmissible here, and unheard of with the vowel a&#772; instead of i, which would here (cf. on the other hand &#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;) be confusing and arbitrary. Nor can it be shown from <a href="/jeremiah/42-10.htm">Jeremiah 42:10</a> to be probable that it is contracted from &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;, since in that passage &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489; signifies redeundo  equals  rursus. The lxx, certainly, renders it by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, as in <a href="/1_samuel/12-2.htm">1 Samuel 12:2</a> by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; but (since so much uncertainty attaches to these translators and their text) we cannot draw a safe inference as to the existing usage of the language, which would, in connection with such a contraction, go out of the province of one verb into that of another, which is not the case with &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;  equals  &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/2_samuel/22-41.htm">2 Samuel 22:41</a>. On the contrary we have before us in the present passage a constructio praegnans: "and I shall return (perf. consec.) in the house of Jahve," i.e., again, having returned, dwell in the house of Jahve. In itself &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489; might also even mean et revertam ad (cf. <a href="/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>), like &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>, adscendere ad (in).
