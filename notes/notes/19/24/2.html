Even those of the children of men are God's, who know him not, nor own their relation to him. A soul that knows and considers its own nature, and that it must live for ever, when it has viewed the earth and the fulness thereof, will sit down unsatisfied. It will think of ascending toward God, and will ask, What shall I do, that I may abide in that happy, holy place, where he makes his people holy and happy? We make nothing of religion, if we do not make heart-work of it. We can only be cleansed from our sins, and renewed unto holiness, by the blood of Christ and the washing of the Holy Ghost. Thus we become his people; thus we receive blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of our salvation. God's peculiar people shall be made truly and for ever happy. Where God gives righteousness, he designs salvation. Those that are made meet for heaven, shall be brought safe to heaven, and will find what they have been seeking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he hath founded it upon the seas - That is, the earth, or the habitable world. The ground of the claim to the earth and all that it contains, which is here asserted, is the fact that God had created it, or "founded" it. The language used here - "he hath founded it," that is, he has laid the foundation of it, "upon the seas" and "the floods" - is in accordance with the usual mode of speaking of the earth in the Scriptures as laid upon a foundation - as a house is raised on a firm foundation. See the notes at <a href="/job/38-6.htm">Job 38:6</a>. As the earth appeared to be surrounded by water, it was natural to speak of it as "founded" also upon the waters. There is probably an allusion here to the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-10</a>, where the waters are said to have been so gathered together that the dry land appeared. Above all the waters the earth was established, so as to become the abode of plants, animals, and man.<p>And established it upon the floods - The streams; the torrents. The earth has been elevated above them, so as to be a residence for animals and for men. The essential thought is, that this earth has become what it is by the fact that God has founded it; and, therefore, what it produces belongs of right to Him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Some have thought that the first earth, which Peter says was standing in the water, and out of the water, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5</a>, was made in the form of an egg, and that the waters were under the earth, and the earth was as a crust or shell over them, until the deluge came; and this crust then broke in, and formed the sea; and so it was literally true, that the earth was founded upon, or over the waters; <p>and established it upon the floods; the floods of the seas, or rivers of water running to and fro in it: this shows the ground and foundation of Christ's right and claim to the earth, and all that is in it; which is not by reason of his father's gift to him as Mediator, but by virtue of his concern in creation, the world, and all things in it, being made and established by him; in him do all things consist, <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>. <p>(e) R.

He who has Jahve, the possessor of all things, himself has all things, he lacks nothing; viz., &#1499;&#1468;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, whatever is good in itself and would be good for him, <a href="/psalms/34-11.htm">Psalm 34:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-12.htm">Psalm 84:12</a>. &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; are the pastures of fresh and tender grass, where one lies at ease, and rest and enjoyment are combined. &#1504;&#1488;&#1492; (&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;), according to its primary meaning, is a resting-or dwelling-place, specifically an oasis, i.e., a verdant spot in the desert. &#1502;&#1497; &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; are waters, where the weary finds a most pleasant resting-place (according to Hitzig, it is a plural brought in by the plural of the governing word, but it is at any rate a superlative plural), and can at the same time refresh himself. &#1504;&#1492;&#1500; is suited to this as being a pastoral word used of gentle leading, and more especially of guiding the herds to the watering-places, just as &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1509; is used of making them to rest, especially at noon-tide, Sol 1:7; cf. &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; (elsewhere &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;) signifies to bring back the soul that is as it were flown away, so that it comes to itself again, therefore to impart new life, recreare.

The Hiph. &#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; (Arabic: to put on one side, as perhaps in <a href="/job/12-23.htm">Job 12:23</a>) is, as in <a href="/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a> the intensive of &#1504;&#1495;&#1492; (<a href="/psalms/77-21.htm">Psalm 77:21</a>).
