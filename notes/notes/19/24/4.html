Even those of the children of men are God's, who know him not, nor own their relation to him. A soul that knows and considers its own nature, and that it must live for ever, when it has viewed the earth and the fulness thereof, will sit down unsatisfied. It will think of ascending toward God, and will ask, What shall I do, that I may abide in that happy, holy place, where he makes his people holy and happy? We make nothing of religion, if we do not make heart-work of it. We can only be cleansed from our sins, and renewed unto holiness, by the blood of Christ and the washing of the Holy Ghost. Thus we become his people; thus we receive blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of our salvation. God's peculiar people shall be made truly and for ever happy. Where God gives righteousness, he designs salvation. Those that are made meet for heaven, shall be brought safe to heaven, and will find what they have been seeking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that hath clean hands - In the parallel passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>, the answer to the question is, "He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness." The sentiment is substantially the same there as in the passage before us. The meaning is, that he who would be recognized as a friend and worshipper of Yahweh must be an upright man; a person not living in the practice of iniquity, but striving always to do that which is right. The "hands" are the instruments by which we accomplish anything; and hence, to have clean hands is equivalent to being upright. See <a href="/job/17-9.htm">Job 17:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3</a>; <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/26-10.htm">Psalm 26:10</a>. The margin here, as the Hebrew, is "the clean of hands."<p>And a pure heart - Not merely the one whose external conduct is upright, but whose heart is pure. The great principle is here stated which enters always into true religion, that it does not consist in outward conformity to law, or to the mere performance of rites and ceremonies, or to external morality, but that it controls the heart, and produces purity of motive and of thought.<p>Who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity - Unto that which is "vain," or which is "false." This expression might refer to one who had not devoted himself to the worship of an idol - regarded as vain, or as nothing <a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-24.htm">Isaiah 41:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>; or to one who had not embraced that which is false and vain in opinion; or to one who had not sworn falsely, or taken the name of God in vain, <a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>. The probable meaning is, that he has not set his heart on vain things, or that which is false. He has sought after substantial truth, alike in the object of worship, in that which he professes to believe, and in the statements and promises which he makes to others. He aims to secure that which is true and real. He is in no sense "carried away" with that which is unreal and false.<p>Nor sworn deceitfully - This is one form of that which had been just specified - his love of truth. The idea here is, that he has not affirmed under the solemnities of an oath, that which was false; and that he has not, under similar solemnities, promised what he has not performed. He is a sincere man; a man seeking after the true and the real, and not running after shadows and falsehood; a man true to God and to his fellow-creatures; a man whose statements are in accordance with facts, and whose promises may be always relied on. In the parallel passage, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>, the statement is, "he that speaketh the truth in his heart."

Though "clean hands" are mentioned first, as being more obvious to view, and better known, and more subject to the cognizance and observation of others; yet a "pure heart" is first in being and in order; from whence cleanness of hands, when right and truth springs: no man has a pure heart naturally and of himself: the heart is desperately wicked; the imagination of the thoughts of it is evil continually; the mind and conscience are defiled with sin; nor can any man make his heart clean, or say he is pure from sin; but it is God that creates a clean heart, and renews a right spirit within men, and purifies the heart by faith, which is led to the blood of sprinkling, which purges the conscience, and cleanseth it from all sin; and from this purity of heart flows purity of life and conversation, signified by "clean hands"; the hand being the instrument of action, holy actions, or good works, performed from a principle of grace, are meant; the phrase is expressive of a holy, harmless, and innocent conversation, washing the hands being used to denote innocence, <a href="/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>; not a conversation entirely free from sin, nor by which a man is justified before God; for though he wash his hands ever so clean, they will not be pure in his sight, and will need washing in the blood of the Lamb; but it denotes a conversation upright in general, and declares a man righteous in the sight of men, and distinguishes him from one of a dissolute life, whose hands are full of blood, and defiled with sin; <p>who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity; or "set his heart upon" (g), and desired vain things, as the phrase is sometimes used, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>; that is, the vain things of this world; as the riches, honours, pleasures, and profits of it; or has not served other gods, the idols of the Gentiles, which are lying vanities, but has lifted up his soul to God, and served him only: or "who hath not received his soul in vain" (h); from the hands of God, but loves him with all his soul, believes with the heart in Christ for righteousness, being sanctified by the Spirit of God; and so the desire of his soul is to his name, and the remembrance of him. The "Keri", or marginal reading, according to the points, is, "who hath not lifted up my soul to vanity" (i); that is, has not taken the name of God in vain, or swore falsely by his name; his soul being put for his name or himself; and by which he is said sometimes to swear, <a href="/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>; and this sense the Jewish interpreters (k) generally give into. The Targum seems to take in both the writing of the text and the marginal reading, as it often does, and renders the words, "who hath not sworn in vain, to the condemnation of his soul"; though sometimes to his own disadvantage, yet not to the hurt of others; see <a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>; it follows, <p>nor sworn deceitfully; by bearing false witness against any man; or by cheating him out of his substance through a false oath. <p>(g)   "non inhiat, aut intentus est", Vatablus, Amama; so Gejerus, Michaelis.

He that swears to his own hurt, and changes not.">Psalm 15:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath clean hands.</span> He whose hands are free from acts of sin (comp. <a href="/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2-5</a>), and not only so, but he who hath also a pure heart, since the heart is the source of all evil (<a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19, 20</a>), and wrongful words and wicked acts are the necessary results of the heart being impure. "God's demands upon his people," as Hengstenberg observes, "go beyond the domain of action. Those only see him - those only are fit to ascend into his hill - who have a pure heart." <span class="cmt_word">Who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who has not lusted after vain and worthless things, whose desires are subdued, brought into captivity to the Law of God, and kept under strict control. This is really implied in purity of heart. <span class="cmt_word">Nor sworn deceitfully</span>. False swearing is the worst - or, at any rate, one of the worst - sins of the tongue. The psalmist means to say that a man is not fit to draw near to God unless he is righteous in act, in thought, and in word. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Rod and staff are here not so much those of the pilgrim, which would be a confusing transition to a different figure, but those of Jahve, the Shepherd (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>, and in connection with it, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-18.htm">Numbers 21:18</a>, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1504;&#1514; as the filling up of the picture), as the means of guidance and defence. The one rod, which the shepherd holds up to guide the flock, and upon which he leans and anxiously watches over the flock, has assumed a double form in the conception of the idea. This rod and staff in the hand of God comfort him, i.e., preserve to him the feeling of security, and therefore a cheerful spirit. Even when he passes through a valley dark and gloomy as the shadow of death, where surprises and calamities of every kind threaten him, he hears no misfortune. The lxx narrows the figure, rendering &#1489;&#1490;&#1497;&#1488; according to the Aramaic &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-25.htm">Daniel 3:25</a>, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#837;. The noun &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, which occurs in this passage for the first time in the Old Testament literature, is originally not a compound word; but being formed from a verb &#1510;&#1500;&#1501;, Arab. d&#817;lm (root &#1510;&#1500;, Arab. d&#817;l), to overshadow, darken, after the form &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, but pronounced &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (cf. &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, Hadra-mo&#770;t  equals  the court of death, &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1488;&#1500; in-God's-shadow), it signifies the shadow of death as an epithet of the most fearful darkness, as of Hades, <a href="/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21</a>., but also of a shaft of a mine, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/28-3.htm">Job 28:3</a>, and more especially of darkness such as makes itself felt in a wild, uninhabited desert, <a href="/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>.<p>After the figure of the shepherd fades away in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>, that of the host appears. His enemies must look quietly on (&#1504;&#1490;&#1491; as in <a href="/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>), without being able to do anything, and see how Jahve provides bountifully for His guest, anoints him with sweet perfumes as at a joyous and magnificent banquet (<a href="/psalms/92-11.htm">Psalm 92:11</a>), and fills his cup to excess. What is meant thereby, is not necessarily only blessings of a spiritual kind. The king fleeing before Absolom and forsaken by the mass of his people was, with his army, even outwardly in danger of being destroyed by want; it is, therefore, even an abundance of daily bread streaming in upon them, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27-29</a>, that is meant; but even this, spiritually regarded, as a gift from heaven, and so that the satisfying, refreshing and quickening is only the outside phase of simultaneous inward experiences.<p>(Note: In the mouth of the New Testament saint, especially on the dies viridium, it is the table of the Lord's supper, as Apollinaris also hints when he applied to it the epithet &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, horrendorum onustam.)<p>The future &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1498; is followed, according to the customary return to the perfect ground-form, by &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;, which has, none the less, the signification of a present. And in the closing assertion, &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;, my cup, is metonymically equivalent to the contents of my cup. This is &#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;, a fulness satiating even to excess. </body></html>
