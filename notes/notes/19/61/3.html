Thus the soul, being lifted up to God, returns to the enjoyment of itself. Wherever we are, we have liberty to draw near to God, and may find a way open to the throne of grace. And that which separates us from other comforts, should drive us nearer to God, the fountain of all comfort. Though the heart is overwhelmed, yet it may be lifted up to God in prayer. Nay, I will cry unto thee, for by that means it will be supported and relieved. Weeping must quicken praying, and not deaden it. God's power and promise are a rock that is higher than we are. This rock is Christ. On the Divine mercy, as on a rock, David desired to rest his soul; but he was like a ship-wrecked sailor, exposed to the billows at the bottom of a rock too high for him to climb without help. David found that he could not be fixed on the Rock of salvation, unless the Lord placed him upon it. As there is safety in Him, and none in ourselves, let us pray to be led to and fixed upon Christ our Rock. The service of God shall be his constant work and business: all must make it so who expect to find God their shelter and strong tower. The grace of God shall be his constant comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/61.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thou hast been a shelter for me - A place of refuge; a place where I have found safety. He refers here to what had occurred in former times. God had protected him when in danger, and he pleads that fact as a reason why God should now interpose and deliver him. That reason seems to be founded on two considerations:<p>(a) God had thus shown that he had power to deliver him; and<p>(b) it might be expected that God who is unchangeable, and who had interposed, would manifest the same traits of character still, and would not leave him now.<p>Both of these are proper grounds for prayer.<p>And strong tower from the enemy - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/61.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. shelter &#8230; and strong tower&#8212;repeat the same sentiment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/61.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/61.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thou hast been a shelter for me,....

The king of Israel is hard pressed in the battle, but he knows that victory comes from above, from the God who has hitherto in anger refused it to His people, inasmuch as He has given power to Edom to break through the defensive forces of Israel (vid., <a href="/psalms/44-10.htm">Psalm 44:10</a>). &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514; (not &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;  equals  &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;) is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/108-13.htm">Psalm 108:13</a>, equivalent to &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492;. The view that it is equal to &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;, the suffix being cast away, is not confirmed in this instance, vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>. How vain is human succour, has been seen only very recently in the case of the kings of Zobah and Ammon, who have succumbed in spite of their confederates. Israel prays for its victorious power from above, and also obtains it thence, as is most confidently expressed in v. 14. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, to do valiantly, to show valour, is equivalent to: to be victorious, as in <a href="/psalms/118-16.htm">Psalm 118:16</a>. In God does Israel conquer, and God, who is in Israel, will by means of Israel tread down Edom in accordance with its deserts. </body></html>
