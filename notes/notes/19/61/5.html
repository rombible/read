We ought always to remember that God is a witness to all our vows, all our good purposes, and solemn promises of new obedience. He keeps an account of them, which should be a sufficient reason with us (as it was with David here) why we should perform our vows.

There is a heritage peculiar to that people; present comforts in the soul, earnests of future bliss. Those that fear God have enough in him, and must not complain. We need desire no better heritage than that of those who fear God. Those abide to good purpose in this world, who abide before God, serve him, and walk in his fear; those who do so, shall abide before him for ever. And these words are to be applied to Him of whom the angel said, the Lord shall give unto him the throne of his father David, and of his kingdom there shall be no end, Lu 1:32. God's promises, and our faith in them, are not to do away, but to encourage prayer. We need not desire to be better secured than under the protection of God's mercy and truth. And if we partake of that grace and truth which came by Jesus Christ, we may praise him, whatever be our outward circumstances. But renewed experience of God's mercy and truth towards his people in Christ, is the main matter of our joy in him, and our praise unto him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/61.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thou, O God, hast heard my vows - That is, my prayers accompanied with solemn pledges or promises that I will devote myself to thy service. In some way David had the assurance that those vows and prayers had been heard; that God would answer his supplications - that he would restore him to his home, and to the privilege of uniting with others in the sacred services of the sanctuary. In what way he had this assurance we are not informed, but the statement here accords with what we often find in the Psalms. His troubled mind became calm, for he looked upon the blessing as already granted. He entertained no doubt that what he had asked would be bestowed. The mind of a true believer often feels this assurance now. Somehow he feels an undoubting persuasion that the prayer which he has offered has been heard; that God will be merciful; that the blessing which has been sought will assuredly be conferred. That there may be danger of illusion here, no one can doubt - for we are not, as David was, inspired; but no one can prove that God may not impart such a gracious assurance to the soul; no one can show that it is wrong for a believer to allow peace to flow into his soul, in the confident hope that the blessing which he had sought will be his.<p>Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name - The heirship which pertains to such; the privileges of those who are the true children of God. One of these privileges is that of prayer; another is the peace which results from adoption into the family of God; of feeling that we are his heirs.

Proofs of divine faithfulness are to be had in remembrance, and to be mentioned to the Lord's honour. The prayer of <a href="/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a> is certain of an answer because of the experience of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/61-5.htm">Psalm 61:5</a>, since we deal with an immutable God. "Vows" may rightly be joined with prayers when they are lawful, well-considered, and truly for God's glory. It is great mercy on God's part to take any notice of the vows and promises of such faithless and deceitful creatures as we are. What we promise him is his due already, and yet he deigns to accept our vows as if we were not so much his servants as his free suitors who could give or withhold at pleasure. "Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name." We are made heirs, joint-heirs with all the saints, partakers of the same portion. With this we ought to be delighted. If we suffer, it is the heritage of the saints; if we are persecuted, are in poverty, or in temptation, all this is contained in the title-deeds of the heritage of the chosen. Those we are to sup with we may well be content to dine with. We have the same inheritance as the First-born himself; what better is conceivable? Saints are described as fearing the name of God; they are reverent worshippers; they stand in awe of the Lord's authority; they are afraid of offending him, they feel their own nothingness in the sight of the Infinite One. To share with such men, to be treated by God with the same favour as he metes out to them, is matter for endless thanksgiving. All the privileges of all the saints are also the privilege of each one.<p><a href="/psalms/61-6.htm">Psalm 61:6</a><p>"Thou will prolong the king's life;" or, better, "days to the days of the King thou wilt add." Death threatened, but God preserved his beloved. David, considering his many perils, enjoyed a long and prosperous reign. "And his years as many generations." He lived to see generation after generation personally; in his descendants he lived as king through a very long period; his dynasty continued for many generations; and in Christ Jesus, his seed and son, spiritually David reigns on evermore. Thus he who began at the foot of the rock, half drowned, and almost dead, is here led to the summit, and sings as a priest abiding in the tabernacle, a king ruling with God for ever, and a prophet foretelling good things to come, (<a href="/psalms/61-7.htm">Psalm 61:7</a>.) See the uplifting power of faith and prayer. None so low but they may yet be set on high.<p><a href="/psalms/61-7.htm">Psalm 61:7</a><p>"He shall abide before God for ever." Though this is true of David in a modified sense, we prefer to view the Lord Jesus as here intended as the lineal descendant of David, and the representative of his royal race. Jesus is enthroned before God to eternity; here is our safety, dignity, and delight. We reign in him; in him we are made to sit together in the heavenlies. David's personal claim to sit enthroned for ever is but a foreshadowing of the revealed privilege of all true believers. "O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him." As men cry, "Long live the king," so we hail with acclamation our enthroned Immanuel, and cry, "Let mercy and truth preserve him." Eternal love and immutable faithfulness are the bodyguards of Jesus' throne, and they are both the providers and the preservers of all those who in him are made kings and priests unto God. We cannot keep ourselves, and nothing short of divine mercy and truth can do it; but these both can and will, nor shall the least of the people of God be suffered to perish.<p><a href="/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a><p>"So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever." Because my prayer is answered, my song shall be perpetual; because Jesus for ever sits at thy right hand, it shall be acceptable; because I am preserved in him, it shall be grateful. David had given vocal utterance to his prayer by a cry; he will now give expression to his praise by a song: there should be a parallel between our supplications and our thanksgivings. We ought not to leap in prayer, and limp in praise. The vow to celebrate the divine name "for ever" is no hyperbolical piece of extravagance, but such as grace and glory shall enable us to carry out to the letter. "That I may daily perform my vows." To God who adds days to our days we will devote all our days. We vowed perpetual praise, and we desire to render it without intermission. We would worship God de die in diem, going right on as the days roll on. We ask no vacation from this heavenly vocation; we would make no pause in this sacred service. God daily performs his promises, let us daily perform our vows: he keeps his covenant let us not forget ours. Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth, even for evermore. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/61.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My vows; </span> my fervent prayers, attended with many vows and promises, as was usual, especially in cases of great danger or difficulty, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/28-20.htm" title="And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,">Genesis 28:20</a> <a href="/judges/11-30.htm" title="And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,">Judges 11:30</a>,31</span>.

Or "my prayers", as the Septuagint and other versions. Vows are so called, because it was usual to make vows in trouble, when prayer was made to the Lord for help and deliverance, <a href="/psalms/66-13.htm">Psalm 66:13</a>. This is a reason why the psalmist was encouraged to put his trust in the Lord, because his prayers were heard by him; or he was sure they would be, as he had entreated, <a href="/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a>. The past is put for the future, as Kimchi and Ben Melech observe; and it may be because of the certainty of his prayers being heard; and which may be concluded from the Lord's declaring himself a God hearing prayer, from the prevalent mediation of Christ, from the assistance and intercession of the Spirit, and from the exercise of faith in prayer, and the divine promises; or while he was crying to God an answer was returned, and he was delivered out of his troubles, <a href="/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>. Another reason follows: <p>thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name: not the land of Israel, as Aben Ezra and Jarchi; which was given for an inheritance to the posterity of Abraham, <a href="/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>; and which was never more fully in their possession than in the times of David: nor the tabernacle or sanctuary of the Lord, as Kimchi; where he desired to dwell, <a href="/psalms/61-4.htm">Psalm 61:4</a>; and now had his request granted: but the heavenly glory, the incorruptible inheritance, the inheritance of the saints in light, prefigured by them both; which is the gift of God their Father to them his children; comes to them through the death of Christ the testator; is not of the law, and the works of it; is not acquired nor purchased; but is owing to the free grace of God; to predestinating grace, as the source of it; to justifying grace, through the righteousness of Christ, as the right unto it; and to regenerating and sanctifying grace, as the meetness for it. Wherefore it manifestly belongs to those that "fear the name of the Lord", himself, his perfections, particularly his goodness; who adore and admire, serve and worship him, internally and externally; not with a slavish fear, but with a filial godly fear. The Targum renders it, <p>"thou hast given an inheritance to them that fear thy name;'' <p>that in the King's Bible is, <p>"an inheritance in the world to come;'' <p>so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and the Oriental versions; and which sense is given by Aben Ezra. It may be understood of them that fear the Lord, being the inheritance itself; as they are of Christ, David's son and antitype, and who is designed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/61-6.htm">Psalm 61:6</a>, see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>, <a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/61.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For thou, O God, <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> hast heard my vows: thou hast given <i>me</i> the heritage of those that fear thy name.</span><p>(c) There is nothing that strengthens our faith more than the memory of God's help in times past.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/61.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">host heard my vows</span>] Vows accompanied by prayers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou hast given</span> me <span class="ital">the heritage of those that fear thy name</span>] <span class="ital">Me</span> is not in the original; and it is best to supply the remoter object of the verb from the complement of the nearer object, and render with LXX, (Vulg.), Jer., P.B.V., thou hast given (their) possession to them that fear thy name. ‘Possession’ is the term regularly used of Israel’s ‘occupation’ of the land of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm" title="And when you come near over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-18.htm" title="And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it: you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.">Deuteronomy 3:18</a>; &c.; <a href="/psalms/37-9.htm" title="For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait on the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.">Psalm 37:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-11.htm" title="But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.">Psalm 37:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-22.htm" title="For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.">Psalm 37:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-29.htm" title="The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.">Psalm 37:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-34.htm" title="Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt you to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.">Psalm 37:34</a>).

The king of Israel is hard pressed in the battle, but he knows that victory comes from above, from the God who has hitherto in anger refused it to His people, inasmuch as He has given power to Edom to break through the defensive forces of Israel (vid., <a href="/psalms/44-10.htm">Psalm 44:10</a>). &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514; (not &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;  equals  &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;) is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/108-13.htm">Psalm 108:13</a>, equivalent to &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492;.
