He calls himself king, either, 1st, Because, if this Psalm was composed before Saul’s death, yet even then he knew he was designed and appointed to be king; or, rather, 2d, Because it was not composed till Saul was dead, and he was actually crowned king, at least of Judah. <span class="ital">And his years — </span>The years of my life and reign; <span class="ital">as many generations — </span>As long as if I had a lease of it for many ages. Thus he speaks, because his kingdom was not like Saul’s, but established to him and his heirs; and because Christ, his Son and Heir, should actually, and in his own person, possess the kingdom for ever. We may observe further here, that the Chaldee Paraphrase adds the word <span class="ital">Christ; </span>thus, <span class="ital">Thou shalt give unto Christ the King days upon days. His years shall be as the generations of this world, and the generations of the</span> <span class="ital">world to come. </span>And so Theodoret observes, that the former part of the verse may very well agree with the psalmist, but that the latter part of it is by no means applicable to him, but only to Christ; who was, according to the flesh, to descend from him, and of whom the psalmist was an eminent type. <span class="ital">He shall abide — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ישׁב</span>, <span class="ital">jesheeb, he shall sit; </span>namely, on the throne; <span class="ital">before God for ever — </span>Living and ruling as in God’s presence, serving him with his royal power, and worshipping him in his tabernacle. <span class="ital">O prepare mercy and truth — </span>Or, <span class="ital">order, </span>or <span class="ital">appoint, </span>as the word <span class="greekheb">מן</span>, <span class="ital">man, </span>here signifies, intending, either, 1st, The graces of <span class="ital">mercy, </span>or <span class="ital">compassion </span>and <span class="ital">truth, </span>or <span class="ital">faithfulness, </span>which are the great supporters of thrones; or rather, the effects of God’s mercy and truth. Thy <span class="ital">truth, </span>in giving me those mercies which thou hast promised to me; and thy <span class="ital">mercy, </span>in giving me such further blessings as I need, and thou seest fit to give me. <span class="ital">So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever — </span>I will never cease praising thee while I live, and after I die, I shall praise thee in eternity. Let us remember, we must make praising God the work of our <span class="ital">time </span>in this world; even to the last, as long as our lives are prolonged, we must continue praising him; and then it will be made the work of our <span class="ital">eternity </span>in the world to come, and we shall be praising him for ever. <span class="ital">That 1 may daily perform my vows — </span>That I may pay unto thee those services and oblations which I vowed to thee, when I was in trouble. David’s praising God was itself the performance of his vows, and it disposed his heart to the performance of them in other instances. Praising God, and paying our vows to him, must be our constant daily work; every day we must be doing something toward it; because it is all but little in comparison with what is due; because we daily receive fresh mercies, and because, if we think much to do it daily we cannot expect to be doing it eternally. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/61.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>61:5-8 There is a people in the world that fear God's name. There is a heritage peculiar to that people; present comforts in the soul, earnests of future bliss. Those that fear God have enough in him, and must not complain. We need desire no better heritage than that of those who fear God. Those abide to good purpose in this world, who abide before God, serve him, and walk in his fear; those who do so, shall abide before him for ever. And these words are to be applied to Him of whom the angel said, the Lord shall give unto him the throne of his father David, and of his kingdom there shall be no end, Lu 1:32. God's promises, and our faith in them, are not to do away, but to encourage prayer. We need not desire to be better secured than under the protection of God's mercy and truth. And if we partake of that grace and truth which came by Jesus Christ, we may praise him, whatever be our outward circumstances. But renewed experience of God's mercy and truth towards his people in Christ, is the main matter of our joy in him, and our praise unto him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/61.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou wilt prolong the king's life - literally, "Days upon the days of the king thou wilt add;" that is, Thou wilt add days to those which thou hast already permitted him to live. The language does not necessarily mean that he would have a long life, but that he would still be permitted to live. He had apprehended death. He knew that his life was sought by those who were engaged with Absalom in the rebellion. At first it was uncertain what the issue would be. He had fled for his life. But now, in answer to prayer, he felt assured that his life would be preserved; that he would be permitted to return to his home and his throne; and that as king - as the sovereign of his people - he would be permitted to honor God.<p>And his years as many generations - Margin, as in Hebrew, generation and generation. This probably means that he would be permitted to live longer than the ordinary time of a generation; that he would live as if one generation - or as if one ordinary lifetime - were added to another, so that he would live through successive generations of men. The average life of a generation is about thirty years. David is supposed to have lived from 1085 before the Christian era to 1016 b.c., or 69 years, which would reach a third generation. This is a more natural interpretation of the passage than to suppose that he refers to an "ideal" king, or that his dynasty would continue for many generations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/61.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7. the king&#8212;himself and his royal line ending in Christ.

Yet we must not think that David did commonly and publicly call or own himself to be king, which had neither been true nor convenient for his affairs; but this Psalm either was not composed whilst Saul lived, or at least was penned only for his private use and comfort, and not <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">committed to the chief musician; </span> which indeed it could not be till David had the kingdom, and the inspection of the sacred music and service of the tabernacle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His years, </span> i.e. the years of my life and reign. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As many generations; </span> as long as if I had a lease of it for many ages.

His life had been in danger: but now the danger was over. At first sight the words may seem to be those of another, speaking of David, rather than those of David speaking of himself. But he thus uses the third person because he is speaking of himself in his capacity of king, referring to the promises made to the king as such. Cp. <a href="/jeremiah/38-5.htm" title="Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.">Jeremiah 38:5</a>, where Zedekiah says, “The king is not he that can do anything against you” = I, though king, cannot &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and <span class="ital">his years</span>] R.V., his years shall be as many generations. This verse is not a prayer, and the text ought not to be altered to turn it into a prayer. It is a confident appeal to God’s promise and purpose.

The language is partly hyperbolical, like the salutation “Let the king live for ever” (<a href="/1_kings/1-31.htm" title="Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.">1 Kings 1:31</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-3.htm" title="And said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lies waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?">Nehemiah 2:3</a>); partly it thinks of the king as living on in his descendants (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm" title="He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.">2 Samuel 7:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And your house and your kingdom shall be established for ever before you: your throne shall be established for ever.">2 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-29.htm" title="Therefore now let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you: for you, O Lord GOD, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your servant be blessed for ever.">2 Samuel 7:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-29.htm" title="His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.">Psalm 89:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-36.htm" title="His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.">Psalm 89:36</a>); but words which in their strict sense could apply to no human individual, become a prophecy of One greater than David; and thus the Targum here interprets ‘king’ by ‘King Messiah.’ See <span class="ital">Introd</span>. p. lxxiv ff; and Introd. to Psalms 21.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/61.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou wilt prolong</span> (or, mayest <span class="accented">thou prolong</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the king's life.</span> The question arises - What king? Some answer that  David prays for the extension of his own life; or, if not exactly of his own life, then for the prolongation of his dynasty upon the throne (Hengstenberg); others suggest that a distant exile, perhaps in Assyria, prays for the life of the reigning King of Judah, Josiah probably ('Four Friends,' p. 117); but the Messianic interpretation is perhaps the best. The writer, lifted up above himself and above sublunary things, abiding, as he does, in the spiritual tabernacle under the shelter of God's wings (ver. 4), prays for long continuance of days for the true King, the ideal King, Messiah, of whom David and his house are types: "Mayest thou add days to the days of the King," and make his years as many generations; or, as <span class="accented">generation and generation; i.e.</span> eternally continuous. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/60.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The third strophe reverts to prayer; but the prayer now breathes more freely with a self-conscious courage for the strife.

The king of Israel is hard pressed in the battle, but he knows that victory comes from above, from the God who has hitherto in anger refused it to His people, inasmuch as He has given power to Edom to break through the defensive forces of Israel (vid., <a href="/psalms/44-10.htm">Psalm 44:10</a>). &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514; (not &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;  equals  &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;) is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/108-13.htm">Psalm 108:13</a>, equivalent to &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492;.
