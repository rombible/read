Some think that they are there only as a quotation from this psalm, but the mode in which the words are here introduced points the other way. The psalmist does not at his distance from the events distinguish between David and Solomon. He merges the executor of the work in the projector; and in honour of the second Temple it is as natural for him to take up words used at the actual dedication of the first as it was to refer to the original purpose in David’s mind. All is blended together in the long perspective of poetry. As to the form of the words, they are of course themselves a reminiscence of the ancient battle-cry of the nation when the Ark set forward on the march. (See <a href="/psalms/68-1.htm" title="Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.">Psalm 68:1</a>, Note.) The mention of the <span class= "ital">Ark </span>does not definitely dispose of the Maccabæan theory of this psalm, though it doubtless must weigh against it. The quotation may have been adopted generally without meaning literal correspondence between all the circumstances—just as the battle-cry had become merely a <span class= "ital">religious </span>formula—or, as Lightfoot and Prideaux suggest (see Prideaux, <span class= "ital">Connection, </span>i. 141), there may have been an ark made for the second Temple in imitation of the original.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">Ark of thy strength.</span>—See the reference in Chronicles.

When work is to be done for the Lord, it is good to tie ourselves to a time. It is good in the morning to fix upon work for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for his Son's sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/132.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Arise, O Lord, into thy rest - Into that which is appointed for its permanent place of repose, that it may no longer be removed from spot to spot. This is spoken of the ark, considered as the place where God, by an appropriate symbol, abode. That symbol - the Shechinah - rested on the cover of the ark. The same language was used by Solomon at the dedication of the temple: "Now, therefore, arise, O Lord God, into thy resting place, thou and the ark of thy strength," <a href="/2_chronicles/6-41.htm">2 Chronicles 6:41</a>.<p>Thou, and the ark of thy strength - The ark, the symbol of the divine power, as if the power of God resided there, or as if the Almighty had his abode there. Perhaps the language was derived from the fact that the ark, in the wars of the Hebrews against their foes, was a symbol of the divine presence and protection - that by which the divine power was put forth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/132.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8, 9. The solemn entry of the ark, symbolical of God's presence and power, with the attending priests, into the sanctuary, is proclaimed in the words used by Solomon (2Ch 6:41).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/132.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>8 Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.<p>9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.<p>10 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.<p><a href="/psalms/132-8.htm">Psalm 132:8</a><p>In these three verses we see the finders of the ark removing it to its appointed place, using a formula somewhat like to that used by Moses when he said, "Rise up, Lord," and again, "Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel." The ark had been long upon the move, and no fit place had been found for it in Canaan, but now devout men have prepared a temple, and they sing, "Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength." They hoped that now the covenant symbol had found a permanent abode - a rest, and they trusted that Jehovah would now abide with it for ever. Vain would it be for the ark to be settled if the Lord did not continue with it, and perpetually shine forth from between the cherubim. Unless the Lord shall rest with us there is no rest for us; unless the ark of his strength abide with us we are ourselves without strength. The ark of the covenant is here mentioned by a name which it well deserved; for in its captivity it smote its captors, and broke their gods, and when it was brought back it guarded its own honour by the death of those who dared to treat it with disrespect. The power of God was thus connected with the sacred chest. Reverently, therefore did Solomon pray concerning it as he besought the living God to consecrate the temple by his presence. It is the Lord and the covenant, or rather say the covenant Jehovah whose presence we desire in our assemblies, and this presence is the strength of his people. Oh that the Lord would indeed abide in all the churches, and cause his power to be revealed in Zion.<p><a href="/psalms/132-9.htm">Psalm 132:9</a><p>"Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness." No garment is so resplendent as that of a holy character. In this glorious robe our great High-priest is evermore arrayed, and he would have all his people adorned in the same manner. Then only are priests fit to appear before the Lord, and to minister for the profit of the people, when their lives are dignified with goodness. They must ever remember that they are God's priests, and should therefore wear the livery of their Lord, which is holiness: they are not only to have righteousness, but to be clothed with it, so that upon every part of them righteousness shall be conspicuous. Whoever looks upon God's servants should see holiness if they see nothing else. Now, this righteousness of the ministers of the temple is prayed for in connection with the presence of the Lord; and this instructs us that holiness is only to be found among those who commune with God, and only comes to them through his visitation of their spirits. God will dwell among a holy people: and on the other hand, where God is the people become holy.<p>"And let thy saints shout for joy." Holiness and happiness go together; where the one is found, the other ought never to be far away. Holy persons have a right to great and demonstrative joy they may shout because of it. Since they are saints, and thy saints, and thou hast come to dwell with them, O Lord, thou hast made it their duty to rejoice, and to let others know of their joy. The sentence, while it may read as a permit, is also a precept saints are commanded to rejoice in the Lord. Happy religion which makes it a duty to be glad! Where righteousness is the clothing, joy may well be the occupation.<p><a href="/psalms/132-10.htm">Psalm 132:10</a><p>"For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed." King Solomon was praying, and here the people pray for him that his face may not be turned away, or that he may not be refused an audience. It is a dreadful thing to have our face turned away from God, or to have his face turned away from us. If we are anointed of the Spirit the Lord will look upon us with favour. Specially is this true of Him who represents us, and is on our behalf the Christ - the truly anointed of the Lord. Jesus is both our David and God's anointed; in him is found in fulness that which David received in measure. For his sake all those who are anointed in him are accepted. God blessed Solomon and succeeding kings, for David's sake; and he will bless us for Jesus' sake. How condescending was the Son of the Highest to take upon himself the form of a servant, to be anointed for us, and to go in before the mercy-seat to plead on our behalf! The Psalm sings of the ark, and it may well remind us of the going in of the anointed priest within the veil all depended upon his acceptance, and therefore well do the people pray, "Turn not away the face of thine anointed."<p>Thus, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-8.htm">Psalm 132:8-10</a>, we have a prayer for the temple, the ark, the priests, the Levites, the people, and the king: in each petition there is a fulness of meaning well worthy of careful thought. We cannot plead too much in detail; the fault of most prayers is their indefiniteness. In God's house and worship everything needs a blessing, and every person connected therewith needs it continually. As David vowed and prayed when he was minded to house the ark, so now the prayer is continued when the temple is consecrated, and the Lord deigns to fill it with his glory. We shall never have done praying till we have done needing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Arise, </span> i.e. arise and come.

It is the post-Davidic church which here reminds Jahve of the hereinafter mentioned promises (of the "mercies of David," <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-42.htm">2 Chronicles 6:42</a>, cf. <a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>) with which He has responded to David's &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. By this verbal substantive of the Pual is meant all the care and trouble which David had in order to procure a worthy abode for the sanctuary of Jahve. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489; signifies to trouble or harass one's self about anything, afflictari (as frequently in the Book of Ecclesiastes); the Pual here denotes the self-imposed trouble, or even that imposed by outward circumsntaces, such as the tedious wars, of long, unsuccessful, and yet never relaxed endeavours (<a href="/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>). For he had vowed unto God that he would give himself absolutely no rest until he had obtained a fixed abode for Jahve. What he said to Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>) is an indication of this vowed resolve, which was now in a time of triumphant peace, as it seemed, ready for being carried out, after the first step towards it had already been taken in the removal of the Ark of the covenant to Zion (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a>); for <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a> is appended to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a> out of its chronological order and only on account of the internal connection. After the bringing home of the Ark, which had been long yearned for (<a href="/psalms/101-2.htm">Psalm 101:2</a>), and did not take place without difficulties and terrors, was accomplished, a series of years again passed over, during which David always carried about with him the thought of erecting God a Temple-building. And when he had received the tidings through Nathan that he should not build God a house, but that it should be done by his son and successor, he nevertheless did as much towards the carrying out of the desire of his heart as was possible in connection with this declaration of the will of Jahve. He consecrated the site of the future Temple, he procured the necessary means and materials for the building of it, he made all the necessary arrangements for the future Temple-service, he inspirited the people for the gigantic work of building that was before them, and handed over to his son the model for it, as it is all related to us in detail by the chronicler. The divine name "the mighty One of Jacob" is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>, as in <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>. The Philistines with their Dagon had been made to feel this mighty Rock of Jacob when they took the sacred Ark along with them (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-12</a>). With &#1488;&#1501; David solemnly declares what he is resolved not to do. The meaning of the hyperbolically expressed vow in the form of an oath is that for so long he will not rejoice at his own dwelling-house, nor give himself up to sleep that is free from anxiety; in fine, for so long he will not rest. The genitives after &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; and &#1506;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; are appositional genitives; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44.htm">Psalm 44</a> delights in similar combinations of synonyms. &#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; (Latin strata mea) is a poetical plural, as also is &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. With &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (which is always said of the eyelids, <a href="/genesis/31-40.htm">Genesis 31:40</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-4.htm">Proverbs 6:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>, not of the eyes) alternates &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514; (according to another reading &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;) for &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;. The a&#772;th is the same as in &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>, cf. 60:13, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>, and frequently. This Aramaizing rejection of the syllable before the tone is, however, without example elsewhere. The lxx adds to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a>, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; &#1500;&#1512;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;), but this is a disagreeable overloading of the verse. </body></html>
