How vast is the love of God to man, that he should speak thus concerning his church! It is his desire to dwell with us; yet how little do we desire to dwell with him! He abode in Zion till the sins of Israel caused him to give them up to the spoilers. Forsake us not, O God, and deliver us not in like manner, sinful though we are. God's people have a special blessing on common enjoyments, and that blessing puts peculiar sweetness into them. Zion's poor have reason to be content with a little of this world, because they have better things prepared for them. God will abundantly bless the nourishment of the new man, and satisfy the poor in spirit with the bread of life. He gives more than we ask, and when he gives salvation, he will give abundant joy. God would bring to nothing every design formed to destroy the house of David, until King Messiah should arise out of it, to sit upon the throne of his Father. In him all the promises centre.

See the notes at <a href="/luke/1-69.htm">Luke 1:69</a>. The word rendered "to bud" means to grow, or to shoot forth as a plant, or as grass grows; and then it may be applied to anything which shoots forth or grows. The allusion here would seem to be to a horn as it shoots forth on the head of an animal. So David would be endowed with growing strength; would have the means of defending himself against his enemies, and of securing victory. The language had no original reference to the Messiah, but it is not improperly applied to him (as springing from David) in <a href="/luke/1-69.htm">Luke 1:69</a>.

The first member of the verse closes with &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;, which has the distinctive Pazer, which is preceded by Legarmeh as a sub-distinctive; then follows at the head of the second member &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; with Zinnor, then &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; with Olewejored and its conjunctive Galgal, which regularly precedes after the sub-distinctive Zinnor. The suffix of &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; refers to that which was affirmed by oath, as in <a href="/jeremiah/4-28.htm">Jeremiah 4:28</a>. Lineal descendants of David will Jahve place on the throne (&#1500;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488; like &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>) to him, i.e., so that they shall follow his as possessors of the throne. David's children shall for ever (which has been finally fulfilled in Christ) sit &#1500;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488; to him (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-5.htm">Jeremiah 9:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-7.htm">Jeremiah 36:7</a>).

It is not plural with a singular suffix (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-59.htm">Deuteronomy 28:59</a>, Ges. 91, 3), but, as &#1494;&#1493;  equals  &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; indicates, the singular for &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; in <a href="/2_kings/6-8.htm">2 Kings 6:8</a>; and signifies the revelation of God as an attestation of His will. &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1501; has Mercha mahpach., &#1494;&#1493; Rebia parvum, and &#1506;&#1491;&#1514;&#1497; Mercha; and according to the interpunction it would have to be rendered: "and My self-attestation there" (vid., on <a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>), but zow is relative: My self-attestation (revelation), which I teach them. The divine words extend to the end of <a href="/psalms/132-12.htm">Psalm 132:12</a>. The hypotheses with &#1488;&#1501;, as the fulfilment in history shows, were conditions of the continuity of the Davidic succession; not, however - because human unfaithfulness does not annul the faithfulness of God - of the endlessness of the Davidic throne. In <a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13</a> the poet states the ground of such promissory mercy. It is based on the universal mercy of the election of Jerusalem. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; has He mappic. like &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-29.htm">Deuteronomy 22:29</a>, or the stroke of Raphe (Ew. 247, d), although the suffix is not absolutely necessary.
