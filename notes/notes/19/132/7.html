When work is to be done for the Lord, it is good to tie ourselves to a time. It is good in the morning to fix upon work for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for his Son's sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/132.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We will go into his tabernacles - His tents, or the fixed resting place prepared for the ark.

It is the post-Davidic church which here reminds Jahve of the hereinafter mentioned promises (of the "mercies of David," <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-42.htm">2 Chronicles 6:42</a>, cf. <a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>) with which He has responded to David's &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. By this verbal substantive of the Pual is meant all the care and trouble which David had in order to procure a worthy abode for the sanctuary of Jahve. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489; signifies to trouble or harass one's self about anything, afflictari (as frequently in the Book of Ecclesiastes); the Pual here denotes the self-imposed trouble, or even that imposed by outward circumsntaces, such as the tedious wars, of long, unsuccessful, and yet never relaxed endeavours (<a href="/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>). For he had vowed unto God that he would give himself absolutely no rest until he had obtained a fixed abode for Jahve. What he said to Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>) is an indication of this vowed resolve, which was now in a time of triumphant peace, as it seemed, ready for being carried out, after the first step towards it had already been taken in the removal of the Ark of the covenant to Zion (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a>); for <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a> is appended to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a> out of its chronological order and only on account of the internal connection. After the bringing home of the Ark, which had been long yearned for (<a href="/psalms/101-2.htm">Psalm 101:2</a>), and did not take place without difficulties and terrors, was accomplished, a series of years again passed over, during which David always carried about with him the thought of erecting God a Temple-building. And when he had received the tidings through Nathan that he should not build God a house, but that it should be done by his son and successor, he nevertheless did as much towards the carrying out of the desire of his heart as was possible in connection with this declaration of the will of Jahve. He consecrated the site of the future Temple, he procured the necessary means and materials for the building of it, he made all the necessary arrangements for the future Temple-service, he inspirited the people for the gigantic work of building that was before them, and handed over to his son the model for it, as it is all related to us in detail by the chronicler. The divine name "the mighty One of Jacob" is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>, as in <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>. The Philistines with their Dagon had been made to feel this mighty Rock of Jacob when they took the sacred Ark along with them (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-12</a>). With &#1488;&#1501; David solemnly declares what he is resolved not to do. The meaning of the hyperbolically expressed vow in the form of an oath is that for so long he will not rejoice at his own dwelling-house, nor give himself up to sleep that is free from anxiety; in fine, for so long he will not rest. The genitives after &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; and &#1506;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; are appositional genitives; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44.htm">Psalm 44</a> delights in similar combinations of synonyms. &#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; (Latin strata mea) is a poetical plural, as also is &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. With &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (which is always said of the eyelids, <a href="/genesis/31-40.htm">Genesis 31:40</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-4.htm">Proverbs 6:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>, not of the eyes) alternates &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514; (according to another reading &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;) for &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;. The a&#772;th is the same as in &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>, cf. 60:13, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>, and frequently.
