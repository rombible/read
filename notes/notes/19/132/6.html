The vow in which David declared his purpose has just been quoted, and that which is now said to have been heard and found can hardly be anything else than this purpose. In fact, the <span class= "ital">feminine </span>suffix to the verbs points directly back to the word rendered <span class= "ital">afflictions </span>in <a href="/psalms/132-1.htm" title="Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:">Psalm 132:1</a>, which is really a feminine form. This being settled, we need not go from the plain direction of such places as <a href="/genesis/35-19.htm" title="And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.">Genesis 35:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/48-7.htm" title="And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.">Genesis 48:7</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-11.htm" title="And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses.

David’s purpose would naturally be connected—especially after a long lapse of time—with the birthplace of his family. But though taking this poetical licence, the psalm keeps sufficiently close to history as to recognise in the discovery of the Ark at Kirjath-jearim an important, nay, a decisive step in the project of building the Temple. Though his purpose may not have been even dimly defined to David when he moved the Ark, history justly sees in that momentous change the initial step in the grander undertaking. That <span class= "ital">“</span>the fields of the wood” (Heb., <span class= "ital">sedey-yā‘ar</span>) is one designation of Kirjath-jearim (city of Yaarim, which went by so many names: <a href="/jeremiah/26-20.htm" title="And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.">Jeremiah 26:20</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-25.htm" title="The children of Kirjatharim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty and three.">Ezra 2:25</a>; <a href="/context/joshua/15-10.htm" title="And the border compassed from Baalah westward to mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:">Joshua 15:10-11</a>) there can be little doubt. We must not, of course, think here of David’s contemporaries, but of those of the psalmist, who poetically are represented as taking important part in the early plans for building the Temple—just as we might say, speaking of our old cathedrals, “we built fine churches in those days.” The poet makes them say, identifying themselves with the people of those distant times, while naturally the historical correctness suffers, “We heard his project at Bethlehem; we found out <span class= "ital">its </span>meaning (saw it take shape) at Kirjath-jearim.” For <span class= "ital">mātsâ, </span>in the sense of “finding out the meaning or discerning,” see <a href="/judges/14-12.htm" title="And Samson said to them, I will now put forth a riddle to you: if you can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:">Judges 14:12</a>, “of a riddle.” This sentence reminds one of a riddle by its form.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/psalms/132.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/132-6.htm" title="See, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.">Psalm 132:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Lo, we have heard of it — </span>The ark, or of the place or habitation for the Lord last mentioned; <span class="ital">at Ephratah — </span>That is, at Shiloh, in the tribe of Ephraim, there they were told it had been, but it was gone; they <span class="ital">found it </span>at last <span class="ital">in the fields of the wood — </span>That is, in Kirjath-jearim, which signifies, <span class="ital">the city of woods. </span>Thence all Israel fetched it, with great solemnity, in the beginning of David’s reign, <a href="/1_chronicles/13-6.htm" title="And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up there the ark of God the LORD, that dwells between the cherubim, whose name is called on it.">1 Chronicles 13:6</a>; so that, in preparing this place for the ark, he gratified all Israel, they needed not to go about to seek it any more: they now knew where to find it. Some learned men, however, being of opinion that Jerusalem, which was at no great distance from Bethlehem, was within the district called Ephratah, give a different interpretation of this verse, and consider the psalmist as speaking of having found the place on which the temple was to be fixed. Thus Bishop Patrick: “And now, behold the Lord himself, to our great joy, hath told us the very place where he will fix his habitation, in the territory of Bethlehem, Ephratah: (<a href="/genesis/35-16.htm" title="And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.">Genesis 35:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-19.htm" title="And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.">Genesis 35:19</a>,) in the fields of that forest where the angel stood and directed David to build an altar unto the Lord, <a href="/1_chronicles/21-18.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar to the LORD in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.">1 Chronicles 21:18</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/22-1.htm" title="Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.">1 Chronicles 22:1</a>.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>132:1-10 David bound himself to find a place for the Lord, for the ark, the token of God's presence. When work is to be done for the Lord, it is good to tie ourselves to a time. It is good in the morning to fix upon work for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for his Son's sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/132.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah - Most probably this is the language of the contemporaries of David; or this is what they might be supposed to say; or this is what tradition reports that they did say. David's purpose, as referred to in the previous verses, is not recorded in the history, and the memory of the whole transaction may have been handed down by tradition. Or, this may be merely poetic language, expressing the feelings of those who, when sent out by David, or accompanying him, found the ark. Much difficulty has been felt in regard to this verse. There is no mention in the history of the fact that the ark was "heard of" at Ephrata, or that it was ever there. The name Ephrata - &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492;  'ephra&#770;tha&#770;h - is applied<p>(1) to a region of country to which was subsequently given the name Bethlehem, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/35-16.htm">Genesis 35:16-19</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11</a>.<p>(2) Properly to Bethlehem, a city of Judah, the full name of which was Bethlehem-Ephratah, <a href="/genesis/48-7.htm">Genesis 48:7</a>; <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>.<p>(3) It is a proper name, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-19.htm">1 Chronicles 2:19</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>.<p>(4) It may perhaps be the same as Ephraim.<p>Compare <a href="/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>. Some have supposed the meaning to be, that they found it within the limits of the tribe of Ephraim, and that the word Ephratah is used here with reference to that; but this is a forced construction. It may have been indeed true that the ark was found within the limits of that tribe, but the word Ephratah would not naturally denote this; and, besides, the tribe of Ephraim was so large, and covered such an extent of territory, that this would convey no distinct information; and it cannot be supposed that the writer meant to say merely that they found it within the limits of a tribe. Nor can it mean that they actually found the ark at Ephrata, or Bethlehem, for this would not be true. A simple and natural interpretation of the passage has been suggested, which seems to make it plain: that, in their search for the ark, it was at Ephratah or Bethlehem that they first heard of it, but that they actually found it in the fields of the wood. It may seem strange that there should have been so much uncertainty about the ark as is here implied; that David did not know where it was; and that none of the priests knew. But, while it must be admitted that it seems to be strange, and that the fact is not of easy explanation, it is to he remembered that the ark was at one time in the possession of the Philistines; that when it was retaken it seems to have had no very permanent resting place; that it may have been removed from one spot to another as circumstances required; that it may have been committed now to one, and now to another, for safe keeping; and thus it might have occurred, in the unsettled and agitated state of affairs, that its exact situation might be unknown, and that a somewhat diligent search was necessary in order to find it We know too little of the times to enable us to pronounce upon the subject with much confidence.<p>We found it in the fields of the wood - Continuing our search, we found it there. Perhaps Kirjath-jearim, <a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5</a>. It was to Kirjath-jearim that the ark was carried after it had been taken by the Philistines <a href="/1_samuel/6-21.htm">1 Samuel 6:21</a>. The literal meaning of the passage here is, "The fields of the wood" - or of Jear, where the word in Hebrew is the same as in Kirjath-jearim. The name Kirjath-jearim means Forest Town, or, city of the woods; and the allusion here is the same as in <a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1</a>. The interpretation, then, seems to be that they heard of the ark, or learned where it was, when they were at Ephrata or Bethlehem; but that they actually found it in the vicinity of Kirjath-jearim. The ignorance in the case may have been merely in regard to the exact place or house where it was at that time kept. Bethlehem was the home or city of David, and the idea is, that, when there, and when it was contemplated to remove the ark to Mount Zion, information or intelligence was brought there of its exact locality, and they went forth to bring it to its new abode or its permanent resting place. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/132.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. These may be the "words of David" and his pious friends, who,<p>at Ephratah&#8212;or Beth-lehem (Ge 48:7), where he once lived, may have heard of the ark, which he found for the first time<p>in the fields of the wood&#8212;or, Jair, or Kirjath-jearim ("City of woods") (1Sa 7:1; 2Sa 6:3, 4), whence it was brought to Zion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">We heard of it; </span> of the place or habitation for the Lord last mentioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">At Ephratah; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

So the sense is either this, We heard a rumour at Bethlehem among David’s relations, that the ark should be removed to a new place, and that David had pitched upon it; or this, We heard that Bethlehem would be the place for it, because it was the city of David. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

Either of the ark which David and others had heard of, that it formerly was at Shiloh, <a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>; here called Ephratah, as some think; so the Ephraimites are called Ephrathites, <a href="/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5</a>; and Elkanah of Ramathaimzophim, of Mount Ephraim, is said to be an Ephrathite, <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>; but this tribe the Lord chose not, but the tribe of Judah, for his habitation; and rejected the tabernacle of Shiloh, and removed it from thence, <a href="/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60</a>; <p>we found it in the fields of the wood; at Kirjathjearim, which signifies the city of woods; being built among woods, and surrounded with them: here the ark was twenty years, and here David found it; and from hence he brought it to the house of Obededom, and from thence to Zion, <a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1</a>. Or else the place where the temple was to be built; which was not known till the times of David, who was of Ephratah or Bethlehem: here he was born and brought up; and here he was, as Arama supposes, when it was revealed to him where the temple should be built. According to R. Moses, the sense is, We have heard of it by the hand of David, who was of Ephratah: but Aben Ezra thinks the meaning is, that in former times men used to say, We have heard from the mouths of the prophets that the chosen place was near to Bethlehem Ephratah; only the precise place was not known, whether to the east or west, or north or south, of Bethlehem. Some think that not any particular city is intended, but a country, even all the neighbourhood of Bethlehem Ephratah; and took in Jerusalem, where the temple was built, it being but a few miles from the place; so Adrichomius (u) says, the country round about Ephratah had its name from thence; see <a href="/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>. Now the place found for the building of the temple was "the fields of the wood", or the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite, and was on Mount Moriah; David found by the order he had to build an altar here, and by the acceptance of his sacrifices, that this was the place for the house of God, <a href="/1_chronicles/22-1.htm">1 Chronicles 22:1</a>; and here Solomon built the temple, <a href="/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>; and which was formerly a woody place, as mountains generally are; and this seems to have been when Abraham offered his son on it, who then spied a ram caught in the thickets, <a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>. The Targum is, <p>"we found it in the field of the forest of Lebanon, the place where the ancient fathers prayed;'' <p>the temple being built of the wood of Lebanon. But all this is to be understood of the Lord, the mighty God of Jacob, who was heard of at Ephratah; the Shechinah, of divine Majesty; so Kimchi, Arama, and Ben Melech. And indeed the Messiah is meant, the antitype of the ark and temple; of whom the saints or believers in him, a chorus of which is here introduced, had heard that he should be born at Ephratah, which is Bethlehem; see <a href="/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>. And if this psalm was written by the captives in Babylon, they might have heard of this from the prophecy of Micah, <a href="/psalms/5-2.htm">Psalm 5:2</a>; the shepherds heard from the mouths of the angels that Christ was born there; and we Christians have heard the same, and know and believe it, <a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>.

The abruptness of the transition is at first sight perplexing; but instead of giving a prosaic account of the transportation of the Ark to Zion, the Psalmist introduces the people of David’s time as speakers, proclaiming the eagerness and joy with which they welcomed David’s proposal, and their resolve to worship Jehovah in His new sanctuary. The removal of the Ark was a national movement. See <a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm" title="And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwells between the cherubim.">2 Samuel 6:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-15.htm" title="So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.">2 Samuel 6:15</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-1.htm" title="And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.">1 Chronicles 13:1</a> ff; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-28.htm" title="Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.">1 Chronicles 15:28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">It</span> may best be explained to mean <span class="ital">the Ark</span>, as the great object which the poet has in mind, though it is not actually mentioned till <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/132-8.htm" title="Arise, O LORD, into your rest; you, and the ark of your strength.">Psalm 132:8</a></span>.

But the Ark never had any connexion with Bethlehem. To refer <span class="ital">we</span> to David, and to explain, ‘I heard of it while I was still in my home in Bethlehem,’ is forced, and leaves the transition from the sing. in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/psalms/132-3.htm" title="Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;...">Psalm 132:3-5</a></span> to the plural unexplained. (2) It has been thought that <span class="ital">Ephrathah</span> may mean <span class="ital">Ephraim</span>, as <span class="ital">Ephrathite</span> means <span class="ital">Ephraimite</span> (<a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm" title="Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:">1 Samuel 1:1</a>), and that the reference is to the sojourn of the Ark at Shiloh. ‘We heard that the Ark was in Shiloh in the days of old, but when we sought it, it was no longer there, but in an obscure refuge in the fields of the forest.’ (3) Delitzsch ingeniously argues that <span class="ital">Ephrathah</span> was a name for the district in which Kiriath-jearim was situated. The firstborn son of Caleb’s wife Ephrath was Hur (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-19.htm" title="And when Azubah was dead, Caleb took to him Ephrath, which bore him Hur.">1 Chronicles 2:19</a>), who is called ‘the father’ of Bethlehem (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-4.htm" title="And Penuel the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah. These are the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah, the father of Bethlehem.">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>). Hur’s son Shobal was ‘the father’ of Kiriath-jearim, and his son Salma the ‘father’ of Bethlehem (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/2-50.htm" title="These were the sons of Caleb the son of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah; Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim....">1 Chronicles 2:50-51</a>). May not the district of Kiriath-jearim have been called Ephrathah, as well as that of Bethlehem? This is perhaps the best explanation; for there can be little doubt that <span class="ital">the fields of the forest</span> (<span class="ital">jaar</span>) mean the neighbourhood of Kiriath-jearim, ‘the city of forests,’ where the Ark had rested for many years in the house of Abinadab (<a href="/context/1_samuel/7-1.htm" title="And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD....">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>), and still was, when David resolved to remove it to Zion (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/13-5.htm" title="So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even to the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim....">1 Chronicles 13:5-6</a>). It should be noticed that the narrative in <a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm" title="And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.">1 Samuel 7:1</a> ff. implies that the Ark was not actually in the town, but in its neighbourhood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The suggestion that <span class="ital">Ephrathah</span> means <span class="ital">the fertile plains</span>, and <span class="ital">the fields of the forest</span> the uncultivated jungle, and that the meaning is, ‘the news of David’s plan spread through field and forest,’ i.e. all over the country, is far-fetched and improbable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">6–10</span>.

"Jaar" is a contracted and poetic name for Kirjath-jearim, where the ark remained from its return out of the country of the Philistines till David transferred it to Jerusalem (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5-13</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/131.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This little song is inscribed &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491; because it is like an echo of the answer (<a href="/2_samuel/6-21.htm">2 Samuel 6:21</a>.) with which David repelled the mocking observation of Michal when he danced before the Ark in a linen ephod, and therefore not in kingly attire, but in the common raiment of the priests: I esteem myself still less than I now show it, and I appear base in mine own eyes. In general David is the model of the state of mind which the poet expresses here. He did not push himself forward, but suffered himself to be drawn forth out of seclusion. He did not take possession of the throne violently, but after Samuel has anointed him he willingly and patiently traverses the long, thorny, circuitous way of deep abasement, until he receives from God's hand that which God's promise had assured to him. The persecution by Saul lasted about ten years, and his kingship in Hebron, at first only incipient, seven years and a half. He left it entirely to God to remove Saul and Ishbosheth. He let Shimei curse. He left Jerusalem before Absalom. Submission to God's guidance, resignation to His dispensations, contentment with that which was allotted to him, are the distinguishing traits of his noble character, which the poet of this Psalm indirectly holds up to himself and to his contemporaries as a mirror, viz., to the Israel of the period after the Exile, which, in connection with small beginnings under difficult circumstances, had been taught humbly contented and calm waiting.<p>With &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1490;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; the poet repudiates pride as being the state of his soul; with &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (lo-ramu&#772;' as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-13.htm">Proverbs 30:13</a>, and before Ajin, e.g., also in <a href="/genesis/26-10.htm">Genesis 26:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, in accordance with which the erroneous placing of the accent in Baer's text is to be corrected), pride of countenance and bearing; and with &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, pride of endeavour and mode of action. Pride has its seat in the heart, in the eyes especially it finds its expression, and great things are its sphere in which it diligently exercises itself. The opposite of "great things" (<a href="/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/45-5.htm">Jeremiah 45:5</a>) is not that which is little, mean, but that which is small; and the opposite of "things too wonderful for me" (<a href="/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>) is not that which is trivial, but that which is attainable.<p>&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; does not open a conditional protasis, for where is the indication of the apodosis to be found?

The Poel &#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; is to be understood according to &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>, and &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; in <a href="/lamentations/3-26.htm">Lamentations 3:26</a>. He has levelled or made smooth his soul, so that humility is its entire and uniform state; he has calmed it so that it is silent and at rest, and lets God speak and work in it and for it: it is like an even surface, and like the calm surface of a lake. Ewald and Hupfeld's rendering: "as a weaned child on its mother, so my soul, being weaned, lies on me," is refuted by the consideration that it ought at least to be &#1499;&#1468;&#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, but more correctly &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;; but it is also besides opposed by the article which is swallowed up in &#1499;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;, according to which it is to be rendered: like one weaned beside its mother (here &#1499;&#1468;&#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500; on account of the determinative collateral definition), like the weaned one (here &#1499;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500; because without any collateral definition: cf. with Hitzig, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>, and the like; moreover, also, because referring back to the first &#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;, cf. <a href="/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>), is my soul beside me (Hitzig, Hengstenberg, and most expositors). As a weaned child - viz. not one that is only just begun to be weaned, but an actually weaned child (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;, cognate &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; eta, to bring to an end, more particularly to bring suckling to an end, to wean) - lies upon its mother without crying impatiently and craving for its mother's breast, but contented with the fact that it has its mother - like such a weaned child is his soul upon him, i.e., in relation to his Ego (which is conceived of in &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; as having the soul upon itself, cf. <a href="/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-18.htm">Jeremiah 8:18</a>; Psychology, S. 151f., tr. p. 180): his soul, which is by nature restless and craving, is stilled; it does not long after earthly enjoyment and earthly good that God should give these to it, but it is satisfied in the fellowship of God, it finds full satisfaction in Him, it is satisfied (satiated) in Him.<p>By the closing strain, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/131-3.htm">Psalm 131:3</a>, the individual language of the Psalm comes to have a reference to the congregation at large. Israel is to renounce all self-boasting and all self-activity, and to wait in lowliness and quietness upon its God from now and for evermore. For He resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. </body></html>
