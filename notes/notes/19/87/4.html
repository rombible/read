So-and-so was born there.<p>The last clause is literally <span class= "ital">this was born there, </span>and on its reference the whole meaning of the verse and the whole intention of the psalm turn. Now immediately after the mention of a place, <span class= "ital">there </span>must surely refer to that place, and not to a place mentioned in the previous verse and there too addressed as in the second person. The demonstrative <span class= "ital">this, </span>is evidently used in a general way. (Comp. the fuller form, <a href="/judges/18-4.htm" title="And he said to them, Thus and thus deals Micah with me, and has hired me, and I am his priest.">Judges 18:4</a>, &c.) The poet begins his special addition to the praises of Zion, by enumerating various renowned nations much in the same way as Horace’s<p>“Laudabunt alii claram Rhodon, aut Mitylenen.”<p>only instead of leaving them as a theme to others he tells us what he himself in ordinary conversation might say of these places, and of the estimation in which their natives were held. It is hardly possible to escape from the conclusion that the Palestinian Jew is here implying his superiority to those of his race who were born abroad, a spirit shown so strongly in the relations of the Hebrews to the Hellenistic Jews in the New Testament.<p><span class= "bld">Rahab </span>undoubtedly stands for <span class= "ital">Egypt, </span>but the exact origin of the term and of its connection with Egypt is much disputed. Most probably it is a term (possibly Coptic) for some large sea or river monster symbolic of Egypt. (Comp. the word “dragons,” <a href="/psalms/74-13.htm" title="You did divide the sea by your strength: you brake the heads of the dragons in the waters.">Psalm 74:13</a>, and see <a href="/job/9-13.htm" title="If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.">Job 9:13</a>; <a href="/job/26-12.htm" title="He divides the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smites through the proud.">Job 26:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Ethiopia—</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">Khûsh </span>(in Authorised Version <span class= "ital">Cush</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>(See <a href="/genesis/10-6.htm" title="And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.">Genesis 10:6</a> : <a href="/2_kings/19-9.htm" title="And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against you: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,">2Kings 19:9</a>.)<p>There is no need with our explanation to look for emblematic reasons for the choice of names in this verse—as Egypt for antiquity; Babylon, strength; Tyre, wealth, &c. There is no one of the districts where Jews of the Dispersion might not have been found, but no doubt in his enumeration the poet takes care to mention countries near and far, as Philistia and Ethiopia. There appears, however, to have been a district in Babylonia known to the Hebrews as <span class= "ital">Khûsh </span>(Lenormant, <span class= "ital">Origines de l’Histoire; </span>and see a paper on the site of Eden, in the <span class= "ital">Nineteenth Century </span>for October, 1882).

See <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>. It is also applied to Egypt in <a href="/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>. The reason why the name was given to Egypt is not certainly known. The Hebrew word properly means fierceness, insolence, pride; and it may have been given to Egypt by the Hebrews on account of its haughtiness, pride, and insolence. It has been supposed by some (Jablonski, Opusc. i. 228) that the name is of Egyptian origin, but this has not been clearly made out. (Gesenius, Lexicon) Egypt, Babylon, Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia, are mentioned here as among the best known nations and cities of the world; as places where it would commonly be regarded as an honor to have been born. The meaning is, "I will refer to these as places well-known and distinguished; I will refer to the honor of having been born there; but great as is such an honor, the honor of having been born in Zion is far above that; it conveys the idea of a much higher distinction; it should be more sacredly cherished as among those things on which men value themselves." The word "I" here seems to have reference to the psalmist, and not to God. The psalmist is mentioning what to him would seem to have a claim to the highest honor.<p>Philistia - The western portion of Palestine, from which the whole country was afterward named. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>; compare <a href="/psalms/108-9.htm">Psalm 108:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>, <a href="/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>. "And Tyre." See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-12.htm">Psalm 45:12</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>, note.<p>With Ethiopia - Hebrew, Cush. The reference here is probably to the southern portion of Arabia. See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1</a>, note.<p>This man was born there - That is, It would be said of individuals that they were born in one of those places, and it would be regarded as an honor thus to have been born. People would pride themselves on the fact that they were born there, and the world would hold them in esteem on that account. This refers to a very natural, and a very common feeling among people. We can, of course, claim no credit, and deserve no real honor, on account of the place where we happen to have been born; but the fact that one has been born in a place distinguished for its advantages and its fame, - in a place where liberty, religion, and the arts have flourishcd - in a place renowned for its public spirit, and for producing illustrious people, - may be properly accounted as an occasion for gratitude, and as a stimulus to high and honorable efforts, and may thus be made an important auxiliary to virtue, patriotism, and piety. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/87.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

He will cause the Gentiles to flock into his Church, even those who have been hitherto the most bitter enemies of Israel (ver. 4), and will place these strangers on a par with such as have belonged to his Church from their birth (vers. 4, 5, 6), admitting them to every blessing and every privilege. The Church, thus augmented, shall be taken under his own protection, and "established," or placed on a sure footing, forever.

The poet calls himself "the son of Thy handmaid" as having been born into the relation to Him of servant; it is a relationship that has come to him by birth. How beautifully does the Adonaj come in here for the seventh time! He is even from his mother's womb the servant of the sovereign Lord, from whose omnipotence he can therefore also look for a miraculous interposition on his behalf.
