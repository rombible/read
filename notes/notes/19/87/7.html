Indeed God’s people have the greatest, nay, the only cause of rejoicing, being his children, and heirs, and joint heirs with Christ. As to all others, the divine injunction is, <span class="ital">Be afflicted, and mourn and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into heaviness. </span>But the psalmist seems here to intimate, that when the prediction, contained in the preceding verses, should be fulfilled, and the Gentiles should be converted, and added to the church, there should be great rejoicing and praising of God, both with vocal and instrumental music, for that glorious event. He describes evangelical worship by legal phrases and customs, as the prophets frequently do. <span class="ital">All my springs are in thee — </span>In Zion, or the church. All graces, comforts, privileges, and blessings, are to be found in thee, O church of God, and are only to be expected in and through the word preached, and the ordinances administered there. These words are thought by many commentators to be here added as the burden of the song which the forementioned singers are supposed to sing, either in their own names, or in the name of the people of God. And so the sense is, all our desires and delights are in thee, O Zion. All the springs of mercy, grace, and glory, flow to us only in and through thee. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/87.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>87:4-7 The church of Christ is more glorious and excellent than the nations of the earth. In the records of heaven, the meanest of those who are born again stand registered. When God renders to every man according to his works, he shall observe who enjoyed the privileges of his sanctuary. To them much was given, and of them much will be required. Let those that dwell in Zion, mark this, and live up to their profession. Zion's songs shall be sung with joy and triumph. The springs of the joy of a carnal worldling are in wealth and pleasure; but of a gracious soul, in the word of God and prayer. All grace and consolation are derived from Christ, through his ordinances, to the souls of believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/87.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there - literally, "The singers as the players on instruments." The image is that of a musical procession, where the singers go before, followed by those who play on various instruments of music. The idea seems to be that when the number of the true friends of God shall be made up, or shall all be enrolled, there will be a triumphal procession; or, they are seen by the psalmist, moving before God as in a triumphal procession. Compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>. Perhaps the reference is to heaven - the true Zion; to the assembling of all who shall have been born in Zion, and who shall have become citizens of the true Zion, the Jerusalem above.<p>All my springs are in thee - The word rendered springs means properly a place of fountains (see the notes at <a href="/psalms/84-6.htm">Psalm 84:6</a>), and also a fountain, <a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/8-2.htm">Genesis 8:2</a>. It thus becomes an emblem of happiness; of delight; of pleasure; and the ideal here is that the highest happiness of the psalmist was found in what is here referred to by the word "thee." That word may refer either to God or to Zion; but as the subject of the psalm is Zion, it is most natural to suppose that the reference is to that. Thus it accords with the sentiment so often found in the Psalms, where the writer expresses his love for Zion; his pleasure in its solemnities; his desire to abide there as his permanent home. Compare <a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/84-2.htm">Psalm 84:2-4</a>, <a href="/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a>. The idea has been beautifully expressed by Dr. Dwight, in his version of <a href="/psalms/137-6.htm">Psalm 137:6</a> :<p>"I love thy church, O God;<p>Her walls before thee stand,<p>Dear as the apple of thine eye,<p>And graven on thy hand.<p>"If e'er my heart forget<p>Her welfare or her woe,<p>Let every joy this heart forsake,<p>And every grief o'erflow.<p>"Beyond my highest joy<p>I prize her heavenly ways.<p>Her sweet communion, solemn vows,<p>Her hymns of love and praise." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/87.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. As in a great procession of those thus written up, or registered, seeking Zion (Isa 2:3; Jer 50:5), "the singers" and "players," or pipers, shall precede.<p>all my springs&#8212;So each shall say, "All my sources of spiritual joy are in Thee" (Ps 46:4; 84:6).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/87.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There shall be great rejoicing and praising God, both with vocal and instrumental music, for this glorious and stupendous work of the conversion of the Gentiles.

These words may be here added as the burden or matter of the song, which these singers are supposed to have sung; and that either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. In their own names, and in the name of all the Zionites or people of God. So the sense is, All our desires and delights are in thee, all the springs of mercy, grace, and glory flow to us only in and through thee; for springs or fountains are oft put for all precious or desirable things, as <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/36-9.htm" title="For with you is the fountain of life: in your light shall we see light.">Psalm 36:9</a> <a href="/isaiah/12-3.htm" title="Therefore with joy shall you draw water out of the wells of salvation.">Isaiah 12:3</a> <a href="/hosea/13-15.htm" title="Though he be fruitful among his brothers, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.">Hosea 13:15</a></span>. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. In God’s name, whose words were frequently sung by the singers in the Old Testament. And so the sense is, All the springs or fountains of good things, or of my blessings are in Zion, or in the church, out of which no true blessings are to be expected or found. And this sense seems best to suit with the phrase, <span class="ital">my springs</span>; partly because it seems more proper to call them God’s springs, who is the author and giver of them, than men’s springs, who are only the receivers of them; and partly because this is more agreeable to the phrase and usage of Scripture, which every where ascribes and appropriates them to God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/87.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As well the singers as the players on the instruments shall be there,.... In Zion, in the church; signifying that there should be great spiritual joy there when the above things should be accomplished; great joy in the churches, because of the conversion of Jews and Gentiles; and great joy in the persons themselves, born again, and brought to Zion; in allusion to the vocal and instrumental music used in the temple service; see <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>. <p>all my springs are in thee; which are either the words of the psalmist, or rather of the souls born in Zion; who, in their spiritual songs, will thus express themselves concerning the church, in which are the word and ordinances, compared to fountains of living water, and are springs of spiritual peace and refreshment to converted persons; see <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>, where also the Spirit and his graces are communicated by the ministry of the word and ordinances in the church, which are signified by wells and rivers of living water, <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a> and particularly here stands Christ, the fountain of gardens, and well of living waters, for the supply and comfort of saints, and his blood a fountain opened for cleansing and purification, Sol 4:15, yea, here flows the river of God's love, the streams whereof make glad the city of God; and which, like the waters in Ezekiel's vision, come from under the threshold of the sanctuary, <a href="/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a> or the words may be considered as an address of the psalmist, or of the church, or of regenerate persons, unto Christ: <p>all my springs or fountains are in thee; the fulness of grace dwells in him, the springs of all joy, and peace, and comfort, are with him; the wells of salvation are in him, and both grace and glory are from him; he is the spring of all grace now, and the fountain of all happiness hereafter. Gussetius (z) has a very peculiar version of the whole text, which he renders thus <p>"all my fountains will be singing in thee, or of thee, as those that dance at the sound of the pipe:'' <p>taking the allusion to be to the playing of fountains in gardens, and to the delightful sound the waters make; but the accents will not admit of such a sense. <p>(z) Comment.

Conclusion. The Psalm ends as abruptly as it began, with a verse which is enigmatic in its brevity. It is best explained as an outline picture of the universal rejoicing with which the citizens of Zion greet their mother.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And singing as well as dancing (shall they chant,)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘All my fountains are in thee.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The rendering <span class="ital">dancing</span> is preferable to <span class="ital">playing on the flute</span> (cp. A.V., R.V. marg.). For dancing as an expression of religious rejoicing see <a href="/psalms/30-11.htm" title="You have turned for me my mourning into dancing: you have put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;">Psalm 30:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/149-3.htm" title="Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises to him with the tambourine and harp.">Psalm 149:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/150-4.htm" title="Praise him with the tambourine and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.">Psalm 150:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm" title="And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.">2 Samuel 6:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The second line is their anthem. It may even be a fragment of some well-known hymn. <span class="ital">My fountains</span> is to be understood metaphorically, as ‘fountains of salvation’ in <a href="/isaiah/12-3.htm" title="Therefore with joy shall you draw water out of the wells of salvation.">Isaiah 12:3</a>. Cp. <a href="/psalms/36-9.htm" title="For with you is the fountain of life: in your light shall we see light.">Psalm 36:9</a> f.; <a href="/psalms/84-6.htm" title="Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also fills the pools.">Psalm 84:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/47-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.">Ezekiel 47:1</a>; <a href="/joel/3-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.">Joel 3:18</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-8.htm" title="And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.">Zechariah 14:8</a>. It is possible, but less satisfactory, to take the verse as the Psalmist’s apostrophe to Zion:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Both they that sing and they that dance,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>All my fountains are in thee:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“meaning that every source of pleasure, music, singing, &c. was to be found in Zion” (Bp Perowne). So Milton in his paraphrase:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Both they who sing and they who dance<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With sacred songs are there;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In thee fresh brooks and soft streams glance,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And all my fountains clear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The obscurity of the verse must however be acknowledged. Cheyne thinks that it may be “a fragment of a description of a joyous procession.” Cp. <a href="/psalms/68-25.htm" title="The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with tambourines.">Psalm 68:25</a>. Is it possible that it is not, strictly speaking, part of the Psalm, but a liturgical direction to sing the anthem “All my fountains are in thee” at the end of the Psalm, as an expression of the joy of Zion’s citizens?<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/87.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As well the singers as the players on instruments;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and singers as well as dancers</span> [<span class="accented">shall say</span>]. (On dancing as an element of religious service, see <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm">2 Samuel 6:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/149-3.htm">Psalm 149:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/150-4.htm">Psalm 150:4</a>.) The psalmist intends to represent the converted nations as coming in a grand procession, with songs and dances, to celebrate their admission to Zion, and there one and all exclaiming, All my fresh springs - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all my sources of life, and joy, and happiness" - are in thee. The verse is possibly but "fragment," as Professor Cheyne supposes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/87.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The poet is absorbed in the contemplation of the glory of a matter which he begins to celebrate, without naming it. Whether we render it: His founded, or (since &#1502;&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1491; and &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1491; are both used elsewhere as part. pass.): His foundation (after the form &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, poetically for &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, a founding, then that which is set fast  equals  a foundation), the meaning remains the same; but the more definite statement of the object with &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497; &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; is more easily connected with what precedes by regarding it as a participle. The suffix refers to Jahve, and it is Zion, whose praise is a favourite theme of the Korahitic songs, that is intended. We cannot tell by looking to the accents whether the clause is to be taken as a substantival clause (His founded city is upon the holy mountains) or not. Since, however, the expression is not &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1514;&#1493; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;&#1514;&#1493; &#1489;&#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; is an object placed first in advance (which the antithesis to the other dwellings of Jacob would admit of), and in <a href="/psalms/87-2.htm">Psalm 87:2</a> a new synonymous object is subordinated to &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; by a similar turn of the discourse to <a href="/jeremiah/13-27.htm">Jeremiah 13:27</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-2.htm">Jeremiah 6:2</a> (Hitzig). By altering the division of the verses as Hupfeld and Hofmann do (His foundation or founded city upon the holy mountains doth Jahve love), <a href="/psalms/87-2.htm">Psalm 87:2</a> is decapitated. Even now the God-founded city (surrounded on three sides by deep valleys), whose firm and visible foundation is the outward manifestation of its imperishable inner nature, rises aloft above all the other dwelling-places of Israel. Jahve stands in a lasting, faithful, loving relationship (&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;, not 3 praet. &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;) to the gates of Zion. These gates are named as a periphrasis for Zion, because they bound the circuit of the city, and any one who loves a city delights to go frequently through its gates; and they are perhaps mentioned in prospect of the fulness of the heathen that shall enter into them. In <a href="/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a> the lxx correctly, and at the same time in harmony with the syntax, renders: &#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. The construction of a plural subject with a singular predicate is a syntax common in other instances also, whether the subject is conceived of as a unity in the form of the plural (e.g., <a href="/psalms/66-3.htm">Psalm 66:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-137.htm">Psalm 119:137</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>), or is individualized in the pursuance of the thought (as is the case most likely in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a>); here the glorious things are conceived of as the sum-total of such. The operation of the construction of the active (Ew. 295, b) is not probable here in connection with the participle. &#1489;&#1468; beside &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; may signify the place or the instrument, substance and object of the speech (e.g., <a href="/psalms/119-46.htm">Psalm 119:46</a>), but also the person against whom the words are spoken (e.g., <a href="/psalms/50-20.htm">Psalm 50:20</a>), or concerning whom they are uttered (as the words of the suitor to the father or the relatives of the maiden, <a href="/1_samuel/25-39.htm">1 Samuel 25:39</a>; Sol 8:8; cf. on the construction, <a href="/1_samuel/19-3.htm">1 Samuel 19:3</a>). The poet, without doubt, here refers to the words of promise concerning the eternal continuance and future glory of Jerusalem: Glorious things are spoken, i.e., exist as spoken, in reference to thee, O thou city of God, city of His choice and of His love.<p>The glorious contents of the promise are now unfolded, and that with the most vivid directness: Jahve Himself takes up the discourse, and declares the gracious, glorious, world-wide mission of His chosen and beloved city: it shall become the birth-place of all nations. Rahab is Egypt, as in <a href="/psalms/89-11.htm">Psalm 89:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, the southern worldly power, and Babylon the northern. &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, as frequently, of loud (<a href="/jeremiah/4-16.htm">Jeremiah 4:16</a>) and honourable public mention or commemoration, <a href="/psalms/45-18.htm">Psalm 45:18</a>. It does not signify "to record or register in writing;" for the official name &#1502;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, which is cited in support of this meaning, designates the historian of the empire as one who keeps in remembrance the memorable events of the history of his time. It is therefore impossible, with Hofmann, to render: I will add Rahab and Babylon to those who know me. In general &#1500; is not used to point out to whom the addition is made as belonging to them, but for what purpose, or as what (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>), these kingdoms, hitherto hostile towards God and His people, shall be declared: Jahve completes what He Himself has brought about, inasmuch as He publicly and solemnly declares them to be those who know Him, i.e., those who experimentally (vid., <a href="/psalms/36-11.htm">Psalm 36:11</a>) know Him as their God. Accordingly, it is clear that &#1494;&#1492; &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is also meant to refer to the conversion of the other three nations to whom the finger of God points with &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, viz., the war-loving Philistia, the rich and proud Tyre, and the adventurous and powerful Ethiopia (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1-7</a>). &#1494;&#1492; does not refer to the individuals, nor to the sum-total of these nations, but to nation after nation (cf. &#1494;&#1492; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501;, <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>), by fixing the eye upon each one separately. And &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; refers to Zion. The words of Jahve, which come in without any intermediary preparation, stand in the closest connection with the language of the poet and seer. Zion appears elsewhere as the mother who brings forth Israel again as a numerous people (<a href="/isaiah/66-7.htm">Isaiah 66:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/54-1.htm">Psalm 54:1-3</a>): it is the children of the dispersion (diaspora) which Zion regains in <a href="/isaiah/60-4.htm">Isaiah 60:4</a>.; here, however, it is the nations which are born in Zion. The poet does not combine with it the idea of being born again in the depth of its New Testament meaning; he means, however, that the nations will attain a right of citizenship in Zion (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>) as in their second mother-city, that they will therefore at any rate experience a spiritual change which, regarded from the New Testament point of view, is the new birth out of water and the Spirit. </body></html>
