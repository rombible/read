In the records of heaven, the meanest of those who are born again stand registered. When God renders to every man according to his works, he shall observe who enjoyed the privileges of his sanctuary. To them much was given, and of them much will be required. Let those that dwell in Zion, mark this, and live up to their profession. Zion's songs shall be sung with joy and triumph. The springs of the joy of a carnal worldling are in wealth and pleasure; but of a gracious soul, in the word of God and prayer.

People shall regard it as a privilege to have been born in Zion. They shall speak of such a birth as a marked and honored distinction. "This and that man," etc. Designating them, or pointing them out, as having been born there. Those in a crowd, those passing along, those brought in any way to notice, will be spoken of in reference to their birth in Zion, and will be treated with a degree of favor and esteem, arising from their birth there corresponding to what those receive who are born in Egypt, Babylon, or Tyre. They will not be shunned and avoided on account of their birth as if it were ignoble, but they will be honored for it.<p>And the Highest himself shall establish her - Will establish Zion, or will give it prosperity and perpetuity. This, too, is what would be "said" respecting Zion by such as should speak of those born there; and it indicates<p>(a) their conviction that it would be permanent; and<p>(b) their desire that it might be: that a place so honored and distinguished might be perpetuated.<p>The practical truths suggested by this verse, as applied to the church, are<p>(1) that it is a privilege to have been born in connection with the Christian church; to have had a Christian parentage, and to have been early dedicated to God;<p>(2) that the time will come when this will be a ground of commendation, or when it will be spoken of as an honor, or when it will be regarded as presumptive evidence of a claim to esteem in the eyes of the world, that one was born in the church, was early devoted to God, and was trained up under the influences of religion;<p>(3) that the character of those who are thus born, and who are thus trained up, will constitute, in the view of the world, evidence of the stability of the church, and proof that God regards it with favor. It has not always been deemed an honor, or a passport to favor, to have been born in the church, but the time will come when this will be universally so; and, even now, no child can fully appreciate the honor and the real advantage of having been born in a family where God is served, and of having been early consecrated to God by parental purpose, by prayer, and by Christian baptism. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/87.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

The writer is a persecuted one, and in constant peril of his life. He has taken <a href="/psalms/86-14.htm">Psalm 86:14</a> out of the Elohimic <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/54-5.htm">Psalm 54:5</a>, and retained the Elohim as a proper name of God (cf. on the other hand <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/86-8.htm">Psalm 86:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/86-10.htm">Psalm 86:10</a>); he has, however, altered &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; to &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, which here, as in <a href="/isaiah/13-11.htm">Isaiah 13:11</a> (cf. however, ibid. <a href="/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>), is the alternating word to &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;. In <a href="/psalms/86-15.htm">Psalm 86:15</a> he supports his petition that follows by Jahve's testimony concerning Himself in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>. The appellation given to himself by the poet in <a href="/psalms/86-16.htm">Psalm 86:16</a> recurs in <a href="/psalms/116-16.htm">Psalm 116:16</a> (cf. Wisd. 9:5). The poet calls himself "the son of Thy handmaid" as having been born into the relation to Him of servant; it is a relationship that has come to him by birth. How beautifully does the Adonaj come in here for the seventh time! He is even from his mother's womb the servant of the sovereign Lord, from whose omnipotence he can therefore also look for a miraculous interposition on his behalf. A "token for good" is a special dispensation, from which it becomes evident to him that God is kindly disposed towards him. &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; as in the mouth of Nehemiah, <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-31.htm">Nehemiah 13:31</a>; of <a href="/ezra/8-22.htm">Ezra 8:22</a>; and also even in Jeremiah and earlier. &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; is just as parenthetical as in <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>. </body></html>
