Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, even Jesus Christ.

The gates of a city were the places of concourse; where business was transacted; where courts were held. The particular allusion here seems to be to the thronging multitudes pressing into the city for public worship - the numbers that gathered together at the great feasts and festivals of the nation; and the meaning is, that he looked with more pleasure on such multitudes as they thronged the gates, pressing in that they might worship him, than on any other scene in the land.<p>More than all the dwellings of Jacob - Than any of the places where the descendants of Jacob, or where his people dwell. Much as he might be pleased with their quiet abodes, with their peace, prosperity, and order, and with the fact that his worship was daily celebrated in those happy families, yet he had superior pleasure in the multitudes that crowded the ways to the place where they would publicly acknowledge him as their God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/87.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. gates&#8212;for the enclosures, or city to which they opened (Ps 9:14; 122:2; compare Ps 132:13, 14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/87.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The gates, </span> i.e. the city gates, being oft put for cities, as <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm" title="If there be among you a poor man of one of your brothers within any of your gates in your land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother:">Deu 15:7</a> 16:5 <a href="/psalms/9-14.htm" title="That I may show forth all your praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in your salvation.">Psalm 9:14</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of Zion; </span> largely so called, as was now said, to wit, of Jerusalem, which was built upon and near Mount Zion.

and he loves her gates, the public ordinances; he loves them that come to Zion's gates, and wait and worship there, and who enter in and become members thereof; and he loves what is done there, he being there publicly prayed unto, and publicly praised by a large number of his people; where his word is faithfully preached, and reverently attended to, and his ordinances truly administered, and the graces of his saints exercised on him: wherefore, because all this is done socially, and in a public manner, and so much for his own manifestative glory, he esteems these <p>more than all the dwellings of Jacob; the private habitations of his people; yet he has a regard to these, the bounds of which he fixed from eternity, and where he was delighting himself before they were in being; and he loves the persons that dwell in them, and what is done there in a right manner, as closet and family worship; but when these are put in competition with public worship, the latter is preferred unto them, because done by more, and more publicly; Zion and its gates, the church and its ordinances, are preferable to all the dwellings of Jacob put together. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/87.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/87.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">the gates of Zion</span>] A poetical expression for the city, specially appropriate with reference to the thought of the crowd of pilgrims (<a href="/psalms/122-2.htm" title="Our feet shall stand within your gates, O Jerusalem.">Psalm 122:2</a>) entering it from all nations (<a href="/isaiah/60-11.htm" title="Therefore your gates shall be open continually;
