In the records of heaven, the meanest of those who are born again stand registered. When God renders to every man according to his works, he shall observe who enjoyed the privileges of his sanctuary. To them much was given, and of them much will be required. Let those that dwell in Zion, mark this, and live up to their profession. Zion's songs shall be sung with joy and triumph. The springs of the joy of a carnal worldling are in wealth and pleasure; but of a gracious soul, in the word of God and prayer. All grace and consolation are derived from Christ, through his ordinances, to the souls of believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/87.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord shall count - That is, God himself will honor those who are so born. In the previous verse, the effect of such a birth was described as securing honor from human beings. Here a higher honor is adverted to - that which will be derived from God himself.<p>When he writeth up the people ... - The word rendered "people" here is in the plural number. At the time of making an enrollment of the people, or taking an account or a census of the nations, he would mark, or cause to be marked, with special honor the man that had his birth in Zion. Out of such would his own people be taken, and those thus born would have an honor which no one else would receive from him. He would not mark with any special approbation those who had been born in Egypt, in Babylon, or in Tyre, but he would mark with special interest those who had been born in Zion. The practical truth suggested here is, that God will in the main take his people from among those who have been born in the church. As a matter of fact, while it is true that others are converted and added to the church, the great mass of church-members consist of those who have been born of Christian parents; who have been early dedicated to God; and who have been trained up for his service.

The writer is a persecuted one, and in constant peril of his life. He has taken <a href="/psalms/86-14.htm">Psalm 86:14</a> out of the Elohimic <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/54-5.htm">Psalm 54:5</a>, and retained the Elohim as a proper name of God (cf. on the other hand <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/86-8.htm">Psalm 86:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/86-10.htm">Psalm 86:10</a>); he has, however, altered &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; to &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, which here, as in <a href="/isaiah/13-11.htm">Isaiah 13:11</a> (cf. however, ibid. <a href="/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>), is the alternating word to &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;. In <a href="/psalms/86-15.htm">Psalm 86:15</a> he supports his petition that follows by Jahve's testimony concerning Himself in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>.

The poet calls himself "the son of Thy handmaid" as having been born into the relation to Him of servant; it is a relationship that has come to him by birth. How beautifully does the Adonaj come in here for the seventh time! He is even from his mother's womb the servant of the sovereign Lord, from whose omnipotence he can therefore also look for a miraculous interposition on his behalf. A "token for good" is a special dispensation, from which it becomes evident to him that God is kindly disposed towards him. &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; as in the mouth of Nehemiah, <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-31.htm">Nehemiah 13:31</a>; of <a href="/ezra/8-22.htm">Ezra 8:22</a>; and also even in Jeremiah and earlier. &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; is just as parenthetical as in <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>. </body></html>
