The destruction of sinners may be prevented by their conversion; for it is threatened, If he turn not from his evil way, let him expect it will be his ruin. But amidst the threatenings of wrath, we have a gracious offer of mercy. God gives sinners warning of their danger, and space to repent, and prevent it. He is slow to punish, and long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish. The sinner is described, ver. 14-16, as taking more pains to ruin his soul than, if directed aright, would save it. This is true, in a sense, of all sinners. Let us look to the Saviour under all our trials. Blessed Lord, give us grace to look to thee in the path of tribulation, going before thy church and people, and marking the way by thine own spotless example. Under all the persecutions which in our lesser trials mark our way, let the looking to Jesus animate our minds and comfort our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My defense is of God - The meaning here is, that God was his protector, and that in his troubles he confided in him.

See the notes at thoses verses.<p>Which saveth the upright in heart - whom he that searches the heart <a href="/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a> sees to be upright; or to be sincere, truthful, just. The writer says that it is a characteristic of God that he saves or protects all such; and, conscious of his innocence of the charges against himself, he here appeals to him on that ground, and confides in his protection because he sees that in this respect he was blameless. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. defence&#8212;literally, "shield" (Ps 5:12).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/7.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>10 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.<p>11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.<p>12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.<p>13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.<p>The judge has heard the cause, has cleared the guiltless, and uttered his voice against the persecutors. Let us draw near, and learn the results of the great assize. Yonder is the slandered one with his harp in hand, hymning the justice of his Lord, and rejoicing aloud in his own deliverance. "My defence is of God, which sayeth the upright heart." Oh, how good to have a true and upright heart. Crooked sinners, with all their craftiness, are foiled by the upright in heart. God defends the right. Filth will not long abide on the pure white garments of the saints, but shall be brushed off by divine providence, to the vexation of the men by whose base hands it was thrown upon the godly. When God shall try our cause, our sun has risen, and the sun of the wicked is set for ever. Truth, like oil, is ever above, no power of our enemies can drown it; we shall refute their slanders in the day when the trumpet wakes the dead, and we shall shine in honour when lying lips are put to silence. O believer, fear not all that thy foes can do or say against thee, for the tree which God plants no winds can hurt. "God judgeth the righteous," he hath not given thee up to be condemned by the lips of persecutors. Thine enemies cannot sit on God's throne, nor blot thy name out of his book. Let them alone, then, for God will find time for his revenges.<p>"God is angry with the wicked every day." He not only detests sin, but is angry with those who continue to indulge in it. We have no insensible and stolid God to deal with; he can be angry, nay, he is angry today and every day with you, ye ungodly and impenitent sinners. The best day that ever dawns on a sinner brings a curse with it. Sinners may have many feast days, but no safe days. From the beginning of the year even to its ending, there is not an hour in which God's oven is not hot, and burning in readiness for the wicked, who shall be as stubble.<p>"If he turn not, he will whet his sword." What blows are those which will be dealt by that long uplifted arm! God's sword has been sharpening upon the revolving stone of our daily wickedness, and if we will not repent, it will speedily cut us in pieces. Turn or burn is the sinner's only alternative. "He hath bent his bow and made it ready." Even now the thirsty arrow longs to wet itself with the blood of the persecutor. The bow is bent, the aim is taken, the arrow is fitted to the string, and what, O sinner, if the arrow should be let fly at thee even now! Remember, God's arrows never miss the mark, and are, every one of them, "instruments of death." Judgment may tarry, but it will not come too late.

The verb &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;, cogn. &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;, signifies originally to finish, complete, (root &#1490;&#1501;, &#1499;&#1501; ,&#1490;&#1501; t, cf. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; to be or to make full, to gather into a heap).

But we join &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; with &#1512;&#1506; according to the Targum and contrary to the accentuation, and not with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497; (Olsh., Bttch., Hitz.), although &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501; beside &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, as e.g., &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; beside &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; might mean "requiting." The poet would then have written: &#1488;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506; i.e., if I have retaliated upon him that hath done evil to me. In <a href="/psalms/7-5.htm">Psalm 7:5</a> we do not render it according the meaning to &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1509; which is usual elsewhere: but rather I rescued... (Louis de Dieu, Ewald 345, a, and Hupfeld). Why cannot &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1509; in accordance with its primary signification expedire, exuere (according to which even the signification of rescuing, taken exactly, does not proceed from the idea of drawing out, but of making loose, exuere vinclis) signify here exuere  equals  spoliare, as it does in Aramaic? And how extremely appropriate it is as an allusion to the incident in the cave, when David did not rescue Saul, but, without indeed designing to take &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;, exuviae, cut off the hem of his garment! As Hengstenberg observes, "He affirms his innocence in the most general terms, thereby showing that his conduct towards Saul was not anything exceptional, but sprang from his whole disposition and mode of action."

Kal of &#1512;&#1491;&#1507; is made into three syllables, in a way altogether without example, since, by first making the Sheb audible, from &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507; it is become &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1507; (like &#1497;&#1510;&#1495;&#1511; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/21-6.htm">Genesis 21:6</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; <a href="/psalms/73-9.htm">Psalm 73:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492; <a href="/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>), and this is then sharpened by an euphonic Dag. forte.<p>(Note: The Dag. is of the same kind as the Dag. in &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; among nouns; Arabic popular dialect farass&#305;&#770; (my horse), vid., Wetzstein's Inshriften S. 366.)<p>Other ways of explaining it, as that by Cahjg  equals  &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1491;&#1507;, or by Kimchi as a mixed form from Kal and Piel,<p>(Note: Pinsker's view, that the pointing &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1507; is designed to leave the reader at liberty to choose between the reading &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507;, cannot be supported.

The rhythm is similar so that in the primary passage <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a>, which also finds its echo in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-38.htm">Psalm 18:38</a>, - viz. iambic with anapaests inspersed. By its parallelism with &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; and &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; acquires the signification "my soul," as Saadia, Gecatilia and Aben-Ezra have rendered it - a signification which is secured to it by <a href="/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/30-13.htm">Psalm 30:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/57-9.htm">Psalm 57:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/108-2.htm">Psalm 108:2</a>, <a href="/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6</a>. Man's soul is his doxa, and this it is as being the copy of the divine doxa (Bibl. Psychol. S. 98, [tr. p. 119], and frequently). Moreover, "let him lay in the dust" is at least quite as favourable to this sense of &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; as to the sense of personal and official dignity (<a href="/psalms/3-4.htm">Psalm 3:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>). To lay down in the dust is equivalent to: to lay in the dust of death, <a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, are the dead. According to the biblical conception the soul is capable of being killed (<a href="/numbers/35-11.htm">Numbers 35:11</a>), and mortal (<a href="/numbers/23-10.htm">Numbers 23:10</a>). It binds spirit and body together and this bond is cut asunder by death. David will submit willingly to death in case he has ever acted dishonourably.<p>Here the music is to strike up, in order to give intensity to the expression of this courageous confession. In the next strophe is affirmation of innocence rises to a challenging appeal to the judgment-seat of God and a prophetic certainty that that judgment is near at hand. </body></html>
