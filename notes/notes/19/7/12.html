The destruction of sinners may be prevented by their conversion; for it is threatened, If he turn not from his evil way, let him expect it will be his ruin. But amidst the threatenings of wrath, we have a gracious offer of mercy. God gives sinners warning of their danger, and space to repent, and prevent it. He is slow to punish, and long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish. The sinner is described, ver. 14-16, as taking more pains to ruin his soul than, if directed aright, would save it. This is true, in a sense, of all sinners. Let us look to the Saviour under all our trials. Blessed Lord, give us grace to look to thee in the path of tribulation, going before thy church and people, and marking the way by thine own spotless example. Under all the persecutions which in our lesser trials mark our way, let the looking to Jesus animate our minds and comfort our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If he turn not - If the wicked person does not repent. in the previous verse the psalmist had said that God is angry with the wicked every day; he here states what must be the consequence to the wicked if they persevere in the course which they are pursuing; that is, if they do not repent. God, he says, cannot be indifferent to the course which they pursue, but he is preparing for them the instruments of punishment, and he will certainly bring destruction upon them. It is implied here that if they would repent and turn they would avoid this, and would be saved: a doctrine which is everywhere stated in the Scriptures.<p>He will whet his sword - He will sharpen his sword preparatory to inflicting punishment. That is, God will do this. Some, however, have supposed that this refers to the wicked person - the enemy of David - meaning that if he did not turn; if he was not arrested; if he was suffered to go on as he intended, he would whet his sword, and bend his bow, etc.; that is, that he would go on to execute his purposes against the righteous. See Rosenmuller in loc. But the most natural construction is to refer it to God, as meaning that if the sinner did not repent, He would inflict on him deserved punishment. The "sword" is an instrument of punishment (compare <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>); and to "whet" or sharpen it, is merely a phrase denoting that he would prepare to execute punishment. See <a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>.<p>He hath bent his bow - The bow, like the sword, was used in battle as a means of destroying an enemy. It is used here of God, who is represented as going forth to destroy or punish his foes. The language is derived from the customs of war. Compare <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-4</a>. The Hebrew here is," his bow he has trodden," alluding to the ancient mode of bending the large and heavy bows used in war, by treading on them in order to bend them.<p>And made it ready - Made it ready to shoot the arrow. That is, He is ready to execute punishment on the wicked; or, all the preparations are made for it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12, 13.

If a man turn not from his evil way and repent, God ‘will whet his sword:’ nay, He has already strung His bow and made it ready to discharge the arrow of punishment.

His vision widens and extends from the enemies immediately around to the whole world in its hostility towards Jahve and His anointed one. In the very same way special judgments and the judgment of the world are portrayed side by side, as it were on one canvas, in the prophets. The truth of this combination lies in the fact of the final judgment being only the finale of that judgment which is in constant execution in the world itself. The language here takes the highest and most majestic flight conceivable. By &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (Milra, ass in <a href="/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>), which is one of David's words of prayer that he has taken from the lips of Moses (<a href="/psalms/9-20.htm">Psalm 9:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/10-12.htm">Psalm 10:12</a>), he calls upon Jahve to interpose. The parallel is &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; lift Thyself up, show thyself in Thy majesty, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-2.htm">Psalm 94:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>. The anger, in which He is to arise, is the principle of His judicial righteousness. With this His anger He is to gird Himself (<a href="/psalms/76-11.htm">Psalm 76:11</a>) against the ragings of the oppressors of God's anointed one, i.e., taking vengeance on their many and manifold manifestations of hostility. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is a shorter form of the construct (instead of &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/40-11.htm">Job 40:11</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/21-1.htm">Psalm 21:1-13</a> :31) of &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; which describes the anger as running over, breaking forth from within and passing over into words and deeds (cf. Arab. fs&#780;s&#780;, used of water: it overflows the dam, of wrath: it breaks forth). It is contrary to the usage of the language to make &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; the object to &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; in opposition to the accents, and it is unnatural to regard it as the accus. of direction  equals  &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1496; (<a href="/psalms/35-23.htm">Psalm 35:23</a>), as Hitzig does. The accents rightly unite &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;: awake (stir thyself) for me i.e., to help me (&#1488;&#1500;&#1497; like &#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="/psalms/59-5.htm">Psalm 59:5</a>). The view, that &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is then precative and equivalent to &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;: command judgment, is one that cannot be established according to syntax either here, or in <a href="/psalms/71-3.htm">Psalm 71:3</a>. It ought at least to have been &#1493;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; with Waw consec. On the other hand the relative rendering: Thou who hast ordered judgment (Maurer, Hengst.), is admissible, but unnecessary. We take it by itself in a confirmatory sense, not as a circumstantial clause: having commanded judgment (Ewald), but as a co-ordinate clause: Thou hast indeed enjoined the maintaining of right (Hupfeld).<p>The psalmist now, so to speak, arranges the judgment scene: the assembly of the nations is to form a circle round about Jahve, in the midst of which He will sit in judgment, and after the judgment He is to soar away (<a href="/genesis/17-22.htm">Genesis 17:22</a>) aloft over it and return to the heights of heaven like a victor after the battle (see <a href="/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>). Although it strikes one as strange that the termination of the judgment itself is not definitely expressed, yet the rendering of Hupfeld and others: sit Thou again upon Thy heavenly judgment-seat to judge, is to be rejected on account of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; (cf. on the other hand 21:14) which is not suited to it; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; can only mean Jahve's return to His rest after the execution of judgment. That which <a href="/psalms/7-7.htm">Psalm 7:7</a> and <a href="/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8</a> in the boldness of faith desire, the beginning of <a href="/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a> expresses as a prophetic hope, from which proceeds the prayer, that the Judge of the earth may also do justice to him (&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497; vindica me, as in <a href="/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-24.htm">Psalm 35:24</a>) according to his righteousness and the purity of which he is conscious, as dwelling in him. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; is to be closely connected with &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, just as one says &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; (Psychol. S. 152 [tr. p. 180]). That which the individual as ego, distinguishes from itself as being in it, as subject, it denotes by &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;. In explaining it elliptically: "come upon me" (Ew., Olsh., Hupf.) this psychologically intelligible usage of the language is not recognised.
