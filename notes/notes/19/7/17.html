The destruction of sinners may be prevented by their conversion; for it is threatened, If he turn not from his evil way, let him expect it will be his ruin. But amidst the threatenings of wrath, we have a gracious offer of mercy. God gives sinners warning of their danger, and space to repent, and prevent it. He is slow to punish, and long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish. The sinner is described, ver. 14-16, as taking more pains to ruin his soul than, if directed aright, would save it. This is true, in a sense, of all sinners. Let us look to the Saviour under all our trials. Blessed Lord, give us grace to look to thee in the path of tribulation, going before thy church and people, and marking the way by thine own spotless example. Under all the persecutions which in our lesser trials mark our way, let the looking to Jesus animate our minds and comfort our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness - That is, particularly as manifested in the treatment of the righteous and the wicked, protecting the one, and bringing deeserved punishment upon the other. The purpose of the psalm is to show this. In the course of the psalm the author had declared his full conviction that this was the character of God, and now, in view of this, he says that he will render to him the praise and glory which such a character deserves. He will acknowledge him by public acts of praise as such a God; and will at all times ascribe these attributes to him.<p>And will sing praise to the name of the Lord - To the name of Jehovah; that is, to Yahweh himself, the "name" being often used to designate a person, or that by which he is known; and also, in many cases, as in this, being significant, or designating the essential nature of him to whom it is applied.<p>Most high - Exalted above all other beings; exalted above all worlds. The purpose here declared of praising God may refer either to the act which he was then performing in the composition of the psalm, or it may be a purpose in respect to the future, declaring his intention to be to retain in future life the memory of those characteristics of the divine nature now disclosed to him, and to celebrate them in all time to come. The great truth taught is, that God is to be adored for what he is, and that his holy character, manifested alike in the treatment of the righteous and the wicked, lays the foundation for exalted praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. his righteousness&#8212;(Ps 5:8).

In this all these Psalms are agreed; they all exhibit the blessedness of the righteous, and make its colours the more glowing by contrast with the miseries of the wicked. The bright jewel Sparkles in a black foil. Praise is the occupation of the godly, their eternal work, and their present pleasure. Singing is the fitting embodiment for praise, and therefore do the saints make melody before the Lord Most High. The slandered one is now a singer: his harp was unstrung for a very little season, and now we leave him sweeping its harmonious chords, and flying on their music to the third heaven of adoring praise. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">According to his righteousness, </span> declared and asserted by him in their exemplary punishment, and my seasonable and wonderful deliverance. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness,....

Another abrupt transition - a song of thankfulness to Jehovah for giving the deliverance which the psalmist foresees, and considers as good as accomplished. And will sing praise to the Name of the Lord most high (comp. <a href="/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1, 9</a>, "How excellent is <span class="accented">thy Name</span> in all the earth!"). God is identified with his Name very commonly in Scripture, or, perhaps we should say, the Name of God is used as a periphrasis for God himself. Where God puts his special presence, he is said to "put his Name" (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 21</a>: <a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>). His Name is "holy and reverend" (Psalm 111:19); "incense is offered unto it" (<a href="/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>); it is "magnified for ever" (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-24.htm">1 Chronicles 17:24</a>); for it the temple is built (<a href="/1_kings/8-44.htm">1 Kings 8:44</a>); through it the godly "tread down their enemies" (<a href="/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>); the "desire of men's souls is to it" (<a href="/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>). (See also <a href="/psalms/92-1.htm">Psalm 92:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/96-8.htm">Psalm 96:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/99-3.htm">Psalm 99:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-1.htm">Psalm 105:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/113-1.htm">Psalm 113:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-55.htm">Psalm 119:55</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-1.htm">Psalm 145:1, 2, 21</a>; <a href="/psalms/148-13.htm">Psalm 148:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/149-3.htm">Psalm 149:3</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 7:12-14) If God will in the end let His wrath break forth, He will not do it without having previously given threatenings thereof every day, viz., to the ungodly, cf. <a href="/isaiah/66-14.htm">Isaiah 66:14</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-4.htm">Malachi 1:4</a>. He makes these feel His &#1494;&#1506;&#1501; beforehand in order to strike a wholesome terror into them. The subject of the conditional clause &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; is any ungodly person whatever; and the subject of the principal clause, as its continuation in <a href="/psalms/7-14.htm">Psalm 7:14</a> shows, is God. If a man (any one) does not repent, then Jahve will whet His sword (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>). This sense of the words accords with the connection; whereas with the rendering: "forsooth He (Elohim) will again whet His sword" (Bttch., Ew., Hupf.) &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, which would moreover stand close by &#1497;&#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; (cf. e.g., <a href="/genesis/30-31.htm">Genesis 30:31</a>), is meaningless; and the &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; of asseveration is devoid of purpose. Judgment is being gradually prepared, as the fut. implies; but, as the perff. imply, it is also on the other hand like a bow that is already strung against the sinner with the arrow pointed towards him, so that it can be executed at any moment. &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; of the making ready, and &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; of the aiming, are used alternately. &#1500;&#1493;, referring to the sinner, stands first by way of emphasis as in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>, and is equivalent to &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="/ezekiel/4-3.htm">Ezekiel 4:3</a>. "Burning" arrows are fire-arrows (&#1494;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1494;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, malleoli); and God's fire-arrows are the lightnings sent forth by Him, <a href="/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a>. The fut. &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500; denotes the simultaneous charging of the arrows aimed at the sinner, with the fire of His wrath. The case illustrated by Cush is generalised: by the sword and arrows the manifold energy of the divine anger is symbolised, and it is only the divine forbearance that prevents it from immediately breaking forth. The conception is not coarsely material, but the vividness of the idea of itself suggests the form of its embodiment. </body></html>
