But Christ alone could call on Heaven to attest his uprightness in all things. All His works were wrought in righteousness; and the prince of this world found nothing whereof justly to accuse him. Yet for our sakes, submitting to be charged as guilty, he suffered all evils, but, being innocent, he triumphed over them all. The plea is, For the righteous God trieth the hearts and the reins. He knows the secret wickedness of the wicked, and how to bring it to an end; he is witness to the secret sincerity of the just, and has ways of establishing it. When a man has made peace with God about all his sins, upon the terms of grace and mercy, through the sacrifice of the Mediator, he may, in comparison with his enemies, appeal to God's justice to decide.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the enemy persecute my soul - Persecute my "life," for so the word rendered "soul," &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;  nephesh, is evidently used here. He was willing, if he had been guilty of the thing charged upon him, that the enemy here referred to should "pursue" or persecute him until he should destroy his life. Compare with this the expression of Paul in <a href="/acts/25-11.htm">Acts 25:11</a>. The meaning here is simply that if he were a guilty man, in the manner charged on him, he would be willing to be treated accordingly. He did not wish to screen himself from any just treatment; and if he had been guilty he would not complain even if he were cut off from the land of the living.<p>And take it - Take my life; put me to death.<p>Yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth - The allusion here is to the manner in which the vanquished were often treated in battle, when they were rode over by horses, or trampled by men into the dust. The idea of David is, that if he was guilty he would be willing that his enemy should triumph over him, should subdue him, should treat him with the utmost indignity and scorn.<p>And lay mine honor in the dust - All the tokens or marks of my honor or distinction in life. That is, I am willing to be utterly degraded and humbled, if I have been guilty of this conduct toward him who is my enemy. The idea in all this is, that David did not wish to screen himself from the treatment which he deserved if he had done wrong. His own principles were such that he would have felt that the treatment here referred to would have been right and proper as a recompense for such base conduct; and he would not have had a word to say against it. His desire for the interposition of God, therefore, arose solely from the fact of his feeling that, in these respects, he was entirely innocent, and that the conduct of his enemy was unjust and cruel.<p>Selah - A musical pause, not affecting the sense, but introduced here, perhaps, because the sense of the psalm now demanded a change in the style of the music.

Should he appear to be guilty of the crimes he was accused of, he is willing to have his glorious name buried in the dust of oblivion, and his memory perish for ever. The words are to be considered as a strong assertion of his innocence, in an appeal to God, the searcher of hearts, and the trier of the reins of men; and as imprecating on himself the worst of evils, should it not appear; see <a href="/job/31-21.htm">Job 31:21</a>. <p>Selah; Aben Ezra renders "selah", "in truth", "let it be so"; and the Targum renders it, as usual, "for ever"; See Gill on <a href="/psalms/3-2.htm">Psalm 3:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take <i>it</i>; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> honour in the dust.

The last line might mean only, ‘degrade my dignity, treat me with insult and ignominy;’ but the parallelism of ‘my soul,’ ‘my life,’ ‘my glory,’ is decisive in favour of interpreting ‘my glory’ to mean ‘my soul, as in <a href="/psalms/16-9.htm" title="Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh also shall rest in hope.">Psalm 16:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/30-12.htm" title="To the end that my glory may sing praise to you, and not be silent.

The ‘soul’ is so designated either as the noblest part of man, or as the image of the divine glory. ‘The dust’ will then be ‘the dust of death.’ Cp. <a href="/psalms/22-15.htm" title="My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue sticks to my jaws; and you have brought me into the dust of death.">Psalm 22:15</a>; and the exact parallel ‘dwellers in the dust,’ <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm" title="Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.">Isaiah 26:19</a>.

Thrice in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/6-9.htm">Psalm 6:9</a>, <a href="/psalms/6-10.htm">Psalm 6:10</a> his confidence that God will answer him flashes forth: He hears his loud sobbing, the voice of his weeping that rises towards heaven, He hears his supplication, and He graciously accepts his prayer. The twofold &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; expresses the fact and &#1497;&#1511;&#1495; its consequence.
