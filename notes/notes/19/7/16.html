The destruction of sinners may be prevented by their conversion; for it is threatened, If he turn not from his evil way, let him expect it will be his ruin. But amidst the threatenings of wrath, we have a gracious offer of mercy. God gives sinners warning of their danger, and space to repent, and prevent it. He is slow to punish, and long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish. The sinner is described, ver. 14-16, as taking more pains to ruin his soul than, if directed aright, would save it. This is true, in a sense, of all sinners. Let us look to the Saviour under all our trials. Blessed Lord, give us grace to look to thee in the path of tribulation, going before thy church and people, and marking the way by thine own spotless example. Under all the persecutions which in our lesser trials mark our way, let the looking to Jesus animate our minds and comfort our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His mischief - The mischief which he had designed for others.<p>Shall return upon his own head - Shall come upon himself.

The word rendered violent dealing means violence, injustice, oppression, wrong.<p>Shall all come down upon his own pate - The word here rendered "pate" means properly vertex, top, or crown - as of the head. The idea is that it would come upon himself. He would be treated as he had designed to treat others. The sentiment here expressed is found also in <a href="/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-15.htm">Psalm 37:15</a>. Compare Eurip.

Some critics see in this a continuation of the metaphor, and suppose that, while the sinner is in the pit, the heap which his own hands have thrown out falls in upon him and crushes him. But it is perhaps better to understand the words in a more general way. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 7:10-11) In this strophe we hear the calm language of courageous trust, to which the rising and calmly subsiding caesural schema is particularly adapted. He is now concerned about the cessation of evil: Oh let it come to an end (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; intransitive as in <a href="/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/77-9.htm">Psalm 77:9</a>).... His prayer is therefore not directed against the individuals as such but against the wickedness that is in them. This Psalm is the key to all Psalms which contain prayers against one's enemies. Just in the same manner &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; is intended to express a wish; it is one of the comparatively rare voluntatives of the 2 pers. (Ew. 229): and mayst Thou be pleased to establish.... To the termination of evil which is desired corresponds, in a positive form of expression, the desired security and establishment of the righteous, whom it had injured and whose continuance was endangered by it. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;&#1503; is the beginning of a circumstantial clause, introduced by &#1493;, but without the personal pronoun, which is not unfrequently omitted both in the leading participial clause, as in <a href="/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a> (which see), and in the minor participial clause as here (cf. <a href="/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20</a>): cum sis  equals  quoniam es. The reins are the seat of the emotions, just as the heart is the seat of the thoughts and feelings. Reins and heart lie naked before God-a description of the only kardiognoo'stees, which is repeated in <a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>, <a href="/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>. In the thesis the adjective is used with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; in the sing. as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/58-12.htm">Psalm 58:12</a>. God is the righteous God, and by his knowledge of the inmost part He is fully capable of always showing Himself both righteous in anger and righteous in mercy according to the requirements and necessity of the case. Therefore David can courageously add &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, my shield doth God carry; &#1500; <a href="/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a>) would signify: He has it, it (my shield) belongs to Him, &#1506;&#1500; (<a href="/1_chronicles/18-7.htm">1 Chronicles 18:7</a>) signifies: He bears it, or if one takes shield in the sense of protection: He has taken my protection upon Himself, has undertaken it (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>, cf. <a href="/judges/19-20.htm">Judges 19:20</a>), as He is in general the Saviour of all who are devoted to Him with an upright heart, i.e., a heart sincere, guileless (cf. <a href="/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a> with <a href="/psalms/7-2.htm">Psalm 7:2</a>). &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is intentionally repeated at the end of the first two lines - the favourite palindrome, found more especially in <a href="/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>. And to the mixed character of this Psalm belongs the fact of its being both Elohimic and Jehovic. From the calm language of heartfelt trust in God the next strophe passes over into the language of earnest warning, which is again more excited and somewhat after the style of didactic poetry. </body></html>
