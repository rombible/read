Hence, it means "shining," splendid, glorious; and it is thus applied to the Divine Being with reference to his perfections, being like light. Compare <a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>. The word rendered "excellent," means exalted, noble, great. These words are applied here to God from the manifestation of his perfections in the case referred to.<p>Than the mountains of prey - The word "prey" as employed here - &#1496;&#1512;&#1507;  t&#803;ereph - means that which is obtained by hunting; and then, plunder. It is usually applied to the food of wild beasts, beasts of prey. Here it refers to the "mountains" considered as the abode or stronghold of robbers and banditti, from where they sally forth in search of plunder. These mountains, in their heights, their rocks, their fastnesses, furnished safe places of retreat for robbers, and hence, they became emblems of power. It is not improbable that the hordes referred to in the psalm had their abodes in such mountains, and hence, the psalmist says that God who made those mountains and hills was superior to them in strength and power. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/76.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

A passage of the Midrash says &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1495;&#1493;&#1509; &#1502;&#1494;&#1492; &#1499;&#1500; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; (everywhere where harim is found in Scripture it signifies harim, mountains, with the exception of this passage), and accordingly it is explained by Rashi, Kimchi, Alshch, and others, that man, whithersoever he may turn, cannot by strength and skill attain great exaltation and prosperity.<p>(Note: E.g., Bamidbar Rabba ch. xxii.; whereas according to Bere&#770;sh&#305;&#770;th Rabba ch. lii. &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;.)<p>Thus it is according to the reading &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, although Kimchi maintains that it can also be so explained with the reading &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, by pointing to &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1505; (<a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>) and the like. It is, however, difficult to see why, in order to express the idea "from anywhere," three quarters of the heavens should be used and the north left out. These three quarters of the heavens which are said to represent the earthly sources of power (Hupfeld), are a frame without the picture, and the thought, "from no side (viz., of the earth) cometh promotion" - in itself whimsical in expression - offers a wrong confirmation for the dissuasive that has gone before. That, however, which the church longs for is first of all not promotion, but redemption. On the other hand, the lxx, Targum, Syriac, and Vulgate render: a deserto montium (desertis montibus); and even Aben-Ezra rightly takes it as a Palestinian designation of the south, when he supplements the aposiopesis by means of &#1502;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1501; (more biblically &#1497;&#1489;&#1506; &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, cf. <a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>.). The fact that the north is not mentioned at all shows that it is a northern power which arrogantly, even to blasphemy, threatens the small Israelitish nation with destruction, and against which it looks for help neither from the east and west, nor from the reed-staff of Egypt (<a href="/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>) beyond the desert of the mountains of Arabia Petraea, but from Jahve alone, according to the watchword of Isaiah: &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492; (<a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>). The negative thought is left unfinished, the discourse hurrying on to the opposite affirmative thought. The close connection of the two thoughts is strikingly expressed by the rhymes &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; of <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a> gives the confirmation of the negation from the opposite, that which is denied; the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; of <a href="/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a> confirms this confirmation. If it were to be rendered, "and the wine foams," it would then have been &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;; &#1502;&#1505;&#1498;, which is undoubtedly accusative, also shows that yayin is also not considered as anything else: and it (the cup) foams (&#1495;&#1502;&#1512; like Arab. 'chtmr, to ferment, effervesce) with wine, is full of mixture. According to the ancient usage of the language, which is also followed by the Arabic, this is wine mixed with water in distinction from merum, Arabic chamr memzu&#770;g'e. Wine was mixed with water not merely to dilute it, but also to make it more pleasant; hence &#1502;&#1505;&#1498; signifies directly as much as to pour out (vid., Hitzig on <a href="/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>).  It is therefore unnecessary to understand spiced wine (Talmudic &#1511;&#1493;&#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1496;&#1493;&#1503;, conditum), since the collateral idea of weakening is also not necessarily associated with the admixture of water. &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; refers to &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;, which is used as masculine, as in <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>; the word is feminine elsewhere, and changes its gender even here in &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/23-34.htm">Ezekiel 23:34</a>). In the fut. consec. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512; the historical signification of the consecutive is softened down, as is frequently the case. &#1488;&#1498; affirms the whole assertion that follows. The dregs of the cup - a dira necessitas - all the wicked of the earth shall be compelled to sip (<a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>), to drink out: they shall not be allowed to drink and make a pause, but, compelled by Jahve, who has appeared as Judge, they shall be obliged to drink it out with involuntary eagerness even to the very last (<a href="/ezekiel/23-34.htm">Ezekiel 23:34</a>). We have here the primary passage of a figure, which has been already hinted at in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>, and is filled in on a more and more magnificent and terrible scale in the prophets. Whilst Obadiah (<a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a>, cf. <a href="/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>) contents himself with a mere outline sketch, it is found again, in manifold applications, in Isaiah, Habakkuk, and Ezekiel, and most frequently in Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-27.htm">Jeremiah 25:27</a>., <a href="/jeremiah/48-26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-12.htm">Jeremiah 49:12</a>), where in <a href="/psalms/25-15.htm">Psalm 25:15</a>. it is embodied into a symbolical act. Jahve's cup of intoxication (inasmuch as &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, the burning of anger and intoxicating, fiery wine, are put on an equality) is the judgment of wrath which is meted out to sinners and given them to endure to the end. </body></html>
