The righteous God seems to keep silence long, yet, sooner or later, he will make judgment to be heard. We live in an angry, provoking world; we often feel much, and are apt to fear more, from the wrath of man. What will not turn to his praise, shall not be suffered to break out. He can set bounds to the wrath of man, as he does to the raging sea; hitherto it shall come, and no further. Let all submit to God. Our prayers and praises, and especially our hearts, are the presents we should bring to the Lord. His name is glorious, and he is the proper object of our fear. He shall cut off the spirit of princes; he shall slip it off easily, as we slip off a flower from the stalk, or a bunch of grapes from the vine; so the word signifies. He can dispirit the most daring: since there is no contending with God, it is our wisdom, as it is our duty, to submit to him. Let us seek his favour as our portion, and commit all our concerns to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/76.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall cut off the spirit of princes - That is, He will cut down their pride; he will break them down. Luther renders it, "He shall take away the wrath of princes." The allusion is to what he had done as celebrated in this psalm. He had shown that he could rebuke the pride and self-confidence of kings, and could bring them low at his feet.<p>He is terrible to the kings of the earth - When they are arrayed against him.<p>(1) they are wholly under his control.<p>(2) he can defeat their plans.<p>(3) he can check them when he pleases.<p>(4) he can, and will, make their plans - even their wrath - the means of promoting or carrying out his own purposes.<p>(5) he will allow them to proceed no further in their plans of evil than he can make subservient to the furtherance of his own.<p>(6) he can cut down the most mighty of them at his pleasure, and destroy them forever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/76.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11, 12.
