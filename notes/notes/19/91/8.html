And those who have found the comfort of making the Lord their refuge, cannot but desire that others may do so. The spiritual life is protected by Divine grace from the temptations of Satan, which are as the snares of the fowler, and from the contagion of sin, which is a noisome pestilence. Great security is promised to believers in the midst of danger. Wisdom shall keep them from being afraid without cause, and faith shall keep them from being unduly afraid. Whatever is done, our heavenly Father's will is done; and we have no reason to fear. God's people shall see, not only God's promises fulfilled, but his threatenings. Then let sinners come unto the Lord upon his mercy-seat, through the Redeemer's name; and encourage others to trust in him also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/91.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Only - That is, This is "all" that will occur to you. The only thing which you have to anticipate is, that you will see how God punishes sinners.<p>With thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked - Your own eyes shall see it. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/37-34.htm">Psalm 37:34</a>. You will see the just punishment of the ungodly, the vicious, the profane, the sensual. You will see what is the proper fruit of their conduct; what is the just expression of the views which God takes of their character. This undoubtedly refers to the general principle that there is a moral government on earth; that vice is often punished as such; that the general course of the divine dealings is such as to show that God is favorable to virtue, and is opposed to vice. The system is not complete here, and there are many things which could not be reconciled with this, if the present world were all, and if there were no future state: but the course of events indicates the general character of the divine administration, and what is the tendency of things. The completion - the actual and perfect adjustment - is reserved for a future state. The facts as they occur on earth prove that there is an attribute of justice in God; the fact that his dealings here are not wholly and fully in accordance with what justice demands, proves that there will be a state where full justice will be done, and where the whole system will be adjusted. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/91.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7, 8.
