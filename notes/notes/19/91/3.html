And those who have found the comfort of making the Lord their refuge, cannot but desire that others may do so. The spiritual life is protected by Divine grace from the temptations of Satan, which are as the snares of the fowler, and from the contagion of sin, which is a noisome pestilence. Great security is promised to believers in the midst of danger. Wisdom shall keep them from being afraid without cause, and faith shall keep them from being unduly afraid. Whatever is done, our heavenly Father's will is done; and we have no reason to fear. God's people shall see, not only God's promises fulfilled, but his threatenings. Then let sinners come unto the Lord upon his mercy-seat, through the Redeemer's name; and encourage others to trust in him also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/91.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler - The snare or gin set for catching birds; meaning, here, that God would save him from the purposes of wicked people; such purposes as might be compared with the devices employed to catch birds. On the meaning of the figure used here, see the notes at <a href="/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>.<p>And from the noisome pestilence - The "fatal" pestilence; the pestilence that spreads death in its march. That is, he can prevent its coming upon you; or, he can save you from its ravages, while others are dying around you. This promise is not to be understood as absolute, or as meaning that no one who fears God will ever fall by the pestilence - for good people "do" die at such times as well as bad people; but the idea is, that God "can" preserve us at such a time and that, as a great law, he will be thus the protector of those who trust him. It is to be remembered that in times of pestilence (as was the case during the prevalence of the Asiatic cholera in 1832 and 1848), very many of the victims are the intemperate, the sensual, the debased, and that a life of this kind is a predisposing cause of death in such visitations of judgment. A large part of those who die are of that number. From the danger arising from this cause, of course the virtuous, the temperate, the pious are exempt; and this is one of the methods by which God saves those who trust in him from the "noisome pestilence." Religion, therefore, to a considerable extent, constitutes a ground of security at such times; nor is there any reason to doubt that, in many cases also, there may be a special interposition protecting the friends of God from danger, and sparing them for future usefulness. The promise here is substantially that general promise which we have in the Scriptures everywhere, that God is the Protector of his people, and that they may put their trust in him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/91.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. snares &#8230; [and] &#8230; noisome pestilence&#8212;literally, "plagues of mischiefs" (Ps 5:9; 52:7), are expressive figures for various evils.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/91.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.<p>4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.<p>5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;<p>6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.<p>7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.<p>8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.<p><a href="/psalms/91-3.htm">Psalm 91:3</a><p>"Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler." Assuredly no subtle plot shall succeed against one who has the eyes of God watching for his defence. We are foolish and weak as poor little birds, and are very apt to be lured to our destruction by cunning foes, but if we dwell near to God, he will see to it that the most skilful deceiver shall not entrap us.<p>"Satan the fowler who betrays<p>Unguarded souls a thousand ways,"<p>shall be foiled in the case of the man whose high and honourable condition consists in residence within the holy place of the Most High. "And from the noisome pestilence." He who is a Spirit can protect us from evil spirits, he who is mysterious can rescue us from mysterious dangers, he who is immortal can redeem us from mortal sickness. There is a deadly pestilence of error, we are safe from that if we dwell in communion with the God of truth; there is a fatal pestilence of sin, we shall not be infected by it if we abide with the thrice Holy One; there is also a pestilence of disease, and even from that calamity our faith shall win immunity if it be of that high order which abides in God, walks on in calm serenity, and ventures all things for duty's sake. Faith by cheering the heart keeps it free from the fear which, in times of pestilence, kills more than the plague itself. It will not in all cases ward off disease and death, but where the man is such as <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a> describes, it will assuredly render him immortal where others die; if all the saints are not so sheltered it is because they have not all such a close abiding with God, and consequently not such confidence in the promise. Such special faith is not given to all, for there are diversities in the measure of faith. It is not of all believers that the Psalmist sings, but only of those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High. Too many among us are weak in faith, and in fact place more reliance in a phial or a globule than in the Lord and giver of life, and if we die of pestilence as others die it is because we acted like others, and did not in patience possess our souls. The great mercy is that in such a case our deaths are blessed, and it is well with us, for we are for ever with the Lord. Pestilence to the saints shall not be noisome but the messenger of heaven.<p><a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a><p>"He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust." A wonderful expression! Had it been invented by an uninspired man it would have verged upon blasphemy, for who should dare to apply such words to the Infinite Jehovah? But as he himself authorised yea, dictated the language, we have here a transcendent condescension, such as it becomes us to admire and adore. Doth the Lord speak of his feathers, as though he likened himself to a bird? Who will not see herein a matchless love, a divine tenderness, which should both woo and win our confidence? Even as a hen covereth her chickens so doth the Lord protect the souls which dwell in him; let us cower down beneath him for comfort and for safety. Hawks in the sky and snares in the field are equally harmless when we nestle so near the Lord. "His truth" - his true promise, and his faithfulness to his promise "shall be thy shield and buckler." Double armour has he who relies upon the Lord. He bears a shield and wears an all-surrounding coat of mail - such is the force of the word "buckler." To quench fiery darts the truth is a most effectual shield, and to blunt all swords it is an equally effectual coat of mail. Let us go forth to battle thus harnessed for the war, and we shall be safe in the thickest of the fight. It has been so, and so shall it be till we reach the land of peace, and there among the "helmed cherubim and sworded seraphim," we will wear no other ornament, his truth shall still be our shield and buckler.<p><a href="/psalms/91-5.htm">Psalm 91:5</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/91.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> O thou believing, pious soul, who after my example shalt make God thy refuge, thou shalt partake of the same privilege which I enjoy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He shall deliver thee from the pestilence, </span> which like a fowler’s snare taketh men suddenly and unexpectedly, and holdeth them fast, and commonly delivers them up to death. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/91.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,....

We here recognise the well-known language of prayer of Moses in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>, according to which &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; is not intended as a prayer for God's return to Israel, but for the turning away of His anger; and the sigh &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; that is blended with its asks how long this being angry, which threatens to blot Israel out, is still to last. &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; is explained according to this same parallel passage: May God feel remorse or sorrow (which in this case coincide) concerning His servants, i.e., concerning the affliction appointed to them. The naming of the church by &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-27.htm">Deuteronomy 9:27</a>, cf. <a href="/exodus/32-13.htm">Exodus 32:13</a> of the patriarchs) reminds one of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a> : concerning His servants He shall feel compassion (Hithpa. instead of the Niphal). The prayer for the turning of wrath is followed in <a href="/psalms/90-14.htm">Psalm 90:14</a> by the prayer for the turning towards them of favour. In &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; there lies the thought that it has been night hitherto in Israel. "Morning" is therefore the beginning of a new season of favour. In &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (to which &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; is a second accusative of the object) is implied the thought that Israel whilst under wrath has been hungering after favour; cf. the adjective &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; in the same tropical signification in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>. The supplicatory imperatives are followed by two moods expressive of intention: then will we, or: in order that we may rejoice and be glad; for futures like these set forth the intention of attaining something as a result or aim of what has been expressed just before: Ew. 325, a. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is not governed by the verbs of rejoicing (<a href="/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a>), in which case it would have been &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, but is an adverbial definition of time (<a href="/psalms/145-2.htm">Psalm 145:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>): within the term of life allotted to us. We see from <a href="/psalms/90-15.htm">Psalm 90:15</a> that the season of affliction has already lasted for a long time. The duration of the forty years of wrath, which in the midst of their course seemed to them as an eternity, is made the measure of the reviving again that is earnestly sought. The plural &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; instead of &#1497;&#1502;&#1497; is common only to our Psalm and <a href="/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>; it is not known elsewhere to Biblical Hebrew. And the poetical &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, which also occurs elsewhere, appears for the first time in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>. The meaning of &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, in which &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; hcihw is specialized after the manner of a genitive, is explained from <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>., according to which the forty years' wandering in the wilderness was designed to humble (&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;) and to prove Israel through suffering. At the close of these forty years Israel stands on the threshold of the Promise Land. To Israel all final hopes were closely united with the taking possession of this land. We learn from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a> that it is the horizon of Jacob's prophetic benediction. This Psalm too, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/90-16.htm">Psalm 90:16-17</a>, terminates in the prayer for the attainment of this goal. The psalmist has begun in <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a> his adoration with the majestic divine name &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;; in <a href="/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a> he began his prayer with the gracious divine name &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;; and now, where he mentions God for the third time, he gives to Him the twofold name, so full of faith, &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. &#1488;&#1500; used once alternates with the thrice repeated &#1506;&#1500;: salvation is not Israel's own work, but the work of Jahve; it therefore comes from above, it comes and meets Israel. It is worthy of remark that the noun &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; occurs only in Deuteronomy in the whole Tra, and that here also of the gracious rule of Jahve, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-4.htm">Psalm 32:4</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>.

This expression &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as a designation of human undertakings runs through the whole of the Book of Deuteronomy: <a href="/deuteronomy/2-7.htm">Deuteronomy 2:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-28.htm">Deuteronomy 4:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-7.htm">Deuteronomy 11:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-15.htm">Deuteronomy 16:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-9.htm">Deuteronomy 30:9</a>.

Therein is made manifest &#1504;&#1506;&#1501; &#1492;, His graciousness and condescension - an expression which David has borrowed from Moses in <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>. &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1492;&#1497; are optatives. &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492; is an urgent request, imperat. obsecrantis as the old expositors say. With Waw the same thought is expressed over again (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>, &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, yea come) - a simple, childlike anadiplosis which vividly reminds us of the Book of Deuteronomy, which revolves in thoughts that are ever the same, and by that very means speaks deeply to the heart. Thus the Deuteronomic impression of this Psalm accompanies us from beginning to end, from &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; to &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;. Nor will it now be merely accidental that the fondness for comparisons, which is a peculiarity of the Book of Deuteronomy (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-13.htm">Deuteronomy 28:13</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-44.htm">Deuteronomy 28:44</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-17.htm">Deuteronomy 29:17-18</a>), is found again in this Psalm. </body></html>
