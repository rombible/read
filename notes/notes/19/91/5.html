We here recognise the well-known language of prayer of Moses in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>, according to which &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; is not intended as a prayer for God's return to Israel, but for the turning away of His anger; and the sigh &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; that is blended with its asks how long this being angry, which threatens to blot Israel out, is still to last. &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; is explained according to this same parallel passage: May God feel remorse or sorrow (which in this case coincide) concerning His servants, i.e., concerning the affliction appointed to them. The naming of the church by &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-27.htm">Deuteronomy 9:27</a>, cf. <a href="/exodus/32-13.htm">Exodus 32:13</a> of the patriarchs) reminds one of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a> : concerning His servants He shall feel compassion (Hithpa. instead of the Niphal). The prayer for the turning of wrath is followed in <a href="/psalms/90-14.htm">Psalm 90:14</a> by the prayer for the turning towards them of favour. In &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; there lies the thought that it has been night hitherto in Israel. "Morning" is therefore the beginning of a new season of favour. In &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (to which &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; is a second accusative of the object) is implied the thought that Israel whilst under wrath has been hungering after favour; cf. the adjective &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; in the same tropical signification in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>. The supplicatory imperatives are followed by two moods expressive of intention: then will we, or: in order that we may rejoice and be glad; for futures like these set forth the intention of attaining something as a result or aim of what has been expressed just before: Ew. 325, a. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is not governed by the verbs of rejoicing (<a href="/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a>), in which case it would have been &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, but is an adverbial definition of time (<a href="/psalms/145-2.htm">Psalm 145:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>): within the term of life allotted to us. We see from <a href="/psalms/90-15.htm">Psalm 90:15</a> that the season of affliction has already lasted for a long time. The duration of the forty years of wrath, which in the midst of their course seemed to them as an eternity, is made the measure of the reviving again that is earnestly sought. The plural &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; instead of &#1497;&#1502;&#1497; is common only to our Psalm and <a href="/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>; it is not known elsewhere to Biblical Hebrew. And the poetical &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, which also occurs elsewhere, appears for the first time in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>. The meaning of &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, in which &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; hcihw is specialized after the manner of a genitive, is explained from <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>., according to which the forty years' wandering in the wilderness was designed to humble (&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;) and to prove Israel through suffering. At the close of these forty years Israel stands on the threshold of the Promise Land. To Israel all final hopes were closely united with the taking possession of this land. We learn from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a> that it is the horizon of Jacob's prophetic benediction. This Psalm too, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/90-16.htm">Psalm 90:16-17</a>, terminates in the prayer for the attainment of this goal. The psalmist has begun in <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a> his adoration with the majestic divine name &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;; in <a href="/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a> he began his prayer with the gracious divine name &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;; and now, where he mentions God for the third time, he gives to Him the twofold name, so full of faith, &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. &#1488;&#1500; used once alternates with the thrice repeated &#1506;&#1500;: salvation is not Israel's own work, but the work of Jahve; it therefore comes from above, it comes and meets Israel. It is worthy of remark that the noun &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; occurs only in Deuteronomy in the whole Tra, and that here also of the gracious rule of Jahve, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-4.htm">Psalm 32:4</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>. The church calls the work of the Lord &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; in so far as He executes it through them. This expression &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as a designation of human undertakings runs through the whole of the Book of Deuteronomy: <a href="/deuteronomy/2-7.htm">Deuteronomy 2:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-28.htm">Deuteronomy 4:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-7.htm">Deuteronomy 11:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-15.htm">Deuteronomy 16:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-9.htm">Deuteronomy 30:9</a>. In the work of the Lord the bright side of His glory unveils itself, hence it is called &#1492;&#1491;&#1512;; this too is a word not alien at least to the language of Deuteronomy, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>. Therein is made manifest &#1504;&#1506;&#1501; &#1492;, His graciousness and condescension - an expression which David has borrowed from Moses in <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>. &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1492;&#1497; are optatives. &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492; is an urgent request, imperat. obsecrantis as the old expositors say. With Waw the same thought is expressed over again (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>, &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, yea come) - a simple, childlike anadiplosis which vividly reminds us of the Book of Deuteronomy, which revolves in thoughts that are ever the same, and by that very means speaks deeply to the heart. Thus the Deuteronomic impression of this Psalm accompanies us from beginning to end, from &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; to &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;. Nor will it now be merely accidental that the fondness for comparisons, which is a peculiarity of the Book of Deuteronomy (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-13.htm">Deuteronomy 28:13</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-44.htm">Deuteronomy 28:44</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-17.htm">Deuteronomy 29:17-18</a>), is found again in this Psalm. </body></html>
