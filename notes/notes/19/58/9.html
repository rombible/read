The Hebrew literally runs, <span class= "ital">Before </span>(<span class= "ital">shall</span>)<span class= "ital"> understand your pots a bramble as </span>(or <span class= "ital">so</span>)<span class= "ital"> living as </span>(or <span class= "ital">so</span>)<span class= "ital"> heat sweeps them off. </span>The ancient versions mostly render <span class= "ital">thorns </span>instead of <span class= "ital">pots, </span>and make the simile to lie in the destruction of the bush before growing to maturity.

We may, in faith, pray against the designs of the enemies of the church. He foretells their ruin. And who knows the power of God's anger? The victories of the Just One, in his own person and that of his servants, over the enemies of man's salvation, produce a joy which springs not from revenge, but from a view of the Divine mercy, justice, and truth, shown in the redemption of the elect, the punishment of the ungodly, and the fulfilment of the promises. Whoever duly considers these things, will diligently seek the reward of righteousness, and adore the Providence which orders all thing aright in heaven and in earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before your pots can feel the thorns - The word "thorns" here - &#1488;&#1496;&#1491;  'a&#770;t&#803;a&#770;d - refers to what is called "Christ's thorn," the southern buckthorn. "Gesenius." The fire made of such thorns when dry would be quick and rapid, and water would be soon heated by it. The idea is, that what is here referred to would occur "quickly" - sooner than the most rapid and intense fire could make an impression on a kettle and its contents. The destruction of the wicked would be, as it were, instantaneous. The following quotation from Prof. Hackitt (Illustrations of Scripture, p. 135) will explain this passage: "A species of thorn, now very common near Jerusalem, bears the name of Spina Christi, or Christ's thorn. The people of the country gather these bushes and plants, and use them as fuel. As it is now, so it was of old. 'As the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool,' <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a> 'Before your pots can feel the thorns,' namely, the fire of them, 'he shall sweep them away,' <a href="/psalms/58-9.htm">Psalm 58:9</a> The figure in this case is taken from travelers in the desert, or from shepherds tenting abroad, who build a fire in the open air, where it is exposed to the wind; a sudden gust arises and sweeps away the fuel almost before it has begun to burn. 'As thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire' <a href="/isaiah/33-12.htm">Isaiah 33:12</a>. The meaning is that the wicked are worthless - their destruction shall be sudden and complete."<p>He shall take them away - The word rendered "shall take them away" means properly "to shiver, to shudder;" and it is then applied to the commotion and raging of a tempest. They shal be taken away as in a storm that makes everything shiver or tremble; <a href="/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>. It would be done "suddenly" and "entirely." A sudden storm sent by God would beat upon them, and they would be swept away in an instant.<p>Both living and in his wrath - Margin, "as living as wrath." This expression is exceedingly obscure. The Septuagint renders it, "he shall devour them as it were living - as it were in wrath." The Latin Vulgate: "He shall devour them as living, so in wrath." Prof. Alexander: "Whether raw or done." He supposes that the idea is, that God would come upon them while forming their plans; and that the illustration is derived from the act of "cooking," and that the meaning is, that God would come upon them whether those plans were matured or not - "cooked" or "raw." This seems to me to be a very forced construction, and one which it is doubtful whether the Hebrew will bear. The word rendered "living" - &#1495;&#1497;  chay - means properly "alive, living;" and then, "lively, fresh, vigorous;" and is applicable then to a plant that is living or green. It "may" be here applied to the "thorns" that had been gathered for the fire, still green or alive; and the idea "here" would be, that even while those thorns were alive and green - before they had been kindled by the fire (or while they were trying to kindle them), a sudden tempest would come and sweep them all away.<p>It is not, indeed, an uncommon occurrence in the deserts of the East, that while, in their journeyings, travelers pause to cook their food, and have gathered the fuel - thorns, or whatever may be at hand - and have placed their pot over the fire, a sudden tempest comes from the desert, and sweeps everything away. Rosenmuller in loc. Such an occurrence "may" be referred to here. The word rendered "wrath" - &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;  cha&#770;ro&#770;n - means properly "burning;" and then it is used to denote anything burning. It is applied to wrath or anger, because it seems to "burn." <a href="/numbers/25-4.htm">Numbers 25:4</a>; <a href="/numbers/32-14.htm">Numbers 32:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-18.htm">1 Samuel 28:18</a>. Here, however, it "may" be taken literally as applicable to thorns when they begin to be kindled, though still green. They are seen first as gathered and placed under the pots; then they are seen as still green - not dried up by the kindling flame; then they are seen as on fire; and, in a moment - before the pots could be affected by them - all is swept away by a sudden gust of wind. The "idea" is that of the sudden and unexpected descent of God on the wicked, frustrating their schemes even when they seemed to be well formed, and to promise complete success. This does not mean, therefore, that God would cut off and punish the wicked while "living," but it refers to the fact that their schemes would be suddenly defeated even while they supposed that all things were going on well; defeated before there was, in fact, any progress made toward the accomplishment, as the arrangements for the evening-meal would all be swept away before even the pot had begun to be warm. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. he shall take them away as with a whirlwind&#8212;literally, "blow him (them) away."<p>both living &#8230; wrath&#8212;literally, "as the living" or fresh as the heated or burning&#8212;that is, thorns&#8212;all easily blown away, so easily and quickly the wicked. The figure of the "snail" perhaps alludes to its loss of saliva when moving. Though obscure in its clauses, the general sense of the passage is clear.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/58.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.<p>10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.<p>11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous-verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.<p><a href="/psalms/58-9.htm">Psalm 58:9</a><p>"Before your pots can feel the thorns." So sudden is the overthrow of the wicked, so great a failure is their life, that they never see joy. Their pot is put upon the hook to prepare a feast of joy, and the fuel is placed beneath, but before the thorns are lit, before any heat can be brought to bear upon the pot, yea, even as soon as the fuel has touched the cooking vessel, a storm comes and sweeps all away; the pot is overturned, the fuel is scattered far and wide. Perhaps the figure may suppose the thorns, which are the fuel, to be kindled, and then the flame is so rapid that before any heat can be produced the fire is out, the meat remains raw, the man is disappointed, his work is altogether a failure. "He shall take them away as with a whirlwind." Cook, fire, pot, meat and all, disappear at once, whirled away to destruction. "Both living, and in his wrath." In the very midst of the man's life, and in the fury of his rage against the righteous, the persecutor is overwhelmed with a tornado, his designs are baffled, his contrivances defeated, and himself destroyed. The passage is difficult, but this is probably its meaning, and a very terrible one it is. The malicious wretch puts on his great seething pot, he gathers his fuel, he means to play the cannibal with the godly; but he reckons without his host, or rather without the Lord of hosts, and the unexpected tempest removes all trace of him, and his fire, and his feast, and that in a moment.<p><a href="/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a><p>"The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance." He will have no hand in meting it out, neither win he rejoice in the spirit of revenge, but his righteous soul shall acquiesce in the judgments of God, and he shall rejoice to see justice triumphant. There is nothing in Scripture of that sympathy with God's enemies which modern traitors are so fond of parading as the finest species of benevolence. We shall at the last say, "Amen," to the condemnation of the wicked, and feel no disposition to question the ways of God with the impenitent. Remember how John, the loving disciple, puts it. "And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: for true and righteous are his Judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever." "He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked." He shall triumph over them, they shall be so utterly vanquished that their overthrow shall be final and fatal, and his deliverance complete and crowning. The damnation of sinners shall not mar the happiness of saints.<p><a href="/psalms/58-11.htm">Psalm 58:11</a><p>"So that a man shall say." Every man however ignorant shall be compelled to say, "Verily," in very deed, assuredly, "there is a reward for the righteous." If nothing else be true this is. The godly are not after all forsaken and given over to their enemies; the wicked are not to have the best of it, truth and goodness are recompensed in the long run. "Verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth." All men shall be forced by the sight of the final judgment to see that there is a God, and that he is the righteous ruler of the universe. Two things will come out clearly after all - there is a God and there is a reward for the righteous. Time will remove doubts, solve difficulties, and reveal secrets; meanwhile faith's foreseeing eye discerns the truth even now, and is glad thereat. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/58.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Feel the thorns, </span> i.e. the heat of the fire kindled by the thorns put under them for that purpose; before your pots can be thoroughly heated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Take them away, </span> to wit, mine enemies; whose sudden destruction he describes under this similitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As with a whirlwind, </span> i.e. violently and irresistibly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Both living, and in his wrath, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">as living</span> (i.e. alive, as he did Korah, <span class="bld">Numbers 16</span>, the particle <span class="ital">as</span> being here not a note of similitude, but of truth or asseveration as it is <span class="bld"><a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a></span>, and oft elsewhere, as hath been noted) as in (which preposition is frequently understood) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">wrath, </span> i.e. as a man moved with great wrath destroys his enemy without mercy, and is ready to devour him alive, if it were possible; or, <span class="ital">both that which is raw</span>, (as the Hebrew word <span class="ital">chai</span> signifies, <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/13-16.htm" title="Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed to white, he shall come to the priest;">Leviticus 13:16</a> <a href="/1_samuel/2-15.htm" title="Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of you, but raw.">1 Samuel 2:15</a></span>, to wit, the raw flesh, which is supposed to be put into the pot that it may be boiled,) and <span class="ital">the burning fire</span>. There is indeed great variety of construction and interpretation of these Hebrew words, which is not strange, especially considering the conciseness of the Hebrew language, and that this is a proverbial speech; nor is it of any great importance, because it is not in any great point of faith, and because the sense of it is agreed, the only difference being about the manner and ground of the phrase. The learned reader may see more upon this place in my Latin Synopsis. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/58.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Before your pots can feel the thorns,.... Which is soon done; for as dry thorns make a great blaze, so they give a quick heat; the pots soon feel them, or the water in them soon receives heat from them. From imprecations the psalmist proceeds to prophesy, and foretells the sudden destruction of wicked men, which would be before a pot could be heated with a blaze of thorns. The Targum is, <p>"before the wicked become tender, they harden as the thorn:'' <p>that is, they never become tender, or have any tender consciences, but are hardened in sin from their infancy. Some render the words, "before your thorns grow up to a brier" or "bramble" (i); little thorns become great ones, tender thorns hard ones, as Jarchi; that is, as he interprets it, before the children of the wicked are grown up, they are destroyed; those sons of Belial, who are like to thorns thrust away, <a href="/2_samuel/23-6.htm">2 Samuel 23:6</a>. Others, as Aben Ezra, "before they understand"; that is, wise and knowing men; "that your thorns are a bramble"; or from lesser ones are become greater; and so denotes, as before, the suddenness and quickness of their destruction, as follows: <p>he, that is, God, <p>shall take them away as with a whirlwind: not to himself, as Enoch; nor to heaven, whither Elijah went up by a whirlwind; but out of the land of the living, and as with a tempest, to hell, where snares, fire, and brimstone, are rained upon them; see <a href="/job/27-20.htm">Job 27:20</a>; <p>both living, and in his wrath: when in health and full strength, and so go quick to hell; as Korah and his company alive into the earth; and all in wrath and sore displeasure: for the righteous are also taken away; but then it is from the evil to come, and to everlasting happiness; and through many tempestuous providences, which are in love, and for their good, do they enter the kingdom: and those that are alive at Christ's coming will be caught up to meet him in the air; but the wicked are taken away as in a whirlwind, alive, and in wrath. <p>(i) Tigurine version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/58.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{g}</span> Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in <i>his</i> wrath.</span><p>(g) As flesh is taken raw out of the pot before the water boils: so he desires God to destroy their enterprises before they bring them to pass.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/58.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. The general sense of the verse is clear, though the second line is extremely obscure and possibly corrupt. The first line certainly means, <span class="ital">Before your pots can feel the thorns</span> (possibly a proverbial expression), and the verb in the second line means, <span class="ital">He shall sweep them</span> (or, <span class="ital">it</span>) <span class="ital">away with a whirlwind</span>. It is another figure for the swift destruction of the wicked and their schemes, taken from the experience of travel in the desert. The travellers have lighted a fire of dry thorns or brambles under their cooking pots. It blazes up rapidly, but even so, before the pots are heated and the meat in them cooked, a sudden whirlwind sweeps away the fire and undoes their work. The fire represents the malicious will of the evildoers, the pots with the meat the plans which they are devising: but let them work never so rapidly, the whirlwind of divine judgement will annihilate their schemes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The crux of the verse is in the words rendered in A.V. <span class="ital">both living and in</span> his <span class="ital">wrath</span>. They have been supposed to refer to the thorns, <span class="ital">the green and the burning alike:</span> or to the flesh in the pot, <span class="ital">the raw flesh and the sodden alike:</span> or to the flesh and the fire, <span class="ital">the raw flesh and hot embers alike:</span> but all these interpretations break down on the fact that <span class="ital">chârôn</span>, though not a rare word, always means <span class="ital">the burning wrath of God</span>. It seems necessary either to omit the word <span class="ital">k’mô</span>, ‘as,’ before <span class="ital">chârôn</span>, or to read <span class="ital">b’inô</span>, ‘in,’ instead of it (<span class="greekheb">במו</span> for <span class="greekheb">כמו</span>). We may then render, Like raw flesh (= perhaps, <span class="ital">while the flesh is yet raw</span>), shall Wrath sweep them away with a whirlwind; or, shall He sweep them away with a whirlwind in wrath. The pronoun for <span class="ital">them</span> is in the singular, and may mean each one of the wicked, or perhaps rather <span class="ital">it</span>, the whole scheme.

Professor Cheyne translates, "Before your pots can feel the thorns, and while your flesh (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the flesh in the pots, on which you are about to feast) is still raw, the hot wrath of Jehovah shall sweep it away." The Revised Version gives the following: "Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the thorns] away with a whirlwind, the green [thorns] and the burning alike." Dr. Kay, "Before your caldrons have felt the thorn fire, even as raw flesh, even so, shall hot fury sweep him away." The general meaning seems to be that before the wicked judges can enjoy the fruits of their wickedness, the fierce wrath of God will come upon them like a tempest, and sweep both them and the produce of their villainy away (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/23-6.htm">2 Samuel 23:6, 7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/58.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this bold beginning the boldest figures follow one another rapidly; and the first of these is that of the serpent, which is kept up longer than any of the others. The verb &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (cogn. &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;) is intentionally written &#1494;&#1493;&#1512; in this instance in a neuter, not an active sense, plural &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; lar, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1496;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;. Bakius recognises a retrospective reference to this passage in <a href="/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>. In such passages Scripture bears witness to the fact, which is borne out by experience, that there are men in whom evil from childhood onwards has a truly diabolical character, i.e., a selfish character altogether incapable of love. For although hereditary sinfulness and hereditary sin (guilt) are common to all men, yet the former takes the most manifold combinations and forms; and, in fact, the inheriting of sin and the complex influence of the power of evil and of the power of grace on the propagation of the human race require that it should be so. The Gospel of John more particularly teaches such a dualism of the natures of men. &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493; (with Rebia, as in <a href="/john/18-18.htm">John 18:18</a>) is not the subject: the poison belonging to them, etc., but a clause by itself: poison is to them, they have poison; the construct state here, as in <a href="/lamentations/2-18.htm">Lamentations 2:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27</a>, does not express a relation of actual union, but only a close connection. &#1497;&#1488;&#1496;&#1468;&#1501; (with the orthophonic Dagesh which gives prominence to the Teth as the commencement of a syllable) is an optative future form, which is also employed as an indicative in the poetic style, e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>. The subject of this attributive clause, continuing the adjective, is the deaf adder, such an one, viz., as makes itself deaf; and in this respect (as in their evil serpent nature) it is a figure of the self-hardening evil-doer. Then with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; begins the more minute description of this adder. There is a difference even among serpents. They belong to the worst among them that are inaccessible to any kind of human influence. All the arts of sorcery are lost upon them. &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are the whisperers of magic formulae (cf. Arabic naffatha&#770;t, adjurations), and &#1495;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512; &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is one who works binding by spells, exorcism, and tying fast by magic knots (cf. &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;, to bind  equals  to bewitch, cf. Arab. &#8219;qqd, &#8219;nn, Persic bend  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, vid., Isaiah, i. 118, ii. 242). The most inventive affection and the most untiring patience cannot change their mind. Nothing therefore remains to David but to hope for their removal, and to pray for it. </body></html>
