The victories of the Just One, in his own person and that of his servants, over the enemies of man's salvation, produce a joy which springs not from revenge, but from a view of the Divine mercy, justice, and truth, shown in the redemption of the elect, the punishment of the ungodly, and the fulfilment of the promises.

The word rendered "young lions" here does not refer to mere whelps, but to full-grown though young lions in their vigor and strength, as contrasted with old lions, or those which are enfeebled by age. The meaning is, that his enemies were of the most fierce and violent kind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

If they have no capacity for good, at least deprive them of their ability for evil. Treat them as the snake-charmers do their serpents, extract their fangs, break their teeth. The Lord can do this, and he will. He will not suffer the malice of the wicked to triumph, he will deal them such a blow as shall disable them from mischief. "Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Lord." As if one brute creature had not enough of evil in it to complete the emblem of ungodly nature, another specimen of ferae naturae is fetched in. For fierce cruelty the wicked are likened to young lions, monsters in the prime of their vigour, and the fury of their lustiness; and It is asked that their grinders may be smashed in, broken off, or dashed out, that the creatures may henceforth be harmless. One can well understand how the banished son of Jesse, while poisoned by the venomous slander of his foes, and wowed by their cruel power, should appeal to heaven for a speedy and complete riddance from his enemies.<p><a href="/psalms/58-7.htm">Psalm 58:7</a><p>"Let them melt away as waters which run continually." Like mountain torrents dried up by the summer heats let them disappear; or like running streams whose waters are swiftly gone, so let them pass away; or like water spilt which none can find again, so let them vanish out of existence. Be gone, ye foul streams, the sooner ye are forgotten the better for the universe. "When he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces." When the Lord goes forth to war, let his judgments so tell upon these persecutors that they may be utterly cut in pieces as a mark shattered by many shafts. Or perhaps the meaning is, when the ungodly man marches to the conflict, let his arrows and his bow drop into fragments, the string cut, the bow snapped, the arrows headless, the points blunted; so that the boastful warrior may not have wherewithal to hurt the object of his enmity. In either sense the prayer of the Psalm has often become fact, and will be again fulfilled as often as need arises.<p><a href="/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a><p>"As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away" As the snail makes its own way by its slime, and so dissolves as it goes, or as its shell is often found empty, as though the inhabitant had melted away, so shall the malicious eat out their own strength while they proceed upon their malevolent designs, and shall themselves disappear. To destroy himself by envy and chagrin is the portion of the ill-disposed. "Like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun." Solemn is this curse, but how surely does it fall on many graceless wretches! They are as if they had never been. Their character is shapeless, hideous, revolting. They are fitter to be hidden away in an unknown grave than to be reckoned among men. Their life comes never to ripeness, their aims are abortive, their only achievement is to have brought misery to others, and horror to themselves. Such men as Herod, Judas, Alva, Bonner, had it not been better for them if they had never been born? Better for the mothers who bore them? Better for the lands they cursed? Better for the earth in which their putrid carcasses are hidden from the sun? Every unregenerate man is an abortion. He misses the true form of God-made manhood; he corrupts in the darkness of sin; he never sees or shall see the light of God in purity, in heaven. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/58.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Their teeth; </span> their power and instruments of doing mischief.

From the description of the wicked, the psalmist passes to imprecations on his enemies; whom he represents as cruel and bloodthirsty, and as being stronger than he; and therefore he applies to God, who could, as he sometimes did, smite his enemies on the cheekbone, and break the teeth of the ungodly; which is done by taking the power and instruments of hurting from them: and it may be by "their teeth in their mouth" may be meant their malicious words, calumnies, and detractions; teeth being the instrument of speech; and by "breaking" them, preventing the mischief designed by them; <p>break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Lord: Saul was the old lion; his princes, nobles, and courtiers, the young ones; whose jaw teeth were as knives to devour David and his men, unless plucked out; or God in his providence should interpose, and hinder the performance of their mischievous and cruel designs; and who could easily destroy them by his blast, and by the breath of his nostrils, <a href="/job/4-9.htm">Job 4:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/58.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Break their <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.</span><p>(e) Take away all opportunity and means by which they hurt.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/58.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

The perfect in <a href="/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a> is the perfect of certainty; the other perfects state what preceded and is now changed into the destruction of the crafty ones themselves. If the clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1507; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is rendered: my soul was bowed down (cf. &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/109-22.htm">Psalm 109:22</a>), it forms no appropriate corollary to the crafty laying of snares. Hence kpp must be taken as transitive: he had bowed down my soul; the change of number in the mention of the enemies is very common in the Psalms relating to these trials, whether it be that the poet has one enemy &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; before his mind or comprehends them all in one.

This line is still remarkable; one would expect for <a href="/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a> a thought parallel with <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a>, and perhaps the poet wrote &#1499;&#1508;&#1507; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, his (the net-layer's) own soul bends (viz., in order to fall into the net). Then &#1499;&#1508;&#1507; like &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; would be praet. confidentiae. In this certainty, to express which the music here becomes triumphantly forte, David's heart is confident, cheerful (Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;), and a powerful inward impulse urges him to song and harp. Although &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; may signify ready, equipped (<a href="/exodus/34-2.htm">Exodus 34:2</a>; <a href="/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>), yet this meaning is to be rejected here in view of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-12.htm">Psalm 51:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-37.htm">Psalm 78:37</a>, <a href="/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7</a> : it is not appropriate to the emphatic repetition of the word. His evening mood which found expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>, was hope of victory; the morning mood into which David here transports himself, is certainty of victory. He calls upon his soul to awake (&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; as in <a href="/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/30-13.htm">Psalm 30:13</a>), he calls upon harp and cithern to awake (&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; &#1493;&#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; with one article that avails for both words, as in <a href="/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>; and &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; with the accent on the ultima on account of the coming together of two aspirates), from which he has not parted even though a fugitive; with the music of stringed instruments and with song he will awake the not yet risen dawn, the sun still slumbering in its chamber: &#1488;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, expergefaciam (not expergiscar), as e.g., in Sol 2:7, and as Ovid (Metam. xi. 597) says of the cock, evocat auroram.<p>(Note: With reference to the above passage in the Psalms, the Talmud, B. Berachoth 3b, says, "A cithern used to hang above David's bed; and when midnight came, the north wind blew among the strings, so that they sounded of themselves; and forthwith he arose and busied himself with the Tra until the pillar of the dawn (&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;) ascended." Rashi observes, "The dawn awakes the other kings; but I, said David, will awake the dawn (&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;).")<p>His song of praise, however, shall not resound in a narrow space where it is scarcely heard; he will step forth as the evangelist of his deliverance and of his Deliverer in the world of nations (&#1489;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;; and the parallel word, as also in <a href="/psalms/108-4.htm">Psalm 108:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/149-7.htm">Psalm 149:7</a>, is to be written &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; with Lamed raphatum and Metheg before it); his vocation extends beyond Israel, and the events of his life are to be for the benefit of mankind. Here we perceive the self-consciousness of a comprehensive mission, which accompanied David from the beginning to the end of his royal career (vid., <a href="/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>). What is expressed in v. 11 is both motive and theme of the discourse among the peoples, viz., God's mercy and truth which soar high as the heavens (<a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>). That they extend even to the heavens is only an earthly conception of their infinity (cf. <a href="/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>). In the refrain, v. 12, which only differs in one letter from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-6.htm">Psalm 57:6</a>, the Psalm comes back to the language of prayer. Heaven and earth have a mutually involved history, and the blessed, glorious end of this history is the sunrise of the divine doxa over both, here prayed for. </body></html>
