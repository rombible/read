We are complete in him. The man that walks in his integrity, yet trusting wholly in the grace of God, is in a state of acceptance, according to the covenant of which Jesus was the Mediator, in virtue of his spotless obedience even unto death. This man desires to have his inmost soul searched and proved by the Lord. He is aware of the deceitfulness of his own heart; he desires to detect and mortify every sin; and he longs to be satisfied of his being a true believer, and to practise the holy commands of God. Great care to avoid bad company, is both a good evidence of our integrity, and a good means to keep us in it. Hypocrites and dissemblers may be found attending on God's ordinances; but it is a good sign of sincerity, if we attend upon them, as the psalmist here tells us he did, in the exercise of repentance and conscientious obedience. He feels his ground firm under him; and, as he delights in blessing the Lord with his congregations on earth, he trusts that shortly he shall join the great assembly in heaven, in singing praises to God and to the Lamb for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But as for me - The Hebrew is, "and I." But there is evidently a contrast between what he purposed to do, and the course of life pursued by those to whom he had just referred; and this is correctly expressed in our translation, "But as for me." It is a statement of his profession of piety, and of his purpose to lead a religious life. He "meant" - he solemnly "purposed" - to lead a holy life.<p>I will walk - I will live a life of integrity. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>.<p>In mine integrity - Hebrew, in my "perfection." See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>, note. The idea is that he intended to live a life of uprightness.<p>Redeem me - From sin; from trouble; from death. The word "redeem" here implies that he did not claim to be "perfect" in the most absolute sense, even when he expressed his purpose to lead a life of integrity. He felt still that he was a sinner, and that he was dependent on redeeming mercy for salvation. On the word "redeem," see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/25-22.htm">Psalm 25:22</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-22.htm">Isaiah 29:22</a>, note. Compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>.<p>And be merciful to me - In connection with redemption. The prayer for mercy is always an acknowledgment of guilt, and the plea here shows that with all his purposes of holy living, and notwithstanding all that he had referred to in the psalm as evidence of uprightness of intention and integrity of life, he still felt that he was a sinner, and that his only hope was in the mercy of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11, 12.

He is a Nonconformist, and is ready to stand alone in his Nonconformity. Like a live fish, he swims against the stream. Trusting in God the Psalmist resolves that the plain way of righteousness shall be his choice, and those who will, may prefer the tortuous paths of violence and deceit. Yet he is by no means a boaster, or a self-righteous vaunter of his own strength, for he cries for redemption and pleads for mercy. Our integrity is not absolute nor inherent it is a work of grace in us and is marred by human infirmity; we must, therefore, resort to the redeeming blood and the throne of mercy, confessing that though we are saints strong men, we must still bow as sinners before God. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity,.... In which he had hitherto walked, <a href="/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1</a>; or it may express his faith, that after he was gathered by death he should walk in uprightness and righteousness, in purity and perfection, with Christ in white, and behold the face of God in righteousness; see <a href="/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>; <p>redeem me; from the vain conversation of the wicked, from all troubles, and out of the hands of all enemies; <p>and be merciful unto me; who was now in distress, being persecuted by Saul, and at a distance from the house of God: this shows that mercy is the source and spring of redemption, both temporal and spiritual; and that the psalmist did not trust in and depend upon his present upright walk and conversation, but in redemption by Christ, and upon the mercy of God in Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. With such evil-doers the Psalmist contrasts himself. His purpose, if his life is spared, is to shape his conduct as hitherto; and therefore he prays <span class="ital">redeem me</span> (<a href="/psalms/25-22.htm" title="Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.">Psalm 25:22</a>), deliver me from the fate of the wicked, <span class="ital">and be gracious unto me</span> (<a href="/psalms/4-1.htm" title="Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: you have enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.">Psalm 4:1</a>, note).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will continue to walk as I have walked hitherto (see ver. 1) - I will be "integer vitae scelerisque purus"  - a brave and good resolve. Had he but kept to it! <span class="cmt_word">Redeem me, and be merciful unto me</span> (compare the comment on ver. 1). Though hitherto he has walked innocently, and is resolved still to continue to walk innocently; he nevertheless feels that he has need of redeeming mercy. Though he "knows nothing by himself, yet he is not thereby justified" (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>). Many, doubtless, are his "secret sins," which God has "set in the light of his countenance" (<a href="/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He still further bases his petition upon his comportment towards the men of this world; how he has always observed a certain line of conduct and continues still to keep to it.
