We are complete in him. The man that walks in his integrity, yet trusting wholly in the grace of God, is in a state of acceptance, according to the covenant of which Jesus was the Mediator, in virtue of his spotless obedience even unto death. This man desires to have his inmost soul searched and proved by the Lord. He is aware of the deceitfulness of his own heart; he desires to detect and mortify every sin; and he longs to be satisfied of his being a true believer, and to practise the holy commands of God. Great care to avoid bad company, is both a good evidence of our integrity, and a good means to keep us in it. Hypocrites and dissemblers may be found attending on God's ordinances; but it is a good sign of sincerity, if we attend upon them, as the psalmist here tells us he did, in the exercise of repentance and conscientious obedience. He feels his ground firm under him; and, as he delights in blessing the Lord with his congregations on earth, he trusts that shortly he shall join the great assembly in heaven, in singing praises to God and to the Lamb for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house - I have loved to dwell in Thy house. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>. The psalmist often refers to his delight in the house of God - the place of public worship; his love to be there united with the people of God in the solemn services of religion. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/84-1.htm">Psalm 84:1-2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/84-4.htm">Psalm 84:4</a>,<a href="/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>.<p>And the place where thine honour dwelleth - Margin, "the tabernacle of thine honor." This might indeed refer to the tabernacle; and the idea might be that he loved the place where that rested in its wanderings. But the more correct meaning is, that he loved the place where the "glory" of God - the Shekinah - the symbol of His presence - rested; that is, the place where God was pleased to manifest Himself, and where He dwelt. Wherever that was, he found pleasure in being there; and that he did thus love the place where God manifested Himself, was to his own mind an evidence of true piety. It is always an evidence of piety, for there can be no true religion where the soul does not find pleasure in the worship of God. A person who does not delight in such a service here, is not prepared for heaven, where God eternally dwells. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. the habitation of thy house&#8212;where Thy house rests, as the tabernacle was not yet permanently fixed.<p>honour dwelleth&#8212;conveys an allusion to the Holy of Holies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The habitation of thy house, </span> i.e. thy sanctuary and worship; which is an evidence of my piety to thee, as I have given many proofs of my justice and integrity towards men.

Meaning the tabernacle, for as yet the temple was not built; which was an habitation for the saints, where they chose to dwell, and reckoned it their happiness, and was the habitation of the Lord himself: the sanctuary was built for that purpose; and between the cherubim, over the mercy seat, he took up his residence; hence it follows, <p>and the place where thine honour dwelleth: or "glory" (a): when the tabernacle was set up, the glory of the Lord filled it, as it did the temple, when it was dedicated, <a href="/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>. The psalmist expresses his love to this place, in opposition to the, congregation of evildoers, which he hated, <a href="/psalms/26-5.htm">Psalm 26:5</a>; and to remove a calumny from him, that being among the Philistines, and at a distance from the house of God, his affections were alienated from it; whereas it was his greatest concern that he was debarred the privileges of it; see <a href="/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>; besides, he had showed his great regard to it by his constant attendance before his exile, as he did after it, <a href="/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>; and it was out of pure love to the worship of God, and with real pleasure and delight, that he did attend; and not through custom, and in mere form, <a href="/psalms/122-1.htm">Psalm 122:1</a>.
