We are complete in him. The man that walks in his integrity, yet trusting wholly in the grace of God, is in a state of acceptance, according to the covenant of which Jesus was the Mediator, in virtue of his spotless obedience even unto death. This man desires to have his inmost soul searched and proved by the Lord. He is aware of the deceitfulness of his own heart; he desires to detect and mortify every sin; and he longs to be satisfied of his being a true believer, and to practise the holy commands of God. Great care to avoid bad company, is both a good evidence of our integrity, and a good means to keep us in it. Hypocrites and dissemblers may be found attending on God's ordinances; but it is a good sign of sincerity, if we attend upon them, as the psalmist here tells us he did, in the exercise of repentance and conscientious obedience. He feels his ground firm under him; and, as he delights in blessing the Lord with his congregations on earth, he trusts that shortly he shall join the great assembly in heaven, in singing praises to God and to the Lamb for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Examine me, O Lord - The meaning of this verse is, that he asked of God a strict and rigid examination of his case. To express this, the psalmist uses three words - "examine; prove; try." These words are designed to include the modes in which the reality of anything is tested, and they imply together that he wished the most "thorough" investigation to be made; he did not shrink from any test. He evidently felt that it was essential to his welfare that the most rigid examination should be made; that the exact truth should be known; that if he was deceived, it was best for himself that he should not be left under the delusion, but that, understanding his own case, he might be led to secure his salvation. The word rendered "examine" means, "to try, to prove," and is applicable especially to metals: <a href="/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>; <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>. It means here, "Apply to me such tests as are applied to metals in order to determine their genuineness and their value."<p>And prove me - A word of similar import. In the original meaning of the word there is a reference to "smell;" to try by the smell; to ascertain the qualities of an object by the smell. Hence, it comes to be used in a more general sense to denote any way of ascertaining the quality of an object.<p>Try my reins - The word here rendered "try" (test) is one that is most commonly applied to metals; and the three words together express the earnest desire of the psalmist that God would examine into the evidences of his piety - those evidences to which he immediately refers - and apply the proper kind of tests to determine whether that piety was genuine. The word rendered "reins" means properly the "kidneys," and hence, it is used to denote the inward part, the mind, the soul - the seat of the desires and the affections. See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-7.htm">Psalm 16:7</a>, note. We speak now of the "heart" as the seat of the affections or of love. The Hebrews more commonly spoke of the heart as the seat of intelligence or knowledge, and the reins or the "bowels" as the seat of the affections. In itself there was no more impropriety in their speaking of the reins or kidneys as the seat of the affections than there is of our speaking of the heart in that manner. Neither of them is strictly correct; and both modes of speech are founded on popular usage. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

This prayer attests at once the clearness of his conscience, and his desire that if aught of evil remains, it may be purged away. Cp. <a href="/context/psalms/139-23.htm" title="Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:...">Psalm 139:23-24</a>.

So God ‘proved’ Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said to him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.">Genesis 22:1</a>); and Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm" title="And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God led you these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, and to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or no.">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-16.htm" title="Who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers knew not, that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end;">Deuteronomy 8:16</a>). The purpose of such heart-searching is ‘to give every man according to his ways’ (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm" title="I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.">Jeremiah 17:10</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my reins and my heart</span>] The reins are the seat of the affections, the heart of thought and will.
