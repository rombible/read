He earnestly prays for comfort. He assures himself of an answer of peace. - God sometimes hides his face, and leaves his own children in the dark concerning their interest in him: and this they lay to heart more than any outward trouble whatever. But anxious cares are heavy burdens with which believers often load themselves more than they need. The bread of sorrows is sometimes the saint's daily bread; our Master himself was a man of sorrows. It is a common temptation, when trouble lasts long, to think that it will last always. Those who have long been without joy, begin to be without hope. We should never allow ourselves to make any complaints but what drive us to our knees. Nothing is more killing to a soul than the want of God's favour; nothing more reviving than the return of it. The sudden, delightful changes in the book of Psalms, are often very remarkable. We pass from depth of despondency to the height of religious confidence and joy. It is thus, ver. 5. All is gloomy dejection in ver. 4; but here the mind of the despondent worshipper rises above all its distressing fears, and throws itself, without reserve, on the mercy and care of its Divine Redeemer. See the power of faith, and how good it is to draw near to God. If we bring our cares and griefs to the throne of grace, and leave them there, we may go away like Hannah, and our countenances will be no more said, 1Sa 1:18. God's mercy is the support of the psalmist's faith. Finding I have that to trust to, I am comforted, though I have no merit of my own. His faith in God's mercy filled his heart with joy in his salvation; for joy and peace come by believing. He has dealt bountifully with me. By faith he was as confident of salvation, as if it had been completed already. In this way believers pour out their prayers, renouncing all hopes but in the mercy of God through the Saviour's blood: and sometimes suddenly, at others gradually, they will find their burdens removed, and their comforts restored; they then allow that their fears and complaints were unnecessary, and acknowledge that the Lord hath dealt bountifully with them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me - The word which is here rendered "dealt bountifully" - &#1490;&#1502;&#1500;  ga&#770;mal - means properly "to deal" with anyone; to "treat" anyone well or ill; and then, to requite, or recompense. When used absolutely, as it is here, it is commonly employed in a good sense, meaning to deal favorably, or kindly, toward anyone; to treat anyone with favor. It means here that God had shown him kindness or favor, and had thus laid the foundation for gratitude and praise. The psalm closes, therefore, with expressions of joy, thankfulness, triumph. Though it begins with depression and sadness, it ends with joy. This is often observable in the Psalms. In the commencement it often occurs that the mind is overwhelmed with sorrow, and there is earnest pleading with God. Light, under the influence of prayer, breaks in gradually upon the soul. The clouds disperse; the darkness disappears. New views of the goodness and mercy of God are imparted; an assurance of his favor is brought to the soul; confidence in his mercy springs up in the heart; and the psalm that began with sorrowful complaining ends with the language of praise and of joy. So, too, it is in our own experience. Afflicted, depressed, and sad, we go to God. Everything seems dark. We have no peace - no clear and cheerful views - no joy. As we wait upon God, new views of his character, his mercy, his love, break upon the mind. The clouds open. Light beams upon us. Our souls take hold of the promises of God, and we, who went to His throne sad and desponding, rise from our devotions filled with praise and joy, submissive to the trials which made us so sad, and rejoicing in the belief that all things will work together for our good. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

The suffix eem in <a href="/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a> refers to the miserable and poor; the suffix ennu in <a href="/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a> (him, not: us, which would be pointed &#1514;&#1510;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, and more especially since it is not preceded by &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;) refers back to the man who yearns for deliverance mentioned in the divine utterance, <a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>. The "preserving for ever" is so constant, that neither now nor at any future time will they succumb to this generation. The oppression shall not become a thorough depression, the trial shall not exceed their power of endurance. What follows in <a href="/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a> is a more minute description of this depraved generation. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is the generation whole and entire bearing one general character and doing homage to the one spirit of the age (cf. e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11-14</a>, where the characteristics of a corrupt age are portrayed). &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; (always without the article, Ew. 293, a) points to the present and the character is has assumed, which is again described here finally in a few outlines of a more general kind than in <a href="/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a>. The wicked march about on every side (&#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; used of going about unopposed with an arrogant and vaunting mien), when (while) vileness among ()&#1500; the children of men rises to eminence (&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/11-11.htm">Proverbs 11:11</a>, cf. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; <a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>), so that they come to be under its dominion. Vileness is called &#1494;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; from &#1494;&#1500;&#1500; (cogn. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;) to be supple and lax, narrow, low, weak and worthless. The form is passive just as is the Talm. &#1494;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (from &#1494;&#1497;&#1500;  equals  &#1494;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;), and it is the epithet applied to that which is depreciated, despised, and to be despised; here it is the opposite of the disposition and conduct of the noble man, &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-8.htm">Isaiah 32:8</a>, - a baseness which is utterly devoid not only of all nobler principles and motives, but also of all nobler feelings and impulses. The &#1499;&#1468; of &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; is not the expression of simultaneousness (as e.g., in <a href="/proverbs/10-25.htm">Proverbs 10:25</a>): immediately it is exalted - for then <a href="/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a> would give expression to a general observation, instead of being descriptive - but &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; is equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, only it is intentionally used instead of the latter, to express a coincidence that is based upon an intimate relation of cause and effect, and is not merely accidental. The wicked are puffed up on all sides, and encompass the better disposed on every side as their enemies. Such is the state of things, and it cannot be otherwise at a time when men allow meanness to gain the ascendency among and over them, as is the case at the present moment. Thus even at last the depressing view of the present prevails in the midst of the confession of a more consolatory hope. The present is gloomy. But in the central hexastich the future is lighted up as a consolation against this gloominess. The Psalm is a ring and this central oracle is its jewel. </body></html>
