He earnestly prays for comfort. He assures himself of an answer of peace. - God sometimes hides his face, and leaves his own children in the dark concerning their interest in him: and this they lay to heart more than any outward trouble whatever. But anxious cares are heavy burdens with which believers often load themselves more than they need. The bread of sorrows is sometimes the saint's daily bread; our Master himself was a man of sorrows. It is a common temptation, when trouble lasts long, to think that it will last always. Those who have long been without joy, begin to be without hope. We should never allow ourselves to make any complaints but what drive us to our knees. Nothing is more killing to a soul than the want of God's favour; nothing more reviving than the return of it. The sudden, delightful changes in the book of Psalms, are often very remarkable. We pass from depth of despondency to the height of religious confidence and joy. It is thus, ver. 5. All is gloomy dejection in ver. 4; but here the mind of the despondent worshipper rises above all its distressing fears, and throws itself, without reserve, on the mercy and care of its Divine Redeemer. See the power of faith, and how good it is to draw near to God. If we bring our cares and griefs to the throne of grace, and leave them there, we may go away like Hannah, and our countenances will be no more said, 1Sa 1:18. God's mercy is the support of the psalmist's faith. Finding I have that to trust to, I am comforted, though I have no merit of my own. His faith in God's mercy filled his heart with joy in his salvation; for joy and peace come by believing. He has dealt bountifully with me. By faith he was as confident of salvation, as if it had been completed already. In this way believers pour out their prayers, renouncing all hopes but in the mercy of God through the Saviour's blood: and sometimes suddenly, at others gradually, they will find their burdens removed, and their comforts restored; they then allow that their fears and complaints were unnecessary, and acknowledge that the Lord hath dealt bountifully with them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him - I have overpowered him; I have conquered him.

Hitherto he had been able to hold out against them; now he began to despair, and to fear that they would accomplish their object by overcoming and subduing him.

The two &#1502;&#1503; in <a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a> denote the motive, &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; the decisive turning-point from forebearance to the execution of judgment, and &#1497;&#1502;&#1512; the divine determination, which has just now made itself audible; cf. Isaiah's echo of it, <a href="/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>. Jahve has hitherto looked on with seeming inactivity and indifference, now He will arise and place in &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, i.e., a condition of safety (cf. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; <a href="/psalms/66-9.htm">Psalm 66:9</a>), him who languishes for deliverance. It is not to be explained: him whom he, i.e., the boaster, blows upon, which would be expressed by &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, cf. <a href="/psalms/10-5.htm">Psalm 10:5</a>; but, with Ewald, Hengstenberg, Olshausen, and Bttcher, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, where &#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495; &#1500; occurs in the sense of panting after an object: him who longs for it. &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495; is, however, not a participial adjective  equals  &#1497;&#1508;&#1495;, but the fut., and &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495; &#1500;&#1493; is therefore a relative clause occupying the place of the object, just as we find the same thing occurring in <a href="/job/24-19.htm">Job 24:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>, and frequently. Hupfeld's rendering: "in order that he may gain breath (respiret)" leaves &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; without an object, and accords more with Aramaic and Arabic than with Hebrew usage, which would express this idea by &#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1500;&#1493; or &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1495; &#1500;&#1493;.<p>In <a href="/psalms/12-7.htm">Psalm 12:7</a> the announcement of Jahve is followed by its echo in the heart of the seer: the words (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; instead of &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; by changing the Sheb which closes the syllable into an audible one, as e.g., in &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;) of Jahve are pure words, i.e., intended, and to be fulfilled, absolutely as they run without any admixture whatever of untruthfulness. The poetical &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; (after the form &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;) serves pre-eminently as the designation of the divine power-words of promise. The figure, which is indicated in other instances, when God's word is said to be &#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492; (<a href="/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-140.htm">Psalm 119:140</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>), is here worked out: silver melted and thus purified &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; signifies either a smelting-pot from &#1506;&#1500;&#1500;, Arab. gll, immittere, whence also &#1506;&#1500; (Hitz.); or, what is more probable since the language has the epithets &#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1507; for this: a workshop, from &#1506;&#1500;&#1500;, Arab. &#8219;ll, operari (prop. to set about a thing), first that which is wrought at (after the form &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1500;), then the place where the work is carried on. From this also comes the Talm. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; manifeste, occurring in the Mishna Rosh ha-Shana 1. 5 and elsewhere, and which in its first meaning corresponds to the French en effet.<p>(Note: On this word with reference to this passage of the Psalm vid., Steinschneider's Hebr. Bibliographie 1861, S. 83.)<p>According to this, the &#1500; in &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is not the &#1500; of property: in a fining-pot built into the earth, for which &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; without anything further would be an inadequate and colourless expression. But in accordance with the usual meaning of &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; as a collateral definition it is: smelted (purified) down to the earth. As Olshausen observes on this subject, "Silver that is purified in the furnace and flows down to the ground can be seen in every smelting hut; the pure liquid silver flows down out of the smelting furnace, in which the ore is piled up." For it cannot be &#1500; of reference: "purified with respect to the earth," since &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; does not denote the earth as a material and cannot therefore mean an earthy element. We ought then to read &#1500;&#1488;&#1489;&#1509;, which would not mean "to a white brilliancy," i.e., to a pure bright mass (Bttch.), but "with respect to the stannum, lead" (vid., on <a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>). The verb &#1494;&#1511;&#1511; to strain, filter, cause to ooze through, corresponds to the German seihen, seigen, old High German sihan, Greek &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; (&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), to clean by passing through a cloth as a strainer, &#1513;&#1474;&#1511;. God's word is solid silver smelted and leaving all impurity behind, and, as it were, having passed seven times through the smelting furnace, i.e., the purest silver, entirely purged from dross. Silver is the emblem of everything precious and pure (vid., Bhr, Symbol. i. 284); and seven is the number indicating the completion of any process (Bibl. Psychol. S. 57, transl. p. 71). </body></html>
