If Saul and his evil counsellors be intended in this clause, probably the heathen, to whom David was now driven for refuge, were meant in the next. They were <span class="ital">workers of iniquity </span>in the worst sense, being worshippers of idols, and their idols were always snares to the Israelites, as their history informs us, and as they were forewarned by God himself, <a href="/judges/2-3.htm" title="Why I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.">Jdg 2:3</a>. <span class="ital">Their gods will be a snare unto you, </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">מוקשׁ</span>, the same word with that translated, in the plural number, <span class="ital">gins, </span>in this verse. <span class="ital">Let the wicked fall — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">יפלו</span>, they <span class="ital">shall fall; into their own nets — </span>Into the snares, dangers, and mischiefs which they design for me. <span class="ital">While that I withal escape — </span>Namely, <span class="ital">together </span>with my followers, or, <span class="ital">in like manner, </span>as I have formerly done.

Which was verified by the event. For David escaped all the snares which were laid for him on every side; and was strangely kept out of harm’s way, when Saul and other of David’s enemies were cut off by the Philistines, 1 Samuel 31. So will the devices of the enemies of God’s people be in the end turned against themselves. They shall fall and perish, but the saved of the Lord shall triumph with their Redeemer to eternity.

It shall not break my head, if it may but help to break my heart: we must show that we take it kindly. Those who slighted the word of God before, will be glad of it when in affliction, for that opens the ear to instruction. When the world is bitter, the word is sweet. Let us lift our prayer unto God. Let us entreat him to rescue us from the snares of Satan, and of all the workers of iniquity. In language like this psalm, O Lord, would we entreat that our poor prayers should set forth our only hope, our only dependence on thee.
