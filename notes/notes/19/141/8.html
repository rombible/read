This verse, says Mr. Peters, shows us what was David’s support under his extraordinary trials: it was a firm trust in God, as the great Lord and Ruler of the world: and a steady resolution to obey him in all things. “Among the sayings of Pythagoras this was one, <span class="greekheb">απλωσον σεαυτον</span>, <span class="ital">simplify thyself, </span>that is, ‘reduce thy conduct, if possible, to one single aim, and pursue it without weariness, or distraction.’ If this single aim be, to approve ourselves to God by such a course of life as he prescribes; to adhere strictly to our duty, with an eye to him who has commanded it, and patiently submit the issue of things to his all-wise and gracious providence; we have then hit upon that principle which here appears to have animated David, and may, with confidence, address our prayers to the great Lord and Sovereign of the world in all our straits and difficulties, as he does in the following part of the Psalm.” <span class="ital">Leave not my soul destitute — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">make not my soul naked: </span>deprive it not of thy favour and protection: or, <span class="ital">do not pour out my soul, </span>namely, unto death, as the same word, <span class="greekheb">ערה</span>, is used, <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>. In the language of the Holy Scriptures, God is said to do what he only permits or suffers to be done. But whether David here prays to have his life preserved from danger, or his soul from sin, may admit of a question. The words will suit with either explanation, and probably he might intend both; but chiefly the latter. We have seen, from <a href="/psalms/141-4.htm" title="Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.">Psalm 141:4</a>, how earnestly he begs that God would protect him by his grace from complying with the idolatrous practices of the heathen, to whom he was about to flee for refuge; and it is remarkable that, in his last speech to Saul, he particularly dwells upon the danger to which his religion was exposed, <a href="/1_samuel/26-19.htm" title="Now therefore, I pray you, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.">1 Samuel 26:19</a>. <span class="ital">They have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go serve other gods. </span>As if he had said, “They have done what lies in their power to drive me to idolatry, by forcing me into a country where I shall have the strongest temptations to it.” This was a thing he seems to have dreaded more than death; and therefore he prays against it in the next verse.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/141.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>141:5-10 We should be ready to welcome the rebuke of our heavenly Father, and also the reproof of our brethren. It shall not break my head, if it may but help to break my heart: we must show that we take it kindly. Those who slighted the word of God before, will be glad of it when in affliction, for that opens the ear to instruction. When the world is bitter, the word is sweet. Let us lift our prayer unto God. Let us entreat him to rescue us from the snares of Satan, and of all the workers of iniquity. In language like this psalm, O Lord, would we entreat that our poor prayers should set forth our only hope, our only dependence on thee. Grant us thy grace, that we may be prepared for this employment, being clothed with thy righteousness, and having all the gifts of thy Spirit planted in our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/141.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord - My hope is in thee.

I believe that he "will" interpose; and now that my enemy has placed himself in this position, I do not need to resort to stealthful arts - to dishonorable acts - to assassination - as my friends advise, but the object will be accomplished, and I shall be placed on the throne by the act of God, and in a manner that will not subject my name and memory to reproach by a base and treacherous deed.<p>In thee is my trust - I rely on thee alone.<p>Leave not my soul destitute - My life; my all.

Expositors say that this in both instances is the comparatio decurtata, as in <a href="/psalms/11-1.htm">Psalm 11:1</a> and elsewhere: as an incense-offering, as an evening mincha. But the poet purposely omits the &#1499;&#1468; of the comparison.
