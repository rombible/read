We must hope in the providence of God for all we need as to this life, and in the grace of God for that which is to come. The God of heaven became a man that he might become our salvation. Though he died on the cross for our sins, and was laid in the grave, yet his thoughts of love to us did not perish; he rose again to fulfil them. When on earth, his miracles were examples of what he is still doing every day. He grants deliverance to captives bound in the chains of sin and Satan. He opens the eyes of the understanding. He feeds with the bread of life those who hunger for salvation; and he is the constant Friend of the poor in spirit, the helpless: with him poor sinners, that are as fatherless, find mercy; and his kingdom shall continue for ever. Then let sinners flee to him, and believers rejoice in him.

The Messiah, who is King of kings and Lord of lords; and in this he is superior to, them, they reign but for a while, but he for evermore; the throne of majesty and glory on which he sits is for ever and ever; his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom; of his government, and the peace of it, there will be no end; he is King of saints now, and reigns in their hearts, and in his churches, and in the world; and he will reign with his people, and they with him, a thousand years on earth; and then they will reign together to all eternity; see <a href="/psalms/14-6.htm">Psalm 14:6</a>. Both Jarchi and Kimchi refer this to the Messiah and his kingdom; the note of the former is, <p>"he shall confirm his kingdom in the redemption or salvation of his children;'' <p>and of the latter, <p>"it shall be said he is King over all, after he has executed judgment on the wicked in the valley of Jehoshaphat;'' <p>even thy God, O Zion, unto, all generations; he who is Zion's God is Zion's King, head over all things to the church; and this is her joy and comfort in every age, that her God and her King reigns, and will reign for evermore; and especially in a glorious manner in the latter day; see <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; and as all this is a solid ground and foundation of truth in the Lord, and serves to encourage saints to make him their help and hope; and shows how happy they are that have him as such; so it is matter of praise and thanksgiving: hence it follows, <p>praise ye the Lord; or "hallelujah"; and so the psalm ends as it began. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/146.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD shall <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> reign for ever, <i>even</i> thy God, O Zion, unto all generations.

When he attunes his sole to the praise of God, he puts himself personally into this mood of mind, and therefore goes on to say "I will praise." He will, however, not only praise God in the song which he is beginning, but &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; (vid., on <a href="/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>), fillling up his life with it, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; (prop. "in my yet-being," with the suffix of the noun, whereas &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; with the verbal suffix is "I still am"), so that his continued life is also a constant continued praising, viz., (and this is in the mind of the poet here, even at the commencment of the Psalm) of the God and Kings who, as being the Almighty, Eternal, and unchangeably Faithful One, is the true ground of confidence. The warning against putting trust in princes calls to mind <a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8</a>. The clause: the son of man, who has no help that he could afford, is to be understood according to <a href="/psalms/60-13.htm">Psalm 60:13</a>. The following &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;&#1493; shows that the poet by expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; combines the thoughts of <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> and <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>.
