(See <a href="/proverbs/26-2.htm" title="As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.">Proverbs 26:2</a>, where this characteristic is especially noticed.) The ancient versions take the word as cognate with “turtle-dove.” In an appendix to Delitzsch’s Commentary on the Psalms, Dr. J. G. Wetzstein, identifies the <span class= "ital">tsippôr </span>with the <span class= "ital">ôsfur </span>of the Arabs, a generic name for small chirping birds, and <span class= "ital">derôr </span>with <span class= "ital">dûri. </span>which is specific of the <span class= "ital">sparrow.</span><p><span class= "bld">Even thy altars.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">at </span>or <span class= "ital">near thine altars, </span>though even if taken as in the Authorised “Version the meaning is the same. There is no real occasion for the great difficulty that has been made about this verse. It is absurd indeed to think of the birds actually nesting on the altars; but that they were found in and about the Temple is quite probable, just as in Herodotus (i. 159) we read of Aristodicus making the circuit of the temple at Branchidæ, and taking the nests of young sparrows and other birds. (Comp. the story in Ælian of the man who was slain for harming a sparrow that had sheltered in the temple of Æsculapius.) Ewald gives many other references, and among them one to Burckhardt showing that birds nest in the Kaaba at Mecca.<p>The Hebrew poetic style is not favourable to simile, or the psalmist would have written (as a modern would), “As the birds delight to nest at thine altars, so do I love to dwell in thine house.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/psalms/84.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Psalms<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">SPARROWS AND ALTARS<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/psalms/84-3.htm" title="Yes, the sparrow has found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.">Psalm 84:3</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The well-known saying of the saintly Rutherford, when he was silenced and exiled from his parish, echoes and expounds these words. ‘When I think,’ said he, ‘upon the sparrows and swallows that build their nests in the kirk of Anwoth, and of my dumb Sabbaths, my sorrowful, bleared eyes look asquint upon Christ, and present Him as angry.’ So sighed the Presbyterian minister in his compelled idleness in a prosaic seventeenth-century Scotch town, answering his heart’s-brother away back in the far-off time, and in such different circumstances. The Psalmist was probably a member of the Levitical family of the Sons of Korah, who were ‘doorkeepers in the house of the Lord.’ He knew what he was saying when he preferred his humble office to all honours among the godless. He was shut out by some unknown circumstances from external participation in the Temple rites, and longs to be even as one of the swallows or sparrows that twitter and flit round the sacred courts. No doubt to him faith was much more inseparably attached to form than it should be for us. No doubt place and ritual were more to him than they can permissibly be to those who have heard and understood the great charter of spiritual worship spoken first to an outcast Samaritan of questionable character: ‘Neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall men worship the Father.’ But equally it is true that what he wanted was what the outward worship brought him, rather than the worship itself. And the psalm, which begins with ‘longing’ and ‘fainting’ for the courts of the Lord, and pronouncing benedictions on ‘those that dwell in Thy house,’ works itself clear, if I might so say, and ends with ‘O Lord of Hosts! Blessed is the man that trusteth in Thee’-for he shall ‘dwell in Thy house,’ wherever he is. So this flight of imagination in the words of my text may suggest to us two or three lessons.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. I take it first as pointing a bitter and significant contrast.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘The sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself,’ while I! We do not know what the Psalmist’s circumstances were, but if we accept the conjecture that he may have accompanied David in his flight during Absalom’s rebellion, we may fancy him as wandering on the uplands across Jordan, and sharing the agitations, fears, and sorrows of those dark hours, and in the midst of all, as the little company hurried hither and thither for safety, thinking, with a touch of bitter envy, of the calm restfulness and serene services of the peaceful Temple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But, pathetic as is the complaint, when regarded as the sigh of a minister of the sanctuary exiled from the shrine which was as his home, and from the worship which was his occupation and delight, it sounds a deeper note and one which awakens echoes in our hearts, when we hear in it, as we may, the complaint of humanity contrasting its unrest with the happier lot of lower creatures. Do you remember who it was that said-and on what occasion He said it-’Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have roosting-places, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His head’? That saying, like our text, has a narrower and a wider application. In the former it pathetically paints the homeless Christ, a wanderer in a land peculiarly ‘His own,’ and warns His enthusiastic would-be follower of the lot which he was so light-heartedly undertaking to share. But when Jesus calls Himself ‘Son of Man,’ He claims to be the realised ideal of humanity, and when, as in that saying, He contrasts the condition of ‘the Son of Man’ with that of the animal creation, we can scarcely avoid giving to the words their wider application to the same contrast between man’s homelessness and the creatures’ repose which we have found in the Psalmist’s sigh.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Yes! There is only one being in this world that does not fit the world that he is in, and that is man, chief and foremost of all. Other beings perfectly correspond to what we now call their ‘environment.’ Just as the soft mollusc fits every convolution of its shell, and the hard shell fits every curve of the soft mollusc, so every living thing corresponds to its place and its place to it, and with them all things go smoothly. But man, the crown of creation, is an exception to this else universal complete adaptation. ‘The earth, O Lord! is full of Thy mercy,’ but the only creature who sees and says that is the only one who has further to say, ‘I am a stranger on the earth.’ He and he alone is stung with restlessness and conscious of longings and needs which find no satisfaction here. That sense of homelessness may be an agony or a joy, a curse or a blessing, according to our interpretation of its meaning, and our way of stilling it. It is not a sign of inferiority, but of a higher destiny, that we alone should bear in our spirits the ‘blank misgivings’ of those who, amid unsatisfying surroundings, have blind feelings after ‘worlds not realised,’ which elude our grasp. It is no advantage over us that every fly dancing in the treacherous gleams of an April sun, and every other creature on the earth except ourselves, on whom the crown is set, is perfectly proportioned to its place, and has desire and possessions absolutely conterminous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘The son of man hath not where to lay his head.’ Why must he alone wander homeless on the bleak moorland, whilst the sparrows and the swallows have their nests and their houses? Why? Because they <span class="ital">are</span> sparrows and swallows, and he is man, and ‘better than many sparrows.’ So let us lay to heart the sure promises, the blessed hopes, the stimulating exhortations, which come from that which, at first sight, seems to be a mystery and half an arraignment of the divine wisdom, in the contrast between the restlessness of humanity and the reposeful contentment of those whom we call the lower creatures. Be true to the unrest, brother! and do not mistake its meaning, nor seek to still it, until it drives you to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. These words bring to us a plea which we may use, and a pledge on which we may rest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘Thine altars, O Lord of hosts! my King and my God.’ The Psalmist pleads with God, and lays hold for his own confidence upon the fact that creatures which do not understand what the altar means, may build beside it, and those which have no notion of who the God is to whom the house is sacred, are yet cared for by Him. And he thinks to himself, ‘If I can say “<span class="ital">My</span> King and <span class="ital">my</span> God,” surely He that takes care of them will not leave me uncared for.’ The unrest of the soul that is capable of appropriating God is an unrest which has in it, if we understand it aright, the assurance that it shall be stilled and satisfied. He that is capable of entering into the close personal relationship with God which is expressed by that eloquent little pronoun and its reduplication with the two words, ‘King’ and ‘God’-such a creature cannot cry for rest in vain, nor in vain grope, as a homeless wanderer, for the door of the Father’s house.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Doth God care for oxen; or saith He it altogether for our sakes?’ ‘Consider the fowls of the air; your heavenly Father feedeth them.’ And the same argument which the Apostle used in the one of these sayings, and our Lord in the other, is valid and full of encouragement when applied to this matter. He that ‘satisfies the desires of every living thing,’ and fills full the maw of the lowest creature; and puts the worms into the gaping beak of the young ravens when they cry, is not the King to turn a deaf ear, or the back of His hand, to the man who can appeal to Him with this word on his lips, ‘My King and my God!’ We grasp God when we say that; and all that we see of provident recognition and supply of wants in dealings with these lower creatures should encourage us to cherish calm unshakable confidence that every true desire of our souls after Him is as certain to be satisfied.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And so the glancing swallows around the eaves of the Temple and the twittering sparrows on its pinnacles may proclaim to us, not only a contrast which is bitter, but a confidence which is sweet. We may be sure that we shall not be left uncared for amongst the many pensioners at His table, and that the deeper our wants the surer we are of their supply. Our bodies may hunger in vain-bodily hunger has no tendency to bring meat; but our spirits cannot hunger in vain if they hunger after God; for that hunger is the sure precursor and infallible prophet of the coming satisfaction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> These words not only may hearten us with confidence that our desires will be satisfied if they are set upon Him, but they point us to the one way by which they are so. Say ‘My King and my God!’ in the deepest recesses of a spirit conscious of His presence, of a will submitting to His authority, of emptiness expectant of His fulness; say that, and you are in the house of the Lord. For it is not a question of place, it is a question of disposition and desire. This Psalmist, though, when he began his song, he was far away from the Temple, and though he finished it sitting on the same hillside on which he began it, when he had ended it was within the curtains of the sanctuary and wrapt about with the presence of his God. He had regained as he sang what for a moment he had lost the consciousness of when he began-viz. the presence of God with him on the lone, dreary expanse of alien soil as truly as amidst the sanctities of what was called His House.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So, brethren! if we want rest, let us clasp God as ours; if we desire a home warm, safe, sheltered from every wind that blows, and inaccessible to enemies, let us, like the swallows, nestle under the eaves of the Temple. Let us take God for our Hope. They that hold communion with Him-and we can all do that wherever we are and whatever we may be doing-these, and only these, ‘dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of their lives.’ Therefore, with deepest simplicity of expression, our psalm goes on to describe, as equally recipients of blessedness, ‘those that dwell in the house of the Lord,’ and those in ‘whose heart are the ways’ that lead to it, and to explain at last, as I have already pointed out, that both the dwellers in, and the pilgrims towards, that intimacy of abiding with God are included in the benediction showered on those who cling to Him, ‘Blessed is the man that trusteth in Thee!’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Lastly, we may take this picture of the Psalmist’s as a warning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Sparrows and swallows have very small brains. They build their nests, and they do not know whose altars they are flitting around. They pursue the insects on the wing, and they twitter their little songs; and they do not understand how all their busy, glancing, brief, trivial life is being lived beneath the shadow of the cherubim, and all but in the presence of the veiled God of the Shekinah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There are too many people who live like that. We are all tempted to build our nests where we may lay our young, or dispose of ourselves or our treasures in the very sanctuary of God, with blind, crass indifference to the Presence in which we move. The Father’s house has many mansions, and wherever we go we are in God’s Temple. Alas! some of us have no more sense of the sanctities around us, and no more consciousness of the divine Eye that looks down upon us, than if we were so many feathered sparrows flitting about the altar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Let us take care, brethren! that we give our hearts to be influenced, and awed, and ennobled, and tranquillised by the sense of ever more being in the house of the Lord. Let us see to it that we keep in that house by continual aspiration, cherishing in our hearts the ways that lead to it; and so making all life worship, and every place what the pilgrim found the stone of Bethel to be, a house of God and a gate of heaven. For everywhere, to the eye that sees the things that are, and not only the things that seem-and to the heart that feels the unseen presence of the One Reality, God Himself-all places are temples, and all work may be beholding His beauty and inquiring in His sanctuary; and everywhere, though our heads rest upon a stone, and there be night and solitude around us, and doubt and darkness in front of us, and danger and terror behind us, and weakness within us, as was the case with Jacob, there will be the ladder with its foot at our side and its top in the heavens; and above the top of it His face, which when we see it look down upon us, makes all places and circumstances good and sweet.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/psalms/84.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/84-3.htm" title="Yes, the sparrow has found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.">Psalm 84:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Yea, the sparrow hath found a house — </span>That is, a habitation, namely, a nest, as it follows. <span class="ital">Even thine altar — </span>Or <span class="ital">nigh thine altar, </span>as the Hebrew particle, <span class="greekheb">את</span>, <span class="ital">eth, </span>often signifies, and is rendered by the Seventy and the Chaldee, <a href="/judges/4-11.htm" title="Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.">Jdg 4:11</a>. In the Hebrew it is <span class="ital">altars, </span>namely, that of <span class="ital">burnt-offerings, </span>and the other of incense: near which these birds might be truly said to have their nests, if, as is probable, they were either in some part of the tabernacle or temple, in which the altars were; or in some buildings belonging to or near them. Thus Bishop Patrick understands the verse, whose paraphrase is, “It grieves me, O mighty Lord, whose subject I am, and infinitely engaged for thee, to see the very birds, who know nothing of thee, enjoy that liberty which is denied me; who am here lamenting my distance from thee, when the sparrows and the ring-doves” (Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">דרור</span>, <span class="ital">deror, </span>which the Seventy render <span class="greekheb">τρυγων</span>, <span class="ital">a turtle, </span>and others a wild-pigeon) “have their constant residence at thy house; and there live so undisturbed, that they build their nests, and bring forth their young in the rafters of it.” The passage, however, is interpreted somewhat differently by several expositors, who read it thus: <span class="ital">My heart, &c., crieth out for the living God, </span>(<span class="ital">yea, as a sparrow, till she finds a house, and a swallow a nest for herself, </span>where to lay her young,) <span class="ital">for thine altars, </span>&c., that is, my heart, &c., crieth out for thine altars, &c. Or thus, <span class="ital">“The sparrow findeth a house, </span>&c., but when shall I find access to what I far prefer to a house of my own, the house of God?” Others again read, <span class="ital">Even as the sparrow, </span>that is, with the same joy and delight as the sparrow <span class="ital">findeth her house, and the swallow </span>(or <span class="ital">wild-pigeon</span>) <span class="ital">her nest, where she hath laid </span>(so <span class="greekheb">שׁתה</span>, <span class="ital">shata, </span>properly means) <span class="ital">her young; so should I find thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my king and my God. </span>This last seems the most just and easy exposition of the words. But whichsoever of the interpretations may be preferred, “the design of the passage,” as Dr. Horne has justly observed, “is evidently to intimate to us, that in the house, and at the altar of God, a faithful soul findeth freedom from care and sorrow, quiet of mind, and gladness of spirit; like a bird that has secured a little mansion for the reception and education of her young. And there is no heart endued with sensibility which doth not bear its testimony to the exquisite beauty and propriety of this affecting image.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/84.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>84:1-7 The ordinances of God are the believer's solace in this evil world; in them he enjoys the presence of the living God: this causes him to regret his absence from them. They are to his soul as the nest to the bird. Yet they are only an earnest of the happiness of heaven; but how can men desire to enter that holy habitation, who complain of Divine ordinances as wearisome? Those are truly happy, who go forth, and go on in the exercise of religion, in the strength of the grace of Jesus Christ, from whom all our sufficiency is. The pilgrims to the heavenly city may have to pass through many a valley of weeping, and many a thirsty desert; but wells of salvation shall be opened for them, and consolations sent for their support.

The word here used - &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512;  tsippo&#770;r - is a name given to a bird from its chirping or twittering. It is rendered sparrow in <a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4</a> (margin); <a href="/psalms/102-7.htm">Psalm 102:7</a>; and is often rendered bird (<a href="/genesis/7-14.htm">Genesis 7:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-10.htm">Genesis 15:10</a>, et al.), and fowl, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-17.htm">Deuteronomy 4:17</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-18.htm">Nehemiah 5:18</a>; et al. It may denote a bird of any kind, but is properly applied here to a sparrow, a species of bird very common and abundant in Palestine; a bird that finds its home especially about houses, barns, etc. That sparrows would be likely to gather around the tabernacle and even the altar, will appear not improbable from their well-known habits. "The sparrows which flutter and twitter about dilapidated buildings at Jerusalem, and crevices of the city walls, are very numerous. In some of the more lonely streets they are so noisy as almost to overpower every other sound. Their chirping is almost an articulate utterance of the Hebrew term (&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512;  tsippo&#770;r), which was employed to designate that class of birds. It may be taken for granted that the sparrows are not less numerous in other places where they have similar means for obtaining shelter and building their nests. The sparrows, in their resort to houses and other such places, appear to be a privileged bird. Encouraged by such indulgence, they are not timid - they frequent boldly the haunts of people. The sight of this familiarity reminded me again and again of the passage in the Psalms Psa 84:3, where the pious Israelite, debarred from the privileges of the sanctuary, felt as if he could envy the lot of the birds, so much more favored than himself." - Professor Hackett, "Illustrations of Scripture," pp. 94, 95.<p>And the swallow a nest for herself - A place where it may make its nest. The word used here - &#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;  dero&#770;r - denotes properly, swift flight, a wheeling or gyration; and it is applied to birds which fly in circles or gyrations, and the name is thus appropriately given to the swallow. It occurs in this sense only here and in <a href="/proverbs/26-2.htm">Proverbs 26:2</a>.<p>Where she may lay her young - Where she may place her young. The wordplay here is not used in the sense in which we now apply it when we speak of "laying" eggs. It means to place them; to make a home for them; to dispose and arrange them.<p>Even thine altars ... - The altars where thou art worshipped. The idea here is, that the sparrows and the swallows seemed to have a happy lot; to be in a condition to be envied. Even they might come freely to the place where God was worshipped - to the very altars - and make their home there undisturbed. How strongly in contrast with this was the condition of the wandering - the exiled - author of the psalm! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/84.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. thine altars&#8212;that is, of burnt offering and incense, used for the whole tabernacle.

One or other of the houses of men, where to build its nest; or its nest itself is called an house, as it seems to be explained in the next clause: the word here used signifies any bird; we translate it a "sparrow", and so Kimchi; the Targum renders it the "dove"; but the Midrash is, <p>"it is not said as a dove, but as a sparrow: the dove takes its young, and returns to its place; not so the sparrow:'' <p>and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young; the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, have it the "turtle", the stock, or ring dove: and so the Targum, which paraphrases this clause, in connection with the following, thus: <p>"and the turtle a nest for herself, whose young are fit to be offered up upon thine altars:'' <p>it is translated a swallow in <a href="/proverbs/26-2.htm">Proverbs 26:2</a> and has its name in Hebrew from liberty, it not loving confinement, or because it freely visits the houses of men without fear: <p>even thine altars, O Lord of hosts; that is, as some understand it, there the swallow builds a nest, and lays her young; but it can hardly be thought that this could be done in them, since the priests were so often officiating at them, and there were so much noise, fire, and smoke there; it must be "at the sides of them", as the Syriac and Arabic versions render it, or near unto them; or rather in the rafters of the house where they were; and the rafters and beams of the temple were of cedar, and in such turtles have their nests (s); or in the houses adjoining to the tabernacle; or in the trees that might be near it; see <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/24-26.htm">Joshua 24:26</a>, and so the psalmist seems to envy and begrudge the place these birds had, and wishes he had the same nearness as they. Kimchi observes, that if this is to be understood of David, when in the land of the Philistines, at that time high places and altars were lawful everywhere, and there birds might build their nests; but if of the captivity, the birds found a place and built their nests in the ruins of the temple and altars; and so Jarchi; for as for the temple, it was not built in the times of David; besides, when built, had a scarecrow on it (t): though the words may be considered as in connection with <a href="/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a> and what goes before be read in a parenthesis, as they are by R. Judah Ben Balsam, cited by R. Aben Ezra; <p>"my soul longeth for the courts of the Lord, crieth out for the living God: even thine altars, O Lord of hosts''; <p>that is, for them; or may be supplied thus, <p>"I desire thine altars, O Lord of hosts'' (u): <p>as the birds above mentioned seek for a nest, and desire to find one, and have what they want, and nature prompts them to; so I desire a place in thine house and courts, and near thine altars; see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, or thus; as these birds rejoice, when they have found an house or nest for themselves and young; so should I rejoice, might I be favoured once more with attendance on thine altars, O Lord of hosts: mention is made of "altars", referring both to the altar of burnt sacrifice, and the altar of incense, both typical of Christ, <a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a> and of his sacrifice and intercession; both which believers have to do with: it is added, <p>my King, and my God; when, by attending at his tabernacle, courts, and altars, he would testify his subjection to him as his King, and his faith in him, and thankfulness to him, as his God; see <a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>. <p>(s) Vide Theocrit.

The Psalmist envies the privilege of the birds which build their nests within the precincts of the Temple. If even they are allowed to find a home there, surely he may expect a welcome. As at an earlier time the surrounding scenery was eloquent to the poet of his own misfortunes (<a href="/psalms/42-7.htm" title="Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterspouts: all your waves and your billows are gone over me.">Psalm 42:7</a>), so now a feature in the Temple courts expresses the longing of his heart. No doubt the figure is abruptly introduced. The picture is painted, and left to the reader to interpret. But it is unnecessary to suppose that the text is defective, and must be emended by the insertion of words to give the sense: ‘Birds have their nests, and so have I found (or rather, would I fain find) a home by thine altars.’ The direct address to God is not out of place, because though the Psalmist does not directly mean himself by the sparrow and swallow, his own longing breaks through the figure and moulds the language.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sparrow … swallow</span>] Cp. <a href="/proverbs/26-2.htm" title="As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.">Proverbs 26:2</a>. <span class="ital">Tsippôr</span>, rendered <span class="ital">sparrow</span>, is a generic term for small birds: <span class="ital">drôr</span> is rendered <span class="ital">dove</span> by the LXX, Targ., and Syr., but probably means <span class="ital">swallow</span>. In ancient Greece as in the East the birds which nested in temples were accounted sacred. Comp. the story of Aristodicus at the temple of Branchidae (Herodotus i. 159); and “still the swallow seeks the temple enclosure at Jerusalem, and the mosque of Omar, as a secure and safe nesting-place.” (Tristram, <span class="ital">Nat.

Both sparrows and swallows abound in Palestine. Canon Tristram found the nest of a sparrow "so closely allied to our own that it is difficult to distinguish it," in a chink of the Haram wall at Jerusalem, near the Golden Gate ('Land of Israel,' p. 182). An anecdote related by Herodotus (1, 159) shows that sparrows built about the Greek temples. The general meaning of the figure in this place seems to be, "If even birds love to build their nests, as they do, in the sacred precincts, how much more reason has the believing heart to find its home in the house of its God!" But the psalmist thinks it enough to suggest the parallel, and does not stop to carry it out. Even <span class="cmt_word">thine altars.</span> The "altar" is put, by metonymy, for the temple itself. <span class="cmt_word">O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/5-2.htm">Psalm 5:2</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/83.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, which constrains God in faith, the "thundering down" begins afresh. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; signifies a wheel and a whirling motion, such as usually arises when the wind changes suddenly, then also whatever is driven about in the whirling, <a href="/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>.<p>(Note: Saadia, who renders the &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; in <a href="/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a> as an astronomical expression with Arab. 'l-frk, the sphere of the heavens, here has professedly Arab. ka&#770;lgra&#770;blt, which would be a plural from expanded out of Arab. gra&#770;b&#305;&#770;l, "sieves" or "tambourines;" it is, however, to be read, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>, Codex Oxon., Arab. ka&#770;lgirba&#770;lt. The verb Arab. garbala, "to sift," is transferred to the wind, e.g., in Mutanabbi (edited with Wahidi's commentary by Dieterici), p. 29, l. 5 and 6: "it is as though the dust of this region, when the winds chase one another therein, were sifted," Arab. mugarbalu (i.e., caught up and whirled round); and with other notional and constructional applications in Makkar&#305;&#770;, i. p. 102, l. 18: "it is as though its soil had been cleansed from dust by sifting," Arab. gurbilat (i.e., the dust thereof swept away by a whirlwind). Accordingly Arab. girba&#770;lat signifies first, as a nom. vicis, a whirling about (of dust by the wind), then in a concrete sense a whirlwind, as Saadia uses it, inasmuch as he makes use of it twice for &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;. So Fleischer in opposition to Ewald, who renders "like the sweepings or rubbish.")<p>&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; (from &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, Arab. qs&#780;s&#780;, aridum esse) is the cry corn-talks, whether as left standing or, as in this instance, as straw upon the threshing-floor or upon the field. Like a fire that spreads rapidly, laying hold of everything, which burns up the forest and singes off the wooded mountain so that only a bare cone is left standing, so is God to drive them before Him in the raging tempest of His wrath and take them unawares. The figure in <a href="/psalms/83-15.htm">Psalm 83:15</a> is fully worked up by Isaiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16-19</a>; &#1500;&#1495;&#1496; as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>. In the apodosis, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/83-16.htm">Psalm 83:16</a>, the figure is changed into a kindred one: wrath is a glowing heat (&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;) and a breath (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>) at the same time. In <a href="/psalms/83-17.htm">Psalm 83:17</a> it becomes clear what is the final purpose towards which this language of cursing tends: to the end that all, whether willingly or reluctantly, may give the glory to the God of revelation. Directed towards this end the earnest prayer is repeated once more in the tetrastichic closing strain. </body></html>
