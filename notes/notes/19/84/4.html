They are to his soul as the nest to the bird. Yet they are only an earnest of the happiness of heaven; but how can men desire to enter that holy habitation, who complain of Divine ordinances as wearisome? Those are truly happy, who go forth, and go on in the exercise of religion, in the strength of the grace of Jesus Christ, from whom all our sufficiency is. The pilgrims to the heavenly city may have to pass through many a valley of weeping, and many a thirsty desert; but wells of salvation shall be opened for them, and consolations sent for their support. Those that press forward in their Christian course, shall find God add grace to their graces.

The reference is to the priests and Levites - the ministers of religion - who had their permanent abode near the tabernacle and the temple, and who were wholly devoted to the sacred duties of religion. Their lot is here spoken of as a blessed, or as a happy lot, in contradistinction from those who had only the opportunity of occasionally going up to worship.

'l-frk, the sphere of the heavens, here has professedly Arab. ka&#770;lgra&#770;blt, which would be a plural from expanded out of Arab. gra&#770;b&#305;&#770;l, "sieves" or "tambourines;" it is, however, to be read, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>, Codex Oxon., Arab. ka&#770;lgirba&#770;lt. The verb Arab. garbala, "to sift," is transferred to the wind, e.g., in Mutanabbi (edited with Wahidi's commentary by Dieterici), p. 29, l. 5 and 6: "it is as though the dust of this region, when the winds chase one another therein, were sifted," Arab. mugarbalu (i.e., caught up and whirled round); and with other notional and constructional applications in Makkar&#305;&#770;, i. p. 102, l. 18: "it is as though its soil had been cleansed from dust by sifting," Arab. gurbilat (i.e., the dust thereof swept away by a whirlwind). Accordingly Arab. girba&#770;lat signifies first, as a nom. vicis, a whirling about (of dust by the wind), then in a concrete sense a whirlwind, as Saadia uses it, inasmuch as he makes use of it twice for &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;.

Like a fire that spreads rapidly, laying hold of everything, which burns up the forest and singes off the wooded mountain so that only a bare cone is left standing, so is God to drive them before Him in the raging tempest of His wrath and take them unawares. The figure in <a href="/psalms/83-15.htm">Psalm 83:15</a> is fully worked up by Isaiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16-19</a>; &#1500;&#1495;&#1496; as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>. In the apodosis, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/83-16.htm">Psalm 83:16</a>, the figure is changed into a kindred one: wrath is a glowing heat (&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;) and a breath (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>) at the same time. In <a href="/psalms/83-17.htm">Psalm 83:17</a> it becomes clear what is the final purpose towards which this language of cursing tends: to the end that all, whether willingly or reluctantly, may give the glory to the God of revelation. Directed towards this end the earnest prayer is repeated once more in the tetrastichic closing strain. </body></html>
