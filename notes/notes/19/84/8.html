The psalmist pleads love to God's ordinances. Let us account one day in God's courts better than a thousand spent elsewhere; and deem the meanest place in his service preferable to the highest earthly preferment. We are here in darkness, but if God be our God, he will be to us a Sun, to enlighten and enliven us, to guide and direct us. We are here in danger, but he will be to us a Shield, to secure us from the fiery darts that fly thick about us. Through he has not promised to give riches and dignities, he has promised to give grace and glory to all that seek them in his appointed way. And what is grace, but heaven begun below, in the knowledge, love, and service of God? What is glory, but the completion of this happiness, in being made like to him, and in fully enjoying him for ever? Let it be our care to walk uprightly, and then let us trust God to give us every thing that is good for us. If we cannot go to the house of the Lord, we may go by faith to the Lord of the house; in him we shall be happy, and may be easy.

Thither the poet is drawn by the deeply inward yearning of love, which makes him pale (&#1504;&#1499;&#1505;&#1507; from &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507;, to grow pale, <a href="/psalms/17-12.htm">Psalm 17:12</a>) and consumes him (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; as in <a href="/job/19-27.htm">Job 19:27</a>). His heart and flesh joyfully salute the living God dwelling there, who, as a never-failing spring, quenches the thirst of the soul (<a href="/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>); the joy that he feels when he throws himself back in spirit into the long-denied delight takes possession even of his bodily nature, the bitter-sweet pain of longing completely fills him (<a href="/psalms/63-2.htm">Psalm 63:2</a>). The mention of the "courts" (with the exception of the Davidic <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a>, occurring only in the anonymous Psalms) does not preclude the reference of the Psalm to the tent-temple on Zion. The Tabernacle certainly had only one &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;; the arrangement of the Davidic tent-temple, however, is indeed unknown to us, and, according to reliable traces, <p>(Note: Vid., Knobel on Exodus, S. 253-257, especially S. 255.)<p>it may be well assumed that it was more gorgeous and more spacious than the old Tabernacle which remained in Gibeon. In <a href="/psalms/84-4.htm">Psalm 84:4</a> the preference must be given to that explanation which makes &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; dependent upon &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1492;, without being obliged to supply an intermediate thought like &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (with hardening Dagesh like &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>, vid., the rule at <a href="/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a>) and &#1511;&#1503; as a more definite statement of the object which the poet has in view. The altars, therefore, or (what this is meant to say without any need for taking &#1488;&#1514; as a preposition) the realm, province of the altars of Jahve - this is the house, this the nest which sparrow and swallow have found for themselves and their young. The poet thereby only indirectly says, that birds have built themselves nests on the Temple-house, without giving any occasion for the discussion whether this has taken place in reality. By the bird that has found a comfortable snug home on the place of the altars of Jahve in the Temple-court and in the Temple-house, he means himself. &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (from &#1510;&#1508;&#1512;) is a general name for whistling, twittering birds, like the finch <p>(Note: Vid., Tobler, Denkbltter aus Jerusalem, 1853, S. 117.)<p>and the sparrow, just as the lxx here renders it. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512; is not the turtle-dove (lxx, Targum, and Syriac), but the swallow, which is frequently called even in the Talmud &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512; &#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512; ( equals  &#1505;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;), and appears to take its name from its straightforward darting, as it were, radiating flight (cf. Arabic jadurru of the horse: it darts straight forward). Saadia renders du&#770;r&#305;&#770;je, which is the name of the sparrow in Palestine and Syria (vid., Wetzstein's Excursus I). After the poet has said that his whole longing goes forth towards the sanctuary, he adds that it could not possibly be otherwise (&#1490;&#1468;&#1501; standing at the head of the clause and belonging to the whole sentence, as e.g., in <a href="/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>; Ewald, 352, b): he, the sparrow, the swallow, has found a house, a nest, viz., the altars of Jahve of Hosts, his King and his God (<a href="/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>), who gloriously and inaccessibly protects him, and to whom he unites himself with most heartfelt and believing love. The addition "where (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; as in <a href="/psalms/95-9.htm">Psalm 95:9</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>) she layeth her young," is not without its significance. One is here reminded of the fact, that at the time of the second Temple the sons of the priests were called &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497; &#1499;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, and the Levite poet means himself together with his family; God's altars secure to them shelter and sustenance. How happy, blessed, therefore, are those who enjoy this good fortune, which he now longs for again with pain in a strange country, viz., to be able to make his home in the house of such an adorable and gracious God! &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; here signifies, not "constantly" (<a href="/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>), for which &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; would have been used, but "yet," as in <a href="/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>. The relation of <a href="/psalms/84-5.htm">Psalm 84:5</a> to <a href="/psalms/84-5.htm">Psalm 84:5</a> is therefore like <a href="/psalms/41-2.htm">Psalm 41:2</a>. The present is dark, but it will come to pass even yet that the inmates of God's house (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>) will praise Him as their Helper. The music here strikes in, anticipating this praise. </body></html>
