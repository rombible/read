in them he enjoys the presence of the living God: this causes him to regret his absence from them. They are to his soul as the nest to the bird. Yet they are only an earnest of the happiness of heaven; but how can men desire to enter that holy habitation, who complain of Divine ordinances as wearisome? Those are truly happy, who go forth, and go on in the exercise of religion, in the strength of the grace of Jesus Christ, from whom all our sufficiency is. The pilgrims to the heavenly city may have to pass through many a valley of weeping, and many a thirsty desert; but wells of salvation shall be opened for them, and consolations sent for their support. Those that press forward in their Christian course, shall find God add grace to their graces. And those who grow in grace, shall be perfect in glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/84.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My soul longeth - The word used here means properly to be pale; then, to be faint or weak; and then, to pine after, to long for, to desire earnestly. It would properly denote such a longing or desire as to make one faint or exhausted; that is, it indicates intense desire. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-12.htm">Psalm 17:12</a>, it is applied to a hungry lion; "Like a lion that is greedy of its prey." In <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-30.htm">Genesis 31:30</a>, it conveys the idea of intense desire: "Because thou sore longedst after thy father's house." For an illustration of the sentiment here expressed, see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>.<p>Yea, even fainteth - Is exhausted; fails of its strength. The word means properly to be completed, finished; then to be consumed, to be spent, to waste or pine away. <a href="/genesis/21-15.htm">Genesis 21:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>; <a href="/job/19-27.htm">Job 19:27</a>.<p>For the courts of the Lord - The word used here refers to the different areas around the tabernacle or temple, within which many of the services of public worship were conducted, and which were frequented by different classes of persons. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>.<p>My heart and my flesh - My whole nature; my body and my soul; all my desires and aspirations - all the longings of my heart are there. The body - the flesh - cries out for rest; the heart - the soul - for communion with God. Our whole nature demands the benefits which spring from the worship of God. Body and soul were made for his service, and the necessities of neither can be satisfied without religion.<p>Crieth out - The word used here - &#1512;&#1504;&#1503;  ra&#770;nan - means properly to give forth a tremulous sound; then, to give forth the voice in vibrations, or in a tremulous manner; and thence it may mean either to utter cries of joy, <a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>; <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-6.htm">Isaiah 12:6</a>, or to utter a loud wail <a href="/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>. Its common application is to joy <a href="/psalms/98-4.htm">Psalm 98:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-16.htm">Psalm 132:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-8.htm">Psalm 65:8</a>; and it might be rendered here, "Sing unto the Lord," or "Rejoice unto the Lord." The connection, however, seems to demand that it be understood as the cry of earnest longing or desire.<p>For the living God - God, the true God, considered as living, in contradistinction from idols, always spoken of as dead.

The verbs are perfects, and it seems best to suppose that he is recalling the earnest longings which are even now finding satisfaction, as his feet stand in the Temple courts, and his heart and flesh sing for joy unto the living God. The latter verb denotes joyous singing, such as that with which pilgrims enlivened their journey. Cp. <a href="/jeremiah/31-12.htm" title="Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.">Jeremiah 31:12</a>; and the cognate substantive in <a href="/psalms/42-4.htm" title="When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy day.">Psalm 42:4</a>. <span class="ital">Soul, heart</span>, and <span class="ital">flesh</span>, the emotions, the reason and the will, with the living organism of the body through which they act, make up the whole man.

So Hengstenberg, who says, "The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is of frequent occurrence in the Psalms, and <span class="accented">always</span> signifies <span class="accented">to rejoice</span>."

'l-frk, the sphere of the heavens, here has professedly Arab. ka&#770;lgra&#770;blt, which would be a plural from expanded out of Arab. gra&#770;b&#305;&#770;l, "sieves" or "tambourines;" it is, however, to be read, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>, Codex Oxon., Arab. ka&#770;lgirba&#770;lt. The verb Arab. garbala, "to sift," is transferred to the wind, e.g., in Mutanabbi (edited with Wahidi's commentary by Dieterici), p. 29, l. 5 and 6: "it is as though the dust of this region, when the winds chase one another therein, were sifted," Arab. mugarbalu (i.e., caught up and whirled round); and with other notional and constructional applications in Makkar&#305;&#770;, i. p. 102, l. 18: "it is as though its soil had been cleansed from dust by sifting," Arab. gurbilat (i.e., the dust thereof swept away by a whirlwind). Accordingly Arab. girba&#770;lat signifies first, as a nom. vicis, a whirling about (of dust by the wind), then in a concrete sense a whirlwind, as Saadia uses it, inasmuch as he makes use of it twice for &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;. So Fleischer in opposition to Ewald, who renders "like the sweepings or rubbish.")<p>&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; (from &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, Arab. qs&#780;s&#780;, aridum esse) is the cry corn-talks, whether as left standing or, as in this instance, as straw upon the threshing-floor or upon the field. Like a fire that spreads rapidly, laying hold of everything, which burns up the forest and singes off the wooded mountain so that only a bare cone is left standing, so is God to drive them before Him in the raging tempest of His wrath and take them unawares. The figure in <a href="/psalms/83-15.htm">Psalm 83:15</a> is fully worked up by Isaiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16-19</a>; &#1500;&#1495;&#1496; as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>. In the apodosis, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/83-16.htm">Psalm 83:16</a>, the figure is changed into a kindred one: wrath is a glowing heat (&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;) and a breath (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>) at the same time. In <a href="/psalms/83-17.htm">Psalm 83:17</a> it becomes clear what is the final purpose towards which this language of cursing tends: to the end that all, whether willingly or reluctantly, may give the glory to the God of revelation. Directed towards this end the earnest prayer is repeated once more in the tetrastichic closing strain. </body></html>
