The man who is a new creature in Christ, may rejoice in all the precious promises God has spoken in his holiness. His present privileges, and the sanctifying influences of the Spirit, are sure earnests of heavenly glory. David rejoices in conquering the neighbouring nations, which had been enemies to Israel. The Israel of God are through Christ more than conquerors. Though sometimes they think that the Lord has cast them off, yet he will bring them into the strong city at last. Faith in the promise will assure us that it is our Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom: But we are not yet made complete conquerors, and no true believer will abuse these truths to indulge sloth, or vain confidence. Hope in God is the best principle of true courage, for what need those fear who have God on their side? All our victories are from him, and while those who willingly submit to our anointed King shall share his glories, all his foes shall be put under his feet.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God hath spoken in his holiness - That is, as a holy God; a God who is true; a God whose promises are always fulfilled. The idea is, that the holiness of God was the public pledge or assurance that what he had promised he would certainly perform. God had made promises in regard to the land of Canaan or Palestine, as a country to be put into the possession of Abraham and his posterity. <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>; <a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8-11</a>. The original promise of the gift of that land, made to Abraham under the general name of Canaan <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>, embraced the whole territory from the river (that divided the land from Egypt) to the Euphrates: "Unto thy seed, addressed to Abraham, have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates," <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>. This would embrace the country of Edom, as well as the other countries which are specified in the psalm. The natural and proper boundary of the land on the east, therefore, according to the promise, was the river Euphrates; on the west, Egypt and the Mediterranean sea; on the south, the outer limit of Edom. It was the object of David to carry out what was implied in this promise, and to secure the possession of all that had been thus granted to the Hebrews as the descendants of Abraham. Hence, he had been engaged in carrying his conquests to the east, with a view to make the Euphrates the eastern border or boundary of the land: "David smote also Hadarezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates," <a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a>. Compare <a href="/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>. In the prosecution of the same purpose he was anxious also to subdue Edom, that the entire territory thus promised to Abraham might be put in possession of the Hebrews, and that he might transmit the kingdom in the fullness of the original grant to his posterity. It is to this promise made to Abraham that he doubtless refers in the passage before us.<p>I will rejoice - I, David, will exult or rejoice in the prospect of success. I will find my happiness, or my confidence in what I now undertake, in the promise which God has made. The meaning is, that since God had made this promise, he would certainly triumph.<p>I will divide Shechem - That is, I will divide up the whole land according to the promise. The language here is taken from that which was employed when the country of Canaan was conquered by Joshua, and when it was divided among the tribes: "Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them," <a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6</a>. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6-7</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-5.htm">Joshua 14:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-51.htm">Joshua 19:51</a>; <a href="/joshua/23-4.htm">Joshua 23:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-55.htm">Psalm 78:55</a>; <a href="/acts/13-19.htm">Acts 13:19</a>. David here applies the same language to Shechem, "and the valley of Succoth," as portions of the land, meaning that he would accomplish the original purpose in regard to the land by placing it in possession of the people of God. Shechem or Sichem was a city within the limits of the tribe of Ephraim, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, called by the Romans Neapolis, and now Nablus. It is about two hours, or eight miles, south of Samaria. It seems to be mentioned here as being the spot where the law of Moses was read to the people of Israel, and especially the blessings and curses recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, which Moses commanded to be read to the different tribes on the above-named mountains, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11-13</a>. This was actually done, <a href="/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a>. Shechem, therefore, as lying between these mountains, and as being the place where the great mass of the people were assembled to hear what was read, became a central place, a representative spot of the whole land, and to say that that was conquered or subdued, was to speak of that which implied a victory over the land. David speaks of having secured this, as significant of the fact that the central point of influence and power had been brought under subjection, and as in fact implying that the land was subdued. The importance of that place, and the allusion to it here, will justify a more extended reference to it, which I copy from "The Land and the Book," by Dr. Thomson, vol. ii. p. 203, 204.<p>"Nablus is a queer old place. The streets are narrow, and vaulted over; and in the winter time it is difficult to pass along many of them on account of brooks which rush over the pavement with deafening roar. In this respect, I know no city with which to compare it except Brusa; and, like that city, it has mulberry, orange, pomegranate, and other trees, mingled in with the houses, whose odoriferous flowers lead the air with delicious perfume during the months of April and May. Here the billbul delights to sit and sing, and thousands of other birds unite to swell the chorus. The inhabitants maintain that theirs is the most musical vale in Palestine, and my experience does not enable me to contradict them.<p>"Imagine that the lofty range of mountains running north and south was cleft open to its base by some tremendous convulsion of nature, at right angles to its own line of extension, and the broad fissure thus made is the vale of Nablus, as it appears to one coming up the plain of Mukhna from Jerusalem. Mount Ebal is on the north, Gerizim on the south, and the city between. Near the eastern end, the vale is not more than sixty rods wide; and just there, I suppose, the tribes assembled to hear the 'blessings and the curses' read by the Levites. We have them in extenso in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8.htm">Joshua 8</a> we are informed that it was actually done, and how. Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin, stood on Gerizim; and Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulon, Dan, and Naphtali, on Ebal; while all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord; the whole nation of Israel, with the women and little ones, were there. And Joshua read all the words of the law, the blessings and the cursings; there was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel. This was, beyond question or comparison, the most august assembly the sun has ever shone upon; and I never stand in the narrow plain, with Ebal and Gerizim rising on either hand to the sky, without involuntarily recalling and reproducing the scene. I have shouted to hear the echo, and then fancied how it must have been when the loud-voiced Levites proclaimed from the naked cliffs of Ebal, 'Cursed be the man that maketh any graven image, an abomination unto Jehovah.' And then the tremendous amen! tenfold louder, from the mighty congregation, rising, and swelling, and re-echoing from Ebal to Gerizim, and from Gerizim to Ebal. amen! even so let him be accursed. No, there never was an assembly to compare with this."<p>And mete out the valley of Succoth - Measure out; that is, measure or survey for the purpose of "dividing" it, or assigning it to the conquerors, to the people of God, according to the promise. There is the same allusion here, as in the former clause, to the dividing of the land in the time of Joshua. Succoth, in the division of the land by Joshua, fell to the tribe of Gad; <a href="/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a>. It was on the east side of the river Jordan, and is now called Sakut. It is first mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>, in the account of the journey which Jacob took on returning from the East to the land of Canaan. At this place he paused in his journey, and made booths for his cattle; and hence, the name Succoth, or booths. Why this place is referred to here by David, as representing his conquests, cannot now be ascertained. It seems most probable that it was because it was a place east of the Jordan, as Shechem was west of the Jordan, and that the two might, therefore, represent the conquest of the whole country. Succoth, too, though not more prominent than many other places, and though in itself of no special importance, was well known as among the places mentioned in history. It is possible, also, though no such fact is mentioned, that there may have been some transaction of special importance there in connection with David's conquests in the East, which was well understood at the time, and which justified this special reference to it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-10.

She sets this over against all discouraging Circumstances; let outward providences say what they will, the voice of a faithful God drowns every sound of tear. God had promised Israel victory, and David the kingdom: the holiness of God secured the fulfilment of his own covenant, and therefore the king spake confidently. The goodly land had been secured to the tribes by the promise made to Abraham, and that divine grant was an abundantly sufficient warrant for the belief that Israel's arms would be successful in battle. Believer make good use of this, and banish doubts while promises remain. "I will rejoice," or "I will triumph." Faith regards the promise not as fiction but fact, and therefore drinks in joy from it, and grasps victory by it. "God hath spoken; I will rejoice;" here is a fit motto for every soldier of the cross. "I will divide Shechem." As a victor David would allot the conquered territory to those to whom God had given it by lot. Shechem was an important portion of the country which as yet had not yielded to his government; but he saw that by Jehovah's help it would be, and indeed was all his own. Faith divides the spoil, she is sure of what God has promised, and enters at once into possession. "And mete out the valley of Succoth." As the east So the west of Jordan should be allotted to the proper persons. Enemies should be expelled, and the landmarks of peaceful ownership Set Up. Where Jacob had pitched his tent, there his rightful heirs should till the soil. When God has spoken, his divine shall, our "I will,", becomes no idle boast, but the fit echo of the Lord's decree. Believer, up and take possession of covenant mercies, "Divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth." Let not Canaanitish doubts and legalisms keep thee out of the inheritance of grace. Live up to thy privileges, take the good which God provides thee.<p><a href="/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a><p>"Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine." He claims the whole land on account of the promise. Two other great divisions of the country he mentions, evidently delighting to survey the goodly land which the Lord had given him. All things are ours, whether things present or things to come; no mean portion belongs to the believer, and let him not think meanly of it. No enemy shall withhold from true faith what God has given her, for grace makes her mighty to wrest it from the foe. Life is mine, death is mine, for Christ is mine, "Ephraim also is the strength of mine head." All the military power of the valiant tribe was at the command of David, and he praises God for it. God will bow to the accomplishment of his purposes all the valour of men: the church may cry, "the prowess of armies is mine," God will overrule all their achievements for the progress of his cause. "Judah is my lawgiver." There the civil power was concentrated: the king being of that tribe sent forth his laws out of her midst. We know no lawgiver, but the King who came out of Judah. To all the claims of Rome, or Oxford, or the councils of men, we pay no attention; we are free from all other ecclesiastical rule, but that of Christ; but we yield joyful obedience to him: "Judah is my lawgiver." Amid distractions it is a great thing to have good and sound legislation, it was a balm for Israel's wounds, it is our joy in the church of Christ.<p><a href="/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a><p>Having looked at home with satisfaction, the hero-king now looks abroad with exultation. "Moab," so injurious to me in former years, "is my washpot." The basin into which the water falls when it is poured from an ewer upon my feet. A mere pot to hold the dirty water after my feet have been washed in it. Once she defiled Israel, according to the counsel of Balaam, the son of Beor; but she shall be no longer able to perpetrate such baseness; she shall be a washpot for those whom she sought to pollute. The wicked as we see in them the evil, the fruit, and the punishment of sin, shall help on the purification of the saints. This is contrary to their will, and to the nature of things, but faith finds honey in the lion, and a washpot in filthy Moab. David treats his foes as but insignificant and inconsiderable; a whole nation he counts but as a footbath for his kingdom. "Over Edom will I cast out my shoe." As a man when bathing throws his shoes on one side, so would he obtain his dominion over haughty Esau's descendants as easily as a man casts a shoe. Perhaps he would throw his shoe as nowadays men throw their glove, as a challenge to them to dare dispute his way. He did not need draw a sword to smite his now crippled and utterly despondent adversary, for if he dared revolt he would only need to throw his slipper at him, and he would tremble. Easily are we victors when Omnipotence leads the way. The day shall come when the church shall with equal ease subdue China and Ethiopia to the sceptre of the Son of David. Every believer also may by faith triumph over all difficulties and reign with him who hath made us kings and priests. "They overcame through the blood of the Lamb," shall yet be said of all who rest in the power of Jesus. "Philistia, triumph thou because of me." Be so subdued as to rejoice in my victories over my other foes. Or does he mean, I who smote thy champion have at length so subdued thee that thou shalt never be able to rejoice over Israel again; but if thou must needs triumph it must be with me, and not against me; or rather is it a taunting defiance, a piece of irony? O proud Philistia, where are thy vaunts? Where now thy haughty looks, and promised conquests? Thus dare we defy the last enemy, "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?" So utterly hopeless is the cause of hell when the Lord comes forth to the battle, that even the weakest daughter of Zion may shake her head at the enemy, and laugh him to scorn. O the glorying of faith! There is not a grain of vainglory in it, but yet her holy boastings none can hinder. When the Lord speaks the promise, we will not be slow to rejoice and glory in it? <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/60.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God hath spoken:</span> having prayed that God would save and hear him, he now intimates that God had done it already, and had prevented his prayers, and <span class="ital">had spoken</span> to him and of him, about the stablishing of his throne. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In his holiness; </span> or, <span class="ital">in the sanctuary or holy place</span>, to which David used to resort to ask counsel, and from whence God usually gave out his oracles.

He makes Ephraim the chief defence of His kingdom, and Judah the seat of government, and treats the neighbouring nations as His vassals. It is possible that some actual oracle is quoted, but more probable that the drift of the great promise to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm" title="And I was with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies out of your sight, and have made you a great name, like to the name of the great men that are in the earth.">2 Samuel 7:9</a> f) is freely reproduced in a poetical form.

Some suppose that a Divine oracle had been recently given to David himself, and that he here records the words of it. But, in that case, it is difficult to account for the despondent tone of vers. 1-4. Hengstenberg's explanation seems preferable, that David now encourages himself by a "reference to the general aspect of the assurances given in the Pentateuch in regard to the possession of the land of Canaan in its widest extent, and to victory over hostile neighbours," and that he has his eye especially on the blessing of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>) and the blessing of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>).

This question altogether disappears if we retain the Chethb and point &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;: my God will anticipate me with His mercy (cf. <a href="/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>), i.e., will meet me bringing His mercy without any effort of mine. Even the old translators have felt that chcdw must belong to the verb as a second object. The lxx is perfectly correct in its rendering, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;. The Ker has come into existence in looking to v. 18, according to which it seems as though &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; ought to be added to the refrain, <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> (cf. a similar instance in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6-7</a>). But <a href="/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a> would be stunted by doing this, and it accords with Biblical poetic usage that the refrain in v. 18 should be climactic in comparison with <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> (just as it also does not altogether harmonize in its first half); so that Olshausen's proposal to close <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; and to begin <a href="/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a> with &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493; (cf. <a href="/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a>) is only just to be put on record. The prayer "slay them not" does not contradict the prayer that follows for their destruction. The poet wishes that those who lie in wait for him, before they are totally swept away, may remain for a season before the eyes of this people as an example of punishment. In accordance with this, &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;, by a comparison of the Hiph. in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-13.htm">Numbers 32:13</a>, and of the Kal in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-16.htm">Psalm 59:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, is to be rendered: cause them to wander about (Targum, cf. Genesis Rabba, ch. 38 init., &#1496;&#1500;&#1496;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;); and in connection with &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; one is involuntarily reminded of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-10.htm">Psalm 10:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-14.htm">Psalm 10:14</a>, and is tempted to read &#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1498; or &#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1498;: cause them to wander about in adversity or wretchedness,  equals  Arab. &#8219;umr h&#803;a&#770;lik, vita caliginosa h. e. misera), and more especially since &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; occurs nowhere else instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1498; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498;. But the Jod in &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; is unfavourable to this supposition; and since the martial apostrophe of God by "our shield" follows, the choice of the word is explained by the consideration that the poet conceives of the power of God as an army (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>), and perhaps thinks directly of the heavenly host (<a href="/joel/3-11.htm">Joel 3:11</a>), over which the Lord of Hosts holds command (Hitzig). By means of this He is first of all to cause them to go astray (&#1504;&#1506; &#1493;&#1504;&#1491;, <a href="/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12</a>), then utterly to cast them down (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>). The Lord (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;) is to do this, as truly as He is Israel's shield against all the heathen and all pseudo-Israelites who have become as heathen. The first member of <a href="/psalms/59-13.htm">Psalm 59:13</a> is undoubtedly meant descriptively: "the sin of their mouth (the sin of the tongue) is the word of their lips" (with the dull-toned suffix mo, in the use of which <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59.htm">Psalm 59</a> associates itself with the Psalms of the time of Saul, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1-13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/11-1.htm">Psalm 11:1-7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-1.htm">Psalm 17:1-15</a>, 22, 35, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/64-1.htm">Psalm 64:1-10</a>). The combination &#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;, however, more readily suggests parallel passages like <a href="/proverbs/11-6.htm">Proverbs 11:6</a> than <a href="/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2</a>; and moreover the &#1502;&#1503; of the expression &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;, which is without example in connection with &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;, and, taken as expressing the motive (Hupfeld), ought to be joined with some designations of the disposition of mind, is best explained as an appended statement of the reason for which they are to be ensnared, so that consequently &#1497;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <a href="/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/64-6.htm">Psalm 64:6</a>) is an attributive clause; nor is this contrary to the accentuation, if one admits the Munach to be a transformation of Mugrash. It is therefore to be rendered: "let them, then, be taken in their pride, and on account of the curse and deceit which they wilfully utter." If, by virtue of the righteousness of the Ruler of the world, their sin has thus become their fall, then, after they have been as it were a warning example to Israel, God is utterly to remove them out of the way, in order that they (it is unnecessary to suppose any change of subject), while perishing, may perceive that Elohim is Ruler in Jacob (&#1489;&#1468;, used elsewhere of the object, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>, is here used of the place of dominion), and as in Jacob, so from thence unto the ends of the earth (&#1500; like &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/48-11.htm">Psalm 48:11</a>) wields the sceptre. Just like the first group of the first part, this first group of the second part also closes with Sela.<p>The second group opens like the second group in the first part, but with this exception, that here we read &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, which loosely connects it with what precedes, whereas there it is &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;. The poet's gaze is again turned towards his present straitened condition, and again the pack of dogs by which Saul is hunting him present themselves to his mind. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; points towards an antithesis that follows, and which finds its expression in &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; stand in direct contrast to one another, and in addition to this &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; has preceded. The reading of the lxx (Vulgate, Luther, [and authorized version]), &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, is thereby proved to be erroneous. But if &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is the correct reading, then it follows that we have to take <a href="/psalms/59-16.htm">Psalm 59:16</a> not as foretelling what will take place, but as describing that which is present; so that consequently the fut. consec. (as is frequently the case apart from any historical connection) is only a consecutive continuation of &#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (for which the Ker has &#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;; the form that was required in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>, but is inadmissible here): they wander up and down (&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, cf. &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, <a href="/job/15-23.htm">Job 15:23</a>) to eat (that is to say, seeking after food); and if they are not satisfied, they pass the night, i.e., remain, eager for food and expecting it, over night on the spot. This interpretation is the most natural, the simplest, and the one that harmonizes best not only with the text before us (the punctuation &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, not &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, gives the member of the clause the impress of being a protasis), but also with the situation. The poet describes the activity of his enemies, and that by completing or retouching the picture of their comparison to dogs: he himself is the food or prey for which they are so eager, and which they would not willingly allow to escape them, and which they nevertheless cannot get within their grasp. Their morbid desire remains unsatisfied: he, however, in the morning, is able to sing of the power of God, which protects him, and exultantly to praise God's loving-kindness, which satiates and satisfies him (<a href="/psalms/90-14.htm">Psalm 90:14</a>); for in the day of fear, which to him is now past, God was his inaccessible stronghold, his unapproachable asylum. To this God, then, even further the play of his harp shall be directed (&#1488;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;), just as was his waiting or hoping (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a>). </body></html>
