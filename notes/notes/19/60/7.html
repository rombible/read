The man who is a new creature in Christ, may rejoice in all the precious promises God has spoken in his holiness. His present privileges, and the sanctifying influences of the Spirit, are sure earnests of heavenly glory. David rejoices in conquering the neighbouring nations, which had been enemies to Israel. The Israel of God are through Christ more than conquerors. Though sometimes they think that the Lord has cast them off, yet he will bring them into the strong city at last. Faith in the promise will assure us that it is our Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom: But we are not yet made complete conquerors, and no true believer will abuse these truths to indulge sloth, or vain confidence. Hope in God is the best principle of true courage, for what need those fear who have God on their side? All our victories are from him, and while those who willingly submit to our anointed King shall share his glories, all his foes shall be put under his feet.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine - That is, My dominion or authority is extended over these regions - Gilead, Manasseh, Ephraim, and Judah. The idea here is substantially the same as in the former verse, that his dominion extended over the country on both sides of the Jordan; or that in the direction of east and west it embraced all that had been promised - "from the great sea to the river Euphrates." In verse 6, this idea is expressed by selecting two spots or towns as representatives of the whole country - Shechem on the west, and Succoth on the east; in this verse, the same idea is expressed by a reference to the two regions so situated - Gilead and Manasseh on the east, and Ephraim and Judah on the west. Gilead was on the east of the river Jordan, properly embracing the mountainous region south of the river Jabbok, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-21.htm">Genesis 31:21-48</a>; Sol 4:1. The word has sometimes, however, a wider signification, including the whole mountainous tract between the rivers Arnon and Bashan, and thus including the region occupied by the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-26.htm">Numbers 32:26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-29.htm">Numbers 32:29</a>, <a href="/numbers/32-39.htm">Numbers 32:39</a>. Hence, in this place, it is put for the region occupied by the tribes of Reuben and Gad. "Manasseh" refers to the district or region occupied by the half tribe of Manasseh, on the east of the Jordan. These two portions - Gilead and Manasseh - or, Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh - would, therefore, embrace the whole of the land of promise, north and south, on the east of the Jordan. The limits of these regions to the east were properly the banks of the Euphrates; that is, the original promise would embrace this. David had gone to carry the boundaries of his country to those assigned limits <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a>, and he now says that he had completed that undertaking.<p>Ephraim also - Ephraim and Judah were the principal tribes on the west of the Jordan, and they would well represent that part of Canaan. The idea is, that the whole of the promised land, east and west, was now under his control. There needed only the territory of Edom, on the south, to complete the conquest, and place the whole of the promised land under his dominion, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8-9</a>.<p>Is the strength of my head - This means that Ephraim constituted his chief strength, or was that on which he mainly relied. It was that which protected him, as the helmet does the head; that on which his very life in battle depended. This honor is given to the tribe of Ephraim because it was one of the largest tribes, and because it was situated in the very center of the land.<p>Judah is my lawgiver - This means that the tribe of Judah, by its position, its numbers, and the prominence given to it in the prophecies <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-12</a>, actually gave law to the nation. Its influence was felt in all the institutions of the land. The controlling influence went out from that tribe in the time of David; and its authority in this respect was recognized, perhaps partly in anticipation of what it had been said would be its importance in future times: "The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come." <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

For (1) The words, beginning with &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;, do not sound like an utterance of something worthy of complaint - in this case it ought at least to have been expressed by &#1506;&#1498; &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505; (only for flight, not for victory); (2) it is more than improbable that the bow, instead of being called &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; (feminine of the Arabic masculine kaus), is here, according to an incorrect Aramaic form of writing, called &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;, whereas this word in its primary form &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496; (<a href="/proverbs/22-21.htm">Proverbs 22:21</a>) corresponds to the Aramaic &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1488; not in the signification "a bow," but (as it is also intended in the Targum of our passage) in the signification "truth" (Arabic k&#803;ist&#803; of strict unswerving justice, root &#1511;&#1513;, to be hard, strong, firm; just as, vice versa, the word s&#803;idk&#803;, coming from a synonymous root, is equivalent to "truth"). We therefore take the perfect predication, like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-4.htm">Psalm 60:4</a>, as the foundation of the prayer which follows: Thou hast given those who fear Thee a banner to muster themselves (sich aufpanieren), i.e., to raise themselves as around a standard or like a standard, on account of the truth - help then, in order that Thy beloved ones may be delivered, with Thy right hand, and answer me. This rendering, in accordance with which <a href="/psalms/60-6.htm">Psalm 60:6</a> expresses the good cause of Israel in opposition to its enemies, is also favoured by the heightened effect of the music, which comes in here, as Sela prescribes. The reflexive &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505; here therefore signifies not, as Hithpal. of &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, "to betake one's self to flight," but "to raise one's self" - a signification on behalf of which we cannot appeal to <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a>, where &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505;&#1493;&#1514; is apparently equivalent to &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1510;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; "sparkling," but which here results from the juxtaposition with &#1504;&#1505;     (cf. &#1504;&#1505;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/4-7.htm">Psalm 4:7</a>), inasmuch as &#1504;&#1505; itself, like Arab. nas&#803;s&#803;un, is so called from &#1504;&#1505;&#1505;, Arab. nas&#803;s&#803;, to set up, raise, whether it be that the Hithpo. falls back upon the Kal of the verb or that it is intended as a denominative (to raise one's self as a banner, sich aufpanieren).<p>(Note: This expression wel illustrates the power of the German language in coining words, so that the language critically dealt with may be exactly reproduced to the German mind. The meaning will at once be clear when we inform our readers that Panier is a banner of standard; the reflexive denominative, therefore, in imitation of the Hebrew, sich aufpanieren signifies to "up-standard one's self," to raise one's self up after the manner of a standard, which being "done into English" may mean to rally (as around a standard). We have done our best above faithfully to convey the meaning of the German text, and we leave our readers to infer from this illustration the difficulties with which translators have not unfrequently to contend. - Tr.])<p>It is undeniable that not merely in later (e.g., <a href="/nehemiah/5-15.htm">Nehemiah 5:15</a>), but also even in older Hebrew, &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; denotes the reason and motive (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20</a>). Moreover <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44.htm">Psalm 44</a> is like a commentary on this &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;, in which the consciousness of the people of the covenant revelation briefly and comprehensively expresses itself concerning their vocation in the world. Israel looks upon its battle against the heathen, as now against Edom, as a rising for the truth in accordance with its mission. By reason of the fact and of the consciousness which are expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-6.htm">Psalm 60:6</a>, arises the prayer in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a>, that Jahve would interpose to help and to rescue His own people from the power of the enemy. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498; is instrumental (vid., on <a href="/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>). It is to be read &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; according to the Ker, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/108-7.htm">Psalm 108:7</a>, instead of &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;; so that here the king of Israel is speaking, who, as he prays, stands in the place of his people. </body></html>
