And when God is turning his hand in our favour, it is good to remember our former troubles. In God's displeasure their troubles began, therefore in his favour their prosperity must begin. Those breaches and divisions which the folly and corruption of man make, nothing but the wisdom and grace of God can repair, by pouring out a spirit of love and peace, by which only a kingdom is saved from ruin. The anger of God against sin, is the only cause of all misery, private or public, that has been, is, or shall be. In all these cases there is no remedy, but by returning to the Lord with repentance, faith, and prayer; beseeching him to return to us. Christ, the Son of David, is given for a banner to those that fear God; in him they are gathered together in one, and take courage. In his name and strength they wage war with the powers of darkness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast made the earth to tremble - This refers, doubtless, to some calamity that might be compared with an earthquake - some disaster, discomfiture, or defeat that had shaken their hopes, as a city is shaken by an earthquake.

The war with Edom, by Joab and Abishai (2Ch 18:12, 25), occurred about the same time. Probably, while doubts and fears alternately prevailed respecting the issue of these wars, the writer composed this Psalm, in which he depicts, in the language of God's people, their sorrows under former disasters, offers prayer in present straits, and rejoices in confident hope of triumph by God's aid.<p>1-3. allude to disasters.<p>cast &#8230; off&#8212;in scorn (Ps 43:2; 44:9).<p>scattered&#8212;broken our strength (compare 2Sa 5:20).<p>Oh, turn thyself&#8212;or, "restore to us" (prosperity).

Hope reigns, and anger burns more fiercely. The Ker says that <a href="/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a> is to be read: &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;, my gracious God will anticipate me, - but with what? This question altogether disappears if we retain the Chethb and point &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;: my God will anticipate me with His mercy (cf. <a href="/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>), i.e., will meet me bringing His mercy without any effort of mine. Even the old translators have felt that chcdw must belong to the verb as a second object. The lxx is perfectly correct in its rendering, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;. The Ker has come into existence in looking to v. 18, according to which it seems as though &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; ought to be added to the refrain, <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> (cf. a similar instance in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6-7</a>). But <a href="/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a> would be stunted by doing this, and it accords with Biblical poetic usage that the refrain in v. 18 should be climactic in comparison with <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> (just as it also does not altogether harmonize in its first half); so that Olshausen's proposal to close <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; and to begin <a href="/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a> with &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493; (cf. <a href="/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a>) is only just to be put on record. The prayer "slay them not" does not contradict the prayer that follows for their destruction. The poet wishes that those who lie in wait for him, before they are totally swept away, may remain for a season before the eyes of this people as an example of punishment. In accordance with this, &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;, by a comparison of the Hiph. in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-13.htm">Numbers 32:13</a>, and of the Kal in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-16.htm">Psalm 59:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, is to be rendered: cause them to wander about (Targum, cf. Genesis Rabba, ch. 38 init., &#1496;&#1500;&#1496;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;); and in connection with &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; one is involuntarily reminded of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-10.htm">Psalm 10:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-14.htm">Psalm 10:14</a>, and is tempted to read &#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1498; or &#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1498;: cause them to wander about in adversity or wretchedness,  equals  Arab. &#8219;umr h&#803;a&#770;lik, vita caliginosa h. e. misera), and more especially since &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; occurs nowhere else instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1498; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498;. But the Jod in &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; is unfavourable to this supposition; and since the martial apostrophe of God by "our shield" follows, the choice of the word is explained by the consideration that the poet conceives of the power of God as an army (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>), and perhaps thinks directly of the heavenly host (<a href="/joel/3-11.htm">Joel 3:11</a>), over which the Lord of Hosts holds command (Hitzig). By means of this He is first of all to cause them to go astray (&#1504;&#1506; &#1493;&#1504;&#1491;, <a href="/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12</a>), then utterly to cast them down (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>). The Lord (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;) is to do this, as truly as He is Israel's shield against all the heathen and all pseudo-Israelites who have become as heathen. The first member of <a href="/psalms/59-13.htm">Psalm 59:13</a> is undoubtedly meant descriptively: "the sin of their mouth (the sin of the tongue) is the word of their lips" (with the dull-toned suffix mo, in the use of which <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59.htm">Psalm 59</a> associates itself with the Psalms of the time of Saul, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1-13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/11-1.htm">Psalm 11:1-7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-1.htm">Psalm 17:1-15</a>, 22, 35, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/64-1.htm">Psalm 64:1-10</a>). The combination &#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;, however, more readily suggests parallel passages like <a href="/proverbs/11-6.htm">Proverbs 11:6</a> than <a href="/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2</a>; and moreover the &#1502;&#1503; of the expression &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;, which is without example in connection with &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;, and, taken as expressing the motive (Hupfeld), ought to be joined with some designations of the disposition of mind, is best explained as an appended statement of the reason for which they are to be ensnared, so that consequently &#1497;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <a href="/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/64-6.htm">Psalm 64:6</a>) is an attributive clause; nor is this contrary to the accentuation, if one admits the Munach to be a transformation of Mugrash. It is therefore to be rendered: "let them, then, be taken in their pride, and on account of the curse and deceit which they wilfully utter." If, by virtue of the righteousness of the Ruler of the world, their sin has thus become their fall, then, after they have been as it were a warning example to Israel, God is utterly to remove them out of the way, in order that they (it is unnecessary to suppose any change of subject), while perishing, may perceive that Elohim is Ruler in Jacob (&#1489;&#1468;, used elsewhere of the object, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>, is here used of the place of dominion), and as in Jacob, so from thence unto the ends of the earth (&#1500; like &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/48-11.htm">Psalm 48:11</a>) wields the sceptre. Just like the first group of the first part, this first group of the second part also closes with Sela.<p>The second group opens like the second group in the first part, but with this exception, that here we read &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, which loosely connects it with what precedes, whereas there it is &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;. The poet's gaze is again turned towards his present straitened condition, and again the pack of dogs by which Saul is hunting him present themselves to his mind. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; points towards an antithesis that follows, and which finds its expression in &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; stand in direct contrast to one another, and in addition to this &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; has preceded. The reading of the lxx (Vulgate, Luther, [and authorized version]), &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, is thereby proved to be erroneous. But if &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is the correct reading, then it follows that we have to take <a href="/psalms/59-16.htm">Psalm 59:16</a> not as foretelling what will take place, but as describing that which is present; so that consequently the fut. consec. (as is frequently the case apart from any historical connection) is only a consecutive continuation of &#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (for which the Ker has &#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;; the form that was required in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>, but is inadmissible here): they wander up and down (&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, cf. &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, <a href="/job/15-23.htm">Job 15:23</a>) to eat (that is to say, seeking after food); and if they are not satisfied, they pass the night, i.e., remain, eager for food and expecting it, over night on the spot. This interpretation is the most natural, the simplest, and the one that harmonizes best not only with the text before us (the punctuation &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, not &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, gives the member of the clause the impress of being a protasis), but also with the situation. The poet describes the activity of his enemies, and that by completing or retouching the picture of their comparison to dogs: he himself is the food or prey for which they are so eager, and which they would not willingly allow to escape them, and which they nevertheless cannot get within their grasp. Their morbid desire remains unsatisfied: he, however, in the morning, is able to sing of the power of God, which protects him, and exultantly to praise God's loving-kindness, which satiates and satisfies him (<a href="/psalms/90-14.htm">Psalm 90:14</a>); for in the day of fear, which to him is now past, God was his inaccessible stronghold, his unapproachable asylum. To this God, then, even further the play of his harp shall be directed (&#1488;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;), just as was his waiting or hoping (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a>). </body></html>
