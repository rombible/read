And when God is turning his hand in our favour, it is good to remember our former troubles. In God's displeasure their troubles began, therefore in his favour their prosperity must begin. Those breaches and divisions which the folly and corruption of man make, nothing but the wisdom and grace of God can repair, by pouring out a spirit of love and peace, by which only a kingdom is saved from ruin. The anger of God against sin, is the only cause of all misery, private or public, that has been, is, or shall be. In all these cases there is no remedy, but by returning to the Lord with repentance, faith, and prayer; beseeching him to return to us. Christ, the Son of David, is given for a banner to those that fear God; in him they are gathered together in one, and take courage. In his name and strength they wage war with the powers of darkness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee - The word rendered "banner" - &#1504;&#1505;  ne&#770;s - means properly anything elevated or lifted up, and hence, a standard, a flag, a sign, or a signal. It may refer to a standard reared on lofty mountains or high places during an invasion of a country, to point out to the people a place of rendezvous or a rallying place <a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/18-3.htm">Isaiah 18:3</a>; or it may refer to a standard or ensign borne by an army; or it may refer to the flag of a ship, <a href="/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-23.htm">Isaiah 33:23</a>. Here it doubtless refers to the flag, the banner, the standard of an army; and the idea is that God had committed such a standard to his people that they might go forth as soldiers in his cause. They were enlisted in his service, and were fighting his battles.<p>That it may be displayed because of the truth - In the cause of truth; or, in the defense of justice and right. It was not to be displayed for vain parade or ostentation; it was not to be unfolded in an unrighteous or unjust cause; it was not to be waved for the mere purpose of carrying desolation, or of securing victory; it was that a righteous cause might be vindicated, and that the honor of God might be promoted. This was the reason which the psalmist now urges why (God should interpose and repair their disasters - that it was his cause, and that they were appointed to maintain and defend it. What was true then of the people of God, is true of the church now. God has given to his church a banner or a standard that it may wage a war of justice, righteousness, and truth; that it may be employed in resisting and overcoming his enemies; that it may carry the weapons of truth and right against all injustice, falsehood, error, oppression, and wrong; that it may ever be found on the side of humanity and benevolence - of virtue, temperance, liberty, and equality; and that it may bear the great principles of the true religion to every territory of the enemy, until the whole world shall be subdued to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.

The Lord has called back to himself his servants, and commissioned them for his service, presenting them with a standard to be used in his wars. "Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee." Their afflictions had led them to exhibit holy fear, and then being fitted for the Lord's favour, he gave them an ensign, which would be both a rallying point for their hosts, a proof that he had sent them to fight, and a guarantee of victory. The bravest men are usually intrusted with the banner, and it is certain that those who fear God most have less fear of man than any others. The Lord has given us the standard of the gospel, let us live to uphold it, and if needful die to defend it. Our right to contend for God, and our reason for expecting success, are found in the fact that the faith has been once committed to the saints, and that by the Lord himself. "That it may be displayed because of the truth." Banners are for the breeze, the sun, the battle. Israel might well come forth boldly, for a sacred standard was borne aloft before them. To publish the gospel is a sacred duty, to be ashamed of it a deadly sin. The truth of God was involved in the triumph of David's armies, he had promised them victory; and so in the proclamation of the gospel we need feel no hesitancy, for as surely as God is true he will give success to his own Word. For the truth's sake, and because the true God is on our side, let us in these modern days of warfare emulate the warriors of Israel, and unfurl our banners to the breeze with confident joy. Dark signs of present or coming ill must not dishearten us; if the Lord had meant to destroy us he would not have given us the gospel; the very fact that he has revealed himself in Christ Jesus involves the certainty of victory. Magna est veritas et praevalebit.<p>"Hard things thou hast upon us laid,<p>And made us drink most bitter wine;<p>But still thy banner we've displayed,<p>And borne aloft thy truth divine.<p>"Our courage fails not, though the night<p>No earthly lamp avails to break,<p>For thou wilt soon arise in might,<p>And of our captors captives make."<p>"Selah." There is so much in the fact of a banner being given to the hosts of Israel, so much of hope, of duty, of comfort, that a pause is fitly introduced. The sense justifies it, and the more joyful strain of the music necessitates it.<p><a href="/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/60.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast given; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The word is, by Jarchi, taken to signify "temptation" or "trial" (o); and he interprets it of many troubles which they had, that they might be tried by them, whether they would stand in the fear of God, and so considers these words as a continuation of the account of the distresses of the people of Israel; but they are rather to be considered as declaring a peculiar blessing and favour bestowed upon some among them, who are here described, when the rest were involved in the greatest calamities, signified by a "banner" or "ensign" given them; by which is meant, not so much David literally, and the victory he obtained over the Syrians and Edomites, of which the banner displayed might be a token; but the Messiah, who is said to be given for a banner, or set up as an ensign for the people, <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>; for the gathering of them to him, to prepare them for war, and animate them to fight the good fight of faith, and oppose every enemy; to direct where they should stand to be on duty, where they should go, and whom they should follow; and is expressive of the victory over sin, Satan, and the world, they have through him: and this is given <p>to them that fear thee; who have the grace of fear put into their hearts; who fear the Lord and his goodness, and serve him with reverence and godly fear; who worship him both inwardly and outwardly, in spirit and in truth, whether among Jews or Gentiles, though the former may be chiefly intended; such as old Simeon, Anna the prophetess, and others, to whom Christ was made known; and especially the apostles of Christ, and those to whom their ministry became useful; whose business it was to display this banner, set up this ensign, and hold out this flag; as it follows: <p>that it may be displayed because of the truth; not because of the truth of Abraham, as the Targum; nor because of the truth, sincerity, and uprightness, of those that fear the Lord; but because of his own truth and faithfulness in the performance of his promises made concerning the displaying of this banner; or the sending of his son into the world, and the preaching of his Gospel in it; see <a href="/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>. <p>Selah; on this word; see Gill on <a href="/psalms/3-2.htm">Psalm 3:2</a>. <p>(o) So Yalkut Simconi in loc. par. 2. fol. 103. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/60.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou hast given <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.

Israel is charged with the maintenance of God’s cause, therefore let Him help them against the heathen. But it is decidedly preferable (cp. R.V. marg.) to follow the LXX, Vulg., Symm., and Jer. in rendering, That they may betake themselves to flight from before the bow (cp. <a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm" title="Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.">Isaiah 31:8</a>). The verse then forms the conclusion of the first stanza of the Psalm. By ‘them that fear thee’ Israel is meant; and the word implies that Israel is loyal to Jehovah (cp. <a href="/psalms/44-17.htm" title="All this is come on us; yet have we not forgotten you, neither have we dealt falsely in your covenant.">Psalm 44:17</a> ff). He has ‘given them a banner’ (cp. <a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm" title="And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:">Isaiah 5:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-1.htm" title="The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.">Isaiah 13:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm" title="Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.">Jeremiah 4:6</a>), raised a standard to summon them to fight for His cause (for the cause of the nation was the cause of its God), in order that they should be put to flight before the enemy’s archers. The words are reproachfully sarcastic, and there is no need to weaken the sarcasm by inserting <span class="ital">only</span> before <span class="ital">that they may betake themselves to flight</span>. God has deliberately mustered His people and led them forth to defeat. They recall (though their spirit is wholly different) the complaint of the Israelites in the wilderness, “Because the Lord hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us” (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-27.htm" title="And you murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.">Deuteronomy 1:27</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The view that <span class="ital"><a href="/context/psalms/60-1.htm" title="O God, you have cast us off, you have scattered us, you have been displeased; O turn yourself to us again....">Psalm 60:1-4</a></span> form the first stanza of the Psalm is confirmed by the position of <span class="ital">Selah</span>, by the commencement of the extract in Psalms 108 with <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/60-5.htm" title="That your beloved may be delivered; save with your right hand, and hear me.">Psalm 60:5</a></span>, and by the symmetry of structure which is given by a division at this point.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/60.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast given a tanner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.</span> So most commentators. But the ancient rendering, recently revived by Professor Cheyne, is perhaps preferable. According to this, the meaning is, "Thou hast indeed given a banner to them that fear thee (see <a href="/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>), but only that they may flee before the bow" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1ffd;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.). On the last occasion that the banner had been lifted, it had seemed to be, not so much a rallying point, as a signal for dispersion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/59.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this second half of the Psalm the cry of fear is hushed. Hope reigns, and anger burns more fiercely. The Ker says that <a href="/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a> is to be read: &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;, my gracious God will anticipate me, - but with what? This question altogether disappears if we retain the Chethb and point &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;: my God will anticipate me with His mercy (cf. <a href="/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>), i.e., will meet me bringing His mercy without any effort of mine. Even the old translators have felt that chcdw must belong to the verb as a second object. The lxx is perfectly correct in its rendering, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;. The Ker has come into existence in looking to v. 18, according to which it seems as though &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; ought to be added to the refrain, <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> (cf. a similar instance in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6-7</a>). But <a href="/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a> would be stunted by doing this, and it accords with Biblical poetic usage that the refrain in v. 18 should be climactic in comparison with <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> (just as it also does not altogether harmonize in its first half); so that Olshausen's proposal to close <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; and to begin <a href="/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a> with &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493; (cf. <a href="/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a>) is only just to be put on record. The prayer "slay them not" does not contradict the prayer that follows for their destruction. The poet wishes that those who lie in wait for him, before they are totally swept away, may remain for a season before the eyes of this people as an example of punishment. In accordance with this, &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;, by a comparison of the Hiph. in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-13.htm">Numbers 32:13</a>, and of the Kal in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-16.htm">Psalm 59:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, is to be rendered: cause them to wander about (Targum, cf.

But the Jod in &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; is unfavourable to this supposition; and since the martial apostrophe of God by "our shield" follows, the choice of the word is explained by the consideration that the poet conceives of the power of God as an army (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>), and perhaps thinks directly of the heavenly host (<a href="/joel/3-11.htm">Joel 3:11</a>), over which the Lord of Hosts holds command (Hitzig). By means of this He is first of all to cause them to go astray (&#1504;&#1506; &#1493;&#1504;&#1491;, <a href="/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12</a>), then utterly to cast them down (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>). The Lord (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;) is to do this, as truly as He is Israel's shield against all the heathen and all pseudo-Israelites who have become as heathen. The first member of <a href="/psalms/59-13.htm">Psalm 59:13</a> is undoubtedly meant descriptively: "the sin of their mouth (the sin of the tongue) is the word of their lips" (with the dull-toned suffix mo, in the use of which <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59.htm">Psalm 59</a> associates itself with the Psalms of the time of Saul, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1-13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/11-1.htm">Psalm 11:1-7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-1.htm">Psalm 17:1-15</a>, 22, 35, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/64-1.htm">Psalm 64:1-10</a>). The combination &#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;, however, more readily suggests parallel passages like <a href="/proverbs/11-6.htm">Proverbs 11:6</a> than <a href="/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2</a>; and moreover the &#1502;&#1503; of the expression &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;, which is without example in connection with &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;, and, taken as expressing the motive (Hupfeld), ought to be joined with some designations of the disposition of mind, is best explained as an appended statement of the reason for which they are to be ensnared, so that consequently &#1497;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <a href="/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/64-6.htm">Psalm 64:6</a>) is an attributive clause; nor is this contrary to the accentuation, if one admits the Munach to be a transformation of Mugrash. It is therefore to be rendered: "let them, then, be taken in their pride, and on account of the curse and deceit which they wilfully utter." If, by virtue of the righteousness of the Ruler of the world, their sin has thus become their fall, then, after they have been as it were a warning example to Israel, God is utterly to remove them out of the way, in order that they (it is unnecessary to suppose any change of subject), while perishing, may perceive that Elohim is Ruler in Jacob (&#1489;&#1468;, used elsewhere of the object, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>, is here used of the place of dominion), and as in Jacob, so from thence unto the ends of the earth (&#1500; like &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/48-11.htm">Psalm 48:11</a>) wields the sceptre. Just like the first group of the first part, this first group of the second part also closes with Sela.<p>The second group opens like the second group in the first part, but with this exception, that here we read &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, which loosely connects it with what precedes, whereas there it is &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;. The poet's gaze is again turned towards his present straitened condition, and again the pack of dogs by which Saul is hunting him present themselves to his mind. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; points towards an antithesis that follows, and which finds its expression in &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; stand in direct contrast to one another, and in addition to this &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; has preceded. The reading of the lxx (Vulgate, Luther, [and authorized version]), &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, is thereby proved to be erroneous. But if &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is the correct reading, then it follows that we have to take <a href="/psalms/59-16.htm">Psalm 59:16</a> not as foretelling what will take place, but as describing that which is present; so that consequently the fut. consec. (as is frequently the case apart from any historical connection) is only a consecutive continuation of &#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (for which the Ker has &#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;; the form that was required in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>, but is inadmissible here): they wander up and down (&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, cf. &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, <a href="/job/15-23.htm">Job 15:23</a>) to eat (that is to say, seeking after food); and if they are not satisfied, they pass the night, i.e., remain, eager for food and expecting it, over night on the spot. This interpretation is the most natural, the simplest, and the one that harmonizes best not only with the text before us (the punctuation &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, not &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, gives the member of the clause the impress of being a protasis), but also with the situation. The poet describes the activity of his enemies, and that by completing or retouching the picture of their comparison to dogs: he himself is the food or prey for which they are so eager, and which they would not willingly allow to escape them, and which they nevertheless cannot get within their grasp. Their morbid desire remains unsatisfied: he, however, in the morning, is able to sing of the power of God, which protects him, and exultantly to praise God's loving-kindness, which satiates and satisfies him (<a href="/psalms/90-14.htm">Psalm 90:14</a>); for in the day of fear, which to him is now past, God was his inaccessible stronghold, his unapproachable asylum. To this God, then, even further the play of his harp shall be directed (&#1488;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;), just as was his waiting or hoping (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a>). </body></html>
