The man who is a new creature in Christ, may rejoice in all the precious promises God has spoken in his holiness. His present privileges, and the sanctifying influences of the Spirit, are sure earnests of heavenly glory. David rejoices in conquering the neighbouring nations, which had been enemies to Israel. The Israel of God are through Christ more than conquerors. Though sometimes they think that the Lord has cast them off, yet he will bring them into the strong city at last. Faith in the promise will assure us that it is our Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom: But we are not yet made complete conquerors, and no true believer will abuse these truths to indulge sloth, or vain confidence. Hope in God is the best principle of true courage, for what need those fear who have God on their side? All our victories are from him, and while those who willingly submit to our anointed King shall share his glories, all his foes shall be put under his feet.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Through God - By the help of God.<p>We shall do valiantly - literally, we shall make strength. That is, we shall gain or gather strength; we shall go forth with spirit and with courage to the war. This expresses the confident assurance that they would secure the aid of God, and that under him they would achieve the victory.<p>For he it is that shall tread down our enemies - He will himself tread or trample them down; that is, he will enable us to do it. The psalm, therefore, though begun in despondency and sadness, closes, as the Psalms often do, with confident hope; with the assurance of the favor of God; and with the firm belief that the object sought in the psalm would be obtained. The history shows that the prayer was answered; that the armies of David were successful; that Edom was subdued; and that thus the territories of the Hebrew people had, in fact, in the time of David, the boundaries promised to Abraham. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/60.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11, 12.

Or, "through the Word of the Lord", as the Targum; Christ, whose name is the Word of God, appearing at the head of his armies, in a vesture dipped in blood, and with a sharp sword proceeding out of his mouth, will inspire his people to fight valiantly under him; and who, in his name and strength, will get the victory over all their enemies, the beast, false prophets, and kings of the earth, and all under them; see <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>; <p>for he it is that shall tread down our enemies; as mire in the street, or as grapes in a winepress; even kings, captains, mighty men, and all the antichristian nations and states; the beast, false prophet, and Satan himself, <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>; and so there will be an end of all the enemies of Christ and his people; after which they will spend an endless eternity together, in joy, peace, and pleasure. The victory is wholly ascribed to God the Word; it is not they that shall do valiantly, that shall tread down their enemies; but he by whom they shall do valiantly shall do it; even the mighty  "He", to whom was promised, in Eden's garden, the bruising the head of the serpent, and all enemies, <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; and who has the same name here as there. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/60.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/60.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">Through God</span>] Cp. <a href="/psalms/56-4.htm" title="In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me.">Psalm 56:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we shall do valiantly</span>] Cp. <a href="/numbers/24-18.htm" title="And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.">Numbers 24:18</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/118-15.htm" title="The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD does valiantly....">Psalm 118:15-16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall tread down our enemies</span>] Cp. <a href="/psalms/44-5.htm" title="Through you will we push down our enemies: through your name will we tread them under that rise up against us.">Psalm 44:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-42.htm" title="Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.">Psalm 18:42</a> (note).

By reason of this he knows himself to be in the free and inalienable possession of the land, and in opposition to the neighbouring nations, Moab, Edom, and Philistia, to be the victorious lord to whom they must bow. The grand word of promise in <a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>. is certainly sufficient in itself to make this feeling of certainty intelligible, and perhaps <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8-10</a> are only a pictorial reproduction of that utterance; but it is also possible that at the time when Edom threatened the abandoned bordering kingdom, David received an oracle from the high priest by means of the Urim and Thummim, which assured him of the undiminished and continued possession of the Holy Land and the sovereignty over the bordering nations. That which God speaks "in His holiness" is a declaration or a promise for the sure fulfilment and inviolability of which He pledges His holiness; it is therefore equal to an oath "by His holiness" (<a href="/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a>; <a href="/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>). The oracle does not follow in a direct form, for it is not God who speaks (as Olshausen thinks), to whom the expression &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1494;&#1492; is unbecoming, nor is it the people (as De Wette and Hengstenberg), but the king, since what follows refers not only to the districts named, but also to their inhabitants. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; might have stood before &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1494;&#1492;, but without it the mode of expression more nearly resembles the Latin me exultaturum esse (cf. <a href="/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a>). Shechem in the centre of the region on this side the Jordan, and the valley of Succoth in the heart of the region on the other side, from the beginning; for there is not only a [Arab.] sa&#770;ku&#770;t (the name both of the eminence and of the district) on the west side of the Jordan south of Beisn (Scythopolis), but there must also have been another on the other side of the Jordan (<a href="/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>., <a href="/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>.) which has not as yet been successfully traced. It lay in the vicinity of Jabbok (ez-Zerka), about in the same latitude with Shechem (Sichem), south-east of Scythopolis, where Estori ha-Parchi contends that he had found traces of it not far from the left bank of the Jordan. <a href="/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> gives some information concerning the &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; (valley) of Succoth. The town and the valley belonged to the tribe of Gad. Gilead, side by side with Manasseh, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>, comprehends the districts belonging to the tribes of Gad and Reuben. As far as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>, therefore, free dominion in the cis-and trans-Jordanic country is promised to David. The proudest predicates are justly given to Ephraim and Judah, the two chief tribes; the former, the most numerous and powerful, is David's helmet (the protection of his head), and Judah his staff of command (&#1502;&#1495;&#1511;&#1511;, the command-giving  equals  staff of command, as in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-18.htm">Numbers 21:18</a>); for Judah, by virtue of the ancient promise, is the royal tribe of the people who are called to the dominion of the world. This designation of Judah as the king's staff or sceptre and the marshal's baton shows that it is the king who is speaking, and not the people. To him, the king, who has the promise, are Joab, Edom, and Philistia subject, and will continue so. Joab the boastful serves him as a wash-basin;<p>(Note: A royal attendant, the tasht-da&#770;r, cup-or wash-basin-bearer, carried the wash-basin for the Persian king both when in battle and on a journey (vid., Spiegel, Avesta ii. LXIX). Moab, says the Psalmist, not merely waits upon him with the wash-basin, but himself serves as such to him.)<p>Edom the crafty and malicious is forcibly taken possession of by him and obliged to submit; and Philistia the warlike is obliged to cry aloud concerning him, the irresistible ruler. &#1505;&#1497;&#1512; &#1512;&#1495;&#1509; is a wash-pot or basin in distinction from a seething-pot, which is also called &#1505;&#1497;&#1512;. The throwing of a shoe over a territory is a sign of taking forcible possession, just as the taking off of the shoe (&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;) is a sign of the renunciation of one's claim or right: the shoe is in both instances the symbol of legal possession.<p>(Note: The sandal or the shoe, I as an object of Arab. wt'&#803;, of treading down, oppressing, signifies metaphorically, (1) a man that is weak and incapable of defending himself against oppression, since one says, ma kuntu na&#8219;lan, I am no shoe, i.e., no man that one can tread under his feet; (2) a wife (quae subjicitur), since one says, g'alaa&#8219; na&#8219;lahu, he has taken off his shoe, i.e., cast off his wife (cf. Lane under Arab. h&#803;id&#817;a'a&#770;', which even signifies a shoe and a wife). II As an instrument of Arab. wt&#803;&#8219;, tropically of the act of oppressing and of reducing to submission, the Arab. wa&#8219;l serves as a symbol of subjugation to the dominion of another. Rosenmller (Das alte und neue Morgenland, No. 483) shows that the Abyssinian kings, at least, cast a shoe upon anything as a sign of taking forcible possession. Even supposing this usage is based upon the above passage of the Psalms, it proves, however, that a people thinking and speaking after the Oriental type associated this meaning with the casting of a shoe upon anything. - Fleischer. Cf. Wetzstein's Excursus at the end of this volume.)<p>The rendering of the last line, with Hitzig and Hengstenberg: "exult concerning me, O Philistia," i.e., hail me, though compelled to do so, as king, is forbidden by the &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, instead of which we must have looked for &#1500;&#1497;. The verb &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; certainly has the general signification "to break out into a loud cry," and like the Hiph. (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a>) the Hithpal. can also be used of a loud outcry at violence. </body></html>
