The man who is a new creature in Christ, may rejoice in all the precious promises God has spoken in his holiness. His present privileges, and the sanctifying influences of the Spirit, are sure earnests of heavenly glory. David rejoices in conquering the neighbouring nations, which had been enemies to Israel. The Israel of God are through Christ more than conquerors. Though sometimes they think that the Lord has cast them off, yet he will bring them into the strong city at last. Faith in the promise will assure us that it is our Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom: But we are not yet made complete conquerors, and no true believer will abuse these truths to indulge sloth, or vain confidence. Hope in God is the best principle of true courage, for what need those fear who have God on their side? All our victories are from him, and while those who willingly submit to our anointed King shall share his glories, all his foes shall be put under his feet.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/60.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give us help from trouble - From the troubles which have now come upon us and overwhelmed us.<p>For vain is the help of man - Margin, salvation. The idea is, that they would look in vain to man to assist them in their present difficulties. They must depend on God alone. What is here said of temporal troubles is true as absolutely in the matter of salvation. When we are burdened with the consciousness of guilt, and trembling under the apprehension of the wrath to come, it is not man that can aid us. Our help is in God alone. Man can neither guide, comfort, pardon, nor save; and in vain should we look to any man, or to all people, for aid.

From God all power proceeds, and all we do well is done by divine operation; but still we, as soldiers of the great king, are to fight, and to fight valiantly too. Divine working is not an argument for human inaction, but rather is it the best excitement for courageous effort, Helped in the past, we shall also be helped in the future, and being assured of this we resolve to play the man. "For he it is that shall tread down our enemies." From him shall the might proceed, to him shall the honour be given. Like straw on the thrashing-floor beneath the feet of the oxen shall we tread upon our abject foes, but it shall rather be his foot which presses them down than ours; his hand shall go out against them so as to put them down and keep them in subjection. In the case of Christians there is much encouragement for a resolve similar to that of the first clause. "We shall do valiantly." We will not be ashamed of our colours, afraid of our foes, or fearful of our cause. The Lord is with us, omnipotence sustains us, and we will not hesitate, we dare not be cowards.

To have trouble is the common lot of all men, but especially of the people of God. They have some troubles which others have not, arising from indwelling sin, Satan's temptations, and the hidings of God's face; and as for outward troubles, they have generally the greatest share of them, which are certain to them by the appointment of God, and the legacy of Christ; though they are needful and for their good, and lie in their way to heaven. But perhaps here is particularly meant the time of trouble, which will be a little before the destruction of antichrist; which will be great, and none like it; will be the time of Jacob's trouble, though he shall be saved out of it, <a href="/jeremiah/30-7.htm">Jeremiah 30:7</a>. This will be the time of the slaying of the witnesses, the hour of temptation, that will try the inhabitants of the Christian world; and when the saints, as they do in all their times of trouble, will seek to the Lord for help, in whom it is, and who has promised it, and gives it seasonably, and which is owing wholly to his own grace and goodness; and therefore it is asked that he would "give" it; <p>for vain is the help of man: or "the salvation of man" (w); man himself is a vain thing; vanity itself, yea, lighter than vanity; even man at his best state, and the greatest among men; and therefore it is a vain thing to expect help and salvation from men, for indeed there is none in them; only in the Lord God is the salvation of his people, both temporal and spiritual. <p>(w)  "salus hominis", V.

The sense in which &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is intended becomes clear from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a>, where David uses this word of the defeat of the Philistines, and explains it figuratively. The word signifies to break through what has hitherto been a compact mass, to burst, blast, scatter, disperse. The prayer is first of all timidly uttered in &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489; &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; in the form of a wish; then in &#1512;&#1508;&#1492; (<a href="/psalms/60-4.htm">Psalm 60:4</a>) and &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; (<a href="/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a>) it waxes more and more eloquent. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489; &#1500; here signifies to grant restoration (like &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495; &#1500;, to give rest; <a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>). The word also signifies to make a turn, to turn one's self away, in which sense, however, it cannot be construed with &#1500;. On &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; Dunash has already compared Arab. fs&#803;m, rumpere, scindere, and Mose ha-Darshan the Targumic &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1501;  equals  &#1508;&#1512;&#1506;, <a href="/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>. The deep wounds which the Edomites had inflicted upon the country, are after all a wrathful visitation of God Himself - reeling or intoxicating wine, or as &#1497;&#1497;&#1503; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; (not &#1497;&#1497;&#1503;), properly conceived of, is: wine which is sheer intoxication (an apposition instead of the genitive attraction, vid., on <a href="/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>), is reached out by Him to His people. The figure of the intoxicating cup has passed over from the Psalms of David and of Asaph to the prophets (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>, <a href="/isaiah/51-21.htm">Isaiah 51:21</a>). A kindred thought is expressed in the proverb: Quem Deus perdere vult, eum dementat. All the preterites as far as &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>) glance back plaintively at that which has been suffered.<p>But <a href="/psalms/60-6.htm">Psalm 60:6</a> cannot be thus intended; for to explain with Ewald and Hitzig, following the lxx, "Thou hast set up a banner for those who reverence Thee, not for victory, but for flight," is inadmissible, notwithstanding the fact that &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; nuwc is a customary phrase and the inscribed &#1500;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491; is favourable to the mention of the bow. For (1) The words, beginning with &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;, do not sound like an utterance of something worthy of complaint - in this case it ought at least to have been expressed by &#1506;&#1498; &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505; (only for flight, not for victory); (2) it is more than improbable that the bow, instead of being called &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; (feminine of the Arabic masculine kaus), is here, according to an incorrect Aramaic form of writing, called &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;, whereas this word in its primary form &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496; (<a href="/proverbs/22-21.htm">Proverbs 22:21</a>) corresponds to the Aramaic &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1488; not in the signification "a bow," but (as it is also intended in the Targum of our passage) in the signification "truth" (Arabic k&#803;ist&#803; of strict unswerving justice, root &#1511;&#1513;, to be hard, strong, firm; just as, vice versa, the word s&#803;idk&#803;, coming from a synonymous root, is equivalent to "truth"). We therefore take the perfect predication, like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-4.htm">Psalm 60:4</a>, as the foundation of the prayer which follows: Thou hast given those who fear Thee a banner to muster themselves (sich aufpanieren), i.e., to raise themselves as around a standard or like a standard, on account of the truth - help then, in order that Thy beloved ones may be delivered, with Thy right hand, and answer me. This rendering, in accordance with which <a href="/psalms/60-6.htm">Psalm 60:6</a> expresses the good cause of Israel in opposition to its enemies, is also favoured by the heightened effect of the music, which comes in here, as Sela prescribes. The reflexive &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505; here therefore signifies not, as Hithpal. of &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, "to betake one's self to flight," but "to raise one's self" - a signification on behalf of which we cannot appeal to <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a>, where &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505;&#1493;&#1514; is apparently equivalent to &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1510;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; "sparkling," but which here results from the juxtaposition with &#1504;&#1505;     (cf. &#1504;&#1505;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/4-7.htm">Psalm 4:7</a>), inasmuch as &#1504;&#1505; itself, like Arab. nas&#803;s&#803;un, is so called from &#1504;&#1505;&#1505;, Arab. nas&#803;s&#803;, to set up, raise, whether it be that the Hithpo. falls back upon the Kal of the verb or that it is intended as a denominative (to raise one's self as a banner, sich aufpanieren).<p>(Note: This expression wel illustrates the power of the German language in coining words, so that the language critically dealt with may be exactly reproduced to the German mind. The meaning will at once be clear when we inform our readers that Panier is a banner of standard; the reflexive denominative, therefore, in imitation of the Hebrew, sich aufpanieren signifies to "up-standard one's self," to raise one's self up after the manner of a standard, which being "done into English" may mean to rally (as around a standard). We have done our best above faithfully to convey the meaning of the German text, and we leave our readers to infer from this illustration the difficulties with which translators have not unfrequently to contend. - Tr.])<p>It is undeniable that not merely in later (e.g., <a href="/nehemiah/5-15.htm">Nehemiah 5:15</a>), but also even in older Hebrew, &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; denotes the reason and motive (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20</a>). Moreover <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44.htm">Psalm 44</a> is like a commentary on this &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;, in which the consciousness of the people of the covenant revelation briefly and comprehensively expresses itself concerning their vocation in the world. Israel looks upon its battle against the heathen, as now against Edom, as a rising for the truth in accordance with its mission. By reason of the fact and of the consciousness which are expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-6.htm">Psalm 60:6</a>, arises the prayer in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a>, that Jahve would interpose to help and to rescue His own people from the power of the enemy. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498; is instrumental (vid., on <a href="/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>). It is to be read &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; according to the Ker, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/108-7.htm">Psalm 108:7</a>, instead of &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;; so that here the king of Israel is speaking, who, as he prays, stands in the place of his people. </body></html>
