You call him Master, or Lord; then be his willing, obedient people. Hear the voice of his doctrine, of his law, and in both, of his Spirit: hear and heed; hear and yield. Christ's voice must be heard to-day. This day of opportunity will not last always; improve it while it is called to-day. Hearing the voice of Christ is the same with believing. Hardness of heart is at the bottom of all distrust of the Lord. The sins of others ought to be warnings to us not to tread in their steps. The murmurings of Israel were written for our admonition. God is not subject to such passions as we are; but he is very angry at sin and sinners. That certainly is evil, which deserves such a recompence; and his threatenings are as sure as his promises. Let us be aware of the evils of our hearts, which lead us to wander from the Lord. There is a rest ordained for believers, the rest of everlasting refreshment, begun in this life, and perfected in the life to come. This is the rest which God calls his rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/95.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forty years long - All the time that they were in the wilderness.

But the lxx, which renders &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1; in the passages in Numbers and &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; in the passage before us, leads one to a more correct track. The verb &#1497;&#1506;&#1507; (&#1493;&#1506;&#1507;), transposed from &#1497;&#1508;&#1506; (&#1493;&#1508;&#1506;), goes back to the root &#1497;&#1507;, &#1493;&#1507;, to stand forth, tower above, to be high, according to which &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;  equals  &#1514;&#1493;&#1508;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; signifies eminentiae, i.e., towerings  equals  summits, or prominences  equals  high (the highest) perfection (vid., on <a href="/job/22-25.htm">Job 22:25</a>). In the passage before us it is a synonym of the Arabic m&#305;&#770;fan, m&#305;&#770;fa&#770;tun, pars terrae eminens (from Arab. wfa&#770;  equals  &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;, prop. instrumentally: a means of rising above, viz., by climbing), and of the names of eminences derived from Arab. yf' (after which Hitzig renders: the teeth of the mountains). By reason of the fact that Jahve is the Owner (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>), because the Creator of all things, the call to worship, which concerns no one so nearly as it does Israel, the people, which before other peoples is Jahve's creation, viz., the creation of His miraculously mighty grace, is repeated. In the call or invitation, &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492; signifies to stretch one's self out full length upon the ground, the proper attitude of adoration; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, to curtsey, to totter; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, Arabic baraka, starting from the radical signification flectere, to kneel down, in genua (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;, pronum  equals  procnum) procumbere, <a href="/2_chronicles/6-13.htm">2 Chronicles 6:13</a> (cf. Hlemann, Bibelstudien, i. 135f.). Beside &#1506;&#1501; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;, people of His pasture, &#1510;&#1488;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; is not the flock formed by His creating hand (Augustine: ipse gratia&#770; sua&#770; nos oves fecit), but, after <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-35.htm">Genesis 30:35</a>, the flock under His protection, the flock led and defended by His skilful, powerful hand. Bttcher renders: flock of His charge; but &#1497;&#1491; in this sense (<a href="/jeremiah/6-3.htm">Jeremiah 6:3</a>) signifies only a place, and "flock of His place" would be poetry and prose in one figure. </body></html>
