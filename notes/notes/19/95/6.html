The word here rendered "come" is not the same which is used in <a href="/psalms/95-1.htm">Psalm 95:1</a>. Its literal meaning is "come," and it is an earnest exhortation to come and worship. It is not a particle merely calling attention to a subject, but it is an exhortation to approach - to enter - to engage in a thing. The word rendered "worship," means properly to bow down; to incline oneself; and then, to bow or prostrate oneself before anyone in order to do him homage, or reverence. Then it means to bow down before God in the attitude of worship. It would most naturally refer to an entire "prostration" on the ground, which was a common mode of worship; but it would also express adoration in any form. The word rendered "bow down," means properly to bend, to bow, spoken usually of the knees. <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a> : "every knee shall bow." Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/7-5.htm">Judges 7:5-6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-54.htm">1 Kings 8:54</a>; <a href="/2_kings/1-13.htm">2 Kings 1:13</a>. The word might be applied, like the former word, to those who bow down with the whole person, or prostrate themselves on the ground. <a href="/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>.<p>Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker - The usual attitude of prayer in the Scriptures. See the notes at <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>; compare <a href="/2_chronicles/6-13.htm">2 Chronicles 6:13</a>; <a href="/luke/22-41.htm">Luke 22:41</a>; <a href="/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>; <a href="/acts/9-40.htm">Acts 9:40</a>; <a href="/acts/20-36.htm">Acts 20:36</a>; <a href="/acts/21-5.htm">Acts 21:5</a>. All the expressions here employed denote a posture of profound reverence in worship, and the passage is a standing rebuke of all irreverent postures in prayer; of such habits as often prevail in public worship where no change of posture is made in prayer, and where a congregation irreverently sit in the act of professedly worshipping God. People show to their fellowmen the respect indicated by rising up before them: much more should they show respect to God - respect in a posture which will indicate profound reverence, and a deep sense of his presence and majesty. Reverently kneeling or standing "will" indicate this; sitting does not indicate it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/95.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. come&#8212;or, "enter," with solemn forms, as well as hearts.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/95.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>6 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our maker.<p>7 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.

"O come, let us worship and bow down." The adoration is to be humble. The "joyful noise" is to be accompanied with lowliest reverence. We are to worship in such style that the bowing down shall indicate that we count ourselves to be as nothing in the presence of the all-glorious Lord. "Let us kneel before the Lord our maker." As suppliants must we come; joyful, but not presumptuous; familiar as children before a father, yet reverential as creatures before their maker. Posture is not everything, yet is it something; prayer is heard when knees cannot bend, but it is seemly that an adoring heart should show its awe by prostrating the body, and bending the knee.<p><a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a><p>"For he is our God." Here is the master reason for worship. Jehovah has entered into covenant with us, and from all the world beside has chosen us to be his own elect. If others refuse him homage, we at least will render it cheerfully. He is ours, and our God; ours, therefore will we love him; our God, therefore will we worship him. Happy is that man who can sincerely believe that this sentence is true in reference to himself. "And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand." As he belongs to us, so do we belong to him. "My Beloved is mine, and I am his." And we are his as the people whom he daily feeds and protects. Our pastures are not ours, but his; we draw all our supplies from his stores. We are his, even as sheep belong to the shepherd, and his hand is our rule, our guidance, our government, our succour, our source of supply. Israel was led through the desert, and we are led through this life by "that great Shepherd of the sheep." The hand which cleft the sea and brought water from the rock is still with us, working equal wonders. Can we refuse to "worship and bow down" when we clearly see that "this God is our God for ever and ever, and will be our guide, even unto death"?<p>But what is this warning which follows? Alas, it was sorrowfully needed by the Lord's ancient people, and is not one whit the less required by ourselves. The favoured nation grew deaf to their Lord's command, and proved not to be truly his sheep, of whom it is written, "My sheep hear my voice": will this turn out to be our character also? God forbid. "To-day if ye will hear his voice." Dreadful "if" Many would not hear, they put off the claims of love, and provoked their God. "To-day," in the hour of grace, in the day of mercy, we are tried as to whether we have an ear for the voice of our Creator. Nothing is said of to-morrow, "he limiteth a certain day," he presses for immediate attention, for our own sakes he asks instantaneous obedience. Shall we yield it? The Holy Ghost saith "To-day," will we grieve him by delay?<p><a href="/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a><p>"Harden not your heart." If ye will hear, learn to fear also.

Before him who is the Rock of our salvation, the great God and great King, the Creator of the ends of the earth, the proper object of all religious worship and adoration: Christ is to be worshipped with every part of external worship under the New Testament dispensation; psalms and songs of praise are to be sung unto him; prayer is to be made unto him; the Gospel is to be preached, and ordinances to be administered, in his name; and likewise with all internal worship, in the exercise of every grace on him, as faith, hope, and love: see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-11.htm">Psalm 45:11</a>, <p>let us kneel before the Lord our Maker; both in a natural and spiritual sense: Christ is the Maker of us as creatures, of our souls and bodies; we have our natural being from him, and are supported in it by him; and he is the Maker of us as new creatures; we are his workmanship, created in him, and by him; and therefore he should be worshipped by us, <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>. Kimchi distinguishes these several gestures, expressed by the different words here used; the first, we render worship, signifies, according to him, the prostration of the whole body on the ground, with the hands and legs stretched out; the second, a bowing of the head, with part of the body; and the third, a bending of the knees on the ground; but though each of these postures and gestures have been, and may be, used in religious worship, yet they seem not so much to design them themselves, and the particular use of them, as worship itself, which is in general intended by them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/95.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O come, let us <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.</span><p>(d) By these three words he signifies one thing: meaning that they must wholly give themselves to serve God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/95.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

The figure of God as &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489; is Davidic and Korahitic. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497; &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is explained from <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. Since &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; designates the retribution as a return of guilt incurred in the form of actual punishment, it might be rendered "requite" just as well as "cause to return;" &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, however, instead of &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; (<a href="/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a>) makes the idea expressed in <a href="/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a> more natural. On &#1489;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501; Hitzig correctly compares <a href="/2_samuel/14-7.htm">2 Samuel 14:7</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>. The Psalm closes with an anadiplosis, just as it began with one; and &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; affirms that the destruction of the persecutor will follow as surely as the church is able to call Jahve its God. </body></html>
