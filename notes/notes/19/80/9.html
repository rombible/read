The root of this vine is Christ, the branches are believers. The church is like a vine, needing support, but spreading and fruitful. If a vine do not bring forth fruit, no tree is so worthless. And are not we planted as in a well-cultivated garden, with every means of being fruitful in works of righteousness? But the useless leaves of profession, and the empty boughs of notions and forms, abound far more than real piety. It was wasted and ruined. There was a good reason for this change in God's way toward them. And it is well or ill with us, according as we are under God's smiles or frowns. When we consider the state of the purest part of the visible church, we cannot wonder that it is visited with sharp corrections. They request that God would help the vine. Lord, it is formed by thyself, and for thyself, therefore it may, with humble confidence, be committed to thyself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/80.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou preparedst room before it - The Hebrew word used here means properly to turn; to turn the back; then, to turn in order to look at anything; to look upon; to see; then, in Piel, to cause to turn away; to remove.

First of all the nation is called Israel as springing from Jacob; then, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/81-6.htm">Psalm 81:6</a>, Joseph, which, where it is distinct from Jacob or Judah, is the name of the kingdom of the ten tribes (vid., Caspari on <a href="/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>), or at least of the northern tribes (<a href="/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>.). <a href="/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3</a> shows that it is also these that are pre-eminently intended here. The fact that in the blessing of Joseph, Jacob calls God a Shepherd (&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;), <a href="/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>, perhaps has somewhat to do with the choice of the first two names. In the third, the sitting enthroned in the sanctuary here below and in the heaven above blend together; for the Old Testament is conscious of a mutual relationship between the earthly and the heavenly temple (&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;) until the one merges entirely in the other. The cher&#1515;bim, which God enthrones, i.e., upon which He sits enthroned, are the bearers of the chariot (&#1502;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492;) of the Ruler of the world (vid., <a href="/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>).

Both the comparison, "after the manner of a flock" and the verb &#1504;&#1492;&#1490; are Asaphic, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-52.htm">Psalm 78:52</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1-12</a>. Just so also the names given to the nation. The designation of Israel after the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh attaches itself to the name Joseph; and the two take the brother after the flesh into their midst, of whom the beloved Rachel was the mother as well as of Joseph, the father of Ephraim and Manasseh. In <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a> also, these three are not separated, but have their camp on the west side of the Tabernacle. May God again put into activity - which is the meaning of &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512; (excitare) in distinction from &#1495;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (expergefacere) - His &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, the need for the energetic intervention of which now makes itself felt, before these three tribes, i.e., by becoming their victorious leader. &#1500;&#1499;&#1492; is a summoning imperative.<p>(Note: Not a pronoun: to Thee it belongs to be for salvation for us, as the Talmud, Midrash, and Masora (vid., Norzi) take it; wherefore in J.

It is not a bringing back out of the Exile that is prayed for by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, for, according to the whole impression conveyed by the Psalm, the people are still on the soil of their fatherland; but in their present feebleness they are no longer like themselves, they stand in need of divine intervention in order again to attain a condition that is in harmony with the promises, in order to become themselves again. May God then cause His long hidden countenance to brighten and shine upon them, then shall they be helped as they desire (&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;). </body></html>
