Thus “the psalmist, having described the exaltation of Israel, under the figure of a vine, proceeds, under the same figure, to lament her depression. She is now represented as deprived of the protection of God, the counsels of the wise, and the arms of the valiant; of all her bulwarks and fortifications, and whatever else could contribute to her defence and security; so that, like a vineyard without a fence, she lay open, on every side, to the incursion and ravages of her neighbouring adversaries, who soon stripped her of all that was valuable, and trod her under foot.” — Horne. <span class="ital">The boar of the wood doth waste it — </span>By which he means some one of their most fierce and furious enemies; <span class="ital">and the wild beasts of the field doth devour it — </span>Some other potent enemy that made war upon and wasted them. Theodoret says, that Nebuchadnezzar was intended, and that he is very properly termed, <span class="ital">The wild beast of the field, </span>because he was more fierce than any other monarch. But the psalmist seems rather to refer to times antecedent to the period in which the Jews suffered so much from Nebuchadnezzar, and to intend some of their other cruel and unrelenting heathen enemies, who, like wild beasts, issuing out of a forest, invaded their country, resolved not only to spoil and plunder, but, if possible, to eradicate and extirpate this vine for ever. The metaphor of the vine is thus continued to a considerable length, and carried on very happily through the several particulars. “Among the many elegances with which this allegory abounds, that nicety, observable both in the beginning and close of it, is not the least; the author sliding, as it were, from the comparison into the subject itself, and from thence into the comparison, by an almost insensible gradation.” See Bishop Lowth’s <span class="ital">Tenth Prelection.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/80.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>80:8-16 The church is represented as a vine and a vineyard. The root of this vine is Christ, the branches are believers. The church is like a vine, needing support, but spreading and fruitful. If a vine do not bring forth fruit, no tree is so worthless. And are not we planted as in a well-cultivated garden, with every means of being fruitful in works of righteousness? But the useless leaves of profession, and the empty boughs of notions and forms, abound far more than real piety. It was wasted and ruined. There was a good reason for this change in God's way toward them. And it is well or ill with us, according as we are under God's smiles or frowns. When we consider the state of the purest part of the visible church, we cannot wonder that it is visited with sharp corrections. They request that God would help the vine. Lord, it is formed by thyself, and for thyself, therefore it may, with humble confidence, be committed to thyself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/80.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why hast thou then broken down her hedges? - Why hast thou dealt with thy people as one would with a vineyard who should break down all its enclosures, and leave it open to wild beasts?

The transferring of the smoking (&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;) of God's nostrils  equals  the hard breathing of anger (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/29-19.htm">Deuteronomy 29:19</a>), to God Himself is bold, but in keeping with the spirit of the Biblical view of the wrath of God (vid., on <a href="/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>), so that there is no need to avoid the expression by calling in the aid of the Syriac word &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, to be strong, powerful (why art Thou hard, why dost Thou harden Thyself...). The perfect after &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; has the sense of a present with a retrospective glance, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-3.htm">Exodus 10:3</a>, cf. &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, to be understood after the analogy of &#1495;&#1512;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468; (to kindle  equals  to be angry against any one), for the prayer of the people is not an object of wrath, but only not a means of turning it aside. While the prayer is being presented, God veils Himself in the smoke of wrath, through which it is not able to penetrate.

Bread of tears is, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>, bread consisting of tears; tears, running down in streams upon the lips of the praying and fasting one, are his meat and his drink. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492; with an accusative signifies to give something to drink, and followed by Beth, to give to drink by means of something, but it is not to be translated: potitandum das eis cum lacrymis trientem (De Dieu, von Ortenberg, and Hitzig). &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (Talmudic, a third part) is the accusative of more precise definition (Vatablus, Gesenius, Olshausen, and Hupfeld): by thirds (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;, Symmachus &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;); for a third of an ephah is certainly a very small measure for the dust of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>), but a large one for tears. The neighbours are the neighbouring nations, to whom Israel is become &#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, an object, a butt of contention.
