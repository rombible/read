Hear thou the bleatings of thy suffering flock. The name is full of tenderness, and hence is selected by the troubled Psalmist: broken hearts delight in names of grace. Good old Jacob delighted to think of God as the Shepherd of Israel, and this verse may refer to his dying expression: "From thence is the Shepherd, the stone of Israel." We may be quite sure that he who deigns to be a shepherd to his people will not turn a deaf ear to their complaints "Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock." The people are called here by the name of that renowned son who became a second father to the tribes, and kept them alive in Egypt; possibly they were known to the Egyptians under the name of "the family of Joseph," and if so, it seems most natural to call them by that name in this place. The term may, however, refer to the ten tribes of which Manasseh was the acknowledged head. The Lord had of old in the wilderness led, guided, shepherded all the tribes; and, therefore, the appeal is made to him. The Lord's doings in the past are strong grounds for appeal and expectation as to the present and the future. "Thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth." The Lord's especial presence was revealed upon the mercy-seat between the cherubim, and in all our pleadings we should come to the Lord by this way: only upon the mercy-seat will God reveal his grace, and only there can we hope to commune with him. Let us ever plead the name of Jesus, who is our true mercy-seat, to whom we may come boldly, and through whom we may look for a display of the glory of the Lord on our behalf. Our greatest dread is the withdrawal of the Lord's presence, and our brightest hope is the prospect of his return. In the darkest times of Israel, the light of her Shepherd's countenance is all she needs.<p><a href="/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a><p>"Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us." It is wise to mention the names of the Lord's people in prayer, for they are precious to him. Jesus bears the names of his people on his breastplate. Just as the mention of the names of his children has power with a father, so is it with the Lord. The three names were near of kin; Ephraim and Manasseh represent Joseph, and it was meet that Benjamin, the other son of the beloved Rachel, should be mentioned in the same breath: these three tribes were wont to march together in the wilderness, following immediately behind the ark. The prayer is that the God of Israel would be mighty on behalf of his people, chasing away their foes, and saving his people. O that in these days the Lord may be pleased to remember every part of his church, and make all her tribes to see his salvation. We would not mention our own denomination only, but lift up a prayer for all the sections of the one church.<p><a href="/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3</a><p>"Turn us again, O God." It is not so much said, "turn our captivity" but turn "us." All will come right if we are right. The best turn is not that of circumstances but of character. When the Lord turns his people he will soon turn their condition. It needs the Lord himself to do this, for conversion is as divine a work as creation; and those who have been once turned unto God, if they at any time backslide, as much need the Lord to turn them again as to turn them at the first. The word may be read, "restore us;" verily, it is a choice mercy that "he restoreth my soul." "And cause thy face to shine." Be favourable to us, smile upon us. This was the high priest's blessing upon Israel: what the Lord has already given us by our High-priest and Mediator we may right confidently ask of him. "And we shall be saved." All that is wanted for salvation is the Lord's favour. One glance of his gracious eye would transform Tophet into Paradise. No matter how fierce the foe, or dire the captivity, the shining face of God ensures both victory and liberty. This verse is a very useful prayer. Since we too often turn aside, let us often with our lips and heart cry, "Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved." <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm was composed either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Upon the same occasion with the former, to wit, the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, as most conceive; which yet seems not probable, because here is no mention of the temple, nor of Jerusalem, as there is in the foregoing Psalm; nor of the tribe of Judah, which was most concerned in that desolation; but of Joseph, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/80-1.htm" title="Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.">Psalm 80:1</a></span>, and of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, which were carried captive long before that time; nor do the expressions of this Psalm import such a desolating judgment as those of the former do. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Upon occasion of the captivity of the ten tribes, as some others think. But why then is Benjamin named, which is none of that number, nor went into captivity with them, but was joined with Judah? Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Upon occasion of some other calamity or calamities which befell the tribes of Israel after their division into two kingdoms, and before the captivity and destruction of either of them; in which time all the evils mentioned in this Psalm bid befall them, sometimes in one tribe or part, and sometimes an another, as is manifest from their history. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shoshannim-Eduth</span> seems to be the name of a musical instrument; though many separate the latter part of the word from the former, and expound Eduth, a testimony, or witness between God and his people, of his relation to them, and of their dependence upon him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The psalmist bemoaneth the miseries and sad condition of the church, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/80-1.htm" title="Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth....">Psalm 80:1-7</a></span>; that God’s past manifold mercies are changed into desolating judgments, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/80-8.htm" title="You have brought a vine out of Egypt: you have cast out the heathen, and planted it....">Psalm 80:8-13</a></span>.

The title of a shepherd for the most part belongs to the Messiah, and who is expressly called the Shepherd and stone of Israel, as distinct from the God of Jacob, <a href="/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a> and may be so called because he was to be, and was of Israel, according to the flesh, and sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and appointed by his Father as a Shepherd over them; and it is on the mountains of Israel he provides a good fold, and pasture for his sheep, <a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a> and it is for the spiritual Israel, his sheep, his elect, both among Jews and Gentiles, for whom he laid down his life; by which it appears that he is the good Shepherd, as he also is the great, the chief, the only one; though this character also may be given, and agrees unto God the Father, who rules, and governs, and feeds his people, his spiritual Israel, as a shepherd his flock; and who is addressed by his people, and is desired to "give ear" to their cries and prayers in their affliction and distress: God has an ear to hear his people's prayers, though sometimes they think he does not hear them; but he not only hears, but answers sooner or later, and in his own way; and the consideration of his character as a shepherd may be an encouragement to their faith, that he will hear, and will not withhold any good thing from them, <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>. <p>thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; the posterity of Joseph, the same with Israel, the spiritual Israel, who are like a flock of sheep, a separate people, distinguished by the grace of God, and purchased by the blood of Christ; and as there is but one Shepherd, so one fold, and one flock, and that but a little one neither; and which is sometimes called a flock of slaughter, because exposed to the rage and fury of men; yet a beautiful one in the eye of Christ, which he undertook to feed: and this he leads on gently and softly, gradually, and proportionate to their strength, or as they are able to bear; he leads in and out, and they find pasture; he leads them out of their former state and condition, in which he finds them, out of the pastures of sin and self-righteousness into the green pastures of his love, grace, word, and ordinances: <p>thou that dwellest between the cherubim; which were over the mercy seat, and were either emblems of angels, among whom Jehovah dwells, and is surrounded by them; by whom Christ was ministered to on earth, and now in heaven, and among whom he was when he ascended thither, and where they are subject to him: or of the two Testaments, which look to Christ, the mercy seat, and agree with each other in their testimony of him, and in other things; and where these are truly opened and explained, there the Lord dwells: or rather of the saints of both dispensations, who look to Christ alone for salvation, and expect to be saved by his grace; are both partakers of it, as they will be of the same glory; and among these the Lord dwells as in his temple; though it seems best of all to consider them as emblems of Gospel ministers, since Ezekiel's four living creatures are the "cherubim", <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-20.htm">Ezekiel 10:20</a>, and these the same with John's four beasts, or living creatures, who were certainly men, being redeemed by the blood of Christ; and were ministers, being distinguished from the four and twenty elders, <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a> and among these the Lord dwells, and with them he has promised his presence shall be unto the end of the world: <p>shine forth; either God the Father, who dwelt between the cherubim, over the mercy seat, who sits upon a throne of grace, from whence he communes with his people and communicates to them; and then the request is, that he would shine forth in the perfections of his nature, as he has done in his Son, the brightness of his glory, and in redemption and salvation by him, where they are all illustriously displayed;

The taking over of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/79-6.htm">Psalm 79:6-7</a> from <a href="/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a> is not betrayed by the looseness of the connection of thought; but in themselves these four lines sound much more original in Jeremiah, and the style is exactly that of this prophet, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-3.htm">Jeremiah 2:3</a>, and frequently, <a href="/psalms/49-20.htm">Psalm 49:20</a>. The &#1488;&#1500;, instead of &#1506;&#1500;, which follows &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; is incorrect; the singular &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; gathers all up as in one mass, as in <a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>. The fact that such power over Israel is given to the heathen world has its ground in the sins of Israel. From <a href="/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a> it may be inferred that the apostasy which raged earlier is now checked. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is not an adjective (<a href="/job/31-28.htm">Job 31:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>), which would have been expressed by &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; &#1495;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, but a genitive: the iniquities of the forefathers (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1-13</a>). On <a href="/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a> of <a href="/judges/6-6.htm">Judges 6:6</a>. As is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/79-9.htm">Psalm 79:9</a>, the poet does not mean that the present generation, itself guiltless, has to expiate the guilt of the fathers (on the contrary, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>); he prays as one of those who have turned away from the sins of the fathers, and who can now no longer consider themselves as placed under wrath, but under sin-pardoning and redeeming grace. </body></html>
