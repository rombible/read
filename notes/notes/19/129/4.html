If the metaphor of the preceding verse is continued, the meaning is that the plower’s harness is broken so that they can no longer continue their work. But the figure may be changed; Israel may be the ox, and the cords those which fasten the yoke of servitude upon its neck. Or ‘cords’ may be used generally as a figure for subjection. Cp. <a href="/psalms/2-3.htm" title="Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.">Psalm 2:3</a>. The reference is to the deliverance of Israel from successive oppressions, but especially to the great deliverance from the captivity in Babylon, and to the escape which is the theme of Psalms 124.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/129.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is righteous</span>.

The promissory future in <a href="/psalms/128-5.htm">Psalm 128:5</a> is followed by imperatives which call upon the God-fearing man at once to do that which, in accordance with the promises, stands before him as certain. &#1502;&#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; as in <a href="/psalms/134-3.htm">Psalm 134:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; gives a designed indefiniteness to the first member of the combination. Every blessing the individual enjoys comes from the God of salvation, who has taken up His abode in Zion, and is perfected in participation in the prosperity of the holy city and of the whole church, of which it is the centre. A New Testament song would here open up the prospect of the heavenly Jerusalem. But the character of limitation to this present world that is stamped upon the Old Testament does not admit of this. The promise refers only to a present participation in the well-being of Jerusalem (<a href="/zechariah/8-15.htm">Zechariah 8:15</a>) and to long life prolonged in one's children's children; and in this sense calls down intercessorily peace upon Israel in all its members, and in all places and all ages. </body></html>
