It is valueless for any such purpose; or, is utterly worthless. The phrase "filleth not his hand" seems to be derived from the idea of reaping, where the reaper with one hand takes hold of the grain which he reaps, and cuts it off with the sickle in the other.<p>Nor he that bindeth sheaves - The man who gathers in the harvest. This was commonly performed by a different person from the reaper.<p>His bosom - This word would commonly refer to the bosom of the garment, in which tilings were carried; or that part above the girdle. It may be used here, however, in a larger sense - since it is incongruous to suppose that sheaves of grain would be carried thus - as meaning simply that one who gathered the sheaves would usually convey them in his arms, folding them to his bosom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/129.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

Such grass never rises high enough to be mowed, nor is of that account to have such pains taken with it; nor the quantity so large as to fill a mower's hand, and carry it away in his arms; <p>nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom; when corn is mowed or reaped, the binders come and gather it up in their arms, and bind it in sheaves, and then bring it into the barn; but nothing of this kind is done with grass on the housetops. This represents the insignificancy and worthlessness of wicked men; who, when the harvest comes, the end of the world, will not be gathered in by the reapers, the angels, into Christ's garner into heaven as the wheat, the righteous will; but like the tares and chaff will be cast into unquenchable fire, <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/129.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/129.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">mower</span>] Reaper (R.V.).
