When we give thanks for some one particular mercy, we should remember former mercies. Our joy must not be in the gift, so much as in the Giver. The triumphs of the Redeemer ought to be the triumphs of the redeemed. The almighty power of God is that which the strongest and stoutest of his enemies are no way able to stand before. We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth, and that with him there is no unrighteousness. His people may, by faith, flee to him as their Refuge, and may depend on his power and promise for their safety, so that no real hurt shall be done to them. Those who know him to be a God of truth and faithfulness, will rejoice in his word of promise, and rest upon that. Those who know him to be an everlasting Father, will trust him with their souls as their main care, and trust in him at all times, even to the end; and by constant care seek to approve themselves to him in the whole course of their lives.

On the word rendered "heathen" here - &#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;  go&#770;yim - see the notes at <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>. The word rebuke here does not mean, as it does usually with us, to chide with words, but it means that he had done this by deeds; that is, by overcoming or vanquishing them. The reference is, undoubtedly, to some of those nations with whom the writer had been at war, and who were the enemies of himself and of God, and to some signal act of the divine interposition by which they had been overcome, or in which the author of the psalm had gained a victory. DeWette understands this as referring to "barbarians, foreigners, pagan?" David, in the course of his life, was often in such circumstances as are here supposed, though to what particular event he refers it would not be possible now to decide.<p>Thou hast destroyed the wicked - The Hebrew here is in the singular number - &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;  ra&#770;sha&#770;&#8219; - though it may be used collectively, and as synonymous with the word "heathen." Compare <a href="/isaiah/14-5.htm">Isaiah 14:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/125-3.htm">Psalm 125:3</a>. The Aramaic Paraphrase renders this, "Thou hast destroyed the impious Goliath." The reference is undoubtedly to the enemies meant by the word pagan, and the writer speaks of them not only as pagan or foreigners, but as characterized by wickedness, which was doubtless a correct description of their general character.<p>Thou hast put out their name forever and ever - As when a nation is conquered, and subdued; when it is made a province of the conquering nation, and loses its own government, and its distinct existence as a people, and its name is no more recorded among the kingdoms of the earth. This is such language as would denote entire subjugation, and it is probably to some such event that the psalmist refers. Nations have often by conquest thus lost their independence and their distinct existence, by becoming incorporated into others. To some such entire subjugation by conquest the psalmist undoubtedly here refers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-5.

The words "put under his feet" sound like a paraphrase of the &#1512;&#1491;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; is unlimited, as in <a href="/job/13-1.htm">Job 13:1</a>; <a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>. But the expansion of the expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/8-8.htm">Psalm 8:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/8-9.htm">Psalm 8:9</a> extends only to the earth, and is limited even there to the different classes of creatures in the regions of land, air, and water. The poet is enthusiastic in his survey of this province of man's dominion. And his lofty poetic language corresponds to this enthusiasm. The enumeration begins with the domestic animals and passes on from these to the wild beasts-together the creatures that dwell on terra firma. &#1510;&#1504;&#1492; (&#1510;&#1504;&#1488; <a href="/numbers/32-24.htm">Numbers 32:24</a>) from &#1510;&#1504;&#1492; (&#1510;&#1504;&#1488;) Arab. dna&#770; (dn'), as also Arab. da&#770;n, fut. o., proliferum esse is, in poetry, equivalent to &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, which is otherwise the usual name for small cattle. &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; (in Aramaic, as the name of the letter shows, a prose word) is in Hebrew poetically equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;; the oxen which willingly accommodate themselves to the service of man, especially of the husbandman, are so called from &#1488;&#1500;&#1507; to yield to. Wild animals, which in prose are called &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, (&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;) here bear the poetical name &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-22.htm">Joel 2:22</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/17-44.htm">1 Samuel 17:44</a>. &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; (in pause &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;) is the primitive form of &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, which is not declined, and has thereby obtained a collective signification. From the land animals the description passes on to the fowls of the air and the fishes of the water. &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is the softer word, instead of &#1506;&#1493;&#1507;; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is water. &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is the softer word, instead of &#1506;&#1493;&#1507;; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is used without the art. according to poetical usage, whereas &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; without the art. would have sounded too scanty and not sufficiently measured. In connection with &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; the article may be again omitted, just as with &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; is a collective participle. If the following were intended: he (or: since he), viz., man, passes through the paths of the sea (Bttcher, Cassel, and even Aben-Ezra and Kimchi), then it would not have been expressed in such a monostich, and in a form so liable to lead one astray. The words may be a comprehensive designation of that portion of the animal kingdom which is found in the sea; and this also intended to include all from the smallest worm to the gigantic leviathan: &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; (Apollinaris). If man thus rules over every living thing that is round about him from the nearest to the most remote, even that which is apparently the most untameable: then it is clear that every lifeless created thing in his vicinity must serve him as its king. The poet regards man in the light of the purpose for which he was created. </body></html>
