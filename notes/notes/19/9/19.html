He speaks thus because wicked men, when they are advanced to great power and majesty, are very prone to forget their own frailty, and to carry themselves as if they were gods: and because it is much for the glory of God, and the peace and welfare of the world, that all, even the highest and haughtiest, should know and consider themselves to be dependant, mutable, mortal, and accountable creatures. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:11-20 Those who believe that God is greatly to be praised, not only desire to praise him better themselves, but desire that others may join with them. There is a day coming, when it will appear that he has not forgotten the cry of the humble; neither the cry of their blood, or the cry of their prayers. We are never brought so low, so near to death, but God can raise us up. If he has saved us from spiritual and eternal death, we may thence hope, that in all our distresses he will be a very present help to us. The overruling providence of God frequently so orders it, that persecutors and oppressors are brought to ruin by the projects they formed to destroy the people of God. Drunkards kill themselves; prodigals beggar themselves; the contentious bring mischief upon themselves: thus men's sins may be read in their punishment, and it becomes plain to all, that the destruction of sinners is of themselves. All wickedness came originally with the wicked one from hell; and those who continue in sin, must go to that place of torment. The true state, both of nations and of individuals, may be correctly estimated by this one rule, whether in their doings they remember or forget God. David encourages the people of God to wait for his salvation, though it should be long deferred. God will make it appear that he never did forget them: it is not possible he should. Strange that man, dust in his and about him, should yet need some sharp affliction, some severe visitation from God, to bring him to the knowledge of himself, and make him feel who and what he is.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Arise, O Lord - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>.<p>Let not man prevail - Against thee and thy cause.

He will not suffer man to prevail over God, but with swift judgments will confound their gloryings.

The strophe represents to us how the &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;) cried to Jahve before the deliverance now experienced. Instead of the form &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; used everywhere else the resolved, and as it were tremulous, form &#1495;&#1504;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; is designedly chosen. According to a better attested reading it is &#1495;&#1504;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; (Pathach with Gaja in the first syllable), which is regarded by Chajug and others as the imper. Piel, but more correctly (Ewald 251, c) as the imper. Kal from the intransitive imperative form &#1495;&#1504;&#1503;. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497; is the vocative, cf. <a href="/psalms/17-7.htm">Psalm 17:7</a>. The gates of death, i.e., the gates of the realm of the dead (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, <a href="/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a>), are in the deep; he who is in peril of death is said to have sunk down to them; he who is snatched from peril of death is lifted up, so that they do not swallow him up and close behind him. The church, already very near to the gates of death, cried to the God who can snatch from death. Its final purpose in connection with such deliverance is that it may glorify God. The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; is sing. with a plural suffix just like &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-11.htm">Ezekiel 35:11</a>, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493; <a href="/ezra/9-15.htm">Ezra 9:15</a>. The punctuists maintained (as &#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="/isaiah/47-13.htm">Isaiah 47:13</a> shows) the possibility of a plural inflexion of a collective singular. In antithesis to the gates of death, which are represented as beneath the ground, we have the gates of the daughter of Zion standing on high. &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; is gen. appositionis (Ges. 116, 5). The daughter of Zion (Zion itself) is the church in its childlike, bride-like, and conjugal relation to Jahve. In the gates of the daughter of Zion is equivalent to: before all God's people, <a href="/psalms/116-14.htm">Psalm 116:14</a>. For the gates are the places of public resort and business. At this period the Old Testament mind knew nothing of the songs of praise of the redeemed in heaven. On the other side of the grave is the silence of death. If the church desires to praise God, it must continue in life and not die. </body></html>
