They are always praising God, therefore the psalmist shows his desire that God may be praised in the best manner; also we show that we have communion with spirits above, who are still praising him.

And great numbers there are of them, thousands and tens of thousands, yea, an innumerable company; and all of them are under obligation to praise the Lord for their creation: for invisible spirits, as well as visible bodies, even the celestial thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, were created by him, by Christ, <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>. And for their preservation in their beings, and confirmation in that happy estate in which they were created; being chosen and secured in Christ, the head of all principality and power, and so stood while others fell: and also for the various excellent powers, and faculties and properties, they are endowed with; they excel in strength, are possessed of great agility and swiftness; have a large share of knowledge, of things natural, civil, moral, spiritual, and evangelical; are perfectly holy, and without sin; and happy in the enjoyment of God, in whose presence they always are, and whose face they continually behold; and will ever remain in this state, being immaterial and immortal beings. And as praise is their duty, it is their work; in this they were employed at the creation of all things, then these sons of God and morning stars sang and shouted for joy; and at the incarnation of Christ, when they worshipped him; at the conversion of every sinner; and frequently join the church in this service, and will be concerned in it to all eternity: and when the psalmist calls upon them to engage in it, it does not suppose that they were deficient in it, or backward to it, or that he had any authority over them to require it of them; but it shows his great desire that the Lord might be praised by the noblest creatures, and in the best manner that could be, and how much his heart was in this work; and he does it to stir up himself and others the more unto it, from this consideration; that if those heavenly creatures should praise the Lord, then much more such as he and others, who were so very unworthy of the divine favours, and so much beholden to the Lord for them; <p>praise ye him, all his hosts; meaning either the angels as before, sometimes called the hosts of heaven, and the heavenly host; there being armies and legions of them, and these encamping about the saints in a military way; see <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>; or else the celestial bodies, the sun, moon, and stars, as follow, sometimes called the host of heaven; and who are represented as militant, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1</a>, <a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/148.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Praise ye him, all <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.</span><p>(a) Because they are members of the same body, he sets them before our eyes, who are most willing and by their prompt obedience teach us to do our duty.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/148.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>.

The call goes forth to the church again on the soil of the land of promise assembled round about Jerusalem. The holy city has again risen out of its ruins; it now once more has gates which can stand open in the broad daylight, and can be closed and bolted when the darkness comes on for the security of the municipality that is only just growing into power (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-1.htm">Nehemiah 7:1-4</a>). The blessing of God again rests upon the children of the sacred metropolis. Its territory, which has experienced all the sufferings of war, and formerly resounded with the tumult of arms and cries of woe and destruction, God has now, from being an arena of conflict, made into peace (the accusative of the effect, and therefore different from <a href="/isaiah/60-17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>); and since the land can now again be cultivated in peace, the ancient promise (<a href="/psalms/81-17.htm">Psalm 81:17</a>) is fulfilled, that God would feed His people, if they would only obey Him, with the fat of wheat. The God of Israel is the almighty Governor of nature. It is He who sends His fiat (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; after the manner of the &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; of the history of creation, cf. <a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>) earthwards (&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the accusative of the direction). The word is His messenger (vid., on <a href="/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>), &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;, i.e., it runs as swiftly as possible, viz., in order to execute the errand on which it is sent. He it is who sends down snow-flakes like flocks of wool, so that the fields are covered with snow as with a white-woollen warming covering.<p>(Note: Bochart in his Hierozoicon on this passage compares an observation of Eustathius on Dionysius Periegetes: &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;.)<p>He scatters hoar-frost (&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512; from &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;, to cover over with the fine frozen dew or mist as though they were powdered with ashes that the wind had blown about. Another time He casts His ice<p>(Note: lxx (Italic, Vulgate) &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, i.e., ice, from the root &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;, to freeze, to congeal (Jerome glaciem). Quid est crystallum? asks Augustine, and replies: Nix est glacie durata per multos annos ita ut a sole vel igne acile dissolvi non possit.)<p>(&#1511;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493; from &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;; or according to another reading, &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493; from &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;) down like morsels, fragments, &#1499;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, viz., as hail-stones, or as sleet. The question: before His cold - who can stand? is formed as in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>. It further comes to pass that God sends forth His word and causes them (snow, hoar-frost, and ice) to melt away: He makes His thawing wind blow, waters flow; i.e., as soon as the one comes about, the other also takes place forthwith. This God now, who rules all things by His word and moulds all things according to His will, is the God of the revelation pertaining to the history of salvation, which is come to Israel, and as the bearer of which Israel takes the place of honour among the nations, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>., 32-34. Since the poet says &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; and not &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, he is thinking not only of the Tra, but also of prophecy as the continuous self-attestation of God, the Lawgiver. The Ker &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, occasioned by the plurals of the parallel member of the verse, gives an unlimited indistinct idea. We must keep to &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;, with the lxx, Aquila, Theodotion, the Quinta, Sexta, and Jerome. The word, which is the medium of God's cosmical rule, is gone forth as a word of salvation to Israel, and, unfolding itself in statutes and judgments, has raised Israel to a legal state founded upon a positive divine law or judgment such as no Gentile nation possesses. The Hallelujah does not exult over the fact that these other nations are not acquainted with any such positive divine law, but (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>., Baruch 4:4) over the fact that Israel is put into possession of such a law. It is frequently attested elsewhere that this possession of Israel is only meant to be a means of making salvation a common property of the world at large. </body></html>
