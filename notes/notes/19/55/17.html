He shall hear us, and not blame us for coming too often; the oftener the more welcome. David had thought all were against him; but now he sees there were many with him, more than he supposed; and the glory of this he gives to God, for it is he that raises us up friends, and makes them faithful to us. There are more true Christians, and believers have more real friends, than in their gloomy hours they suppose. His enemies should be reckoned with, and brought down; they could not ease themselves of their fears, as David could, by faith in God. Mortal men, though ever so high and strong, will easily be crushed by an eternal God. Those who are not reclaimed by the rod of affliction, will certainly be brought down to the pit of destruction. The burden of afflictions is very heavy, especially when attended with the temptations of Satan; there is also the burden of sin and corruption. The only relief under it is, to look to Christ, who bore it. Whatever it is that thou desirest God should give thee, leave it to him to give it in his own way and time. Care is a burden, it makes the heart stoop. We must commit our ways and works to the Lord; let him do as seemeth him good, and let us be satisfied. To cast our burden upon God, is to rest upon his providence and promise. And if we do so, he will carry us in the arms of his power, as a nurse carries a child; and will strengthen our spirits by his Spirit, so that they shall sustain the trial. He will never suffer the righteous to be moved; to be so shaken by any troubles, as to quit their duty to God, or their comfort in him. He will not suffer them to be utterly cast down. He, who bore the burden of our sorrows, desires us to leave to him to bear the burden of our cares, that, as he knows what is best for us, he may provide it accordingly. Why do not we trust Christ to govern the world which he redeemed?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/55.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray - In another place <a href="/psalms/119-164.htm">Psalm 119:164</a> the psalmist says that he engaged in acts of devotion seven times in a day. Daniel prayed three times a day, <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>. David went, in his troubles, before God evening, morning, and mid-day, in solemn, earnest prayer. So Paul, in a time of great distress, gave himself on three set occasions to earnest prayer for deliverance. See the notes at <a href="/2_corinthians/12-8.htm">2 Corinthians 12:8</a>. This verse, therefore, does not prove that it was a regular habit of David to pray three times a day; but in view of the passage, it may be remarked<p>(a) that it is proper to have regular seasons for devotion, of frequent occurrence; and<p>(b) that there are favorable and suitable times for devotion.<p>The morning and the evening are obviously appropriate; and it is well to divide the day also by prayer - to seek, at mid-day, the rest titan bodily and mental toil which is secured by communion with God - and to implore that strength which we need for the remaining duties of the day. True religion is cultivated by frequent and regular seasons of devotion.<p>And cry aloud - The word here employed properly means to murmur; to make a humming sound; to sigh; to growl; to groan. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>. Here the language means that he would give utterance to his deep feelings in appropriate tones - whether words, sighs, or groans. To the deep thoughts and sorrows of his soul he would often give suitable expression before God.<p>And he shall hear my voice - The confident language of faith, as in <a href="/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/55.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-18.

These being the stated times of prayer with the Jews, and which continued to later ages, <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>. These times, they say (b), were fixed by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: the morning prayer by Abraham, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>, the prayer of the "minchah" by Isaac, according to <a href="/genesis/24-63.htm">Genesis 24:63</a>; and the evening prayer by Jacob, according to <a href="/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>. The prayer of the evening was at the time of the evening sacrifice, to which it is compared, <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>. This was at the ninth hour, at which time Peter and John went up to the temple to pray; and Cornelius prayed in his own house, <a href="/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>. The prayer of the morning was at the time of the morning daily sacrifice, and was about the third hour of the day; at which time the apostles met together for prayer on the day of Pentecost, <a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a>; and that at noon was at the sixth hour of the day; at which time Peter went up to the housetop to pray, <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>. And now, though we are not tied down to these exact and precise times of prayer, yet this teaches us that we ought to pray frequently and constantly, and that a day should not pass without it; and the morning and evening seem to be very proper seasons for it, seeing the mercies of the Lord are new every morning; and we should be thankful for them and the mercies of the night past, and implore divine protection and grace for the day following; and at evening we should express our thankfulness for the mercies of the day, and commit ourselves and families into the hands of God, who is Israel's Keeper, that neither slumbers nor sleeps; <p>and cry aloud; denoting the distress he was in, the fervency of his prayer, and the importunity of it; <p>and he shall hear my voice; this he might be assured of, from the general character of God, as a God hearing prayer, and from his own special and particular experience of the truth of it, and from the promises made unto him. <p>(b) Yalkut Simeoni in loc. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/55.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</span><p>(m) Which signifies a servants mind and sure trust to obtain his portion, which made him earnest at all times in prayer.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/55.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">Evening, and morning, and at noon</span>] <span class="ital">Evening</span> stands first because the day began at sunset.

In the city all kinds of party passions have broken loose; even his bosom friend has taken a part in this hostile rising. The retrospective reference to the confusion of tongues at Babel which is contained in the word &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1490; (cf. <a href="/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25</a>), also in remembrance of &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11-1.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), involves the choice of the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;, which here, after <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>, denotes a swallowing up, i.e., annihilation by means of confounding and rendering utterly futile. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; is the object to both imperatives, the second of which is &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1490; (like the pointing usual in connection with a final guttural) for the sake of similarity of sound. Instead of &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; &#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, the pointing is &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; &#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, which is perfectly regular, because the &#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; with a conjunctive accent logically hurries on to &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; as its supplement.<p>(Note: Certain exceptions, however, exist, inasmuch as &#1493; sometimes remains even in connection with a disjunctive accent, <a href="/isaiah/49-4.htm">Isaiah 49:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/40-10.htm">Jeremiah 40:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>; and it is pointed &#1493; in connection with a conjunctive in <a href="/genesis/45-23.htm">Genesis 45:23</a>; <a href="/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/9-3.htm">Leviticus 9:3</a>; <a href="/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>; <a href="/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a>.)<p>The subjects to <a href="/psalms/55-11.htm">Psalm 55:11</a> are not violence and strife (Hengstenberg, Hitzig), for it is rather a comical idea to make these personified run round about upon the city walls; but (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>, <a href="/psalms/59-15.htm">Psalm 59:15</a>) the Absalomites, and in fact the spies who incessantly watch the movements of David and his followers, and who to this end roam about upon the heights of the city. The narrative in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a> shows how passively David looked on at this movement, until he abandoned the palace of his own free will and quitted Jerusalem  The espionage in the circuit of the city is contrasted with the movements going on within the city itself by the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;. We are acquainted with but few details of the affair; but we can easily fill in the details for ourselves in accordance with the ambitious, base, and craftily malicious character of Absalom. The assertion that deceit (&#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;) and the extremest madness had taken possession of the city is confirmed in <a href="/psalms/55-13.htm">Psalm 55:13</a> by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. It is not open enemies who might have had cause for it that are opposed to him, but faithless friends, and among them that Ahithophel of Giloh, the scum of perfidious ingratitude. The futures &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; and &#1493;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512; are used as subjunctives, and &#1493; is equivalent to alioqui, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>, cf. <a href="/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>. He tells him to his face, to his shame, the relationship in which he had stood to him whom he now betrays. <a href="/psalms/55-14.htm">Psalm 55:14</a> is not to be rendered: and thou art, etc., but: and thou (who dost act thus) wast, etc.; for it is only because the principal clause has a retrospective meaning that the futures &#1504;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; and &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; describe what was a custom in the past. The expression is designedly &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; and not &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1499;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;; David does not make him feel his kingly eminence, but places himself in the relation to him of man to man, putting him on the same level with himself and treating him as his equal. The suffix of &#1499;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; is in this instance not subjective as in the &#1499;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1498; of the law respecting the asham or trespass-offering: according to my estimation, but objectively: equal to the worth at which I am estimated, that is to say, equally valued with myself. What heart-piercing significance this word obtains when found in the mouth of the second David, who, although the Son of God and peerless King, nevertheless entered into the most intimate human relationship as the Son of man to His disciples, and among them to that Iscariot! &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; from &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, Arabic alifa, to be accustomed to anything, assuescere, signifies one attached to or devoted to any one; and &#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488;, according to the Hebrew meaning of the verb &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, an intimate acquaintance. The first of the relative clauses in <a href="/psalms/55-15.htm">Psalm 55:15</a> describes their confidential private intercourse; the second the unrestrained manifestation of it in public. &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; here, as in <a href="/job/19-19.htm">Job 19:19</a> (vid., supra on <a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>). &#1492;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, to make friendly intercourse sweet, is equivalent to cherishing it. &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473; stands over against &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, just like &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, secret counsel, and &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, loud tumult, in <a href="/psalms/64-3.htm">Psalm 64:3</a>. Here &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473; is just the same as that which the Korahitic poet calls &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1495;&#1493;&#1490;&#1490; in <a href="/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>.<p>In the face of the faithless friends who has become the head of the Absalomite faction David now breaks out, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>, into fearful imprecations. The Chethb is &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, desolationes (super eos); but this word occurs only in the name of a place ("House of desolations"), and does not well suit such direct reference to persons. On the other hand, the Ker &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, let death ensnare or impose upon them, gives a sense that is not to be objected to; it is a pregnant expression, equivalent to: let death come upon them unexpectedly. To this &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488; corresponds the &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; of the second imprecation: let them go down alive into Hades (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, perhaps originally &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, the &#1492; of which may have been lost beside the &#1495; that follows), i.e., like the company of Korah, while their life is yet vigorous, that is to say, let them die a sudden, violent death. The drawing together of the decipiat (opprimat) mors into one word is the result of the ancient scriptio continua and of the defective mode of writing, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;, like &#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/141-5.htm">Psalm 141:5</a>, &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;, <a href="/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>. Bttcher renders it differently: let death crash in upon them; but the future form &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;  equals  &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1497; is an imaginary one, which cannot be supported by <a href="/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>. Hitzig renders it: let death benumb them (&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;); but this gives an inconceivable figure, with the turgidity of which the trepidantes Manes in Virgil, Aenid viii. 246, do not admit of comparison. In the confirmation, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, together with the &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; which follows, does not pretend to be any advance in the thought, whether &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; be rendered a settlement, dwelling, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (lxx, Targum), or an assembly (Aquila, Symmachus, Jerome). Hence Hitzig's rendering: in their shrine, in their breast ( equals  &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, <a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>), &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; being short for &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1501; in accordance with the love of contraction which prevails in poetry (on <a href="/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>). But had the poet intended to use this figure he would have written &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1501;, and is not the assertion that wickedness is among them, that it is at home in them, really a climax? The change of the names of God in <a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a> is significant. He calls upon Him who is exalted above the world, and He who mercifully interposes in the history of the world helps him. </body></html>
