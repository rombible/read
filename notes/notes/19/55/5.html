David praying. Prayer is a salve for every sore, and a relief to the spirit under every burden. 2. David weeping. Griefs are thus, in some measure, lessened, while those increase that have no vent given them. David in great alarm. We may well suppose him to be so, upon the breaking out of Absalom's conspiracy, and the falling away of the people. Horror overwhelmed him. Probably the remembrance of his sin in the matter of Uriah added much to the terror. When under a guilty conscience we must mourn in our complaint, and even strong believers have for a time been filled with horror. But none ever was so overwhelmed as the holy Jesus, when it pleased the Lord to put him to grief, and to make his soul an offering for our sins. In his agony he prayed more earnestly, and was heard and delivered; trusting in him, and following him, we shall be supported under, and carried through all trials. See how David was weary of the treachery and ingratitude of men, and the cares and disappointments of his high station: he longed to hide himself in some desert from the fury and fickleness of his people. He aimed not at victory, but rest; a barren wilderness, so that he might be quiet. The wisest and best of men most earnestly covet peace and quietness, and the more when vexed and wearied with noise and clamour. This makes death desirable to a child of God, that it is a final escape from all the storms and tempests of this world, to perfect and everlasting rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/55.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fearfulness and trembling - Fear so great as to produce trembling. Compare the notes at <a href="/job/4-14.htm">Job 4:14</a>. He knew not when these things would end. How far the spirit of rebellion had spread he knew not, and he had no means of ascertaining. It seemed as if he would be wholly overthrown; as if his power was wholly at an end; as if even his life was in the greatest peril.<p>And horror hath overwhelmed me - Margin, as in Hebrew, "covered me." That is; it had come upon him so as to cover or envelop him entirely. The shades of horror and despair spread all around and above him, and all things were filled with gloom. The word rendered "horror" occurs only in three other places; - <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-18.htm">Ezekiel 7:18</a>, rendered (as here) "horror;" <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-6.htm">Job 21:6</a>, rendered "trembling;" and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-4.htm">Isaiah 21:4</a>, rendered "fearfulness."

Fear and dread of mind, and trembling of body; <p>and horror hath overwhelmed me; or "covered me"; he was in the utmost consternation and surprise at what he apprehended would be the issue of things; so Christ in the garden is said to be "sore amazed", <a href="/mark/14-33.htm">Mark 14:33</a>; all which terror, fearfulness, trembling, and horror, arose from a sense of sin imputed to him, even of all the sins of his people, the faith of which must be nauseous to him, and the guilt thereof pressing upon him; and from a feeling of the wrath of God, and the curse of the law, which he endured in the room and stead of his people; and this shows the truth of his human nature, and the weakness and insufficiency of that, without his divine nature, to have performed the great work of redemption; also the evil of sin, the exceeding sinfulness of it, and the strictness of divine justice; and likewise the wonderful love of Christ in becoming a surety for his people, and what ease and pleasure they may take; all the pain, the trembling, and horror, were his, and all the joy is theirs. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/55.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> overwhelmed me.</span><p>(d) There was no part of him that was not astonished with extreme fear.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/55.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">horror hath overwhelmed me</span>] The same phrase as in <a href="/ezekiel/7-18.htm" title="They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.">Ezekiel 7:18</a>, “horror shall cover them.” The word occurs besides only in <a href="/job/21-6.htm" title="Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling takes hold on my flesh.">Job 21:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/21-4.htm" title="My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure has he turned into fear to me.">Isaiah 21:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/55.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</span> A graphic description of the feelings which the apprehension of death naturally excites in a man. Where the expectation of a life beyond the grave was so dim and shadowy as in Judaea at this time, the "horror" of death would be the greater. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/54.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 54:6-9) In this second half, the poet, in the certainty of being heard, rejoices in help, and makes a vow of thanksgiving. The &#1489;&#1468; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1502;&#1499;&#1497; is not meant to imply that God is one out of many who upheld his threatened life; but rather that He comes within the category of such, and fills it up in Himself alone, cf. <a href="/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a>; and for the origin of this Beth essentiae, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a>, <a href="/judges/11-35.htm">Judges 11:35</a>. In <a href="/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a> the Ker&#1502; merits the preference over the Cheth&#1502;b (evil shall "revert" to my spies), which would at least require &#1506;&#1500; instead of &#1500; (cf. <a href="/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a>). Concerning &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;, vid., on <a href="/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>. In the rapid transition to invocation in <a href="/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a> the end of the Psalm announces itself. The truth of God is not described as an instrumental agent of the cutting off, but as an impelling cause. It is the same Beth as in the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1491;&#1489;&#1492; (<a href="/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>): by or out of free impulse. These free-will sacrifices are not spiritual here in opposition to the ritual sacrifices (<a href="/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>), but ritual as an outward representation of the spiritual. The subject of &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; is the Name of God; the post-biblical language, following <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a>, calls God straightway &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;, and passages like <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a> and the one before us come very near to this usage. The praeterites mention the ground of the thanksgiving. What David now still hopes for will then lie behind him in the past. The closing line, v. 9b, recalls <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-21.htm">Psalm 35:21</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>; the invoking of the curse upon his enemies in v. 8 recalls <a href="/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>.; and the vow of thanksgiving in v. 8 recalls <a href="/psalms/22-26.htm">Psalm 22:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-18.htm">Psalm 35:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a>. </body></html>
