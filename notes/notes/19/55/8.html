David praying. Prayer is a salve for every sore, and a relief to the spirit under every burden. 2. David weeping. Griefs are thus, in some measure, lessened, while those increase that have no vent given them. David in great alarm. We may well suppose him to be so, upon the breaking out of Absalom's conspiracy, and the falling away of the people. Horror overwhelmed him. Probably the remembrance of his sin in the matter of Uriah added much to the terror. When under a guilty conscience we must mourn in our complaint, and even strong believers have for a time been filled with horror. But none ever was so overwhelmed as the holy Jesus, when it pleased the Lord to put him to grief, and to make his soul an offering for our sins. In his agony he prayed more earnestly, and was heard and delivered; trusting in him, and following him, we shall be supported under, and carried through all trials. See how David was weary of the treachery and ingratitude of men, and the cares and disappointments of his high station: he longed to hide himself in some desert from the fury and fickleness of his people. He aimed not at victory, but rest; a barren wilderness, so that he might be quiet. The wisest and best of men most earnestly covet peace and quietness, and the more when vexed and wearied with noise and clamour. This makes death desirable to a child of God, that it is a final escape from all the storms and tempests of this world, to perfect and everlasting rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/55.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I would hasten my escape - I would make haste to secure an escape.

If this psalm was composed on occasion of the rebellion of Absalom, it is easy to see with what propriety tiffs language is used.

As doves fly from storm and tempest to their nests in the rocks, so the psalmist would fain haste away from the passions and perils of the city to some safe refuge in the wilds. What he here anticipates, he afterwards accomplished, when he fled from Absalom over Jordan (<a href="/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/55.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this first group sorrow prevails. David spreads forth his deep grief before God, and desires for himself some lonely spot in the wilderness far away from the home or lurking-place of the confederate band of those who are compassing his overthrow. "Veil not Thyself" here, where what is spoken of is something audible, not visible, is equivalent to "veil not Thine ear," <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-56.htm">Lamentations 3:56</a>, which He designedly does, when the right state of heart leaves the praying one, and consequently that which makes it acceptable and capable of being answered is wanting to the prayer (cf. <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>). &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; signifies a shrub (Syriac shucho, Arabic s&#780;&#305;&#770;h&#803;), and also reflection and care (Arabic, carefulness, attention; Aramaic, &#1505;&#1495;, to babble, talk, discourse). The Hiph. &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;, which in <a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a> signifies to lead a roving life, has in this instance the signification to move one's self backwards and forwards, to be inwardly uneasy; root &#1512;&#1491;, Arab. rd, to totter, whence ra&#770;da, jaru&#770;da, to run up and down (IV to desire, will); raida, to shake (said of a soft bloated body); radda, to turn (whence taraddud, a moving to and fro, doubting); therefore: I wander hither and thither in my reflecting or meditating, turning restlessly from one thought to another. It is not necessary to read &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; after <a href="/psalms/77-4.htm">Psalm 77:4</a> instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, since the verb &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;  equals  &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>, 12, is secured by the derivatives. Since these only exhibit &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, and not &#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (in Arabic used more particularly of the raving of love), &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, as also &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;, is Hiph., and in fact like this latter used with an inward object: I am obliged to raise a tumult or groan, break out into the dull murmuring sounds of pain. The cohortative not unfrequently signifies "I have to" or "I must" of incitements within one's self which are under the control of outward circumstances. In this restless state of mind he finds himself, and he is obliged to break forth into this cry of pain on account of the voice of the foe which he cannot but hear; by reason of the pressure or constraint (&#1506;&#1511;&#1514;) of the evil-doer which he is compelled to feel. The conjecture &#1510;&#1506;&#1511;&#1514; (Olshausen and Hupfeld) is superfluous. &#1506;&#1511;&#1492; is a more elegant Aramaizing word instead of &#1510;&#1512;&#1492;.<p>The second strophe begins with a more precise statement of that which justifies his pain. The Hiph. &#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1496; signifies here, as in <a href="/psalms/140-11.htm">Psalm 140:11</a> (Chethb), declinare: they cast or roll down evil (calamity) upon him and maliciously lay snares for him &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1507;, breathing anger against him who is conscious of having manifested only love towards them. His heart turns about in his body, it writhes (&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500;); cf. on this, <a href="/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a>. Fear and trembling take possession of his inward parts; &#1497;&#1489;&#1488; in the expression &#1497;&#1489;&#1488; &#1489;&#1497;, as is always the case when followed by a tone syllable, is a so-called &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1490; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, i.e., it has the tone that has retreated to the penult. (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-38.htm">Deuteronomy 1:38</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-24.htm">Isaiah 7:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-20.htm">Isaiah 60:20</a>), although this is only with difficulty discernible in our printed copies, and is therefore (vid., Accentsystem, vi. 2) noted with Mercha. The fut. consec. which follows introduces the heightened state of terror which proceeds from this crowding on of fear and trembling. Moreover, the wish that is thereby urged from him, which David uttered to himself, is introduced in the third strophe by a fut. consec.<p>(Note: That beautiful old song of the church concerning Jesus has grown out of this strophe: - <p>Ecquis binas columbinas<p>Alas dabit animae?<p>Et in almam crucis palmam<p>Evolat citissime, etc.)<p>"Who will give me?" is equivalent to "Oh that I had!" Ges. 136, 1. In &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is involved the self-satisfying signification of settling down (<a href="/ezekiel/31-13.htm">Ezekiel 31:13</a>), of coming to rest and remaining in a place (<a href="/2_samuel/7-10.htm">2 Samuel 7:10</a>). Without going out of our way, a sense perfectly in accordance with the matter in hand may be obtained for &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496; &#1500;&#1497;, if &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is taken not as Kal (<a href="/psalms/71-12.htm">Psalm 71:12</a>), but after <a href="/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-12.htm">Isaiah 60:12</a>, as Hiph.: I would hasten, i.e., quickly find for myself a place which might serve me as a shelter from the raging wind, from the storm. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1505;&#1506;&#1492; is equivalent to the Arabic rihin sa&#770;ijat-in, inasmuch as Arab. s&#8219;a&#770;, "to move one's self quickly, to go or run swiftly," can be said both of light (Koran, 66:8) and of water-brooks (vid., Jones, Comm. Poes. Asiat., ed. Lipsiae, p. 358), and also of strong currents of air, of winds, and such like. The correction &#1505;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, proposed by Hupfeld, produces a disfiguring tautology. Among those about David there is a wild movement going on which is specially aimed at his overthrow. From this he would gladly flee and hide himself, like a dove taking refuge in a cleft of the rock from the approaching storm, or from the talons of the bird of prey, fleeing with its noiseless but persevering flight.<p>(Note: Kimchi observes that the dove, when she becomes tired, draws in one wing and flies with the other, and thus the more surely escapes. Aben-Ezra finds an allusion here to the carrier-pigeon.) </body></html>
