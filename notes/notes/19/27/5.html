In God let us strengthen ourselves. The gracious presence of God, his power, his promise, his readiness to hear prayer, the witness of his Spirit in the hearts of his people; these are the secret of his tabernacle, and in these the saints find cause for that holy security and peace of mind in which they dwell at ease. The psalmist prays for constant communion with God in holy ordinances. All God's children desire to dwell in their Father's house. Not to sojourn there as a wayfaring man, to tarry but for a night; or to dwell there for a time only, as the servant that abides not in the house for ever; but to dwell there all the days of their life, as children with a father. Do we hope that the praising of God will be the blessedness of our eternity? Surely then we ought to make it the business of our time. This he had at heart more than any thing. Whatever the Christian is as to this life, he considers the favour and service of God as the one thing needful. This he desires, prays for and seeks after, and in it he rejoices.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For in the time of trouble - When I am surrounded by dangers, or when affliction comes upon me.<p>He shall hide me - The word used here means to hide; to secrete; and then, to defend or protect. It would properly be applied to one who had fled from oppression, or from any impending evil, and who should be "secreted" in a house or cavern, and thus rendered safe from pursuers, or from the threatening evil.<p>In his pavilion - The word "pavilion" means "tent" or "tabernacle." The Hebrew word - &#1505;&#1499;&#1492;  suka&#770;h - means properly a booth, hut, or cot formed of green branches interwoven: <a href="/jonah/4-5.htm">Jonah 4:5</a>; <a href="/job/27-18.htm">Job 27:18</a>; see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/4-6.htm">Isaiah 4:6</a>. Then it is applied to tents made of skins: <a href="/leviticus/23-43.htm">Leviticus 23:43</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/11-11.htm">2 Samuel 11:11</a>. It thus is used to denote the tabernacle, considered as the dwelling-place of God on earth, and the meaning here is, that God would hide him as it were in His own dwelling; He would admit him near to Himself; He would take care that he should be protected as if he were one of His own family; as a man protects those whom he admits to his own abode.<p>In the secret of his tabernacle - In the most retired and private part of His dwelling. He would not merely admit him to His premises; not only to the vestibule of His house; not only to the open court, or to the parts of His house frequented by the rest of His family; but he would admit him to the private apartments - the place to which He Himself withdrew to be alone, and where no stranger, and not even one of the family, would venture to intrude. Nothing could more certainly denote friendship; nothing could more certainly make protection sure, than thus to be taken into the private apartment where the master of a family was accustomed himself to withdraw, that he might be alone; and nothing, therefore, can more beautifully describe the protection which God will give to His friends than the idea of thus admitting them to the secret apartments of His own dwelling-place.<p>He shall set me up upon a rock - A place where I shall be secure; a place inaccessible to my enemies.

This, with what follows, is given as a reason why the psalmist desired to dwell in the house of the Lord; because he considered it as a pavilion or booth, as the word (h) signifies in which he should be hid by the Lord, in times of trouble and distress, either through the heat of persecution, or of inward anxiety of mind, caused by the working of a fiery law; the allusion being, as some think, to the shepherd's tent or booth, into which he sometimes takes a poor sheep, and protects it from the scorching heat of the sun at noon: and of such use is the tabernacle of the Lord; see <a href="/isaiah/4-6.htm">Isaiah 4:6</a>; <p>in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; alluding either to the tents of generals of armies, who receive into them those whom they would protect from the insults and injuries of others; or rather to the most holy place in the tabernacle, called the secret place, <a href="/ezekiel/7-22.htm">Ezekiel 7:22</a>; typical of Christ, the hiding place of his, people, in whom their life is hid, and where it is safe and secure; <p>he shall set me up upon a rock; where he would be above and out of the reach of his enemies; meaning Christ, comparable to a rock for its height, he being higher than the kings of the earth, than the angels in heaven, than the heavens themselves, and much more than the sons of men; see <a href="/psalms/61-2.htm">Psalm 61:2</a>; and for shelter and safety, he being a munition of rocks, a strong tower, a place of defence, and rock of refuge; and for firmness, solidity, and strength, he being able to bear the whole weight of the building of the church, and every believer laid upon him; and for duration, he being more immovable than rocks and mountains; so that such who are set up upon him are in the most safe and secure state imaginable. <p>(h) "in tugurio suo", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.
