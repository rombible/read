God calls us by his Spirit, by his word, by his worship, and by special providences, merciful and afflicting. When we are foolishly making court to lying vanities, God is, in love to us, calling us to seek our own mercies in him. The call is general, Seek ye my face; but we must apply it to ourselves, I will seek it. The word does us no good, when we do not ourselves accept the exhortation: a gracious heart readily answers to the call of a gracious God, being made willing in the day of his power. The psalmist requests the favour of the Lord; the continuance of his presence with him; the benefit of Divine guidance, and the benefit of Divine protection. God's time to help those that trust in him, is, when all other helpers fail. He is a surer and better Friend than earthly parents are, or can be. What was the belief which supported the psalmist? That he should see the goodness of the Lord. There is nothing like the believing hope of eternal life, the foresights of that glory, and foretastes of those pleasures, to keep us from fainting under all calamities. In the mean time he should be strengthened to bear up under his burdens. Let us look unto the suffering Saviour, and pray in faith, not to be delivered into the hands of our enemies. Let us encourage each other to wait on the Lord, with patient expectation, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When my father and my mother forsake me - If they should do it. The psalmist supposes it possible that this might occur. It does occur, though very rarely; but the psalmist means to say that the love of God is stronger and more certain than even that of a father or mother, since he will never forsake his people. Though every other tie that binds heart to heart should dissolve, this will remain; though a case might occur in which we could not be sure of the love that naturally springs out of the most tender earthly relationships, yet we can always confide in His love. See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>.<p>Then the Lord will take me up - Margin, "will gather me." The margin expresses the usual meaning of the word. It is sometimes used as referring to the hospitable reception of strangers or wanderers into one's house: <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/19-15.htm">Judges 19:15</a>, <a href="/judges/19-18.htm">Judges 19:18</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-4.htm">Joshua 20:4</a>. The meaning here is, that if he should be forsaken by his nearest earthly friends, and be an outcast and a wanderer, so that no one on earth would take him in, the Lord would then receive him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

They were probably dead at the time of his flight from Absalom. What David means is that, even if forsaken by his nearest and dearest, he would not be forsaken by God. The expression is proverbial. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There is only one thing, that he desires, although he also has besides full satisfaction in Jahve in the midst of strangers and in trouble. The future is used side by side with the perfect in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>, in order to express an ardent longing which extends out of the past into the future, and therefore runs through his whole life. The one thing sought is unfolded in &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. A life-long dwelling in the house of Jahve, that is to say intimate spiritual intercourse with the God, who has His dwelling (&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;), His palace (&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;) in the holy tent, is the one desire of David's heart, in order that he may behold and feast upon (&#1495;&#1494;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468; of a clinging, lingering, chained gaze, and consequently a more significant form of expression than &#1495;&#1494;&#1492; with an accusative, <a href="/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a>) &#1504;&#1506;&#1501; &#1492; (<a href="/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a>), the pleasantness (or gracefulness) of Jahve, i.e., His revelation, full of grace, which is there visible to the eye of the spirit. The interpretation which regards amaenitas as being equivalent to amaenus cultus takes hold of the idea from the wrong side. The assertion that &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468; is intended as a synonym of &#1495;&#1494;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;, of a pleased and lingering contemplation (Hupf., Hitz.), is contrary to the meaning of the verb, which signifies "to examine (with &#1500; to seek or spie about after anything, <a href="/leviticus/13-36.htm">Leviticus 13:36</a>), to reflect on, or consider;" even the post-biblical signification to visit, more especially the sick (whence &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;), comes from the primary meaning investigare. An appropriate sense may be obtained in the present instance by regarding it as a denominative from &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; and rendering it as Dunash and Rashi have done, "and to appear early in His temple;" but it is unnecessary to depart from the general usage of the language. Hengstenberg rightly retains the signification "to meditate on." &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493; is a designation of the place consecrated to devotion, and &#1500;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512; is meant to refer to contemplative meditation that loses itself in God who is there manifest. In <a href="/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a> David bases the justification of his desire upon that which the sanctuary of God is to him; the futures affirm what Jahve will provide for him in His sanctuary. It is a refuge in which he may hide himself, where Jahve takes good care of him who takes refuge therein from the storms of trouble that rage outside: there he is far removed from all dangers, he is lifted high above them and his feet are upon rocky ground. The Chethb may be read &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <a href="/psalms/31-21.htm">Psalm 31:21</a> and with Ewald 257, d; but, in this passage, with &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; alternates &#1505;&#1498;, which takes the place of &#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; in the poetic style (<a href="/psalms/76-3.htm">Psalm 76:3</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a>), though it does not do so by itself, but always with a suffix.<p>(Note: Just in like manner they say in poetic style &#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="/psalms/132-15.htm">Psalm 132:15</a>; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="/proverbs/7-8.htm">Proverbs 7:8</a>; &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a>; &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2</a>; and perhaps even &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="/genesis/40-10.htm">Genesis 40:10</a>; for &#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, and &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;; as, in general, shorter forms are sometimes found in the inflexion, which do not occur in the corresponding principal form, e.g., &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-15.htm">Psalm 49:15</a>, for &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1501;; &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>, for &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1501;; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1502;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-13.htm">Job 5:13</a>, for &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1502;&#1514;&#1501;; &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>, for &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1501;; &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>, for &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1501;; cf.
