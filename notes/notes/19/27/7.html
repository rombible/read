God calls us by his Spirit, by his word, by his worship, and by special providences, merciful and afflicting. When we are foolishly making court to lying vanities, God is, in love to us, calling us to seek our own mercies in him. The call is general, Seek ye my face; but we must apply it to ourselves, I will seek it. The word does us no good, when we do not ourselves accept the exhortation: a gracious heart readily answers to the call of a gracious God, being made willing in the day of his power. The psalmist requests the favour of the Lord; the continuance of his presence with him; the benefit of Divine guidance, and the benefit of Divine protection. God's time to help those that trust in him, is, when all other helpers fail. He is a surer and better Friend than earthly parents are, or can be. What was the belief which supported the psalmist? That he should see the goodness of the Lord. There is nothing like the believing hope of eternal life, the foresights of that glory, and foretastes of those pleasures, to keep us from fainting under all calamities. In the mean time he should be strengthened to bear up under his burdens. Let us look unto the suffering Saviour, and pray in faith, not to be delivered into the hands of our enemies. Let us encourage each other to wait on the Lord, with patient expectation, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice - This earnest prayer seems to have been prompted by a returning sense of danger. He had had assurance of the divine favor. He had found God ready to help him. He did not doubt but that He would aid him; yet all this did not prevent his calling upon Him for the aid which he needed, but rather stimulated him to do it. With all the deep-felt conviction of his heart that God was ready and willing to assist him, he still felt that he had no reason to hope for His aid unless he called upon Him. The phrase "when I cry with my voice" refers to the fact that he prayed audibly or aloud. It was not mental prayer, but that which found expression in the language of earnest entreaty. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

The voice which in the last verse was tuned to music is here turned to crying. As a good soldier, David knew how to handle his weapons, and found himself much at home with the weapon of "all prayer." Note his anxiety to be heard. Pharisees care not a fig for the Lord's hearing them, so long as they are heard of men, or charm their own pride with their sounding devotions; but with a genuine man, the Lord's ear is everything. The voice may be profitably used even in private prayer; for though it is unnecessary, it is often helpful, and aids in preventing distractions. "Have mercy also upon me." Mercy is the hope of sinners and the refuge of saints. All acceptable petitioners dwell much upon this attribute. "And answer me." We may expect answers to prayer, and should not be easy without them any more than we should be if we had written a letter to a friend upon important business, and had received no reply.<p><a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a><p>In this verse we are taught that if we would have the Lord hear our voice, we must be careful to respond to his voice. The true heart should echo the will of God as the rocks among the Alps repeat in sweetest music the notes of the peasant's horn. Observe, that the command was in the plural, to all the saints, "Seek ye;" but the man of God turned it into the singular by a personal application, "Thy face, Lord, will I seek." The voice of the Lord is very effectual where all other voices fail, "When thou saidst," then my "heart," my inmost nature was moved to an obedient reply. Note the promptness of the response - no sooner said than done; as soon as God said "seek," the heart said, "I will seek." Oh, for more of this holy readiness! Would to God that we were more plastic to the divine hand, more sensitive of the touch of God's Spirit.<p><a href="/psalms/27-9.htm">Psalm 27:9</a><p>"Hide not thy face far from me." The word "far" is not in the original, and is a very superfluous addition of the translators, since even the least hiding of the Lord's face is a great affliction to a believer. The command to seek the Lord's face would be a painful one if the Lord, by withdrawing himself, rendered it impossible for the seeker to meet with him. A smile from the Lord is the greatest of comforts, his frown the worst of ills. "Put not thy servant away in anger." Other servants had been put away when they proved unfaithful, as for instance, his predecessor Saul; and this made David, while conscious of many faults, most anxious that divine long-suffering should continue him in favour. This is a most appropriate prayer for us under a similar sense of unworthiness. "Thou hast been my help." How truly can we join in this declaration; for many years, in circumstances of varied trial, we have been upheld by our God, and must and will confess our obligation. "Ingratitude," it is said, "is natural to fallen man," but to spiritual men it is unnatural and detestable. "Leave me not, neither forsake me." A prayer for the future, and an inference front the past. If the Lord had meant to leave us, why did he begin with us? Past help is but a waste of effort if the soul now be deserted. The first petition, "leave me not," may refer to temporary desertions, and the second word to the final withdrawal of grace, both are to be prayed against; and concerning the second, we have immutable promises to urge. "O God of my salvation." A sweet title worthy of much meditation.<p><a href="/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice,.... Which is to be understood of prayer, and that in the time of distress; and of vocal prayer, as distinguished from mental prayer; and the phrase denotes the vehemency and intenseness of it: and the request is, that the Lord would hear it; not only as he is omniscient and omnipresent, and so hears the prayers of all, good and bad; but as a God gracious and merciful, who sometimes very quickly hears, and answers in a gracious way, and sometimes seems to turn a deaf car, to shut out the prayers of his people, and cover himself with a cloud, that they should not pass through, or, however, defers an answer to it for a little while; yet, sooner or later, he always shows himself a God hearing prayer; <p>have mercy also upon me; by delivering him out of his temporal distresses, and by forgiving his iniquities; <p>and answer me; by speaking a word in season; commanding off the affliction he lay under, and by saying to him that his sins were forgiven him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Have mercy</span>] Be gracious.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">7–14</span>.

The rhythm alters from a jubilant double beat to a slow and mournful cadence. A cry is raised for mercy and pity - the wrath of God is deprecated - rejection and desertion are contemplated and prayed against (vers. 7-10). The danger from the enemy appears great and formidable (vers. 11, 12).

It is a hexastich in the caesural schema. Let darkness break in upon him, the darkness of night, of trouble, and of spiritual conflict, yet Jahve is his Light, and if he is in Him, he is in the light and there shines upon him a sun, that sets not and knows no eclipse. This sublime, infinitely profound name for God, &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, is found only in this passage; and there is only one other expression that can be compared with it. viz., &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498; in <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>; cf. &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;, <a href="/john/12-46.htm">John 12:46</a>. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497; does not stand beside &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; as an unfigurative, side by side with a figurative expression; for the statement that God is light, is not a metaphor. David calls Him his "salvation" in regard to everything that oppresses him, and the "stronghold (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; from &#1506;&#1494;&#1494;, with an unchangeable ) of his life" in regard to everything that exposes him to peril. In Jahve he conquers far and wide; in Him his life is hidden as it were behind a fortress built upon a rock (<a href="/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3</a>). When to the wicked who come upon him in a hostile way (&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500; differing from &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500;), he attributes the intention of devouring his flesh, they are conceived of as wild beasts. To eat up any one's flesh signifies, even in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-22.htm">Job 19:22</a>, the same as to pursue any one by evil speaking (in Aramaic by slander, back-biting) to his destruction. In &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; (the Sheb&#1490; of the only faintly closed syllable is raised to a Chateph, as in &#1493;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>, &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, and the like. The &#1500;&#1497; of &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; may, as also in <a href="/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>), be regarded as giving intensity to the notion of special, personal enmity; but a mere repetition of the subject (the enemy) without the repetition of their hostile purpose would be tame in the parallel member of the verse: &#1500;&#1497; is a variation of the preceding &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, as in <a href="/lamentations/3-60.htm">Lamentations 3:60</a>. In the apodosis &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, the overthrow of the enemy is regarded beforehand as an accomplished fact. The holy boldness and imperturbable repose are expressed in <a href="/psalms/27-3.htm">Psalm 27:3</a> in the very rhythm. The thesis or downward movement in <a href="/psalms/27-3.htm">Psalm 27:3</a> is spondaic: he does not allow himself to be disturbed; the thesis in <a href="/psalms/27-3.htm">Psalm 27:3</a> is iambic: he can be bold. The rendering of Hitzig (as of Rashi): "in this do I trust, viz., that Jahve is my light, etc.," is erroneous. Such might be the interpretation, if &#1489;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1493;&#1496;&#1495; closed <a href="/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>; but it cannot refer back over <a href="/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a> to <a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; and why should the poet have expressed himself thus materially, instead of saying &#1489;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;? The fact of the case is this, &#1489;&#1493;&#1496;&#1495; signifies even by itself "of good courage," e.g., <a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>; and &#1489;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; "in spite of this" (Coccejus: hoc non obstante), <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-27.htm">Leviticus 26:27</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-32.htm">Psalm 78:32</a>, begins the apodosis, at the head of which we expect to find an adversative conjunction. </body></html>
