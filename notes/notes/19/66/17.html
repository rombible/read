We cannot share these spiritual privileges, if we retain the love of sin in our hearts, though we refrain from the gross practice, Sin, regarded in the heart, will spoil the comfort and success of prayer; for the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination of the Lord. But if the feeling of sin in the heart causes desires to be rid of it; if it be the presence of one urging a demand we know we must not, cannot comply with, this is an argument of sincerity. And when we pray in simplicity and godly sincerity, our prayers will be answered. This will excite gratitude to Him who hath not turned away our prayer nor his mercy from us. It was not prayer that fetched the deliverance, but his mercy that sent it.

God has averted the peril of death and overthrow from His people: He has put their soul in life (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; in <a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>), i.e., in the realm of life; He has not abandoned their foot to tottering unto overthrow (mowT the substantive, as in <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a>; cf. the reversed construction in <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>). For God has cast His people as it were into a smelting-furnace or fining-pot in order to purify and to prove them by suffering; - this is a favourite figure with Isaiah and Jeremiah, but is also found in <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>. <a href="/ezekiel/19-9.htm">Ezekiel 19:9</a> is decisive concerning the meaning of &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, where &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; signifies "to bring into the holds or prisons;" besides, the figure of the fowling-net (although this is also called &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; as well as &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;) has no footing here in the context. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; (vid., <a href="/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a>) signifies specula, and that both a natural and an artificial watch-post on a mountain; here it is the mountain-hold or prison of the enemy, as a figure of the total loss of freedom. The laying on of a heavy burden mentioned by the side of it in <a href="/psalms/66-11.htm">Psalm 66:11</a> also accords well with this. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492;, a being oppressed, the pressure of a burden, is a Hophal formation, like &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, a being spread out, <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>; cf. the similar masculine forms in <a href="/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-6.htm">Isaiah 14:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>. The loins are mentioned because when carrying heavy loads, which one has to stoop down in order to take up, the lower spinal region is called into exercise. &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; is frequently (<a href="/psalms/9-20.htm">Psalm 9:20</a>., <a href="/psalms/10-18.htm">Psalm 10:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/56-2.htm">Psalm 56:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/14-10.htm">2 Chronicles 14:10</a>) the word used for tyrants as being wretched mortals, perishable creatures, in contrast with their all the more revolting, imperious, and self-deified demeanour. God so ordered it, that "wretched men" rode upon Israel's head. Or is it to be interpreted: He caused them to pass over Israel (cf. <a href="/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-23.htm">Isaiah 51:23</a>)? It can scarcely mean this, since it would then be in dorso nostro, which the Latin versions capriciously substitute. The preposition &#1500; instead of &#1506;&#1500; is used with reference to the phrase &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1500;: sitting upon Israel's head, God caused them to ride along, so that Israel was not able to raise its head freely, but was most ignominiously wounded in its self-esteem. Fire and water are, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, a figure of vicissitudes and perils of the most extreme character. Israel was nigh to being burnt up and drowned, but God led it forth &#1500;&#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;, to an abundant fulness, to abundance and superabundance of prosperity. The lxx, which renders &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; (Jerome absolutely: in refrigerium), has read &#1500;&#1512;&#1493;&#1495;&#1492;; Symmachus, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, probably reading &#1500;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1492; (<a href="/psalms/119-45.htm">Psalm 119:45</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-20.htm">Psalm 18:20</a>). Both give a stronger antithesis. But the state of straitness or oppression was indeed also a state of privation. </body></html>
