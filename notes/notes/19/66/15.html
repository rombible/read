Besides, the ram was not a sacrifice for any individual, but particularly enjoined for the high priest (<a href="/leviticus/9-2.htm" title="And he said to Aaron, Take you a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.">Leviticus 9:2</a>), the head of a tribe (Numbers 7), or a Nazarite (<a href="/numbers/6-14.htm" title="And he shall offer his offering to the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,">Numbers 6:14</a>).

We cannot share these spiritual privileges, if we retain the love of sin in our hearts, though we refrain from the gross practice, Sin, regarded in the heart, will spoil the comfort and success of prayer; for the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination of the Lord. But if the feeling of sin in the heart causes desires to be rid of it; if it be the presence of one urging a demand we know we must not, cannot comply with, this is an argument of sincerity. And when we pray in simplicity and godly sincerity, our prayers will be answered. This will excite gratitude to Him who hath not turned away our prayer nor his mercy from us. It was not prayer that fetched the deliverance, but his mercy that sent it.

The word rendered "fatlings" is rendered in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-17.htm">Isaiah 5:17</a>, lambs. It may be applied to any animal considered as fat - a qualification required in sacrifices to be made on the altar, <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>.<p>With the incense of rams - The word here rendered incense is commonly applied to aromatics which were burned in the tabernacle or temple, producing a grateful odor (see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>); but it seems here to be used with reference to the smoke ascending from burning rams offered in sacrifice - ascending as the smoke of incense did. The smoke thus ascending would be as grateful and acceptable as incense.<p>I will offer bullocks with goats - Bullocks and goats. That is, I will present sacrifices in all the forms required in worship; in all the forms that will express gratitude to God, or that will be an acknowledgment of dependence and guilt; in all that would properly express homage to the Deity.

Burnt offerings of fatlings will I offer unto thee,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Together with incense of rams.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Incense of rams’ denotes the sweet savour of the sacrifice ascending as it was consumed by fire. Cp. perhaps, though the meaning is not certain, <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm" title="Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.">Isaiah 1:13</a>. The cognate verb is used of burning the victim or the fat of the victim on the altar. Thus <a href="/exodus/29-18.htm" title="And you shall burn the whole ram on the altar: it is a burnt offering to the LORD: it is a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Exodus 29:18</a>, “and thou shalt <span class="ital">burn</span> (lit., if an obsolete verb might be revived, <span class="ital">incense</span>) the whole ram upon the altar; it is a burnt offering unto the Lord: it is a sweet savour.” According to the Levitical ritual the ram was to be offered as a burnt offering or peace offering only by the whole people or its princes, by the high-priest or an ordinary priest, or by a Nazirite; never by an ordinary individual (by whom however it was to be used as a trespass offering). <span class="ital">He-goats</span> are only mentioned in connexion with the offerings of the princes (<a href="/numbers/7-17.htm" title="And for a sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five he goats, five lambs of the first year: this was the offering of Nahshon the son of Amminadab.">Numbers 7:17</a> ff). Hence it may be inferred that the Psalm refers to sacrifices offered by the nation or its leaders, not by an ordinary private individual. Cp. however <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11</a>, where almost exactly the same animals are mentioned as here; and <a href="/psalms/50-9.htm" title="I will take no bullock out of your house, nor he goats out of your folds.">Psalm 50:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-13.htm" title="Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?">Psalm 50:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will offer</span>] Lit., <span class="ital">dress</span> for sacrifice.

God has averted the peril of death and overthrow from His people: He has put their soul in life (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; in <a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>), i.e., in the realm of life; He has not abandoned their foot to tottering unto overthrow (mowT the substantive, as in <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a>; cf. the reversed construction in <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>). For God has cast His people as it were into a smelting-furnace or fining-pot in order to purify and to prove them by suffering; - this is a favourite figure with Isaiah and Jeremiah, but is also found in <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>. <a href="/ezekiel/19-9.htm">Ezekiel 19:9</a> is decisive concerning the meaning of &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, where &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; signifies "to bring into the holds or prisons;" besides, the figure of the fowling-net (although this is also called &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; as well as &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;) has no footing here in the context. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; (vid., <a href="/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a>) signifies specula, and that both a natural and an artificial watch-post on a mountain; here it is the mountain-hold or prison of the enemy, as a figure of the total loss of freedom. The laying on of a heavy burden mentioned by the side of it in <a href="/psalms/66-11.htm">Psalm 66:11</a> also accords well with this. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492;, a being oppressed, the pressure of a burden, is a Hophal formation, like &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, a being spread out, <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>; cf. the similar masculine forms in <a href="/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-6.htm">Isaiah 14:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>.

God so ordered it, that "wretched men" rode upon Israel's head. Or is it to be interpreted: He caused them to pass over Israel (cf. <a href="/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-23.htm">Isaiah 51:23</a>)? It can scarcely mean this, since it would then be in dorso nostro, which the Latin versions capriciously substitute. The preposition &#1500; instead of &#1506;&#1500; is used with reference to the phrase &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1500;: sitting upon Israel's head, God caused them to ride along, so that Israel was not able to raise its head freely, but was most ignominiously wounded in its self-esteem. Fire and water are, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, a figure of vicissitudes and perils of the most extreme character. Israel was nigh to being burnt up and drowned, but God led it forth &#1500;&#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;, to an abundant fulness, to abundance and superabundance of prosperity.

Both give a stronger antithesis. But the state of straitness or oppression was indeed also a state of privation. </body></html>
