It is very common and very commendable, when we are under the pressure of any affliction, or in the pursuit of any mercy, to make vows, and solemnly to name them before the Lord, in order that we may bind ourselves more closely to our duty; but we must take care that the vows which we made when we were in trouble be not forgotten when the trouble is over, but carefully performed; otherwise we contract fresh guilt, and bring upon ourselves fresh chastisement, from him whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem, and who will not fail to chastise with severity such instances of unfaithfulness in his people.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/66.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>66:13-20 We should declare unto those that fear God, what he has done for our souls, and how he has heard and answered our prayers, inviting them to join us in prayer and praise; this will turn to our mutual comfort, and to the glory of God. We cannot share these spiritual privileges, if we retain the love of sin in our hearts, though we refrain from the gross practice, Sin, regarded in the heart, will spoil the comfort and success of prayer; for the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination of the Lord. But if the feeling of sin in the heart causes desires to be rid of it; if it be the presence of one urging a demand we know we must not, cannot comply with, this is an argument of sincerity. And when we pray in simplicity and godly sincerity, our prayers will be answered. This will excite gratitude to Him who hath not turned away our prayer nor his mercy from us. It was not prayer that fetched the deliverance, but his mercy that sent it. That is the foundation of our hopes, the fountain of our comforts; and ought to be the matter of our praises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/66.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will go into thy house with burnt-offeriings - To thy temple - the place of worship. This is language designed to represent the feelings and the purpose of the people. If the psalm was composed on occasion of the return from the Babylonian captivity, it means that, as their first act, the people would go to the house of God, and acknowledge his goodness to them, and render him praise.

Selah.<p><a href="/psalms/66-13.htm">Psalm 66:13</a><p>"I will." The child of God is so sensible of his own personal indebtedness to grace, that he feels he must utter a song of his own. He joins in the common thanksgiving, but since the best public form must fail to meet each individual case, he makes sure that the special mercies received by him shall not be forgotten, for he records them with his own pen, and sings of them with his own lips. "I will go into thy house with burnt offerings;" the usual sacrifices of godly men. Even the thankful heart dares not come to God without a victim of grateful praise; of this as well as of every other form of worship, we may Say, "the blood is the life thereof." Reader, never attempt to come before God without Jesus, the divinely promised, given, and accepted burnt offering. "I will pay thee my vows." He would not appear before the Lord empty, but at the same time he would not boast of what he offered, seeing it was all due on account of former vows. After all, our largest gifts are but payments; when we have given all, we must confess, "O Lord, of thine own have we given unto thee." We should be slow in making vows, but prompt in discharging them. When we are released from trouble, and can once more go up to the house of the Lord, we should take immediate occasion to fulfil our promises. How can we hope for help another time, if we prove faithless to covenants voluntarily entered upon in hours of need.<p><a href="/psalms/66-14.htm">Psalm 66:14</a><p>"Which my lips have uttered," or vehemently declared; blurted out, as we say in common speech. His vows had been wrung from him; extreme distress burst open the door of his lips, and out rushed the vow like a long pent-up torrent, which had at last found a vent. What we were so eager to vow, we should be equally earnest to perform; but, alas! many a vow runs so fast in words that it lames itself for deeds. "And my mouth hath spoken." He had made the promise public, and had no desire to go back; an honest man is always ready to acknowledge a debt. "When I was in trouble." Distress suggested the vow; God in answer to the vow removed the distress, and now the votary desires to make good his promise. It is well for each man to remember that he was in trouble, proud spirits are apt to speak as if the road had always been smooth for them, as if no dog dare bark at their nobility, and scarce a drop of rain would venture to besprinkle their splendour; yet these very upstarts were probably once so low in spirits and condition that they would have been glad enough of the help of those they now despise. Even great Caesar, whose look did awe the world, must have his trouble and become weak as other men; so that his enemy could say in bitterness, "When the fit was on him, I did mark how he did shake." Of the strong and vigorous man the nurse could tell a tale of weakness, and his wife could say of the boaster, "I did hear him groan; his coward lips did from their colour fly." All men have trouble, but they act not in the same manner while under it; the profane take to swearing and the godly to praying. Both bad and good have been known to resort to vowing, but the one is a liar unto God, and the other a conscientious respecter of his word.<p><a href="/psalms/66-15.htm">Psalm 66:15</a><p>"I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of failings." The good man will give his best things to God. No starveling goat upon the hills will be present at the altar, but the well-fed bullocks of the luxuriant pastures shall ascend in smoke item the sacred fire. He who is miserly with God is a wretch indeed. Few devise liberal things, but those few find a rich reward in so doing. "With the incense of rams." The smoke of burning rams should also rise from the altar; he would offer, the strength and prime of his flocks as well as his herds. Of all we have we should give the Lord his portion, and that should be the choicest we can select. It was no waste to burn the fat upon Jehovah's altar, nor to pour the precious ointment upon Jesus's head; neither are large gifts and bountiful offerings to the church of God any diminution to a man's estate: such money is put to good interest and placed where it cannot be stolen by thieves nor corroded by rust. "I will offer bullets with goats." A perfect sacrifice, completing the circle of offerings, should show forth the intense love of his heart. We should magnify the Lord with the great and the littler. None of his ordinances Should be disregarded; we must not omit either the bullocks or the goats. In these three verses we have gratitude in action, not content with words, but proving its own sincerity by deeds of obedient sacrifice.<p>"Selah." It is most fit that we should suspend the song while the smoke of the victims ascends the heavens: let the burnt-offerings stand for praises while we meditate upon the infinitely greater sacrifice of Calvary. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/66.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/66.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I will go into thy house with burnt offerings,....

In the old world the strict performance of vows was always held to be one of the main obligations of religion. A vow was of the nature of a compact with God, and to break it was an act of flagrant dishonesty, from which men shrank. The Mosaic Law sanctioned vows of various kinds, as the vowing of children to the service of God (<a href="/leviticus/27-1.htm">Leviticus 27:1-8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>); the vow of the Nazarite (<a href="/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2-21</a>); and vows of clean or unclean animals (<a href="/leviticus/27-9.htm">Leviticus 27:9-13, 27-29</a>), etc. Clean animals, when vowed, must be either redeemed or sacrificed. The importance of performing vows is borne frequent witness to by the psalmists (see <a href="/psalms/22-25.htm">Psalm 22:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/56-12.htm">Psalm 56:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-1.htm">Psalm 65:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/116-14.htm">Psalm 116:14, 18</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-2.htm">Psalm 132:2</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/66.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Although the summons: Come and see... (borrowed apparently from <a href="/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a>), is called forth by contemporary manifestations of God's power, the consequences of which now lie open to view, the rendering of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>, "then will we rejoice in Him," is nevertheless unnatural, and, rightly looked at, neither grammar nor the matter requires it. For since &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; in this passage is equivalent to &#1488;&#1494;, and the future after &#1488;&#1494; takes the signification of an aorist; and since the cohortative form of the future can also (e.g., after &#1506;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-7.htm">Psalm 73:7</a>, and in clauses having a hypothetical sense) be referred to the past, and does sometimes at least occur where the writer throws himself back into the past (<a href="/2_samuel/22-38.htm">2 Samuel 22:38</a>), the rendering: Then did we rejoice in Him, cannot be assailed on syntactical grounds. On the "we," cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>, Chethb, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1-14</a> :54. The church of all ages is a unity, the separate parts being jointly involved in the whole. The church here directs the attention of all the world to the mighty deeds of God at the time of the deliverance from Egypt, viz., the laying of the Red Sea and of Jordan dry, inasmuch as it can say in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-7.htm">Psalm 66:7</a>, by reason of that which it has experienced ibn the present, that the sovereign power of God is ever the same: its God rules in His victorious might &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, i.e., not "over the world," because that ought to be &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, but "in eternity" (accusative of duration, as in <a href="/psalms/89-2.htm">Psalm 89:2</a>., <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>), and therefore, as in the former days, so also in all time to come. His eyes keep searching watch among the peoples; the rebellious, who struggle agaisnt His yoke and persecute His people, had better not rise, it may go ill with them. The Chethb runs &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, for which the Ker is &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;. The meaning remains the same; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; can (even without &#1497;&#1491;, &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1511;&#1512;&#1503;, <a href="/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a>) mean "to practise exaltation," superbire. By means of &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; this proud bearing is designated as being egotistical, and as unrestrainedly boastful. Only let them not imagine themselves secure in their arrogance! There is One more exalted, whose eye nothing escapes, and to whose irresistible might whatever is not conformed to His gracious will succumbs. </body></html>
