Such glorious events, as the cleaving of the Bed Sea and the overthrow of Pharaoh, are standing wonders, and throughout all time a voice sounds forth concerning them - "Come and see." Even till the close of all things, the marvellous works of God at the Red Sea will be the subject of meditation and praise; for, standing on the sea of glass mingled with fire, the triumphal armies of heaven sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb. It has always been the favourite subject of the inspired bards, and their choice was most natural. "He is terrible in his doing toward the children of men." For the defence of his church and the overthrow of her foes he deals terrific blows, and strikes the mighty with fear. O thou enemy, wherefore dost thou vaunt thyself? Speak no more so exceeding proudly, but remember the plagues which bowed the will of Pharaoh, the drowning of Egypt's chariots in the Red Sea, the overthrow of Og and Sihon, the scattering of the Canaanites before the tribes. This same God still liveth, and is to be worshipped with trembling reverence.<p><a href="/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a><p>"He turned the sea into dry land." It was no slight miracle to divide a pathway through such a sea, and to make it fit for the traffic of a whole nation. He who did this can do anything, and must be God, the worthy object of adoration. The Christian's inference is that no obstacle in his journey heavenward need hinder him, for the sea could not hinder Israel, and even death itself shall be as life; the sea shall be dry land when God's presence is felt. "They went through the flood on foot." Through the river the tribes passed dry-shod, Jordan was afraid because of them.<p>"What ail'd thee, O thou mighty sea?<p>Why roll'd thy waves in dread?<p>What bade thy tide, O Jordan, flee<p>And bare its deepest bed?<p>O earth, before the Lord, the God<p>Of Jacob, tremble still;<p>Who makes the waste a water'd sod,<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/66.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See the works of God; </span> consider them wisely and seriously, for God’s glory, and for your own good. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Toward the children of men; </span> to all his enemies; whom he calls the children of men, partly in way of contempt, to show how unable they are either to avoid or resist the great God; and partly in opposition to his own people, who are frequently called the children of God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/66.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Come and see the works of God,.... Of the Messiah, God manifest in the flesh; those divine works which he did when here on earth; his miraculous works, which were proofs of his deity and Messiahship; his preaching the Gospel, in so divine a manner as never man did; his works of obedience to the law, which were pure and perfect; the everlasting righteousness he wrought out for the justification of his people; and the great work of redemption and salvation finished by him, which none but God could ever have effected. This is an invitation to the inhabitants of all lands, where the Gospel should come with power, to take notice of and consider these works of Christ, and the glory of his might, wisdom, and grace in them, in order to engage them to sing his praise; <p>he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men; in his vengeance on the Jews, for disbelieving and rejecting him; in destroying antichrist, and pouring out the vials of his wrath on the antichristian states; and in the everlasting damnation of the wicked.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/65-10.htm">Psalm 65:10</a>, <a href="/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a> God is thanked for having sent down the rain required for the ploughing (vid., Commentary on Isaiah, ii. 522) and for the increase of the seed sown, so that, as vv. 12-14 affirm, there is the prospect of a rich harvest. The harvest itself, as follows from v. 14b, is not yet housed. The whole of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/65-10.htm">Psalm 65:10</a>, <a href="/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a> is a retrospect; in vv. 12-14 the whole is a description of the blessing standing before their eyes, which God has put upon the year now drawing to a close. Certainly, if the forms &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; were supplicatory imperatives, then the prayer for the early or seed-time rain would attach itself to the retrospect in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a>, and the standpoint would be not about the time of the Passover and Pentecost, both festivals belonging to the beginning of the harvest, but about the time of the feast of Tabernacles, the festival of thanksgiving for the harvest, and vv. 12-14 would be a glance into the future (Hitzig). But there is nothing to indicate that in <a href="/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a> the retrospect changes into a looking forward. The poet goes on with the same theme, and also arranges the words accordingly, for which reason &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; are not to be understood in any other way. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1511; beside &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; (to enrich) signifies to cause to run over, overflow, i.e., to put anything in a state of plenty or abundance, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511; (Hiph. <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a>, to yield in abundance), Arab, sa&#770;q, to push, impel, to cause to go on in succession and to follow in succession. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; (for which we find &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/62-3.htm">Psalm 62:3</a>) is an adverb, copiously, richly (<a href="/psalms/120-6.htm">Psalm 120:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/129-1.htm">Psalm 129:1</a>), like &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, a hundred times (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is Hiph. with the middle syllable shortened, Ges. 53, 3, rem. 4. The fountain (&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;) of God is the name given here to His inexhaustible stores of blessing, and more particularly the fulness of the waters of the heavens from which He showers down fertilizing rain. &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, "thus thoroughly," forms an alliteration with &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, to prepare, and thereby receives a peculiar twofold colouring. The meaning is: God, by raising and tending, prepared the produce of the field which the inhabitants of the land needed; for He thus thoroughly prepared the land in conformity with the fulness of His fountain, viz., by copiously watering (&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; infin. absol. instead of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <a href="/1_samuel/3-12.htm">1 Samuel 3:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-10.htm">2 Chronicles 24:10</a>; <a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-19.htm">Jeremiah 14:19</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-9.htm">Hosea 6:9</a>) the furrows of the land and pressing down, i.e., softening by means of rain, its ridges (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, defective plural, as e.g., in <a href="/ruth/2-13.htm">Ruth 2:13</a>), which the ploughshare has made. &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; (related by root with Arab. tll, tell, a hill, prop. that which is thrown out to a place, that which is thrown up, a mound) signifies a furrow as being formed by casting up or (if from Arab. t&#817;lm, e&#769;bre&#769;cher, to make a fracture, rent, or notch in anything) by tearing into, breaking up the ground; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; (related by root with uchdu&#770;d and chat&#803;t&#803;, the usual Arabic words for a furrow<p>(Note: Frst erroneously explains &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; as a bed or strip of ground between two deep furrows, in distinction from &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; or &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; (vid., on <a href="/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>), a furrow. Beds such as we have in our potato fields are unknown to Syrian agriculture. There is a mode which may be approximately compared with it called ketif (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507;), another far wider called meskeba (&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;). The Arabic tilm (&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, Hebrew &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;  equals  talm), according to the Kams (as actually in Magrebinish Arabic) talam (&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;), corresponds exact to our furrow, i.e., (as the Turkish Kams explains) a ditch-like fissure which the iron of the plough cuts into the field. Neshwn (i. 491) says: "The verb talam, fut. jatlum and jatlim, signifies in Jemen and in the Ghr (the land on the shore of the Red Sea) the crevices (Arab. 'l-s&#780;uqu&#770;q) which the ploughman forms, and tilm, collective plural tila&#770;m, is, in the countries mentioned, a furrow of the corn-field. Some persons pronounce the word even thilm, collective plural thila&#770;m." Thus it is at the present day universally in H&#803;aura&#770;n; in Edre&#8219;a&#770;t I heard the water-furrow of a corn-field called thilm el-kana&#770;h (Arab. t&#817;lm 'l-qna&#770;t). But this pronunciation with Arab. t&#817; is certainly not the original one, but has arisen through a substitution of the cognate and more familiar verbal stem Arab. t&#817;lm, cf. s&#780;rm, to slit (shure&#770;m, a harelip). In other parts of Syria and Palestine, also where the distinction between the sounds Arab. t and t&#817; is carefully observed, I have only heard the pronunciation tilm. - Wetzstein.))<p>as being formed by cutting into the ground.<p>In <a href="/psalms/65-12.htm">Psalm 65:12</a> the year in itself appears as a year of divine goodness (&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, bonitas), and the prospective blessing of harvest as the crown which is set upon it. For Thou hast crowned "the year of Thy goodness" and "with Thy goodness" are different assertions, with which also different (although kindred as to substance) ideas are associated. The futures after &#1506;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; depict its results as they now lie out to view. The chariot-tracks (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>) drop with exuberant fruitfulness, even the meadows of the uncultivated and, without rain, unproductive pasture land (<a href="/job/38-26.htm">Job 38:26</a>.). The hills are personified in <a href="/psalms/65-13.htm">Psalm 65:13</a> in the manner of which Isaiah in particular is so fond (e.g., <a href="/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-13.htm">Psalm 49:13</a>), and which we find in the Psalms of his type (<a href="/psalms/96-11.htm">Psalm 96:11</a>., <a href="/psalms/98-7.htm">Psalm 98:7</a>., cf. <a href="/psalms/89-13.htm">Psalm 89:13</a>). Their fresh, verdant appearance is compared to a festive garment, with which those which previously looked bare and dreary gird themselves; and the corn to a mantle in which the valleys completely envelope themselves (&#1506;&#1496;&#1507; with the accusative, like Arab. t&#8219;t&#803;t&#803;f with b of the garment: to throw it around one, to put it on one's self). The closing words, locking themselves as it were with the beginning of the Psalm together, speak of joyous shouting and singing that continues into the present time. The meadows and valleys (Bttcher) are not the subject, of which it cannot be said that they sing; nor can the same be said of the rustling of the waving corn-fields (Kimchi). The expression requires men to be the subject, and refers to men in the widest and most general sense. Everywhere there is shouting coming up from the very depths of the breast (Hithpal.), everywhere songs of joy; for this is denoted by &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; in distinction from &#1511;&#1504;&#1503;. </body></html>
