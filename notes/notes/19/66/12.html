Professor Alexander renders this, "Thou hast caused men to ride at our head," as if leading them forth as captives in war. The most probable meaning, however, is that they had been subdued, as if on a field of battle, and as if their conquerors had ridden over them when prostrate on the ground. Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>, and the notes at <a href="/isaiah/51-23.htm">Isaiah 51:23</a>.<p>We went through fire and through water - This is designed to represent the nature of their trials. It was as if they had been made to pass through burning flames and raging floods. Compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>. Instead of passing through the seas and rivers when the waters had been turned back, and when a dry and safe path was made for them, as was the ease with their fathers <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>, they had been compelled to breast the flood itself; and yet, notwithstanding this, God had brought them into a place of safety. In either way, by parting the floods, or by conducting his people through them, as shall seem best pleasing to him, God can conduct his people safely, and deliver them from danger. The power, the protecting care, the love, and the faithfulness of God are shown with equal clearness whether he divides the flood and causes his people to march through as on dry land, or whether he suffers the flood to rage and heave around them while he conducts his chosen people safely through.<p>But there broughtest us out into a wealthy place - Margin, moist. Professor Alexander, overfIow, abundance. Vulgate, info a place of refreshment - refrigerium. The Septuagint, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;  eis anapsuche&#772;n. Luther, Thou hast led us forth and quickened us. DeWette, zum Ueberflusse - "to overflowing, or abundance." The Hebrew word - &#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;  reva&#770;ya&#770;h - means properly "abundant drink," "abundance." It occurs only here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, where it is rendered "runneth over." See the notes at that place. The proper idea here is, that he had brought them into a land where there was plenty of water - as emblematic of abundance in general. He had led them to a place where there were ample rivers, springs, and streams, producing fertility and abundance. This would be the language of the people after their return from exile, and when they were permitted again to re-visit their native land - a land always characterized as a land of plenty.

Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it of the kings and nations of the world ruling over Israel; and may very well design the Heathen powers and antichristian states tyrannizing over Christian people. The word in the original text is singular, "a man" (c), a frail mortal man; and may be understood of the man of sin and son of perdition; who rides upon the heads of men, exalts himself above all that is called God, and has exercised dominion over the saints in a most lawless and tyrannical manner. Vitringa, on <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a> interprets it of Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a type of antichrist, and supposes the following clause to refer to the persecution of the church in his time. The Targum renders it, "a lord of rebuke"; that is, either one worthy of rebuke, as antichrist is; or one that gives rebukes, delivers out anathemas and excommunications, as he does: though some translate the words of the Targum, "lords of usury", or "usurers"; a title not unfit for the creatures of antichrist; <p>we went through fire and through water; through afflictions, compared to fire and water; through fiery trials and overwhelming providences, though not destroyed by them, because the Lord was with them; see <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>; therefore they are said to go through them, not to abide in them; nor to sink under them, and perish by them: they went cheerfully through them for Christ's sake, even the greatest hardships and difficulties, which this phrase may be expressive of. It may have a particular reference to the sufferings of the saints in Gospel times; to the burning of the martyrs with fire and faggot, who, like Elijah, went up to heaven in a fiery chariot; and to the flood of waters cast out after the woman, the church, by the dragon; see <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>; <p>but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place; the Targum is, into largeness; or into a large place; see <a href="/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19</a>. This may intend either the state of the church upon the Reformation, or rather as it will be in the latter day glory; when there will be a large spread of the Gospel, and of the interest of Christ, everywhere; when the church will be enlarged with converts, and the members of it with the gifts and graces of the Spirit; and which will be a state of great liberty and freedom in the worship of God, both inward and outward. The Septuagint version renders it, "into refreshment": so the Tigurine version, and Piscator; as those times will be times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord, which will be everywhere among his people, in his word and ordinances, and to a great degree; see <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>. The Arabic version, "unto rest"; from adversity, from persecution; for, after this state takes place, there will be no more persecution; no more fines, imprisonment, racks, and torturing deaths, for the sake of Christ and his Gospel. The word used signifies a well watered place (d) or land; such as was the land of Canaan, <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>; and such will be the state of the church in the latter day: the Spirit will be poured down like floods of water upon the dry ground; the doctrines of the Gospel will drop as the rain, and as showers upon the grass: the ordinances of it will be as green pastures beside the still waters; and every believer will be as a watered garden, whose springs fail not; it will be a time of great plenty and prosperity in spiritual things. Ainsworth renders it, "to an abundant place"; so Gejerus: a place abounding with all good things: a "wealthy" one, as we translate it. And even in a literal sense this will be the wealthy time of the church; when kings shall come into it, and bring their riches and honour there, and use them for the good of it, <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>; and then also will the saints be enriched with every gift, and be rich in grace and in all good works. <p>(c) "hominem", Pagninus, Montanus.

For since &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; in this passage is equivalent to &#1488;&#1494;, and the future after &#1488;&#1494; takes the signification of an aorist; and since the cohortative form of the future can also (e.g., after &#1506;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-7.htm">Psalm 73:7</a>, and in clauses having a hypothetical sense) be referred to the past, and does sometimes at least occur where the writer throws himself back into the past (<a href="/2_samuel/22-38.htm">2 Samuel 22:38</a>), the rendering: Then did we rejoice in Him, cannot be assailed on syntactical grounds. On the "we," cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>, Chethb, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1-14</a> :54. The church of all ages is a unity, the separate parts being jointly involved in the whole. The church here directs the attention of all the world to the mighty deeds of God at the time of the deliverance from Egypt, viz., the laying of the Red Sea and of Jordan dry, inasmuch as it can say in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-7.htm">Psalm 66:7</a>, by reason of that which it has experienced ibn the present, that the sovereign power of God is ever the same: its God rules in His victorious might &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, i.e., not "over the world," because that ought to be &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, but "in eternity" (accusative of duration, as in <a href="/psalms/89-2.htm">Psalm 89:2</a>., <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>), and therefore, as in the former days, so also in all time to come.

There is One more exalted, whose eye nothing escapes, and to whose irresistible might whatever is not conformed to His gracious will succumbs. </body></html>
