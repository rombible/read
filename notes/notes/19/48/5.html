Happy the kingdom, the city, the family, the heart, in which God is great, in which he is all. There God is known. The clearer discoveries are made to us of the Lord and his greatness, the more it is expected that we should abound in his praises. The earth is, by sin, covered with deformity, therefore justly might that spot of ground, which was beautified with holiness, be called the joy of the whole earth; that which the whole earth has reason to rejoice in, that God would thus in very deed dwell with man upon the earth. The kings of the earth were afraid of it. Nothing in nature can more fitly represent the overthrow of heathenism by the Spirit of the gospel, than the wreck of a fleet in a storm. Both are by the mighty power of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They saw it - That is, they looked on it; they contemplated it; they were struck with its beauty and strength, and fled.<p>And so they marveled - It surpassed their expectations of its strength, and they saw with wonder that any attempt to conquer it was hopeless.<p>They were troubled - They were filled with anxiety and confusion. They even began to have apprehensions about their own safety. They saw that their preparations had been made in vain, and that all hopes of success must be abandoned.<p>And hasted away - They fled in confusion. The idea in the whole verse is that of a "panic," leading to a disorderly flight. This "may" have occurred in the time of Jehoshaphat, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20</a>, when the kings of Moab, Edom, and others, came up to attack Jerusalem, though the immediate cause of their overthrow was a conflict among themselves <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22-25</a>. It may have been, however, that they approached the city, and were dismayed by its strength, so that they turned away before the internal conflict occurred which ended in their ruin. But it is not "necessary" to adjust these accounts one to another, or even to suppose that this was the event referred to in the psalm, though the general ideas in it accord well with all which occurred on that occasion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6.
