All the streams of mercy that flow down to us, must be traced to the fountain of His loving-kindness. Let us give to God the glory of the great things he has done for us. Let all the members of the church take comfort from what the Lord does for his church. Let us observe the beauty, strength, and safety of the church.

That is, Pay close attention to them; make the investigation with care, not as one does whose heart is not in the thing, and who does it negligently. The word rendered "bulwarks" - &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;  che&#770;yl - means, properly, a host or army, and then a fortification or entrenchment, especially the "ditch" or "trench," with the low wall or breastwork which surrounds it: <a href="/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>. (Gesenius, Lexicon) The Septuagint translates it here: &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  dunamis, power; the Vulgate, "virtus," courage; Luther, "Mauern" - walls.<p>Consider her palaces - The word "palaces" here refers to the royal residences; and, as these were usually fortified and guarded, the expression here is equivalent to this: "Consider the "strength" of the city; its power to defend itself; its safety from the danger of being taken." The word rendered "consider" - &#1508;&#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;  pasegu&#770; - is rendered in the margin "raise up." The word occurs nowhere else in the Bible. According to Gesenius (Lexicon), it means to "divide up;" that is, to walk through and survey them; or, to consider them accurately, or in detail, one by one. The Vulgate renders it "distribute;" the Septuagint, "take a distinct view of (Thompson);" Luther, "lift up." The idea is, "examine attentively" or "carefully."<p>That ye may tell it to the generation following - That you may be able to give a correct account of it to the next age. The "object" of this is to inspire the next generation with a belief that God is the protector of the city; that it is so strong that it cannot be vanquished; that there is safety in such a city as that. As applied to the church now, or at any time, it means that we are to take such views of its being a true church of God; of its being fixed on firm foundations; of its being so able to resist all the assaults of Satan, and of its being so directly under the divine protection, that it has nothing to fear. It will and must stand to all coming time, a place of absolute safety to all who seek protection and safety within it. The following remarks of Dr. Thomson (Land and the Book, vol. ii., 474, 475), may furnish an illustration of what the ancient defenses in the city may have been, and especially of the word "towers" in this passage in the Psalms: "The only castle of any particular importance is that at the Jaffa Gate, commonly called the Tower of David. The lower part of it is built of huge stones, roughly cut, and with a deep "bevel" round the edges.<p>They are undoubtedly ancient, but the interspersed patch-work proves that they are not in their original positions. I have been within it, and carefully explored all parts of it that are now accessible, but found nothing which could cast any light upon its history. It is believed by many to be the Hippicus of Josephus, and to this idea it owes its chief importance, for the historian makes that the point of departure in laying down the line of the ancient walls of Jerusalem. Volumes have been written in our day for and against the correctness of this identification, and the contest is still undecided; but, interesting as may be the result, we may safely leave it with those who are now conducting the controversy, and turn to matters more in unison with our particular inquiries. Everything that can be said about this grand old tower will be found in the voluminous works of Williams, Robinson, Schultz, Wilson, Fergusson, and other able writers on the topography of the Holy City." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-14.

Such as the free favour of God in Christ; which is not only as a shield, but as a bulwark to the church; his everlasting love, electing grace, the covenant of grace, with its blessings and promises, all which are more immovable than rocks and mountains; and especially the power of God, which surrounds his church, as the mountains did Jerusalem; and by which they are kept and preserved as in a garrison, <a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>. Also salvation by Christ; his righteousness, sacrifice, and satisfaction, which God has appointed for walls and bulwarks, and which make the city, the church, a strong and impregnable one, <a href="/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>.

Some render the words, set "your hearts on her strength", as the Vulgate Latin version; that is, on Christ, who is the strength of the poor and needy in their distress; the strength of their hearts, of their lives, and of their salvation, and the security of the church. Others readier them, "set your hearts on her armies"; as the Targum is; her volunteers, her soldiers, who endure hardness as good soldiers of Christ, fight the Lord's battles, and are more than conquerors through him; and a lovely sight it is to behold them, with Christ at the head of them; see <a href="/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>; <p>consider her palaces; for Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit, have their dwelling places in Zion; and here, besides apostles, prophets, evangelists, and ordinary ministers of the word, who are rulers and officers set in the first place, every saint is a prince and a king; and has a place and a name here, better than that of sons and daughters of the greatest potentate on earth; every dwelling place in Mount Zion is a palace. <p>that ye may tell it to the generation following: that is, the beauty and glory, strength and safety of the church; and even all that is spoken of her in this psalm, as well as what follows: this is the end proposed by taking a circuit round Zion, and making the above observations on it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/48.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/48.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">bulwarks</span>] The outer wall or rampart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">consider</span>] Or, as R.V. marg., <span class="ital">traverse</span>.

The fact by which He has thus made Himself known now immediately follows. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; points to a definite number of kings known to the poet; it therefore speaks in favour of the time of peril and war in the reign of Jehoshaphat and against that in the reign of Hezekiah. &#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; is reciprocal: to appoint themselves a place of meeting, and meet together there. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, as in <a href="/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-21.htm">2 Kings 8:21</a>, of crossing the frontier and invasion (Hitzig), not of perishing and destruction, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-36.htm">Psalm 37:36</a>, <a href="/nahum/1-12.htm">Nahum 1:12</a> (De Wette); for &#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1493; requires further progress, and the declaration respecting their sudden downfall does not follow till later on. The allies encamped in the desert to Tekoa, about three hours distant from Jerusalem. The extensive view at that point extends even to Jerusalem: as soon as they saw it they were amazed, i.e., the seeing and astonishment, panic and confused flight, occurred all together; there went forth upon them from the Holy City, because Elohim dwells therein, a &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-15.htm">1 Samuel 14:15</a>), or as we should say, a panic or a panic-striking terror. Concerning &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; as expressive of simultaneousness, vid., on <a href="/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; in the correlative protasis is omitted, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a>, and frequently; cf. on <a href="/isaiah/55-9.htm">Isaiah 55:9</a>. Trembling seized upon them there (&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, as in <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>), pangs as of a woman in travail. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>, the description passes over emotionally into the form of address. It moulds itself according to the remembrance of a recent event of the poet's own time, viz., the destruction of the merchant fleet fitted out by Jehoshaphat in conjunction with Ahaziah, king of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/22-49.htm">1 Kings 22:49</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a>.). The general meaning of <a href="/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a> is, that God's omnipotence is irresistible. Concerning the "wind of the east quarter," which here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a>, causes shipwreck, vid., on <a href="/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>. The "ships of Tarshish," as is clear from the context both before and after, are not meant literally, but used as a figure of the worldly powers; Isaiah (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33.htm">Isaiah 33</a>) also compares Assyria to a gallant ship. Thus, then, the church can say that in the case of Jerusalem it has, as an eye-witness, experienced that which it has hitherto only heard from the tradition of a past age (&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; as in <a href="/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>), viz., that God holds it erect, establishes it, for ever. Hengstenberg observes here, "The Jerusalem that has been laid in ruins is not that which the psalmist means; it is only its outward form which it has put off" [lit. its broken and deserted pupa]. It is true that, according to its inner and spiritual nature, Jerusalem continues its existence in the New Testament church; but it is not less true that its being trodden under foot for a season in the kairoi' ethnoo'n no more annuls the promise of God than Israel's temporary rejection annuls Israel's election. The Holy City does not fall without again rising up. </body></html>
