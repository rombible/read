The fact by which He has thus made Himself known now immediately follows. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; points to a definite number of kings known to the poet; it therefore speaks in favour of the time of peril and war in the reign of Jehoshaphat and against that in the reign of Hezekiah. &#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; is reciprocal: to appoint themselves a place of meeting, and meet together there. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, as in <a href="/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-21.htm">2 Kings 8:21</a>, of crossing the frontier and invasion (Hitzig), not of perishing and destruction, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-36.htm">Psalm 37:36</a>, <a href="/nahum/1-12.htm">Nahum 1:12</a> (De Wette); for &#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1493; requires further progress, and the declaration respecting their sudden downfall does not follow till later on. The allies encamped in the desert to Tekoa, about three hours distant from Jerusalem. The extensive view at that point extends even to Jerusalem: as soon as they saw it they were amazed, i.e., the seeing and astonishment, panic and confused flight, occurred all together; there went forth upon them from the Holy City, because Elohim dwells therein, a &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-15.htm">1 Samuel 14:15</a>), or as we should say, a panic or a panic-striking terror. Concerning &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; as expressive of simultaneousness, vid., on <a href="/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; in the correlative protasis is omitted, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a>, and frequently; cf. on <a href="/isaiah/55-9.htm">Isaiah 55:9</a>. Trembling seized upon them there (&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, as in <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>), pangs as of a woman in travail. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>, the description passes over emotionally into the form of address. It moulds itself according to the remembrance of a recent event of the poet's own time, viz., the destruction of the merchant fleet fitted out by Jehoshaphat in conjunction with Ahaziah, king of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/22-49.htm">1 Kings 22:49</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a>.). The general meaning of <a href="/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a> is, that God's omnipotence is irresistible. Concerning the "wind of the east quarter," which here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a>, causes shipwreck, vid., on <a href="/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>. The "ships of Tarshish," as is clear from the context both before and after, are not meant literally, but used as a figure of the worldly powers; Isaiah (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33.htm">Isaiah 33</a>) also compares Assyria to a gallant ship. Thus, then, the church can say that in the case of Jerusalem it has, as an eye-witness, experienced that which it has hitherto only heard from the tradition of a past age (&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; as in <a href="/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>), viz., that God holds it erect, establishes it, for ever. Hengstenberg observes here, "The Jerusalem that has been laid in ruins is not that which the psalmist means; it is only its outward form which it has put off" [lit. its broken and deserted pupa]. It is true that, according to its inner and spiritual nature, Jerusalem continues its existence in the New Testament church; but it is not less true that its being trodden under foot for a season in the kairoi' ethnoo'n no more annuls the promise of God than Israel's temporary rejection annuls Israel's election. The Holy City does not fall without again rising up. </body></html>
