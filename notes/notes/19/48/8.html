All the streams of mercy that flow down to us, must be traced to the fountain of His loving-kindness. Let us give to God the glory of the great things he has done for us. Let all the members of the church take comfort from what the Lord does for his church. Let us observe the beauty, strength, and safety of the church. Consider its strength; see it founded on Christ the Rock, fortified by the Divine power, guarded by Him who neither slumbers nor sleeps. See what precious ordinances are its palaces, what precious promises are its bulwarks, that you may be encouraged to join yourselves to it: and tell this to others. This God, who has now done such great things for us, is unchangeable in his love to us, and his care for us. If he is our God, he will lead and keep us even to the last.

It has been shown that God is its protector; that he dwells in the midst of it; that it is safe from the assaults of man; that it is permanent and abiding. All that had ever been said of the city in this respect had been found, in this trial when the kings assembled against it, to be true.<p>In the city of the Lord of hosts - The city where the Lord of hosts has taken up his abode, or which he has chosen for his dwelling-place on earth.

They had seen that these combined armies could not take the city; that God had mercifully interposed to scatter their forces; and they inferred that it could be taken by no human power, and that God intended that it should be permanent and abiding. What is here said of Jerusalem is true in a sense more strict and absolute of the Church - that nothing can prevail against it, but that it will endure to the end of the world.

Or, we have had late and fresh experiences of such wonderful works of God, as before we only heard of by the report of our fathers. From this miraculous deliverance we plainly see that God hath a singular love to it, and care of it, and therefore will defend her in all succeeding ages against all her enemies.

These are the words of the people of God making their observations on the above things; and so Aben Ezra and Kimchi understand them of the people of Israel; and the former, referring them to the war of Gog and Magog, paraphrases them thus: <p>"the Israelites shall say in that day, as we have heard the prophets, who prophesied of the fall of Gog and Magog, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts.'' <p>The words may be understood, either of facts which have been reported and heard to have been done in time past, to which others will correspond, and will be seen to do to in the latter day; as, for instance, as it has been heard that God inflicted plagues upon Egypt; so it will be seen that he will pour out the vials of his wrath upon the great city, which is spiritually called Egypt and Sodom: as it has been heard that God brought his people Israel out of Egypt with a mighty hand; so it will be seen that he will deliver his people from the captivity and tyranny of the man of sin, and will call them out from Babylon a little before the destruction of it: as it has been heard that Pharaoh and his host were drowned in the Red sea; so it will be seen that Babylon shall be thrown down like a mill stone cast into the sea, and be found no more: as it has been heard that, literal Babylon is destroyed; so it will be seen that mystical Babylon will be destroyed also: and as it has been heard that the kings of the nations, at several times, have gathered themselves together against Jerusalem, without effect; so it will be seen treat the kings of the earth will assemble together against the church of Christ; but, as soon as they shall come up to her, and look upon her, they shall be astonished and flee with the utmost consternation, fear, and dread, and be utterly ruined: or else the sense is, as it has been heard, from the promises and prophecies delivered out from time to time, that God will grant his presence to his church and people, and will be the protection of them, and will destroy all his and their enemies; so it has been seen that these have been fulfilled, more or less, in all ages; in the latter day their accomplishment will be full and manifest, even <p>in the city of the Lord of hosts; of the hosts of heaven and earth, of all armies above and below; and therefore the church must be safe under his protection; <p>in the city of our God: the covenant God of his people; wherefore, as the former title declares his power, this shows his love and affection, and both together secure the happiness of the saints: wherefore it follows, <p>God will establish it for ever. Not only particular believers, of which the church consists, are established on the foundation, Christ; but the church itself is built on him, the Rock against which the gates of hell cannot prevail; yet as they are not always in a settled and constant condition, so neither is that, being sometimes tossed with the tempests of afflictions and persecutions, and sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another; but in the latter day it will be established on the top of the mountains; and which is a desirable thing by all the saints, and what they should, as many do, earnestly pray for; and which God will do in his own time; and then it shall be established for ever, and be a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of its stakes shall be removed, nor any of its cords broken, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/33-20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>. <p>Selah; on this word; see Gill on <a href="/psalms/3-2.htm">Psalm 3:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/48.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As we have <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.

Having seen with our own eyes Jerusalem thus delivered, we come to the conclusion that God will establish it for ever. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 48:2-9) Viewed as to the nature of its subject-matter, the Psalm divides itself into three parts. We begin by considering the three strophes of the first part. The middle strophe presents an instance of the rising and falling caesural schema. Because Jahve has most marvellously delivered Jerusalem, the poet begins with the praise of the great King and of His Holy City. Great and praised according to His due (&#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; as in <a href="/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>) is He in her, is He upon His holy mountain, which there is His habitation. Next follow, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>, two predicates of a threefold, or fundamentally only twofold, subject; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;, in whatever way it may be understood, is in apposition to &#1492;&#1512;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;. The predicates consequently refer to Zion-Jerusalem; for &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1512;&#1489; is not a name for Zion, but, inasmuch as the transition is from the holy mountain to the Holy City (just as the reverse is the case in <a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>), Jerusalem; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, <a href="/matthew/5-35.htm">Matthew 5:35</a>. Of Zion-Jerusalem it is therefore said, it is &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1504;&#1493;&#1507;, beautiful in prominence or elevation (&#1504;&#1493;&#1507; from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, Arabic na&#770;fa, nauf, root &#1504;&#1507;, the stronger force of &#1504;&#1489;, Arab. nb, to raise one's self, to mount, to come sensibly forward; just as &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; also goes back to a root &#1497;&#1507;, Arab. yf, wf, which signifies "to rise, to be high," and is transferred in the Hebrew to eminence, perfection, beauty of form), a beautifully rising terrace-like height; <p>(Note: Luther with Jerome (departing from the lxx and Vulgate) renders it: "Mount Zion is like a beautiful branch," after the Mishna-Talmudic &#1504;&#1493;&#1507;, a branch, Maccoth 12a, which is compared also by Saadia and Dunash. The latter renders it "beautiful in branches," and refers it to the Mount of Olives.) <p>and, in the second place, it is the joy (&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1513;&#1474;) of the whole earth. It is deserving of being such, as the people who dwell there are themselves convinced (<a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>); and it is appointed to become such, it is indeed such even now in hope, - hope which is, as it were, being anticipatorily verified. but in what sense does the appositional &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; follow immediately upon &#1492;&#1512;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;? Hitzig, Ewald, Hengstenberg, Caspari (Micha, p. 359), and others, are of opinion that the hill of Zion is called the extreme north with reference to the old Asiatic conception of the mountain of the gods - old Persic Ar-bur'g (Al-bur'g), and also called absolutely hara or haraiti, <p>(Note: Vid., Spiegel, Era&#770;n, S. 287f.) <p>old Indian Kaila&#770;sa and Me&#770;ru <p>(Note: Vide Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, ii.847.)<p> - forming the connecting link between heaven and earth, which lay in the inaccessible, holy distance and concealment of the extreme north. But the poet in no way betrays the idea that he applies this designation to Zion in an ideal sense only, as being not inferior to the extreme north (Bertheau, Lage des Paradieses, S. 50, and so also S. D. Luzzatto on <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>), or as having taken the place of it (Hitzig). That notion is found, it is true, in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>, in the mouth of the king of the Chaldeans; but, with the exception of the passage before us, we have no trace of the Israelitish mind having blended this foreign mythological style of speech with its own. We therefore take the expression "sides of the north" to be a topographical designation, and intended literally. Mount Zion is thereby more definitely designated as the Temple-hill; for the Temple-hill, or Zion in the narrower sense, formed in reality the north-eastern angle or corner of ancient Jerusalem. It is not necessarily the extreme north (<a href="/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/39-2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>), which is called &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; are the two sides, then the angle in which the two side lines meet, and just such a northern angle was Mount Moriah by its position in relation to the city of David and the lower city.</body></html>
