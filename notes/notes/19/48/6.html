Happy the kingdom, the city, the family, the heart, in which God is great, in which he is all. There God is known. The clearer discoveries are made to us of the Lord and his greatness, the more it is expected that we should abound in his praises. The earth is, by sin, covered with deformity, therefore justly might that spot of ground, which was beautified with holiness, be called the joy of the whole earth; that which the whole earth has reason to rejoice in, that God would thus in very deed dwell with man upon the earth. The kings of the earth were afraid of it. Nothing in nature can more fitly represent the overthrow of heathenism by the Spirit of the gospel, than the wreck of a fleet in a storm. Both are by the mighty power of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fear took hold upon them there - Trembling seized them; they were filled with sudden consternation.

The nobles of the peoples (&#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; with the twofold meaning of generosi), the "shields (i.e., the lords who are the defenders of their people) of the earth" (<a href="/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>), enter into the society of the people of the God of Abraham; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x391;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bc; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, as Theodoret observes. The promise concerning the blessing of the tribes of the nations in the seed of the patriarch is being fulfilled; for the nobles draw the peoples who are protected by them after themselves. It is unnecessary to read &#1506;&#1501; instead of &#1506;&#1501; with Ewald, and following the lxx and Syriac; and it is also inadmissible, since one does not say &#1504;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507; &#1506;&#1501;, but &#1500; or &#1488;&#1500;. Even Eusebius has rightly praised Symmachus and Theodotion, because they have translated the ambiguous &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc; by &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x391;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;), viz., as being a nominative of the effect or result, as it is also understood by the Targum, Jerome, Luther, and most of the Jewish expositors, and among modern expositors by Crusius, Hupfeld, and Hitzig: They gather and band themselves together as a people or into a people of the God of Abraham, they submit themselves with Israel to the one God who is proved to be so glorious.<p>(Note: It is also accented accordingly, viz., &#1504;&#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1493; with Rebia magnum, which (and in this respect it is distinguished from Mugrash) makes a pause; and this is then followed by the supplementing clause with Zinnor, Galgal, and Olewejored.)<p>The conclusion (v. 11) reminds one of the song of Hannah, <a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>. Thus universal homage is rendered to Him: He is gone up in triumph, and is in consequence thereof highly exalted (&#1504;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, 3rd praet., the result of consequence of the &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/47-6.htm">Psalm 47:6</a>). </body></html>
