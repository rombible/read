Though true Christians are few number, strangers and pilgrims upon earth, yet a far better inheritance than Canaan is made sure to them by the covenant of God; and if we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit, none can do us any harm. Afflictions are among our mercies. They prove our faith and love, they humble our pride, they wean us from the world, and quicken our prayers. Bread is the staff which supports life; when that staff is broken, the body fails and sinks to the earth. The word of God is the staff of spiritual life, the food and support of the soul: the sorest judgment is a famine of hearing the word of the Lord. Such a famine was sore in all lands when Christ appeared in the flesh; whose coming, and the blessed effect of it, are shadowed forth in the history of Joseph. At the appointed time Christ was exalted as Mediator; all the treasures of grace and salvation are at his disposal, perishing sinners come to him, and are relieved by him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/105.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The king sent and loosed him - Released him from prison. <a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>.

That is, Pharaoh king of Egypt sent messengers to the prison, and ordered Joseph to be loosed, as soon as ever he heard the account which the chief butler gave of him, and of his skill in interpreting dreams. <p>Even the ruler of the people; or "peoples": the subjects of Pharaoh's kingdom being very numerous. <p>And let him go free, ordered his fetters to be taken off, and him to be set at liberty, to go where he pleased; or, however, that he might come to court, whither he was brought, and which was the end of his releasement; see <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>, in this he was a type of Christ in his resurrection from the dead; who for a while was under the dominion of death, was held with the pains and cords of it, and was under the power and in the prison of the grave; but it was not possible, considering the dignity of his person, and the performance of his work as a surety, that he should be held here. Wherefore the cords and pains of death were loosed, and he was brought out of prison; God his Father, the King of kings, sent an angel from heaven, to roll away the stone of the sepulchre, and let the prisoner free; so that he was legally and judicially discharged and acquitted; as it was proper he should, having satisfied both law and justice; he was justified in the Spirit when he rose from the dead, and all his people were justified in him, for he rose again for their justification. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/105.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/105.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">The king sent</span>. &c.] <a href="/genesis/41-14.htm" title="Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in to Pharaoh.">Genesis 41:14</a><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/105.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king sent and loosed him</span> (see <a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Even the ruler of the people.</span> Pharaoh, ruler of the Egyptians. <span class="cmt_word">Let him go free;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> made him a free man, instead of a prisoner and a slave. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/105.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The poet now celebrates the divine preservation which had sway over the small beginnings of Israel, when it made the patriarchs proof against harm on their wanderings. "Men of number" are such as can be easily counted, vid., the confessions in <a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; places the claim upon the hospitality at one time of this people and at another time of that people in the connection with it of cause and effect. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, as a small number, only such a small number, signifies, as being virtually an adjective: inconsiderable, insignificant, worthless (<a href="/proverbs/10-20.htm">Proverbs 10:20</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; refers to Canaan. In <a href="/psalms/105-13.htm">Psalm 105:13</a> the way in which the words &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; and &#1506;&#1501; alternate is instructive: the former signifies the nation, bound together by a common origin, language, country, and descent; the latter the people, bound together by unity of government.<p>(Note: For this reason a king says &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, not &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497;; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; only occurs twice with a suffix, which refers to Jahve (<a href="/psalms/106-5.htm">Psalm 106:5</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>); for this reason &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, frequently side by side with &#1506;&#1501;, is the nobler word, e.g., in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>; for this reason &#1506;&#1501; is frequently added to &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; as a dignitative predicate, <a href="/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>; and for this reason &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1501; &#1492; are used antithetically.)<p>The apodosis does not begin until <a href="/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14</a>. It is different in connection with &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; in the text of the chronicler, and in this passage in the Psalter of the Syriac version, according to which <a href="/psalms/105-12.htm">Psalm 105:12</a> ought to be jointed to the preceding group. The variation &#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; instead of &#1502;&#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; is of no consequence; but &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (to any one whomsoever) instead of &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, in connection with &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;, restores the current mode of expression (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:11</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-11.htm">2 Samuel 16:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>) instead of one which is without support elsewhere, but which follows the model of &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, &#1504;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/genesis/31-28.htm">Genesis 31:28</a> (cf. supra p. 171); whilst on the other hand &#1493;&#1489;&#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497; instead of &#1493;&#1500;&#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497; substitutes an expression that cannot be supported for the current one (<a href="/genesis/19-9.htm">Genesis 19:9</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-21.htm">Ruth 1:21</a>). In <a href="/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14</a> the poet has the three histories of the preservation of the wives of the patriarchs in his mind, viz., of Sarah in Egypt (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>), and of Sarah and of Rebekah both in Philistia (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/20-1.htm">Psalm 20:1-9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1-12</a>, cf. especially <a href="/psalms/26-11.htm">Psalm 26:11</a>). In the second instance God declares the patriarch to be a "prophet" (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). The one mention has reference to this and the other to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>, where Abram is set apart to be the father of peoples and kings, and Sarai to be a princess. They are called &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (a passive form) as eing God-chosen princes, and &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (an intensive active form, from &#1504;&#1489;&#1488;, root &#1504;&#1489;, to divulge), not as being inspired ones (Hupfeld), but as being God's spokesmen (cf. <a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>. with <a href="/exodus/4-15.htm">Exodus 4:15</a>.), therefore as being the recipients and mediators of a divine revelation. </body></html>
