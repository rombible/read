Yet instruments shall be raised up for their deliverance, and plagues may be expected by persecutors. And see the special care God took of his people in the wilderness. All the benefits bestowed on Israel as a nation, were shadows of spiritual blessings with which we are blessed in Christ Jesus. Having redeemed us with his blood, restored our souls to holiness, and set us at liberty from Satan's bondage, he guides and guards us all the way. He satisfies our souls with the bread of heaven, and the water of life from the Rock of salvation, and will bring us safely to heaven. He redeems his servants from all iniquity, and purifies them unto himself, to be a peculiar people, zealous of good works.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/105.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he increased his people greatly ... - God caused them to multiply. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>, <a href="/exodus/1-9.htm">Exodus 1:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/105.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23-25.

God increased the people of Israel greatly in the land of Egypt; they went down few, and became a populous nation; only sixty six persons, besides Jacob's sons' wives; and when they came out from thence were six hundred thousand footmen; yea, they increased the more they were afflicted, <a href="/exodus/1-12.htm">Exodus 1:12</a>. So the people of God in this world sometimes increase in number, and that even amidst the persecutions of their enemies; as the Christians did in the first times of the Gospel under the Roman emperors; and they increase in grace, in every grace, and oftentimes the more they are tried and exercised by afflictions. <p>And made them stronger than their enemies; in their bodies, being more healthy, strong, and robust; and which was seen, observed, and owned by their enemies, <a href="/exodus/1-9.htm">Exodus 1:9</a>.

To break the staff of bread (i.e., the staff which bread is to man) is a very old metaphor, <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>. That the selling of Joseph was, providentially regarded, a "sending before," he himself says in <a href="/genesis/45-5.htm">Genesis 45:5</a>. <a href="/psalms/102-24.htm">Psalm 102:24</a> throws light upon the meaning of &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;. The Ker&#1502; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493; is just as much without any occasion to justify it as &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; in <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a> (for &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;). The statement that iron came upon his soul is intended to say that he had to endure in iron fetters sufferings that threatened his life. Most expositors take &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; as equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;, but Hitzig rightly takes &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; as an object, following the Targum; for &#1489;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; as a name of an iron fetter <p>(Note: Also in ancient Arabic firzil (after the Aramaic &#1508;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;&#1488;) directly signifies an iron fetter (and the large smith's shears for cutting the iron), whence the verb. denom. Arab. farzala, c. acc. pers., to put any one into iron chains. Iron is called &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;, to pierce, like the Arabic h&#803;d&#305;&#770;d, as being the material of which pointed tools are made.)<p>can change its gender, as do, e.g., &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; as a name of the north wind, and &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; as a name of the soul. The imprisonment (so harsh at the commencement) lasted over ten years, until at last Joseph's word cam to pass, viz., the word concerning this exaltation which had been revealed to him in dreams (<a href="/genesis/42-9.htm">Genesis 42:9</a>). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>, &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; appears to be the word of Jahve, but then one would expect from <a href="/psalms/105-19.htm">Psalm 105:19</a> a more parallel turn of expression. What is meant is Joseph's open-hearted word concerning his visions, and &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492; is the revelation of God conveying His promises, which came to him in the same form, which had to try, to prove, and to purify him (&#1510;&#1512;&#1507; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>, and frequently), inasmuch as he was not to be raised to honour without having in a state of deep abasement proved a faithfulness that wavered not, and a confidence that knew no despair. The divine "word" is conceived of as a living effectual power, as in <a href="/psalms/119-50.htm">Psalm 119:50</a>. The representation of the exaltation begins, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>, with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;<p>(Note: Here &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; is united by Makkeph with the following word, to which it hurries on, whereas in <a href="/psalms/105-28.htm">Psalm 105:28</a> it has its own accent, a circumstance to which the Masora has directed attention in the apophthegm: &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497; &#1491;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1488; &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497; &#1491;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1499;&#1488; &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; (the emissaries of the king are in haste, those of darkness are tardy); vid., Baer, Thorath Emeth, p. 22.)<p>and follows <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39-41</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-44.htm">Genesis 41:44</a>, very closely as to the rest, according to which &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is a collateral definition to &#1500;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512; (with an orthophonic Dag.) in the sense of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;: by his soul, i.e., by virtue of his will (vid., Psychology, S. 202; tr. p. 239). In consequence of this exaltation of Joseph, Jacob-Israel came then into Egypt, and sojourned there as in a protecting house of shelter (concerning &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, vid., supra, p. 414). Egypt is called (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-23.htm">Psalm 105:23</a>, <a href="/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>) the land of Chaam, as in <a href="/psalms/78-51.htm">Psalm 78:51</a>; according to Plutarch, in the vernacular the black land, from the dark ashy grey colouring which the deposited mud of the Nile gives to the ground. There Israel became a powerful, numerous people (<a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>), greater than their oppressors. </body></html>
