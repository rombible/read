All the benefits bestowed on Israel as a nation, were shadows of spiritual blessings with which we are blessed in Christ Jesus.

The reasons for these dealings: (1) God's faithfulness to His covenant, "His holy promise" of Canaan, is the fountain whence flowed so many acts of marvellous kindness to His people (compare Ps 105:8, 11). Ex 2:24 is the fundamental passage [Hengstenberg]. (2) That they might be obedient. The observance of God's commands by Abraham was the object of the covenant with him (Ge 18:19), as it was also the object of the covenant with Israel, that they might observe God's statutes.<p>remembered &#8230; and Abraham&#8212;or, "remembered His holy word (that is, covenant confirmed) with Abraham."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/105.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or rather, <span class="ital">with</span> (as this particle is oft used) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Abraham; </span> made with or to Abraham. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/105.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he remembered his holy promise,.... It was not owing to the goodness of this people, to their obedience to the divine will, to any worthiness or merit of theirs, that such signs and wonders were wrought for them in Egypt; and that they were brought out from thence in such a manner as they were; and were protected and so plentifully provided for in the wilderness; but it was owing to the grace and goodness of God, to his covenant and promise, which he sacredly and inviolably observed; the grace and covenant of God are the source and spring of all blessings of goodness; he is ever mindful of his covenant, and therefore sends meat to them that fear him, as he did to the Israelites, <a href="/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a>. <p>And Abraham his servant; or the promise he made to Abraham his servant; so the Targum, <p>"which "was" with Abraham his servant;'' <p>that is, which holy word or promise was with Abraham, was spoken to him; and was with him, that he would give him and his seed the land of Canaan; and that though they should be afflicted long in Egypt, yet should come out from thence with great substance, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>, this he remembered, as he never forgets any promise of his, nor ever suffers his faithfulness to fail, nor his covenant to be broken.

It was indirectly God's work, inasmuch as He gave increasing might to His people, which excited their jealousy. The craft reached its highest pitch in the weakening of the Israelites that was aimed at by killing all the male children that were born. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; signifies facts, instances, as in <a href="/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>. Here, too, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>, the miraculous judgments of the ten plagues to not stand in exactly historical order. The poet begins with the ninth, which was the most distinct self-representation of divine wrath, viz., the darkness (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-29</a>): sha&#772;'lach cho&#772;'shech. The former word (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;) has an orthophonic Gaja by the final syllable, which warns the reader audibly to utter the guttural of the toneless final syllable, which might here be easily slurred over. The Hiph. &#1492;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498; has its causative signification here, as also in <a href="/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>; the contracted mode of writing with i instead of &#305;&#770; may be occasioned by the Waw convers. <a href="/psalms/105-28.htm">Psalm 105:28</a> cannot be referred to the Egyptians; for the expression would be a mistaken one for the final compliance, which was wrung from them, and the interrogative way of taking it: nonne rebellarunt, is forced: the cancelling of the &#1500;&#1488;, however (lxx and Syriac), makes the thought halting. Hitzig proposes &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;: they observed not His words; but this, too, sounds flat and awkward when said of the Egyptians. The subject will therefore be the same as the subject of &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;; and of Moses and Aaron, in contrast to the behaviour at Me&#770;-Mer&#305;&#770;bah (<a href="/numbers/20-24.htm">Numbers 20:24</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-21.htm">1 Kings 13:21</a>, <a href="/1_kings/13-26.htm">1 Kings 13:26</a>), it is said that this time they rebelled not against the words (Ker, without any ground: the word) of God, but executed the terrible commands accurately and willingly. From the ninth plague the poet in <a href="/psalms/105-29.htm">Psalm 105:29</a> passes over to the first (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/7-14.htm">Exodus 7:14-25</a>), viz., the red blood is appended to the black darkness. The second plague follows, viz., the frogs (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/8-1.htm">Exodus 8:1-15</a>); <a href="/psalms/105-20.htm">Psalm 105:20</a> looks as though it were stunted, but neither has the lxx read any &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493; (&#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;), <a href="/exodus/7-28.htm">Exodus 7:28</a>. In <a href="/psalms/105-31.htm">Psalm 105:31</a> he next briefly touches upon the fourth plague, viz., the gad-fly, &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, lxx &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/8-20.htm">Exodus 8:20-32</a>, vid., on <a href="/psalms/78-45.htm">Psalm 78:45</a>), and the third (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/8-16.htm">Exodus 8:16-19</a>), viz., the gnats, which are passed over in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>. From the third plague the poet in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-32.htm">Psalm 105:32</a>, <a href="/psalms/105-33.htm">Psalm 105:33</a> takes a leap over to the seventh, viz., the hail (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-13.htm">Exodus 9:13-35</a>). In <a href="/psalms/105-32.htm">Psalm 105:32</a> he has <a href="/exodus/9-24.htm">Exodus 9:24</a> before his mind, according to which masses of fire descended with the hail; and in <a href="/psalms/105-33.htm">Psalm 105:33</a> (as in <a href="/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>) he fills in the details of <a href="/exodus/9-25.htm">Exodus 9:25</a>. The seventh plague is followed by the eighth in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-35.htm">Psalm 105:35</a>, viz., the locust (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1-20</a>), to which &#1497;&#1500;&#1511; (the grasshopper) is the parallel word here, just as &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; (the cricket) is in <a href="/psalms/78-46.htm">Psalm 78:46</a>. The expression of innumerableness is the same as in <a href="/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25</a>. The fifth plague, viz., the pestilence, murrain (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1-7</a>), and the sixth, viz., &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1503;, boils (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-8.htm">Exodus 9:8-12</a>), are left unmentioned; and the tenth plague closes, viz., the smiting of the first-born (<a href="/exodus/11-1.htm">Exodus 11:1</a>.), which <a href="/psalms/105-36.htm">Psalm 105:36</a> expresses in the Asaphic language of <a href="/psalms/78-51.htm">Psalm 78:51</a>. Without any mention of the institution of the Passover, the tenth plague is followed by the departure with the vessels of silver and gold asked for from the Egyptians (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35</a>; <a href="/exodus/11-2.htm">Exodus 11:2</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-22.htm">Exodus 3:22</a>). The Egyptians were glad to get rid of the people whose detention threatened them with total destruction (<a href="/exodus/12-33.htm">Exodus 12:33</a>). The poet here draws from <a href="/isaiah/5-27.htm">Isaiah 5:27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-13.htm">Isaiah 63:13</a>, and <a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>. The suffix of &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1493; refers to the chief subject of the assertion, viz., to God, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/122-4.htm">Psalm 122:4</a>, although manifestly enough the reference to Israel is also possible (<a href="/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a>). </body></html>
