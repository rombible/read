That is, He so ordered things that they became the enemies of his people, and made it necessary that they should be removed into another land. It is not said that God did this by his direct "power;" or that he "compelled" them to hate his people; or that he in any way interfered with their "will;" or that he regarded this "as a good" in itself; or that he "approved" of it: but this is said in accordance with the usual representations in the Bible, where God is spoken of as having all things under his control, and where it is constantly affirmed that nothing takes place without his own proper agency and government in the matter. Nothing - not even the human will - free as it is - is independent of God; and not even the worst passions of men are "outside of his plan," or independent in such a sense that he does not afford the opportunity for their development and display.

"When Saul had turned his back to go from (God's prophet) Samuel, God turned (Margin) him another heart" (see Ex 1:8, &c.). Whatever evil the wicked man plots against God's people, God holds bound even his heart, so as not to lay a single plan except what God permits. Thus Isaiah (Isa 43:17) says it was God who brought forth the army of Pharaoh to pursue Israel to their own destruction (Ex 4:21; 7:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/105.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He turned their heart to hate his people; </span> not by putting this wicked hatred into them, which is not consistent either with the holiness of God’s nature, or with the truth of his word, and which was altogether unnecessary, because they had that and all other wickedness in them by nature; but partly, by withdrawing the common gifts and operations of his Spirit, and all other restraints and hinderances to it, and wholly leaving them to their own mistakes, and passions, and corrupt affections, which of their own accord were ready to take that course; partly, by ordering the affairs of his people in such manner as might give them occasion of hatred; and partly, by directing and governing that hatred, which was wholly in and from themselves, so as it should fall upon the Israelites rather than upon other people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To deal subtilly with his servants; </span> to destroy them by crafty devices; of which see <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/1-11.htm" title="Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens.

Whom before they loved and esteemed: when Pharaoh and his servants heard of Joseph's father and brethren, they were greatly pleased, and invited them into Egypt; and, when come, placed them in the land of Goshen; but when a new king arose, and a new generation, which knew not Joseph, the hearts of these were turned to hate them. This is said to be of the Lord: not that he put any hatred into them, there was no need of that; there is enough of that naturally in every man's heart against good men, and all that is good: but he did not restrain that hatred, as he could have done, but suffered them to let it have vent; and moreover, he did those things which were an occasion of it, and which served to stir up their hatred; as increasing their numbers, and making them stronger and mightier than they, <a href="/exodus/1-9.htm">Exodus 1:9</a>. <p>To deal subtilly with his servants; by putting them to hard labour, and using them with great rigour, in order to weaken their strength; by commanding the midwives to kill every son that was born; and by publishing an edict, to cast every male child into the river and drown it, and so hinder the increase of them. Thus the people of God have their enemies that hate them; that are subtle and cunning, wise to do evil, full of all subtilty and wicked craft; Satan, at the head of them, has his artful methods, wiles, stratagems, and devices: but the Lord is wiser than all, and knows how to deliver his people out of the hands of all their enemies, as he did the children of Israel; of which there is an account in the following verses. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/105.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{n}</span> He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</span><p>(n) So it is in God, either to move the hearts of the wicked to love or to hate God's children.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/105.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">He turned their heart</span>] The rendering of the Targ., followed in P.B.V., <span class="ital">Whose heart turned</span>, is grammatically possible, but A.V. is no doubt right.

The Ker&#1502; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493; is just as much without any occasion to justify it as &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; in <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a> (for &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;). The statement that iron came upon his soul is intended to say that he had to endure in iron fetters sufferings that threatened his life. Most expositors take &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; as equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;, but Hitzig rightly takes &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; as an object, following the Targum; for &#1489;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; as a name of an iron fetter <p>(Note: Also in ancient Arabic firzil (after the Aramaic &#1508;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;&#1488;) directly signifies an iron fetter (and the large smith's shears for cutting the iron), whence the verb. denom. Arab. farzala, c. acc. pers., to put any one into iron chains. Iron is called &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;, to pierce, like the Arabic h&#803;d&#305;&#770;d, as being the material of which pointed tools are made.)<p>can change its gender, as do, e.g., &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; as a name of the north wind, and &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; as a name of the soul. The imprisonment (so harsh at the commencement) lasted over ten years, until at last Joseph's word cam to pass, viz., the word concerning this exaltation which had been revealed to him in dreams (<a href="/genesis/42-9.htm">Genesis 42:9</a>). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>, &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; appears to be the word of Jahve, but then one would expect from <a href="/psalms/105-19.htm">Psalm 105:19</a> a more parallel turn of expression. What is meant is Joseph's open-hearted word concerning his visions, and &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492; is the revelation of God conveying His promises, which came to him in the same form, which had to try, to prove, and to purify him (&#1510;&#1512;&#1507; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>, and frequently), inasmuch as he was not to be raised to honour without having in a state of deep abasement proved a faithfulness that wavered not, and a confidence that knew no despair. The divine "word" is conceived of as a living effectual power, as in <a href="/psalms/119-50.htm">Psalm 119:50</a>. The representation of the exaltation begins, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>, with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;<p>(Note: Here &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; is united by Makkeph with the following word, to which it hurries on, whereas in <a href="/psalms/105-28.htm">Psalm 105:28</a> it has its own accent, a circumstance to which the Masora has directed attention in the apophthegm: &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497; &#1491;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1488; &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497; &#1491;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1499;&#1488; &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; (the emissaries of the king are in haste, those of darkness are tardy); vid., Baer, Thorath Emeth, p. 22.)<p>and follows <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39-41</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-44.htm">Genesis 41:44</a>, very closely as to the rest, according to which &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is a collateral definition to &#1500;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512; (with an orthophonic Dag.) in the sense of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;: by his soul, i.e., by virtue of his will (vid., Psychology, S. 202; tr. p. 239). In consequence of this exaltation of Joseph, Jacob-Israel came then into Egypt, and sojourned there as in a protecting house of shelter (concerning &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, vid., supra, p. 414). Egypt is called (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-23.htm">Psalm 105:23</a>, <a href="/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>) the land of Chaam, as in <a href="/psalms/78-51.htm">Psalm 78:51</a>; according to Plutarch, in the vernacular the black land, from the dark ashy grey colouring which the deposited mud of the Nile gives to the ground. There Israel became a powerful, numerous people (<a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>), greater than their oppressors. </body></html>
