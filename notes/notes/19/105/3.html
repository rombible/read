The idea is, In your praises let the main subject be the name of God - that holy name by which he chooses to be known. The Hebrew is, "the name of his holiness." It implies<p>(a) that we should rejoice in God - in his very name - in that by which he chooses to make himself known;<p>(b) that it is a special subject of praise and rejoicing that his name is "holy;" that is, that he is a holy Being.<p>This can be a subject of real rejoicing only to those who are themselves holy; but properly considered, one of the highest reasons for rejoicing in God is the fact that he is holy; that he cannot look upon sin but with abhorrence. There would be no ground of confidence in God if this were not so.<p>Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord - That desire to know him; that come to praise him. Let their hearts rejoice - or, let them be happy:<p>(a) because they are "permitted" to seek him;<p>(b) because they are inclined to seek him;<p>(c) because they have such a God to come to - One so mighty, so holy, so good, so gracious. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/105.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4.

For if they cease to give Him pleasure, He can indeed blot them out as He did at the time of the Flood, since He is always able by a look to put the earth in a tremble, and by a touch to set the mountains on fire (&#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1491; of the result of the looking, as in <a href="/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; of that which takes place simultaneously with the touching, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-5.htm">Psalm 144:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/9-5.htm">Zechariah 9:5</a>, cf. on <a href="/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a>). The poet, however, on his part, will not suffer there to be any lack of the glorifying of Jahve, inasmuch as he makes it his life's work to praise his God with music and song (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>, cf. Bar. 4:20, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;). Oh that this his quiet and his audible meditation upon the honour of God may be pleasing to Him (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500; synonymous with &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;, but also &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>)! Oh that Jahve may be able to rejoice in him, as he himself will rejoice in his God! Between "I will rejoice," <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-34.htm">Psalm 104:34</a>, and "He shall rejoice," <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-31.htm">Psalm 104:31</a>, there exists a reciprocal relation, as between the Sabbath of the creature in God and the Sabbath of God in the creature. When the Psalmist wishes that God may have joy in His works of creation, and seeks on his part to please God and to have his joy in God, he is also warranted in wishing that those who take pleasure in wickedness, and instead of giving God joy excite His wrath, may be removed from the earth (&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, cf. <a href="/numbers/14-35.htm">Numbers 14:35</a>); for they are contrary to the purpose of the good creation of God, they imperil its continuance, and mar the joy of His creatures. The expression is not: may sins (&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, as it is meant to be read in B. Berachoth, 10a, and as some editions, e.g., Bomberg's of 1521, actually have it), but: may sinners, be no more, for there is no other existence of sin than the personal one.<p>With the words Bless, O my soul, Jahve, the Psalm recurs to its introduction, and to this call upon himself is appended the Hallelujah which summons all creatures to the praise of God - a call of devotion which occurs nowhere out of the Psalter, and within the Psalter is found here for the first time, and consequently was only coined in the alter age. In modern printed copies it is sometimes written &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468;, sometimes &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1492;&#1468;, but in the earlier copies (e.g., Venice 1521, Wittenberg 1566) mostly as one word &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468;.<p>(Note: More accurately &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; with Chateph, as Jekuthil ha-Nakdan expressly demands. Moreover the mode of writing it as one word is the rule, since the Masora notes the &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468;, occurring only once, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135-3.htm">Psalm 135:3</a>, with &#1500;&#1497;&#1514; &#1489;&#1496;&#1506;&#1501; as being the only instance of the kind.)<p>In the majority of MSS it is also found thus as one word, <p>(Note: Yet even in the Talmud (J. Megilla i. 9, Sofrim v. 10) it is a matter of controversy concerning the mode of writing this word, whether it is to be separate or combined; and in B. Pesachim 117a Rab appeals to a Psalter of the school of Chabibi (&#1514;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; &#1491;&#1489;&#1497; &#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;) that he has seen, in which &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493; stood in one line and &#1497;&#1492; in the other. In the same place Rab Chasda appeals to a &#1514;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; &#1491;&#1489;&#1497; &#1512;&#1489; &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; that he has seen, in which the Hallelujah standing between two Psalms, which might be regarded as the close of the Psalm preceding it or as the beginning of the Psalm following it, as written in the middle between the two (&#1489;&#1506;&#1502;&#1510;&#1506; &#1508;&#1497;&#1512;&#1511;&#1488;). In the &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; written as one word, &#1497;&#1492; is not regarded as strictly the divine name, only as an addition strengthening the notion of the &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;, as in &#1489;&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; <a href="/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>; with reference to this, vide Geiger, Urschrift, S. 275.)<p>and that always with &#1492;&#1468;, except the first &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; which occurs here at the end of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104.htm">Psalm 104</a>, which has &#1492; raphe in good MSS and old printed copies. This mode of writing is that attested by the Masora (vid., Baer's Psalterium, p. 132). The Talmud and Midrash observe this first Hallelujah is connected in a significant manner with the prospect of the final overthrow of the wicked. Ben-Pazzi (B. Berachoth 10a) counts 103 &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; up to this Hallelujah, reckoning <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-12</a> as one &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;'. </body></html>
