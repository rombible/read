Though true Christians are few number, strangers and pilgrims upon earth, yet a far better inheritance than Canaan is made sure to them by the covenant of God; and if we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit, none can do us any harm. Afflictions are among our mercies. They prove our faith and love, they humble our pride, they wean us from the world, and quicken our prayers. Bread is the staff which supports life; when that staff is broken, the body fails and sinks to the earth. The word of God is the staff of spiritual life, the food and support of the soul: the sorest judgment is a famine of hearing the word of the Lord. Such a famine was sore in all lands when Christ appeared in the flesh; whose coming, and the blessed effect of it, are shadowed forth in the history of Joseph. At the appointed time Christ was exalted as Mediator; all the treasures of grace and salvation are at his disposal, perishing sinners come to him, and are relieved by him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/105.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He made him lord of his house - <a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>.

That is, Pharaoh made Joseph lord chamberlain of his household; after he had him to court, and he had interpreted his dreams to him to his great satisfaction, and had given him such prudent advice to provide against the years of famine; see <a href="/genesis/41-33.htm">Genesis 41:33</a>. So Christ, after his resurrection, was received up into heaven, and was made and declared Lord and Christ, Lord of all, having all power in heaven and earth given to him; particularly had the care of the church committed to him, which is the house of God, of his building, and where he dwells; where his children are born, brought up, and provided for. Here Christ is as a Son over his own house, as the owner and proprietor of it; here he is King, Priest, and Prophet; and is the provider for all in it, both of food and clothing: <p>of him the whole family in heaven and in earth is named, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/3-15.htm">Ephesians 3:15</a>, though he makes use of under stewards, to give to everyone their portion of meat in due season. <p>And ruler of all his substance, or "possession" (h); lord treasurer of all his revenue, <a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>. Herein also he was a type of Christ, who, as God, is possessor of heaven and earth, being the Creator of them; but, as Mediator, he has all things delivered into his hands; all are at his dispose, to subserve the ends of his mediatorial office; he has all temporal things, gold and silver, riches and honour, to bestow upon men at pleasure; more especially all spiritual things are with him; the gifts of the Spirit, which he has without measure; and the fulness of all grace, which it has pleased the Father should dwell in him; the blessings of the everlasting covenant, and the promises of it; all the riches of grace, pardoning, justifying, and adopting grace, and all the riches of glory. <p>(h) "possessione sua", Pagninus, Montanus; so Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/105.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/105.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21, 22</span>.

"Men of number" are such as can be easily counted, vid., the confessions in <a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; places the claim upon the hospitality at one time of this people and at another time of that people in the connection with it of cause and effect. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, as a small number, only such a small number, signifies, as being virtually an adjective: inconsiderable, insignificant, worthless (<a href="/proverbs/10-20.htm">Proverbs 10:20</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; refers to Canaan. In <a href="/psalms/105-13.htm">Psalm 105:13</a> the way in which the words &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; and &#1506;&#1501; alternate is instructive: the former signifies the nation, bound together by a common origin, language, country, and descent; the latter the people, bound together by unity of government.<p>(Note: For this reason a king says &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, not &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497;; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; only occurs twice with a suffix, which refers to Jahve (<a href="/psalms/106-5.htm">Psalm 106:5</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>); for this reason &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, frequently side by side with &#1506;&#1501;, is the nobler word, e.g., in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>; for this reason &#1506;&#1501; is frequently added to &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; as a dignitative predicate, <a href="/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>; and for this reason &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1501; &#1492; are used antithetically.)<p>The apodosis does not begin until <a href="/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14</a>.

The variation &#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; instead of &#1502;&#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; is of no consequence; but &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (to any one whomsoever) instead of &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, in connection with &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;, restores the current mode of expression (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:11</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-11.htm">2 Samuel 16:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>) instead of one which is without support elsewhere, but which follows the model of &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, &#1504;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/genesis/31-28.htm">Genesis 31:28</a> (cf. supra p. 171); whilst on the other hand &#1493;&#1489;&#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497; instead of &#1493;&#1500;&#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497; substitutes an expression that cannot be supported for the current one (<a href="/genesis/19-9.htm">Genesis 19:9</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-21.htm">Ruth 1:21</a>). In <a href="/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14</a> the poet has the three histories of the preservation of the wives of the patriarchs in his mind, viz., of Sarah in Egypt (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>), and of Sarah and of Rebekah both in Philistia (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/20-1.htm">Psalm 20:1-9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1-12</a>, cf. especially <a href="/psalms/26-11.htm">Psalm 26:11</a>). In the second instance God declares the patriarch to be a "prophet" (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). The one mention has reference to this and the other to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>, where Abram is set apart to be the father of peoples and kings, and Sarai to be a princess. They are called &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (a passive form) as eing God-chosen princes, and &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (an intensive active form, from &#1504;&#1489;&#1488;, root &#1504;&#1489;, to divulge), not as being inspired ones (Hupfeld), but as being God's spokesmen (cf. <a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>. with <a href="/exodus/4-15.htm">Exodus 4:15</a>.), therefore as being the recipients and mediators of a divine revelation. </body></html>
