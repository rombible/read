Though true Christians are few number, strangers and pilgrims upon earth, yet a far better inheritance than Canaan is made sure to them by the covenant of God; and if we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit, none can do us any harm. Afflictions are among our mercies. They prove our faith and love, they humble our pride, they wean us from the world, and quicken our prayers. Bread is the staff which supports life; when that staff is broken, the body fails and sinks to the earth. The word of God is the staff of spiritual life, the food and support of the soul: the sorest judgment is a famine of hearing the word of the Lord. Such a famine was sore in all lands when Christ appeared in the flesh; whose coming, and the blessed effect of it, are shadowed forth in the history of Joseph. At the appointed time Christ was exalted as Mediator; all the treasures of grace and salvation are at his disposal, perishing sinners come to him, and are relieved by him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/105.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan - <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-15</a>.<p>The lot of your inheritance - Or, that shall be the lot of your inheritance; or, what you shall inherit. The margin is, "the cord." The Hebrew word - &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;  chebel - means properly a cord, a rope; and then, a measuring-line. Hence, it means a portion "measured out" and assigned to anyone as land, <a href="/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-9.htm">Joshua 19:9</a>. Compare <a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>. The meaning is, that the land of Canaan was given by promise to the patriarchs as their lot or portion of the earth; as that which they and their descendants were to possess as their own. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/105.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10, 11. Alluding to God's promise to Jacob (Ge 28:13). Out of the whole storehouse of the promises of God, only one is prominently brought forward, namely, that concerning the possession of Canaan [Ps 105:11]. Everything revolves around this. The wonders and judgments have all for their ultimate design the fulfilment of this promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/105.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The portion assigned to you by lot and the designation of Divine Providence. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm" title="For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.">Deu 32:9</a>"</span>; <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/psalms/16-6.htm" title="The lines are fallen to me in pleasant places; yes, I have a goodly heritage.">Psalm 16:6</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/105.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Saying, unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,.... To each of the above persons, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their posterity, the children of Israel. Not that the word "saying", as Gussetius (c) well observes, signifies that the words following it are expressive of the covenant, for that is expressed <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-7.htm">Psalm 105:7</a>, the main article, sum, and substance of it, being this, that the Lord was their God; but it only signifies that this earthly promise was pronounced when that everlasting covenant was given, <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>. Besides, this must be considered as typical of the heavenly inheritance; as that was a land of promise, so is this; it is the promise, the grand promise, which God has promised; as that was a land prepared and ready furnished with houses, fields, and vineyards, so is heaven a kingdom prepared by God the Father, and by the presence and mediation of his Son; as the Israelites passing through the wilderness met with many difficulties, and fought many battles, before possessed of it, so the people of God pass through the wilderness of this world, go through many tribulations, and fight the good fight of faith before they lay hold on eternal life; and as not Moses, but Joshua, led the people into the land, so not the law, but Jesus the Saviour, the great Captain of salvation, brings the many sons to glory; and as that was a land of rest after fatiguing travels, is heaven the sabbatism or rest for the people of God, a rest from all their toil and labour; and as the one was the pure gift of God, so is the other: <p>to thee will I give, &amp;c. And as the land of Canaan is here called "the lot of your inheritance", it being divided and distributed by lot to the children of Israel, who find each their proper share and portion, <a href="/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1</a> so heaven is an inheritance, not purchased, nor acquired, but bequeathed by the will of God; comes through the death of the testator Christ, belongs only to children, and is, as inheritances are, for ever; this is also by lot, as the word is in <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>, not that it is a casual thing, for it is appointed by the Lord for his people, and they for that; it is what they are predestinated to, as in the aforementioned text; but it denotes that everyone shall have their part and portion in it. <p>(c) Ebr.
