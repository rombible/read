Though true Christians are few number, strangers and pilgrims upon earth, yet a far better inheritance than Canaan is made sure to them by the covenant of God; and if we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit, none can do us any harm. Afflictions are among our mercies. They prove our faith and love, they humble our pride, they wean us from the world, and quicken our prayers. Bread is the staff which supports life; when that staff is broken, the body fails and sinks to the earth. The word of God is the staff of spiritual life, the food and support of the soul: the sorest judgment is a famine of hearing the word of the Lord. Such a famine was sore in all lands when Christ appeared in the flesh; whose coming, and the blessed effect of it, are shadowed forth in the history of Joseph. At the appointed time Christ was exalted as Mediator; all the treasures of grace and salvation are at his disposal, perishing sinners come to him, and are relieved by him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/105.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He sent a man before them - That is, He so ordered it by his providence that a man - Joseph - was sent before the family of Jacob into Egypt, that he might make arrangements for their reception and preservation. The whole matter was as God had sent him, or had commanded him to go. And yet it was brought about as the result of a series of acts of the most wicked character; by the envy and the hatred of his brethren; by their guilt and hardness of heart in proposing at first to put him to death, and then in their arrangements for selling him to hopeless slavery; by their plan so to dispose of him that their father might never hear of him again, and that they might be troubled with him no more. God did not cause these acts. He did not command them; he did not approve of them. And yet, since they did occur, and since Joseph's brethren were so wicked, God made use of these things to accomplish his own benevolent purposes, and to carry out his great designs. So he makes use of the passions of wicked people at all times to execute his plans (compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-7</a>; see also <a href="/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a>; and <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>); and so he will do to the end of time.

Who, though but a lad of seventeen years of age when he was sold into Egypt, yet was a grown man when he stood before Pharaoh, and interpreted his dreams of plenty and famine to come; and advised him to lay up store in the years of plenty, against the years of famine; by which he appeared to be a wise man, as the Targum here calls him; see <a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>. Him God sent before into Egypt; before Jacob and his sons went down thither, to make provision for them, to support them in the time of famine, and preserve their lives.

Jahve is Israel's God: His righteous rule extends over the whole earth, whilst His people experience His inviolable faithfulness to His covenant. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/105-7.htm">Psalm 105:7</a> is in apposition to &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, for the God who bears this name is as a matter of course the object of the song of praise. &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; is the perfect of practically pledges certainty (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a>, where we find instead the future of confident prospect). The chronicler has &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; instead (lxx again something different: &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;); but the object is not the demanding but the promissory side of the covenant, so that consequently it is not Israel's remembering but God's that is spoken of. He remembers His covenant in all time to come, so that exile and want of independence as a state are only temporary, exceptional conditions. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; has its radical signification here, to establish, institute, <a href="/psalms/111-9.htm">Psalm 111:9</a>. &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1507; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (in which expression &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; is a specifying accusative) is taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>.

It is the oath on Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>) that is meant, which applied to Abraham and his seed. &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511; (chronicler &#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1495;&#1511;), as in <a href="/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-26.htm">Jeremiah 33:26</a>.

From Abraham and Isaac we come to Jacob-Israel, who as being the father of the twelve is the twelve-tribe nation itself that is coming into existence; hence the plural can alternate with the singular in <a href="/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1503; (chronicler, without the &#1488;&#1514;) is an accusative of the object, and &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; accusative of the predicate: the land of Canaan as the province of your own hereditary possession measured out with a measuring line (<a href="/psalms/78-55.htm">Psalm 78:55</a>). </body></html>
