Though true Christians are few number, strangers and pilgrims upon earth, yet a far better inheritance than Canaan is made sure to them by the covenant of God; and if we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit, none can do us any harm. Afflictions are among our mercies. They prove our faith and love, they humble our pride, they wean us from the world, and quicken our prayers. Bread is the staff which supports life; when that staff is broken, the body fails and sinks to the earth. The word of God is the staff of spiritual life, the food and support of the soul: the sorest judgment is a famine of hearing the word of the Lord. Such a famine was sore in all lands when Christ appeared in the flesh; whose coming, and the blessed effect of it, are shadowed forth in the history of Joseph. At the appointed time Christ was exalted as Mediator; all the treasures of grace and salvation are at his disposal, perishing sinners come to him, and are relieved by him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/105.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Israel also came into Egypt - Another name for Jacob; see <a href="/psalms/105-10.htm">Psalm 105:10</a>.<p>And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham - Not as a permanent abode, but as a temporary arrangement, until the time should come for the people to be removed to the land of promise.

That is, Jacob, as afterwards expressed, who had the name of Israel, from his wrestling with God and prevailing. He came into Egypt, being invited by Pharaoh, and having heard of his son Joseph being alive, and of his exaltation. <p>And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham: the same with Egypt; Mizraim, from whence Egypt has its name, being the son of Ham, <a href="/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>. Hence Egypt is called by Plutarch (k) Chemia; and Diodorus Siculus (l) speaks of a city in Thebais, or Upper Egypt, which was called by the inhabitants Chemmis, interpreted by them the city of Pan; and Plutarch (m) mentions a place called Chennis, inhabited by Pans and Satyrs. The same is mentioned by Herodotus (n), which he calls a large city of the Thebaic nome; a city of the same name is observed by Heliodorus (o); and both Herodotus (p) and Mela (q) speak of an island called Chemmis, which the Egyptians represent as floating. In all which there are plain traces of the name of Ham, the same with Jupiter Ammon; or Amun, as Plutarch; worshipped in Egypt; and from whom all Africa was sometimes called Ammonia (r), the country of Ammon or Ham. And Herodotus (s) speaks of a people called Ammonii, about ten days' journey from Thebes in Upper Egypt; who, according to him (t), had their name from Jupiter Ammon, or Ham. And Pliny (u) makes mention of the oracle of Hammon, as twelve days' journey from Memphis, and of the Hammoniac nome; and the Egyptian priests are called Ammmonean (w). Here Jacob was a sojourner, as all the Lord's people are in this world; they are sojourners, as all their fathers were; and their time here is a time of sojourning, <a href="/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>. They are not natives of the place where they are; they are indeed so by their first birth, but not by their new birth; being born from above, they belong to another place, are citizens of another city; their house, estate, and inheritance, are in heaven: neither their settlement nor satisfaction are here; they do not reckon themselves at home while they are in this world; they are indeed in an enemy's country, in a cursed land; or that is nigh unto cursing, and its end to be burned. Such the land of Ham was, where Jacob sojourned. <p>(k) De Iside. (l) Biblioth. l. 1. p. 16. (m) Ut supra. (De Iside.) (n) Euterpe sive, l. 2. c. 91. (o) Ethiopic. l. 5. c. 9. &amp; l. 6. c. 4.

That the selling of Joseph was, providentially regarded, a "sending before," he himself says in <a href="/genesis/45-5.htm">Genesis 45:5</a>. <a href="/psalms/102-24.htm">Psalm 102:24</a> throws light upon the meaning of &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;. The Ker&#1502; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493; is just as much without any occasion to justify it as &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; in <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a> (for &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;). The statement that iron came upon his soul is intended to say that he had to endure in iron fetters sufferings that threatened his life. Most expositors take &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; as equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;, but Hitzig rightly takes &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; as an object, following the Targum; for &#1489;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; as a name of an iron fetter <p>(Note: Also in ancient Arabic firzil (after the Aramaic &#1508;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;&#1488;) directly signifies an iron fetter (and the large smith's shears for cutting the iron), whence the verb. denom. Arab. farzala, c. acc. pers., to put any one into iron chains. Iron is called &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;, to pierce, like the Arabic h&#803;d&#305;&#770;d, as being the material of which pointed tools are made.)<p>can change its gender, as do, e.g., &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; as a name of the north wind, and &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; as a name of the soul. The imprisonment (so harsh at the commencement) lasted over ten years, until at last Joseph's word cam to pass, viz., the word concerning this exaltation which had been revealed to him in dreams (<a href="/genesis/42-9.htm">Genesis 42:9</a>). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>, &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; appears to be the word of Jahve, but then one would expect from <a href="/psalms/105-19.htm">Psalm 105:19</a> a more parallel turn of expression. What is meant is Joseph's open-hearted word concerning his visions, and &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492; is the revelation of God conveying His promises, which came to him in the same form, which had to try, to prove, and to purify him (&#1510;&#1512;&#1507; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>, and frequently), inasmuch as he was not to be raised to honour without having in a state of deep abasement proved a faithfulness that wavered not, and a confidence that knew no despair. The divine "word" is conceived of as a living effectual power, as in <a href="/psalms/119-50.htm">Psalm 119:50</a>. The representation of the exaltation begins, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>, with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;<p>(Note: Here &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; is united by Makkeph with the following word, to which it hurries on, whereas in <a href="/psalms/105-28.htm">Psalm 105:28</a> it has its own accent, a circumstance to which the Masora has directed attention in the apophthegm: &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497; &#1491;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1488; &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497; &#1491;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1499;&#1488; &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; (the emissaries of the king are in haste, those of darkness are tardy); vid., Baer, Thorath Emeth, p. 22.)<p>and follows <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39-41</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-44.htm">Genesis 41:44</a>, very closely as to the rest, according to which &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is a collateral definition to &#1500;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512; (with an orthophonic Dag.) in the sense of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;: by his soul, i.e., by virtue of his will (vid., Psychology, S. 202; tr. p. 239). In consequence of this exaltation of Joseph, Jacob-Israel came then into Egypt, and sojourned there as in a protecting house of shelter (concerning &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, vid., supra, p. 414). Egypt is called (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-23.htm">Psalm 105:23</a>, <a href="/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>) the land of Chaam, as in <a href="/psalms/78-51.htm">Psalm 78:51</a>; according to Plutarch, in the vernacular the black land, from the dark ashy grey colouring which the deposited mud of the Nile gives to the ground. There Israel became a powerful, numerous people (<a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>), greater than their oppressors. </body></html>
