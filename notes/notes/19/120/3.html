So, too, the word “add” has a similar sense (<a href="/1_kings/10-7.htm" title="However, I believed not the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: your wisdom and prosperity exceeds the fame which I heard.">1Kings 10:7</a>; see margin).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/120.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>120:1-4 The psalmist was brought into great distress by a deceitful tongue. May every good man be delivered from lying lips. They forged false charges against him. In this distress, he sought God by fervent prayer. God can bridle their tongues. He obtained a gracious answer to this prayer. Surely sinners durst not act as they do, if they knew, and would be persuaded to think, what will be in the end thereof. The terrors of the Lord are his arrows; and his wrath is compared to burning coals of juniper, which have a fierce heat, and keep fire very long.

Luther, "What can the false tongue do?" Others render this, "How will God punish thee?" Others, "What will he (God) give to thee?" That is, What recompence can you expect from God for these malignant calumnies? A literal translation of this verse would be, "What shall the tongue of deceit give to thee, and what shall it add to thee?" - referring to the offender himself. The essential idea is, What will be the result of such conduct? What must be expected to follow from it? That is, either<p>(a) from the unprofitableness of such a course; or<p>(b) from the natural consequences to one's reputation and happiness; or<p>(c) from the judgment of God.<p>The answer to these questions is found in <a href="/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a>.<p>Or what shall be done unto thee? - Margin, as in Hebrew, "added."

For although thou mayst thereby obtain some favour and advantage from Saul, yet thou wilt assuredly bring upon thyself the curse and vengeance of God; and then thou wilt be no gainer by the bargain.

What should he give thee, and what should he add to thee, thou deceitful tongue? Arrows of a warrior sharpened, with glowing coals of broom. The tongue, or rather its owner, is addressed. God is the subject of the verbs, and the form of expression is suggested by the familiar formula, “So God do to thee and more also” (<a href="/1_samuel/3-17.htm" title="And he said, What is the thing that the LORD has said to you? I pray you hide it not from me: God do so to you, and more also, if you hide any thing from me of all the things that he said to you.">1 Samuel 3:17</a>), lit. “So shall God do to thee and so shall he add.” <a href="/psalms/120-4.htm" title="Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.">Psalm 120:4</a> is the answer to the question. The just retribution which is to overtake the deceitful man is described in terms suggested by his offence (cp. <a href="/psalms/7-12.htm" title="If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he has bent his bow, and made it ready.">Psalm 7:12</a> ff.). He has shot his arrows of slander or false accusation at the innocent, but a mightier than he, even God Himself, will pierce him with the arrows of His judgement: he has kindled the fire of strife by his falsehoods, but the lightnings of Divine wrath will consume him. For the comparison of the evil tongue to a bow which shoots arrows of falsehood see <a href="/jeremiah/9-3.htm" title="And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth on the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 9:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/26-18.htm" title="As a mad man who casts firebrands, arrows, and death,">Proverbs 26:18</a> f.; cp. too <a href="/jeremiah/9-8.htm" title="Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaks deceit: one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in heart he lays his wait.">Jeremiah 9:8</a>, “Their tongue is a murderous arrow”: its power of mischief is described as fire in <a href="/proverbs/16-27.htm" title="An ungodly man digs up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.">Proverbs 16:27</a> (cp. <a href="/james/3-6.htm" title="And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.">James 3:6</a>). Glowing coals are a metaphor for Divine judgements in <a href="/psalms/140-10.htm" title="Let burning coals fall on them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.">Psalm 140:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is the simplest and most natural explanation. Several other explanations have however been proposed, e.g. (1) “What profit will thy false tongue bring thee, O slanderer? It is as sharp arrows” &c., but this seems to lack point. (2) Others suppose that God is addressed and that the tongue is the subject of the sentence: “What profit can the deceitful tongue bring to Thee?”—a sarcastic question, like that in <a href="/job/10-3.htm" title="Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and shine on the counsel of the wicked?">Job 10:3</a> ff. Can it be that Jehovah tolerates the deceitful man, because thereby He gains some advantage? <a href="/psalms/120-4.htm" title="Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.">Psalm 120:4</a> will then be an equally sarcastic answer.

May God answer this his supplication as He has heard his praise, and interest Himself on behalf of His servant, the sheep that is exposed to great danger. The petitions "give me understanding" and "deliver me" go hand-in-hand, because the poet is one who is persecuted for the sake of his faith, and is just as much in need of the fortifying of his faith as of deliverance from the outward restraint that is put upon him. &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is a shrill audible prayer; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, a fervent and urgent prayer. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, prop. to answer, signifies in <a href="/psalms/119-172.htm">Psalm 119:172</a> to begin, strike up, attune (as does &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; also sometimes). According to the rule in <a href="/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a> the poet bases his petition for help upon the purpose of thankful praise of God and of His word. Knowing how to value rightly what he possesses, he is warranted in further supplicating and hoping for the good that he does not as yet possess. The "salvation" for which he longs (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-40.htm">Psalm 119:40</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-20.htm">Psalm 119:20</a>) is redemption from the evil world, in which the life of his own soul is imperilled. May then God's judgments (defective plural, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-43.htm">Psalm 119:43</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-149.htm">Psalm 119:149</a>, which the Syriac only takes a singular) succour him (&#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;). God's hand, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-173.htm">Psalm 119:173</a>, and God's word afford him succour; the two are involved in one another, the word is the medium of His hand. After this relationship of the poet to God's word, which is attested a hundredfold in the Psalm, it may seem strange that he can say of himself &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;; and perhaps the accentuation is correct when it does not allow itself to be determined by <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, but interprets: If I have gone astray - seek Thou like a lost sheep Thy servant. &#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1489;&#1491; is a sheep that is lost (cf. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as an appellation of the dispersion, <a href="/isaiah/27-13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>) and in imminent danger of total destruction (cf. <a href="/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a> with <a href="/leviticus/26-38.htm">Leviticus 26:38</a>). In connection with that interpretation which is followed by the interpunction, <a href="/psalms/119-176.htm">Psalm 119:176</a> is also more easily connected with what precedes: his going astray is no apostasy; his home, to which he longs to return when he has been betrayed into by-ways, is beside the Lord. </body></html>
