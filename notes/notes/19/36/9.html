This is great comfort to all believers, plainly to be seen, and not to be taken away. God does all wisely and well; but what he does we know not now, it is time enough to know hereafter. God's loving-kindness is precious to the saints. They put themselves under his protection, and then are safe and easy. Gracious souls, though still desiring more of God, never desire more than God. The gifts of Providence so far satisfy them, that they are content with such things as they have. The benefit of holy ordinances is sweet to a sanctified soul, and strengthening to the spiritual and Divine life. But full satisfaction is reserved for the future state. Their joys shall be constant. God not only works in them a gracious desire for these pleasures, but by his Spirit fills their souls with joy and peace in believing. He quickens whom he will; and whoever will, may come, and take from him of the waters of life freely. May we know, and love, and uprightly serve the Lord; then no proud enemy, on earth or from hell, shall separate us from his love. Faith calleth things that are not, as though they were. It carries us forward to the end of time; it shows us the Lord, on his throne of judgment; the empire of sin fallen to rise no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For with thee is the fountain of life - The fountain or source from which all life flows. All living beings derive their origin from thee, as streams flow from fountains; all that is properly "called" life proceeds from thee; everything which makes life real life - which makes it desirable or happy - has its origin in thee. The psalmist evidently meant here to include more than mere "life" considered as animated existence. He recalls what he had referred to in the previous verses - the various blessings which proceeded from the mercy and loving-kindness of God, and which were attendant on his worship; and he here says that all this - all that makes man happy - all that can properly be regarded as "life" - proceeds from God. Life literally, in man and in all animated beings; life spiritually; life here, and life hereafter - all is to be traced to God.<p>In thy light shall we see light - As thou art the Source of light, and all light proceeds from thee, so we shall be enabled to see light, or to see what is true, only as we see it in thee. By looking to thee; by meditating on thy character; by a right understanding of thyself; by being encompassed with the light which encompasses thee, we shall see light on all those great questions which perplex us, and which it is so desirable that we should understand. It is not by looking at ourselves; it is not by any human teaching; it is not by searching for information "away from thee," that we can hope to have the questions which perplex us solved; it is only by coming to thyself, and looking directly to thee. There is no other source of real light and truth but God; and in the contemplation of himself, and of the light which encompasses him, and in that alone, can we hope to comprehend the great subjects on which we pant so much to be informed. All away from God is dark; all near him is light. If, therefore, we desire light on the subjects which pertain to our salvation, it must be sought by a direct and near approach to him; and the more we can lose ourselves in the splendors of his throne, the more we shall understand of truth.

"In <span class="accented">his</span> light we see light." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 36:1-4) At the outset the poet discovers to us the wickedness of the children of the world, which has its roots in alienation from God. Supposing it were admissible to render <a href="/psalms/36-2.htm">Psalm 36:2</a> : "A divine word concerning the evil-doing of the ungodly is in the inward parts of my heart" (&#1504;&#1488;&#1501; with a genitive of the object, like &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, which is compared by Hofmann), then the difficulty of this word, so much complained of, might find the desired relief in some much more easy way than by means of the conjecture proposed by Diestel, &#1504;&#1506;&#1501; (&#1504;&#1506;&#1501;), "Pleasant is transgression to the evil-doer," etc. But the genitive after &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; (which in <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a>., 15f., <a href="/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>, just as here, stands at the head of the clause) always denotes the speaker, not the thing spoken. Even in <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a> &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;&#1514; &#1491;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; &#1500;&#1499;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493; is not a song concerning my beloved in relation to His vineyard, but a song of my beloved (such a song as my beloved has to sing) touching His vineyard. Thus, therefore, &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; must denote the speaker, and &#1500;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, as in <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a> &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, the person or thing addressed; transgression is personified, and an oracular utterance is attributed to it. But the predicate &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, which is intelligible enough in connection with the first rendering of &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; as genit. obj., is difficulty and harsh with the latter rendering of &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; as gen. subj., whatever way it may be understood: whether, that it is intended to say that the utterance of transgression to the evil-doer is inwardly known to him (the poet), or it occupies and affects him in his inmost parts. It is very natural to read &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, as the lxx, Syriac, and Arabic versions, and Jerome do. In accordance therewith, while with Von Lengerke he takes &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; as part of the inscription, Thenius renders it: "Sin is to the ungodly in the midst of his heart," i.e., it is the inmost motive or impulse of all that he thinks and does. But this isolation of &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; is altogether at variance with the usage of the language and custom. The rendering given by Hupfeld, Hitzig, and at last also by B&#1510;ttcher, is better: "The suggestion of sin dwells in the ungodly in the inward part of his heart;" or rather, since the idea of &#1489;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; is not central, but circumferential, in the realm of (within) his heart, altogether filling up and absorbing it. And in connection with this explanation, it must be observed that this combination &#1489;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#1500;&#1489;&#1493; (instead of &#1489;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;, or &#1489;&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;, &#1489;&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493;) occurs only here, where, together with a personification of sin, an incident belonging to the province of the soul's life, which is the outgrowth of sin, is intended to be described. It is true this application of &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; does not admit of being further substantiated; but &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; (cognate &#1504;&#1492;&#1501;, &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;), as an onomatopoetic designation of a dull, hollow sound, is a suitable word for secret communication (cf. Arabic nemma&#770;m, a tale-bearer), or even - since the genius of the language does not combine with it the idea of that which is significantly secretly, and solemnly silently communicated, but spoken out - a suitable word for that which transgression says to the ungodly with all the solemn mien of the prophet or the philosopher, inasmuch as it has set itself within his heart in the place of God and of the voice of his conscience. &#1500;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; does not, however, denote the person addressed, but, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10</a>, the possessor. He possesses this inspiration of iniquity as the contents of his heart, so that the fear of God has no place therein, and to him God has no existence (objectivity), that He should command his adoration.<p>Since after this &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; we expect to hear further what and how transgression speaks to him, so before all else the most probable thing is, that transgression is the subject to &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1511;. We do not interpret: He flatters God in His eyes (with eye-service), for this rendering is contrary both to what precedes and to what follows; nor with Hupfeld (who follows Hofmann): "God deals smoothly (gently) with him according to his delusions," for the assumption that &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1511; must, on account of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, have some other subject that the evil-doer himself, is indeed correct. It does not, however, necessarily point to God as the subject, but, after the solemn opening of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/36-2.htm">Psalm 36:2</a>, to transgression, which is personified. This addresses flattering words to him (&#1488;&#1500; like &#1506;&#1500; in <a href="/proverbs/29-5.htm">Proverbs 29:5</a>) in his eyes, i.e., such as are pleasing to him; and to what end? For the finding out, i.e., establishing (&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503;, as in <a href="/genesis/44-16.htm">Genesis 44:16</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-9.htm">Hosea 12:9</a>), or, - since this is not exactly suited to &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; as the subject, and where it is a purpose that is spoken of, the meaning assequi, originally proper to the verb &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, is still more natural - to the attainment of his culpability, i.e., in order that he may inculpate himself, to hating, i.e., that he may hate God and man instead of loving them. &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488; is designedly used without an object just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:8</a>, in order to imply that the flattering words of &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; incite him to turn into an object of hatred everything that he ought to love, and to live and move in hatred as in his own proper element. Thenius endeavours to get rid of the harshness of the expression by the following easy alteration of the text: &#1500;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1493;&#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;; and interprets it: Yea, it flatters him in his own eyes (it tickles his pride) to discover faults in others and to make them suffer for them. But there is no support in the general usage of the language for the impersonal rendering of the &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1511;; and the &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, which in this case is not only pleonastic, but out of place, demands a distinction between the flatterer and the person who feels himself flattered. The expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/36-3.htm">Psalm 36:3</a>, in whatever way it may be explained, is harsh; but David's language, whenever he describes the corruption of sin with deep-seated indignation, is wont to envelope itself in such clouds, which, to our difficult comprehension, look like corruptions of the text. In the second strophe the whole language is more easy. &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489; is just such another asyndeton as &#1500;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;. A man who has thus fallen a prey to the dominion of sin, and is alienated from God, has ceased (&#1495;&#1491;&#1500; &#1500;, as in <a href="/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13</a>) to act wisely and well (things which essentially accompany one another). His words when awake, and even his thoughts in the night-time, run upon &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; (<a href="/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>), evil, wickedness, the absolute opposite of that which alone is truly good. Most diligently does he take up his position in the way which leads in the opposite direction to that which is good (<a href="/proverbs/16-29.htm">Proverbs 16:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>); and his conscience is deadened against evil: there is not a trace of aversion to it to be found in him, he loves it with all his soul. </body></html>
