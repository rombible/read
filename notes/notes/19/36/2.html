A sentence of great difficulty. We must seek for the key to the interpretation of these words in the balance of the two phrases, “before his eyes,” “in his own eyes,” and must take the two verses together. They form, in fact, an example of introverted parallelism. (See Gen. Introduction.)<p>Sin is the wicked man’s oracle in his heart;<p>No fear of God is before his eyes;<p>He makes all smooth to himself in his eyes.<p>As to the discovery of his guilt that is his hate;<p>Or,<p>The discovery of his guilt is the only thing he hates.<p>This reading takes the two infinitives as subject and complement with the copula understood.

Here is the root of bitterness, from which all the wickedness of wicked men comes. It takes rise from contempt of God, and the want of due regard to him. Also from the deceit they put upon their own souls. Let us daily beg of God to preserve us from self-flattery. Sin is very hurtful to the sinner himself, and therefore ought to be hateful; but it is not so. It is no marvel, if those that deceive themselves, seek to deceive all mankind; to whom will they be true, who are false to their own souls? It is bad to do mischief, but worse to devise it, to do it with plot and management. If we willingly banish holy meditations in our solitary hours, Satan will soon occupy our minds with sinful imaginations. Hardened sinners stand to what they have done, as though they could justify it before God himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he flattereth himself in his own eyes - He puts such an exalted estimate on himself; he so overrates himself and his own ability in judging of what is right and proper, that he is allowed to pursue a course which ultimately makes his conduct odious to all people: the result is so apparent, and so abominable, that no one can doubt what he himself is. The foundation or the basis of all this is an overweening confidence "in himself" - in his own importance; in his own judgment; in his own ability to direct his course regardless of God. The result is such a development of character, that it cannot but be regarded as hateful or odious. There is, indeed, considerable obscurity in the original. A literal translation would be, "For he has made smooth to him in his eyes to find his iniquity to hate." The ancient interpretations throw no light on the passage. The word rendered "flattereth" - &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;  cha&#770;laq - means to be smooth; then, to be smooth in the sense of being bland or flattering: <a href="/hosea/10-2.htm">Hosea 10:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/5-9.htm">Psalm 5:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-23.htm">Proverbs 28:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-5.htm">Proverbs 7:5</a>. Here the meaning is, that he commends himself to himself; he overestimates himself; he ascribes to himself qualities which he does not possess - either:<p>(a) by supposing that what he does must be right and proper, or<p>(b) by overestimating his strength of virtue, and his power to resist temptation.<p>He does this until God suffers him so to act out his own nature, and to show what he is, that his course of life is seen by himself and by others to be odious.<p>In his own eyes - As if his eyes were looking upon himself, or his own conduct. We act so as to be seen by others; thus he is represented as acting as if he himself were looking on, and sought to commend himself to himself.<p>Until his iniquity be found to be hateful - Margin, as in Hebrew: "to find his iniquity to hate." Prof. Alexander renders this, "As to (God's) finding his iniquity (and) hating (it);" that is (as he supposes the meaning to be), that he flatters himself that God will not find out his iniquity and hate it, or punish it. DeWette renders it, "that he does not find and hate his guilt;" that is, he so flatters himself in what he does, that he does not see the guilt of what he is doing, and hate it. He is blind to the real nature of what he is doing. But it seems to me that the true construction is that which is given by our translators. The real difficulty rests on the interpretation of the preposition in the word &#1500;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;  limetsa&#770;' - "until he find." If the interpretation proposed by DeWette were the true one, the preposition should have been the Hebrew letter &#1502;  (m) instead of the Hebrew letter &#1500;  (l) - &#1502;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;  mimetsa&#770;' instead of &#1500;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;  limetsa&#770;'). The preposition used here often has the sense of "even unto, until." Compare <a href="/ezekiel/39-19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>; and this idea seems best to comport with the connection. The idea, according to this, is that he overestimates himself; he prides himself on his own strength and goodness, he confides in his own wisdom and power, he pursues his course of conduct trusting in himself, until he is suffered to act out what is really in his heart - and his conduct becomes hateful and abominable - until he can no longer conceal what he really is. God suffers him to act out what he had endeavored to cover over by his own flattery. Men who pride themselves on their own cunning and strength - men who attempt to conceal their plans from the world - are often thus suffered to develop their character so that the mask is taken off, and the world is allowed to see how vile they are at heart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-4. This reflection detailed.<p>until his iniquity&#8212;literally, "for finding his iniquity for hating"; that is, he persuades himself God will not so find it&#8212;"for hating" involving the idea of punishing. Hence his words of iniquity and deceit, and his bold rejection of all right principles of conduct. The climax is that he deliberately adopts and patronizes evil. The negative forms affirm more emphatically their contraries.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For; </span> so this is the proof of that assertion, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/36-1.htm" title="The transgression of the wicked said within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.">Psalm 36:1</a></span>.

Otherwise thus, <span class="ital">he flattereth him</span> (i.e. God) <span class="ital">in his eyes</span>, i.e. openly and publicly makes a show of religion, as if he designed to deceive or mock God, whilst inwardly and secretly he is projecting wickedness.

A much disputed verse. Three renderings of the first line deserve consideration. (1) Taking the wicked man as the subject, we may render as the A.V. (2) Taking Transgression as the subject, we may render, For It flattereth him in his eyes. (3) Taking God as the subject, we may render, For He flattereth him in his eyes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The third rendering, whether it is explained to mean, ‘God treats him gently, so he imagines,’ (Cheyne) or, ‘God’s threatenings seem to him mere idle words,’ can hardly be supported by the usage of the word.
