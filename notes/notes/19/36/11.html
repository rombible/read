This is great comfort to all believers, plainly to be seen, and not to be taken away. God does all wisely and well; but what he does we know not now, it is time enough to know hereafter. God's loving-kindness is precious to the saints. They put themselves under his protection, and then are safe and easy. Gracious souls, though still desiring more of God, never desire more than God. The gifts of Providence so far satisfy them, that they are content with such things as they have. The benefit of holy ordinances is sweet to a sanctified soul, and strengthening to the spiritual and Divine life. But full satisfaction is reserved for the future state. Their joys shall be constant. God not only works in them a gracious desire for these pleasures, but by his Spirit fills their souls with joy and peace in believing. He quickens whom he will; and whoever will, may come, and take from him of the waters of life freely. May we know, and love, and uprightly serve the Lord; then no proud enemy, on earth or from hell, shall separate us from his love. Faith calleth things that are not, as though they were. It carries us forward to the end of time; it shows us the Lord, on his throne of judgment; the empire of sin fallen to rise no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let not the foot of pride come against me - The foot of the proud man.

He contemplates, and praises, the infinite, ever sure mercy of God, and the salvation, happiness, and light which spring from it. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, the expression is &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, the syncope of the article not taking place. &#1489;&#1468; alternating with &#1506;&#1491;, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-11.htm">Psalm 57:11</a>, has here, as in <a href="/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>, the sense of touching or reaching to the spot that is denoted in connection with it. The poet describes the exaltation and super-eminence of divine mercy and faithfulness figuratively, after earthly standards. They reveal themselves on earth in a height that reaches to the heavens and extends to &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., the thin veil of vapour which spreads itself like a veil over the depths of the heavens; they transcend all human thought, desire, and comprehension (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103-11.htm">Psalm 103:11</a>, and cf. <a href="/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>). The &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; (righteousness) is distinguished from the &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; (faithfulness) thus: the latter is governed by the promises of God, the former by His holiness; and further, the latter has its being in the love of God, the former, on the other hand, manifests itself partly as justifying in mercies, and partly as avenging in wrath. Concerning the righteousness, the poet says that it is like the mountains of God, i.e., (cf. cedars of God, <a href="/psalms/80-11.htm">Psalm 80:11</a>) unchangeably firm (<a href="/psalms/111-3.htm">Psalm 111:3</a>), like the giant primeval mountains which bear witness to the greatness and glory of God; concerning God's judgments, that they are "a great deep," incomprehensible and unsearchable (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>) as the great, deep-surging mass of waters in the lower parts of the earth, which becomes visible in the seas and in the rivers. God's punitive righteousness, as at length becomes evident, has His compassion for its reverse side; and this, as in the case of the Flood (cf. <a href="/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>), embraces the animal world, which is most closely involved, whether for weal or for woe, with man, as well as mankind.<p>Lost in this depth, which is so worthy of adoration, the Psalmist exclaims: How precious (cf. <a href="/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17</a>) is Thy mercy, Elohim! i.e., how valuable beyond all treasures, and how precious to him who knows how to prize it! The Waw of &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is the explicative Waw  equals  et hoc ipsum quod. The energetic form of the future, &#1497;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, has the pre-tonic Kametz, here in pause, as in <a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-44.htm">Psalm 78:44</a>. The shadow of God's wings is the protection of His love, which hides against temptation and persecution. To be thus hidden in God is the most unspeakable blessedness, <a href="/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a> : they satiate themselves, they drink full draughts of "the fatness of Thy house." The house of God is His sanctuary, and in general the domain of His mercy and grace. &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; (cf. &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, <a href="/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a>) is the expression for the abundant, pleasant, and powerful gifts and goods and recreations with which God entertains those who are His; and &#1512;&#1493;&#1492; (whence &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1503;, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-13.htm">Deuteronomy 8:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>) is the spiritual joy of the soul that experiences God's mercy to overflowing. The abundant fare of the priests from Jahve's table (vid., <a href="/jeremiah/31-14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a>), and the festive joy of the guests at the shelamim-offering, i.e., the communion-offering, - these outward rites are here treated according to their spiritual significance, receive the depth of meaning which radically belongs to them, and are ideally generalized. It is a stream of pleasures (&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;) with which He irrigates and fertilizes them, a paradisaic river of delights. This, as the four arms of the river of Paradise had one common source (<a href="/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>), has its spring in God, yea, God is the fountain itself. He is "the fountain of life" (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>); all life flows forth from Him, who is the absolutely existing and happy One. The more inwardly, therefore, one is joined to Him, the fuller are the draughts of life which he drinks from this first fountain of all life. And as God is the fountain of life, so also is He the fountain of light: "In Thy light do we see light;" out of God, seeing we see only darkness, whereas immersed in God's sea of light we are illumined by divine knowledge, and lighted up with spiritual joy. The poet, after having taken a few glimpses into the chaos of evil, here moves in the blessed depths of holy mysticism [Mystik, i.e., mysticism in the good sense - true religion, vital godliness], and in proportion as in the former case his language is obscure. So here it is clear as crystal. </body></html>
