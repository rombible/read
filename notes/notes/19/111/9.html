Our exhortations and our examples should agree together. He recommends the works of the Lord, as the proper subject, when we are praising him; and the dealings of his providence toward the world, the church, and particular persons. All the works of the Lord are spoken of as one, it is his work; so admirably do all the dispensations of his providence centre in one design. The works of God, humbly and diligently sought into, shall all be found just and holy. God's pardoning sin is the most wonderful of all his works, and ought to be remembered to his glory. He will ever be mindful of his covenant; he has ever been so, and he ever will be so. His works of providence were done according to the truth of the Divine promises and prophecies, and so were verity, or truth; and by him who has a right to dispose of the earth as he pleases, and so are judgment, or righteous: and this holds good of the work of grace upon the heart of man, ver. 7,8. All God's commandments are sure; all have been fulfilled by Christ, and remain with him for a rule of walk and conversation to us. He sent redemption unto his people, out of Egypt at first, and often afterwards; and these were typical of the great redemption, which in the fulness of time was to be wrought out by the Lord Jesus. Here his everlasting righteousness shines forth in union with his boundless mercy. No man is wise who does not fear the Lord; no man acts wisely except as influenced by that fear. This fear will lead to repentance, to faith in Christ, to watchfulness and obedience. Such persons are of a good understanding, however poor, unlearned, or despised.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/111.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He sent redemption unto his people - In their deliverance from Egypt.

We are led to the right meaning by &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1493; in <a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a> in comparison with <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, where &#1495;&#1508;&#1509; signifies God's purpose in accordance with His counsel: constantly searched into, and therefore a worthy object of research (&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, root &#1491;&#1512;, to seek to know by rubbing, and in general experimentally, cf. Arab. dra&#770; of knowledge empirically acquired) according to all their aims, i.e., in all phases of that which they have in view. In <a href="/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4</a> &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; points to the festival which propagates the remembrance of the deeds of God in the Mosaic age; &#1496;&#1512;&#1507;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a>, therefore points to the food provided for the Exodus, and to the Passover meal, together with the feast of unleavened bread, this memorial (&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>) of the exemption in faithfulness to the covenant which was experienced in Egypt. This Psalm, says Luther, looks to me as though it had been composed for the festival of Easter. Even from the time of Theodoret and Augustine the thought of the Eucharist has been connected with <a href="/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a> in the New Testament mind; and it is not without good reason that <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1-10</a> has become the Psalm of the church at the celebration of the Lord's Supper. In connection with &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; one is reminded of the Pesach-Haggada. The deed of redemption which it relates has a power that continues in operation; for to the church of Jahve is assigned the victory not only over the peoples of Canaan, but over the whole world. The power of Jahve's deeds, which He has made known to His people, and which they tell over again among themselves, aims at giving them the inheritance of the peoples. The works of His hands are truth and right, for they are the realization of that which is true and which lasts and verifies itself, and of that which is right, that triumphantly maintains its ground. His ordinances are &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (occasionally pointed &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;), established, attested, in themselves and in their results authorizing a firm confidence in their salutariness (cf. <a href="/psalms/19-8.htm">Psalm 19:8</a>). &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, supported, stayed, viz., not outwardly, but in themselves, therefore imperturbable (cf. &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; used of the state of mind, <a href="/psalms/112-8.htm">Psalm 112:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>). &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, moulded, arranged, viz., on the part of God, "in truth, and upright;" &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; is accusative of the predicate (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-37.htm">Psalm 119:37</a>), but without its being clear why it is not pointed &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. If we have understood <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4-6</a> correctly, then &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; glances back at the deliverance out of Egypt. Upon this followed the ratification of the covenant on Sinai, which still remains inviolable down to the present time of the poet, and has the holiness and terribleness of the divine Name for a guarantee of its inviolability. The fear of Jahve, this holy and terrible God, is the beginning of wisdom - the motto of the Chokma in Job (<a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>) and Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), the Books of the Chokma. <a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a> goes on in this Proverbs-like strain: the fear of God, which manifests itself in obedience, is to those who practise them (the divine precepts, &#1508;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;) &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; (<a href="/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-4.htm">Proverbs 3:4</a>, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>), a fine sagacity, praiseworthy discernment - such a (dutiful) one partakes of everlasting praise. It is true, in glancing back to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-3.htm">Psalm 111:3</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; seems to refer to God, but a glance forward to <a href="/psalms/112-3.htm">Psalm 112:3</a> shows that the praise of him who fears God is meant. The old observation therefore holds good: ubi haec ode desinit, sequens incipit (Bakius). </body></html>
