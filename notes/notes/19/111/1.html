Our exhortations and our examples should agree together. He recommends the works of the Lord, as the proper subject, when we are praising him; and the dealings of his providence toward the world, the church, and particular persons. All the works of the Lord are spoken of as one, it is his work; so admirably do all the dispensations of his providence centre in one design. The works of God, humbly and diligently sought into, shall all be found just and holy. God's pardoning sin is the most wonderful of all his works, and ought to be remembered to his glory. He will ever be mindful of his covenant; he has ever been so, and he ever will be so. His works of providence were done according to the truth of the Divine promises and prophecies, and so were verity, or truth; and by him who has a right to dispose of the earth as he pleases, and so are judgment, or righteous: and this holds good of the work of grace upon the heart of man, ver. 7,8. All God's commandments are sure; all have been fulfilled by Christ, and remain with him for a rule of walk and conversation to us. He sent redemption unto his people, out of Egypt at first, and often afterwards; and these were typical of the great redemption, which in the fulness of time was to be wrought out by the Lord Jesus. Here his everlasting righteousness shines forth in union with his boundless mercy. No man is wise who does not fear the Lord; no man acts wisely except as influenced by that fear. This fear will lead to repentance, to faith in Christ, to watchfulness and obedience. Such persons are of a good understanding, however poor, unlearned, or despised.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/111.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Praise ye the Lord - Margin, "Hallelujah."

I will praise the Lord with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.<p>"Praise ye the Lord," or, Hallelujah! All ye his saints unite in adoring Jehovah, who worketh so gloriously. Do it now, do it always: do it heartily, do it unanimously, do it eternally. Even if others refuse, take care that ye have always a song for your God. Put away all doubt, question, murmuring, and rebellion, and give yourselves up to the praising of Jehovah, both with your lips and in your lives. "I will praise the Lord with my whole heart." The sweet singer commences the song, for his heart is all on flame: whether others will follow him or not, he will at once begin and long continue. What we preach we should practise. The best way to enforce an exhortation is to set an example; but we must let that example be of the best kind, or we may lead others to do the work in a limping manner. David brought nothing less than his whole heart to the duty; all his love went out towards God, and all his zeal, his skill, and his ardour went with it. Jehovah the one and undivided God cannot be acceptably praised with a divided heart, neither should we attempt so to dishonour him; for our whole heart is little enough for his glory, and there can be no reason why it should not all be lifted up in his praise. All his works are praiseworthy, and therefore all our nature should adore him. "In the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation"; - whether with few or with many he would pour forth his whole heart and soul in praise, and whether the company was made up of select spirits or of the general mass of the people he would continue in the same exercise. For the choicest society there can be no better engagement than praise, and for the general assembly nothing can be more fitting. For the church and for the congregation, for the family or the community, for the private chamber of pious friendship, or the great hall of popular meeting, the praise of the Lord is suitable; and at the very least the true heart should sing hallelujah in any and every place. Why should we fear the presence of men? The best of men will join us in our song, and if the common sort, will not do so, our example will be a needed rebuke to them. In any case let us praise God, whether the hearers be a little band of saints or a mixed multitude. Come, dear reader, he who pens this comment is in his heart magnifying the Lord: will you not pause for a moment and join in the delightful exercise? <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The excellency of this Psalm appears, as from other things, so from the psalmist’s care to digest the several parcels of it into an exact order, according to the order of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, that it might be better fixed in the memories of those who read it.

Or "hallelujah"; this is the title of the psalm, and is expressive of the subject matter of it; and so it stands in the Targum, Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Ethiopic, and Arabic versions; as it should, as appears from the psalm being alphabetical; for the first letter of this word is the fifth and not the first of the alphabet; it is wanting in the Syriac version, which gives the title in this manner, without a name, concerning the glorious virtues of <p>"the works of God; but it exhorts us to give thanks to Christ; and it is said in the person of the apostles.'' <p>I will praise the Lord with my whole heart; the psalmist excites to praise God by his own example; the object of his praise is Jehovah, the self-existent Being, the Being of beings, the author of his Being, and in whom all men live and move, and have their being; the God of their mercies, temporal and spiritual, and therefore should praise him, even Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit; especially Jehovah the Messiah may be here intended, whose work of redemption is particularly attended to: the manner in which he determines to perform this service is, "with his whole heart": which ought to be engaged in every religious exercise, even the whole of it, all the powers and faculties of the soul, without being divided between other objects, and distracted or drawn off from the Lord by them; the phrase is not expressive of perfection, which is not to be expected in any duty, but of sincerity and cordial affection.

It may be rendered, as it is by the Targum, <p>"in the secret (e) of the upright, and the congregation;'' <p>because here the secret of the Lord is made known to his people; the mysteries of his grace are revealed; and his ordinances, which are his counsel, are administered: or it may design some particular friends and acquaintance of the psalmist's, who privately met and took sweet counsel together, and communicated their secrets to one another, as the other word "congregation" may intend the public assembly of the people; and then the sense is, that he would sincerely praise the Lord both in private and public, and that because of his works; as follows. <p>(e) "in secreto", Pagninus, Montanus, Piscator; so Ainsworth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/111.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{a}</span> Praise ye the LORD.

Here &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a> does not favour this, and &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; is decidedly against it. The former does not favour it, for it is indeed correct that the subject calls his king "my lord," e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-12.htm">1 Samuel 22:12</a>, although the more exact form of address is "my lord the king," e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/24-9.htm">1 Samuel 24:9</a>; but if the people are speaking here, what is the object of the title of honour being expressed as if coming from the mouth of an individual, and why not rather, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/20.htm">Psalm 20-21</a>, &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; or &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;? &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; is, however, decisive against the supposition that it is an Israelite who here expresses himself concerning the relation of his king to Jahve. For it is absurd to suppose that an Israelite speaking in the name of the people would begin in the manner of the prophets with &#1504;&#1488;&#1501;, more particularly since this &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1492; placed thus at the head of the discourse is without any perfectly analogous example (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a> are only similar) elsewhere, and is therefore extremely important. In general this opening position of &#1504;&#1488;&#1501;, even in cases where other genitives that &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; follow, is very rare; &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; <a href="/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15</a>, of David in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a>, of Agur in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>, and always (even in <a href="/psalms/36-2.htm">Psalm 36:2</a>) in an oracular signification. Moreover, if one from among the people were speaking, the declaration ought to be a retrospective glance at a past utterance of God. But, first, the history knows nothing of any such divine utterance; and secondly, &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1492; always introduces God as actually speaking, to which even the passage cited by Hofmann to the contrary, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28</a>, forms no exception. Thus it will consequently not be a past utterance of God to which the poet glances back here, but one which David has just now heard &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; (<a href="/matthew/22-43.htm">Matthew 22:43</a>), and is therefore not a declaration of the people concerning David, but of David concerning Christ. The unique character of the declaration confirms this. Of the king of Israel it is said that he sits on the throne of Jahve (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>), viz., as visible representative of the invisible King (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>); Jahve, however, commands the person here addressed to take his place at His right hand. The right hand of a king is the highest place of honour, <a href="/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>.<p>(Note: Cf. the custom of the old Arabian kings to have their viceroy (ridf) sitting at their right hand, Monumenta antiquiss. hist. Arabum, ed. Eichhorn, p. 220.)<p>Here the sitting at the right hand signifies not merely an idle honour, but reception into the fellowship of God as regards dignity and dominion, exaltation to a participation in God's reigning (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>). Just as Jahve sits enthroned in the heavens and laughs at the rebels here below, so shall he who is exalted henceforth share this blessed calm with Him, until He subdues all enemies to him, and therefore makes him the unlimited, universally acknowledged ruler. &#1506;&#1491; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>, for &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; or &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, does not exclude the time that lies beyond, but as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/112-8.htm">Psalm 112:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, includes it, and in fact so that it at any rate marks the final subjugation of the enemies as a turning-point with which something else comes about (vid., <a href="/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-28.htm">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>). &#1492;&#1491;&#1501; is an accusative of the predicate. The enemies shall come to lie under his feet (<a href="/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>), his feet tread upon the necks of the vanquished (<a href="/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>), so that the resistance that is overcome becomes as it were the dark ground upon which the glory of his victorious rule arises. For the history of time ends with the triumph of good over evil, - not, however, with the annihilation of evil, but with its subjugation. This is the issue, inasmuch as absolute omnipotence is effectual on behalf of and through the exalted Christ. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/110-2.htm">Psalm 110:2</a>, springing from the utterance of Jahve, follow words expressing a prophetic prospect. Zion is the imperial abode of the great future King (<a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>). &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1498; (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-11.htm">Ezekiel 19:11-14</a>) signifies "the sceptre (as insignia and the medium of exercise) of the authority delegated to thee" (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>, <a href="/micah/5-3.htm">Micah 5:3</a>). Jahve will stretch this sceptre far forth from Zion: no goal is mentioned up to which it shall extend, but passages like <a href="/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a> show how the prophets understand such Psalms. In <a href="/psalms/110-2.htm">Psalm 110:2</a> follow the words with which Jahve accompanies this extension of the dominion of the exalted One. Jahve will lay all his enemies at his feet, but not in such a manner that he himself remains idle in the matter. Thus, then, having come into the midst of the sphere (&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;) of his enemies, shall he reign, forcing them to submission and holding them down. We read this &#1512;&#1491;&#1492; in a Messianic connection in <a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>. So even in the prophecy of Balaam (<a href="/numbers/24-19.htm">Numbers 24:19</a>), where the sceptre (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>) is an emblem of the Messiah Himself. </body></html>
