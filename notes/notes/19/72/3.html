There were righteousness and peace at first in the administration of his government; but, before the end of his reign, there were troubles and unrighteousness. The kingdom here spoken of is to last as long as the sun, but Solomon's was soon at an end. Even the Jewish expositors understood it of the kingdom of the Messiah. Observe many great and precious promises here made, which were to have full accomplishment only in the kingdom of Christ. As far as his kingdom is set up, discord and contentions cease, in families, churches, and nations. The law of Christ, written in the heart, disposes men to be honest and just, and to render to all their due; it likewise disposes men to live in love, and so produces abundance of peace. Holiness and love shall be lasting in Christ's kingdom. Through all the changes of the world, and all the changes of life, Christ's kingdom will support itself. And he shall, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, come down like rain upon the mown grass; not on that cut down, but that which is left growing, that it may spring again. His gospel has been, or shall be, preached to all nations. Though he needs not the services of any, yet he must be served with the best. Those that have the wealth of this world, must serve Christ with it, do good with it. Prayer shall be made through him, or for his sake; whatever we ask of the Father, should be in his name. Praises shall be offered to him: we are under the highest obligations to him. Christ only shall be feared throughout all generations. To the end of time, and to eternity, his name shall be praised. All nations shall call HIM blessed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/72.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The mountains shall bring peace to the people - The idea in this verse is that the land would be full of peace and the fruits of peace. All parts of it would be covered with the evidences that it was a land of quietness and security, where people could pursue their callings in safety, and enjoy the fruit of their labors. On the mountains and on all the little hills in the land there would be abundant harvests, the result of peace (so strongly in contrast with the desolations of war) - all showing the advantages of a peaceful reign. It is to be remembered that Judea is a country abounding in hills and mountains, and that a great part of its former fertility resulted from terracing the hills, and cultivating them as far as possible toward the summit. The idea here is, that one who should look upon the land - who could take in at a glance the whole country - would see those mountains and hills cultivated in the most careful manner, and everywhere bringing forth the productions of peace. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11-13</a>. See also the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/85-11.htm">Psalm 85:11-12</a>.<p>And the little hills, by righteousness - That is, By the prevalence of righteousness, or under a reign of righteousness, the little hills would furnish illustrations of the influence of a reign of peace. Everywhere there would be the effects of a reign of peace. The whole land would be cultivated, and there would be abundance.

The people of God, as before.

Logically this verse forms but one sentence, and the exact reproduction of the Heb. division into two clauses for the sake of rhythm has an awkward effect. The sense is, By righteousness shall the mountains and the hills bear peace for the people. The mountains and the hills, which are the characteristic features of Palestine, represent poetically the whole land, which, under a just government, will bear the fruit of peace and general welfare for its inhabitants. Similarly Isaiah describes peace as the result of righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm" title="And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.">Isaiah 32:17</a>); and peace was the distinguishing characteristic of Solomon’s reign (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm" title="Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>), as well as of its antitype the Messianic age (<a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm" title="And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace....">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-10.htm" title="And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace to the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.">Zechariah 9:10</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/72.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.</span> Through the general establishment prominent features. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/71.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The thought of this proclamation so thoroughly absorbs the poet that he even now enters upon the tone of it; and since to his faith the deliverance is already a thing of the past, the tender song with its uncomplaining prayer dies away into a loud song of praise, in which he pictures it all to himself. Without <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-19.htm">Psalm 71:19-21</a> being subordinate to &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-18.htm">Psalm 71:18</a>, &#1493;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1514;&#1498; is coupled by close connection with &#1489;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498;. <a href="/psalms/71-19.htm">Psalm 71:19</a> is an independent clause; and &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; takes the place of the predicate: the righteousness of God exceeds all bounds, is infinite (<a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>., <a href="/psalms/57-11.htm">Psalm 57:11</a>). The cry &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; &#1502;&#1497;, as in <a href="/psalms/35-10.htm">Psalm 35:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-6.htm">Jeremiah 10:6</a>, refers back to <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>. According to the Chethb, the range of the poet's vision widens in <a href="/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a> from the proofs of the strength and righteousness of God which he has experienced in his own case to those which he has experienced in common with others in the history of his own nation.

"The abysses of the earth" (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, just as the old Syriac version renders the New Testament &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, e.g., in <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a>, by Syr. tehu&#772;ma&#772;') are, like the gates of death (<a href="/psalms/9-14.htm">Psalm 9:14</a>), a figure of extreme perils and dangers, in the midst of which one is as it were half hidden in the abyss of Hades. The past and future are clearly distinguished in the sequence of the tenses. When God shall again raise His people out of the depth of the present catastrophe, then will He also magnify the &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; of the poet, i.e., in the dignity of his office, by most brilliantly vindicating him in the face of his foes, and will once more (&#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, fut. Niph. like &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; ekil .h above) comfort him. He on his part will also (cf. <a href="/job/40-14.htm">Job 40:14</a>) be grateful for this national restoration and this personal vindication: he will praise God, will praise His truth, i.e., His fidelity to His promises. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497; &#1504;&#1489;&#1500; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1489;&#1500; sounds more circumstantial than in the old poetry. The divine name "The Holy One of Israel" occurs here for the third time in the Psalter; the other passages are <a href="/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a>, which are older in time, and older also than Isaiah, who uses it thirty times, and Habakkuk, who uses it once.
