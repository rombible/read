They acknowledge, however, that in this he was a type of Christ, and that the words ultimately, and in their most sublime sense, are to be explained of him. But as <span class="ital">fear </span>or <span class="ital">reverence </span>is frequently put for strict and proper divine <span class="ital">worship, </span>(as <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm" title="Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:">Isaiah 29:13</a>, compared with <a href="/matthew/15-9.htm" title="But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.">Matthew 15:9</a>, and frequently elsewhere,) which certainly was not due to Solomon, and could not be paid to him without idolatry; and as the psalmist never elsewhere, in any part of the Psalm, speaks of Solomon in the second person, but always in the third; many others consider him as addressing God in these words, to whom he had spoken before in the second person, <a href="/context/psalms/72-1.htm" title="Give the king your judgments, O God, and your righteousness to the king's son....">Psalm 72:1-2</a>, as it is here. Thus Mr. Samuel Clark: “They shall worship and serve thee, O God, so that, with peace, true religion shall flourish.” “The sense is,” says Poole, “This shall be another blessed fruit of his righteous government, that, together with peace, true religion shall be established, and <span class="ital">that throughout all generations, </span>as it here follows. Which was begun in Solomon’s days, and continued, though not without much interruption, in the time of his successors, the kings of Judah, and afterward, until the coming of Christ, in and by whom this prediction and promise was,” in part, and shall, in the end, be “most fully accomplished.” And Henry interprets the words to the same purpose. <span class="ital">As long as the sun and moon endure </span>— Hebrew, <span class="ital">With the sun, and before the moon, </span>that is, while they continue in the heavens; or, as others expound it, Both day and night, as the twelve tribes are said to serve God, <a href="/acts/26-7.htm" title="To which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come.

There were righteousness and peace at first in the administration of his government; but, before the end of his reign, there were troubles and unrighteousness. The kingdom here spoken of is to last as long as the sun, but Solomon's was soon at an end. Even the Jewish expositors understood it of the kingdom of the Messiah. Observe many great and precious promises here made, which were to have full accomplishment only in the kingdom of Christ. As far as his kingdom is set up, discord and contentions cease, in families, churches, and nations. The law of Christ, written in the heart, disposes men to be honest and just, and to render to all their due; it likewise disposes men to live in love, and so produces abundance of peace. Holiness and love shall be lasting in Christ's kingdom. Through all the changes of the world, and all the changes of life, Christ's kingdom will support itself. And he shall, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, come down like rain upon the mown grass; not on that cut down, but that which is left growing, that it may spring again. His gospel has been, or shall be, preached to all nations. Though he needs not the services of any, yet he must be served with the best. Those that have the wealth of this world, must serve Christ with it, do good with it. Prayer shall be made through him, or for his sake; whatever we ask of the Father, should be in his name. Praises shall be offered to him: we are under the highest obligations to him. Christ only shall be feared throughout all generations. To the end of time, and to eternity, his name shall be praised.

The divine name "The Holy One of Israel" occurs here for the third time in the Psalter; the other passages are <a href="/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a>, which are older in time, and older also than Isaiah, who uses it thirty times, and Habakkuk, who uses it once. Jeremiah has it twice (<a href="/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-5.htm">Jeremiah 51:5</a>), and that after the example of Isaiah. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-23.htm">Psalm 71:23</a>, <a href="/psalms/71-24.htm">Psalm 71:24</a> the poet means to say that lips and tongue, song and speech, shall act in concert in the praise of God. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; with Dagesh also in the second Nun, after the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, side by side with which we also find the reading &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, and the reading &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, which is in itself admissible, after the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1490;&#1504;&#1492;, but is here unattested.<p>(Note: Heidenheim reads &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; with Segol, following the statement of Ibn-Bil'am in his &#1496;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497; &#1492;&#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; and of Mose ha-Nakdan in his &#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;, that Segol always precedes the ending &#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, with the exception only of &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;. Baer, on the other hand, reads &#1514;&#1493;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, following Aben-Ezra and Kimchi (Michlol 66b).)<p>The cohortative after &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (lxx &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;) is intended to convey this meaning: when I feel myself impelled to harp unto Thee. In the perfects in the closing line that which is hoped for stands before his soul as though it had already taken place. &#1499;&#1497; is repeated with triumphant emphasis. </body></html>
