There were righteousness and peace at first in the administration of his government; but, before the end of his reign, there were troubles and unrighteousness. The kingdom here spoken of is to last as long as the sun, but Solomon's was soon at an end. Even the Jewish expositors understood it of the kingdom of the Messiah. Observe many great and precious promises here made, which were to have full accomplishment only in the kingdom of Christ. As far as his kingdom is set up, discord and contentions cease, in families, churches, and nations. The law of Christ, written in the heart, disposes men to be honest and just, and to render to all their due; it likewise disposes men to live in love, and so produces abundance of peace. Holiness and love shall be lasting in Christ's kingdom. Through all the changes of the world, and all the changes of life, Christ's kingdom will support itself. And he shall, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, come down like rain upon the mown grass; not on that cut down, but that which is left growing, that it may spring again. His gospel has been, or shall be, preached to all nations. Though he needs not the services of any, yet he must be served with the best. Those that have the wealth of this world, must serve Christ with it, do good with it. Prayer shall be made through him, or for his sake; whatever we ask of the Father, should be in his name. Praises shall be offered to him: we are under the highest obligations to him. Christ only shall be feared throughout all generations. To the end of time, and to eternity, his name shall be praised.

According to Herodotus, Tartessus, when it first became known to the Greeks, was governed by kings (Herod., 1:163). By "the isles" are to be understood the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean generally. All these have, at one time or another, paid homage to Christ. <span class="cmt_word">The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.</span> "Sheba" and "Seba" are distinguished by the writer of Genesis (<a href="/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>), and appear not even to have been very near the one to the other. Sheba was in Southeastern Arabia, and was known to the Greeks and Romans as the country of the Sabaeans (Diod. Sic., 3:45; Strabo, 16:4, &sect; 19; Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 6:23). Saba was in Africa, on the Middle Nile, and the Sebaeans (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) are closely connected by Isaiah with Ethiopia and Egypt (<a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>).  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/72.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The name of God, occurring only once, is Elohim; and this is sufficient to stamp the Psalm as an Elohimic Psalm. &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; (cf. <a href="/psalms/21-2.htm">Psalm 21:2</a>) and &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; are only used without the article according to a poetical usage of the language. The petition itself, and even the position of the words, show that the king's son is present, and that he is king; God is implored to bestow upon him His &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., the rights or legal powers belonging to Him, the God of Israel, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, i.e., the official gift in order that he may exercise those rights in accordance with divine righteousness. After the supplicatory teen the futures which now follow, without the Waw apodoseos, are manifestly optatives.

The predicate for <a href="/psalms/72-3.htm">Psalm 72:3</a> is to be taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-3.htm">Psalm 72:3</a>, just as, on the other hand, &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, "in or by righteousness," the fruit of which is indeed peace (<a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>), belongs also to <a href="/psalms/72-3.htm">Psalm 72:3</a>; so that consequently both members supplement one another. The wish of the poet is this: By righteousness, may there in due season be such peaceful fruit adorning all the heights of the land. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-3.htm">Psalm 72:3</a>, however, always makes one feel as though a verb were wanting, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492; suggested by Bttcher. In <a href="/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a> the wishes are continued in plain unfigurative language. &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; in the signification to save, to obtain salvation for, has, as is frequently the case, a dative of the object. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; are those who are born to poverty, just like &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, one who is born a king. Those who are born to poverty are more or less regarded, by an unrighteous government, as having no rights. </body></html>
