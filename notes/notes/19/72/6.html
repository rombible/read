There were righteousness and peace at first in the administration of his government; but, before the end of his reign, there were troubles and unrighteousness. The kingdom here spoken of is to last as long as the sun, but Solomon's was soon at an end. Even the Jewish expositors understood it of the kingdom of the Messiah. Observe many great and precious promises here made, which were to have full accomplishment only in the kingdom of Christ. As far as his kingdom is set up, discord and contentions cease, in families, churches, and nations. The law of Christ, written in the heart, disposes men to be honest and just, and to render to all their due; it likewise disposes men to live in love, and so produces abundance of peace. Holiness and love shall be lasting in Christ's kingdom. Through all the changes of the world, and all the changes of life, Christ's kingdom will support itself. And he shall, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, come down like rain upon the mown grass; not on that cut down, but that which is left growing, that it may spring again. His gospel has been, or shall be, preached to all nations. Though he needs not the services of any, yet he must be served with the best. Those that have the wealth of this world, must serve Christ with it, do good with it. Prayer shall be made through him, or for his sake; whatever we ask of the Father, should be in his name. Praises shall be offered to him: we are under the highest obligations to him. Christ only shall be feared throughout all generations. To the end of time, and to eternity, his name shall be praised. All nations shall call HIM blessed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/72.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall come down - That is, The influence of his reign will be like fertilising showers. The word" he" in this place might have been "it," referring to his reign, or to the influence of his government.<p>Like rain upon the mown grass - The word rendered "mown grass" - &#1490;&#1494;  ge&#770;z - means properly "a shearing," and is applied in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-20.htm">Job 31:20</a>, to a fleece of wool. So it is understood here by the Septuagint, by the Latin Vulgate, by the Syriac, and by Luther; and, in accordance with this, it has been supposed by some that there is an allusion to the dew that descended on the fleece spread out by Gideon, <a href="/judges/6-37.htm">Judges 6:37</a>. The Chaldee Paraphrase renders it, "As the grass that has been eaten off by locusts;" where the idea would be that after locusts have passed over a field, devouring everything, when the rain descends the fields revive, and nature again puts on the appearance of life. This idea is adopted by Rosenmuller. The common interpretation, however, which refers the word to a "mowing," that is, a "mown meadow," is probably the correct one; and thus understood, the image is very beautiful. The reign of the Messiah would resemble the gently descending shower, under which the grass which has been mown springs up again with freshness and beauty.<p>As showers that water the earth - literally, "like showers, the watering of the earth." The original word rendered "that water" suggests the idea of distilling, or "gently" flowing. <p><a href="/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>My doctrine shall drop as the rain<p>My speech shall distil as the dew<p>As the small rain upon the tender herb,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/72.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

That is, the King and King's Son, the Messiah, whose coming is compared to rain, and showers of it; see <a href="/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>; and may be understood of his incarnation; when, like rain, he came down from heaven; not by an illapse or entrance of the human nature, which before was not in him; nor by local motion of his divine Person, with which that will not agree; but by assumption of human nature into union with him, as the Son of God; which was an instance of his condescending grace: like rain, he had no father as man; see <a href="/job/38-28.htm">Job 38:28</a>; but was born of a virgin, through the power of the Holy Ghost; which was very marvellous, like the dew that fell on Gideon's fleece, when the earth about it was dry; which some think is here referred to. The word used signifies also a shorn fleece of wool; and so it is rendered by the Septuagint, and those versions which follow that: or, "shorn grass", shorn by locusts, as the Targum; rather by sheep, who, as by classical writers (s), are said to sheer the grass by biting it. Or, "like rain upon the fleece" (t); and as the rain is the gift of God to persons undeserving, in consequence of a decree, <a href="/job/28-26.htm">Job 28:26</a>; sometimes comes suddenly, and is very grateful and refreshing; so Christ is the free gift of God to sinners, and by a decree of his; and his coming was suddenly, into his temple, and was welcome to them that looked for him; as he still is to all sensible sinners. Or this may be interpreted of the coming of Christ into the hearts of his people, by the communications of his Spirit and grace, which, like rain, came down from heaven; are dependent on the will of God, are free grace gifts, and given in abundance; and, like rain, refresh, revive, and make fruitful. Or else this may be applied to the administration of Christ's offices; as his prophetic office, his Gospel and doctrine, being from heaven, like rain, and falling, by divine direction, sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another; and like it in its effects, softening, quickening, and fructifying; and more especially it may respect the administration of his kingly office, since he is in the context spoken of as a King and Judge, and that in the latter day; whose administrations, though just and righteous; yet not cruel and severe, but mild and gentle; his commands are not grievous, nor his yoke heavy; though he will rule the wicked with a rod of iron, he holds forth the sceptre of grace and mercy to his own people; and when his kingdom shall come in all its glory, it will be times refreshing from the presence of the Lord; and his favour will be as the cloud of the latter rain; see <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>; <p>as showers that water the earth: signifying the same. The word is only in this place, and is used in the Talmud (u), in the plural number, for drops of water; and this sense of showers dropping on the earth is given by the Targum. Kimchi derives it from  which, in the Syriac language, signifies to "cut"; and thinks the phrase is the same with the former, "as showers on the cut grass of the earth" (w). But perhaps the word rather designs the fissures and cracks of the earth through drought; and the sense is, that Christ's coming is like showers of rain upon the dry and parched ground, which are very acceptable to it. <p>(s) "Tondentes gramen oves", Ovid. de Remed.

According to the Chethb, the range of the poet's vision widens in <a href="/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a> from the proofs of the strength and righteousness of God which he has experienced in his own case to those which he has experienced in common with others in the history of his own nation.

The past and future are clearly distinguished in the sequence of the tenses. When God shall again raise His people out of the depth of the present catastrophe, then will He also magnify the &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; of the poet, i.e., in the dignity of his office, by most brilliantly vindicating him in the face of his foes, and will once more (&#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, fut. Niph. like &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; ekil .h above) comfort him. He on his part will also (cf. <a href="/job/40-14.htm">Job 40:14</a>) be grateful for this national restoration and this personal vindication: he will praise God, will praise His truth, i.e., His fidelity to His promises. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497; &#1504;&#1489;&#1500; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1489;&#1500; sounds more circumstantial than in the old poetry.
