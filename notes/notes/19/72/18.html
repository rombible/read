Surely such an illustrious prophecy of the Messiah and his kingdom as is contained in the foregoing verses, may well be concluded with thanksgivings and praises. For we cannot but own that for all the great things which he has done for the world, for the church, for the children of men, for his own children, in the kingdom of providence, in the kingdom of grace; for all the power and trust lodged in the hands of the Redeemer, God is worthy to be praised; and we ought to stir up ourselves and all that is within us to praise him after the best manner, and to desire that all others may do it. <span class="ital">Who only doth wondrous things — </span>In creation and providence, and especially in this work of redemption, which excelleth them all. Men’s works are little, common, trifling things, and things which, without him, they could not do. But God doth all by his own power, and they are wondrous things which he doth, and such as will be the eternal admiration of saints and angels. <span class="ital">And blessed be his glorious name — </span>For it is only in his <span class="ital">name </span>that we can contribute any thing to his glory and blessedness, and that is <span class="ital">exalted above all blessing and praise. </span>Let it be blessed for ever, for it deserves to be blessed for ever, and we hope to be for ever blessing it, and that with angels, and archangels, and all the company of heaven. <span class="ital">And let the whole earth be filled with his glory — </span>As it will be, when the kings of <span class="ital">Tarshish and the isles shall bring presents to him, </span>when to him <span class="ital">every knee shall bow, and all shall know him, from the least to the greatest. </span>It is lamentable to think how empty the earth is of the glory of God, how little honour and service he has from a world which he made and upholds, and to which he is such a bountiful benefactor. And, therefore, all that wish well to the honour of God and the welfare of mankind, cannot but desire that the earth may be filled with discoveries of his glory, suitably returned in thankful acknowledgments of it. Let every heart then, and every mouth, and every assembly, be filled with the high praises of God. We see how earnest David was in this prayer, and how much his heart was in it, by observing, 1st, How he shuts it up with a double seal, <span class="ital">Amen, and amen: </span>and, 2d, How he even shuts up his life with this prayer; for this, it appears <a href="/psalms/72-20.htm" title="The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.">Psalm 72:20</a>, was the last Psalm that ever he composed, though not placed last in this collection: he penned it when he lay, on his death-bed, and with this he breathes his last. Let God be glorified; let the kingdom of the Messiah be set up and established in the world and I have enough, I desire no more. With this let our prayers, like the prayers of David the son of Jesse, be ended: and with our last breath let us say, <span class="ital">Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly!</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/72.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>72:18-20 We are taught to bless God in Christ, for all he has done for us by him. David is earnest in prayer for the fulfilment of this prophecy and promise. It is sad to think how empty the earth is of the glory of God, how little service and honour he has from a world to which he is so bountiful. May we, like David, submit to Christ's authority, and partake of his righteousness and peace. May we bless him for the wonders of redeeming love. May we spend our days, and end our lives, praying for the spread of his gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/72.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel - The God who rules over Israel; the God who is worshipped by the Hebrew people, and who is recognized as their God.

He is the Blessed God, and his name shall be blessed; his name is glorious, and that glory shall fill the whole earth.

What more could he ask? He has climbed the summit of the mount of God; he desires nothing more. With this upon his lip, he is content to die. He strips himself of his own royalty and becomes only the "son of Jesse," thrice happy to subside into nothing before the crowned Messiah. Before his believing eye the reign of Jesus, like the sun, filled all around with light, and the holy soul of the man after! God's own heart exulted in it, and sung his "Nunc dimittis:" "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation!" We, too, will cease from all petitioning if it be granted to us to see the day of the Lord.

Voluntative forms are intermingled because the prospect extending into the future is nevertheless more lyrical than prophetic in its character. The elevation of the king to the dominion of the world is the reward of his condescension; he shows himself to be the helper and protecting lord of the poor and the oppressed, who are the especial object upon which God's eye is set. He looks upon it as his task to deal most sympathizingly and most considerately (&#1497;&#1495;&#1505;) just with those of reduced circumstances and with the poor, and their blood is precious in his eyes. <a href="/psalms/72-12.htm">Psalm 72:12</a> is re-echoed in <a href="/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12</a>. The meaning of <a href="/psalms/72-14.htm">Psalm 72:14</a> is the same as <a href="/psalms/116-15.htm">Psalm 116:15</a>. Instead of &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;, by a retention of the Jod of the stem it is written &#1497;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512;. Just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>, &#1497;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512; here also is followed by &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;. The assertion is individualized: and he (who was threatened with death) shall live (voluntative, having reference to the will of the king). But who is now the subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;-? Not the rescued one (Hitzig), for after the foregoing designations (<a href="/psalms/72-11.htm">Psalm 72:11</a>.) we cannot expect to find "the gold of Sheba" (gold from Jeman or Aethiopia) in his possession. Therefore it is the king, and in fact Solomon, of whom the disposal of the gold of Sheba (Saba) is characteristic. The king's thought and endeavour are directed to this, that the poor man who has almost fallen a victim shall live or revive, and not only will he maintain his cause, he will also bestow gifts upon him with a liberal hand, and he (the poor one who has been rescued and endowed from the riches of the king) shall pray unceasingly for him (the king) and bless him at all times. The poor one is he who is restored to life and endowed with gifts, and who intercedes and blesses; the king, however, is the beneficent giver. It is left for the reader to supply the right subjects in thought to the separate verbs. That clearly marked precision which we require in rhetorical recital is alien to the Oriental style (vid., my Geschichte der jdischen Poesie, S. 189). Maurer and Hofmann also give the same interpretation as we have done. </body></html>
