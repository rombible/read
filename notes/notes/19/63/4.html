When this is the regular frame of a believer's mind, he values the loving-kindness of God more than life. God's loving-kindness is our spiritual life, and that is better than temporal life. We must praise God with joyful lips; we must address ourselves to the duties of religion with cheerfulness, and speak forth the praises of God from a principle of holy joy. Praising lips must be joyful lips. David was in continual danger; care and fear held his eyes waking, and gave him wearisome nights; but he comforted himself with thoughts of God. The mercies of God, when called to mind in the night watches, support the soul, making darkness cheerful. How happy will be that last morning, when the believer, awaking up after the Divine likeness, shall be satisfied with all the fulness of God, and praise him with joyful lips, where there is no night, and where sorrow and sighing flee away!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/63.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thus will I bless thee while I live - In my life; or, as long as life lasts, will I praise thee. The word "thus" refers to the sentiment in the previous verse, meaning that as the result of his deep sense of the value of the loving kindness of God, he would praise him through all the remainder of his life, or would never cease to praise him. A true purpose of serving God embraces the whole of this life, and the whole of eternity. He who loves God, and who has any proper sense of his mercy, does not anticipate a time when he will cease to praise and bless him, or when he will have any desire or wish not to be engaged in his service.<p>I will lift up my hands in thy name - In solemn prayer and praise.

With his whole heart and soul, as he had sought after him, and as under a sense of his lovingkindness; and as he now praised him with his lips, so he determined to do as long as he had life and being; by proclaiming his blessedness, by ascribing blessing and honour to him, and by giving him the glory of all mercies temporal and spiritual; <p>I will lift up my hands in thy name; not against his enemies, against those that fought against him, as Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it, but unto God in heaven; and that not as a gesture used in swearing, but either in blessing, as Aben Ezra observes; so the high priest lifted up his hands when he blessed the people; or in prayer, or in both, so Jarchi's note is, to pray and to praise; See Gill on <a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>.

This is the internal connection of the third group with the two preceding ones. By means of the strophe vv. 10-13, our Psalm is brought into the closest reciprocal relationship with <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1-13</a>. Concerning &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; vid., on <a href="/psalms/49-3.htm">Psalm 49:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>. The accentuation divides <a href="/psalms/62-10.htm">Psalm 62:10</a> quite correctly. The Athnach does not mark &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; as an independent clause: they are upon the balance &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, for a going up; they must rise, so light are they (Hengstenberg). Certainly this expression of the periphrastic future is possible (vid., on <a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-6</a> :17), still we feel the want here of the subject, which cannot be dispensed within the clause as an independent one. Since, however, the combining of the words with what follows is forbidden by the fact that the infinitive with &#1500; in the sense of the ablat. gerund. always comes after the principal clause, not before it (Ew. 280, d), we interpret: upon the balances ad ascendendum  equals  certo ascensuri, and in fact so that this is an attributive that is co-ordinate with &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;. Is the clause following now meant to affirm that men, one and all, belong to nothingness or vanity (&#1502;&#1503; partitivum), or that they are less than nothing (&#1502;&#1503; comparat.)? Umbreit, Stier, and others explain <a href="/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17</a> also in the latter way; but parallels like <a href="/isaiah/41-24.htm">Isaiah 41:24</a> do not favour this rendering, and such as <a href="/isaiah/44-11.htm">Isaiah 44:11</a> are opposed to it. So also here the meaning is not that men stand under the category of that which is worthless or vain, but that they belong to the domain of the worthless or vain.<p>The warning in <a href="/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a> does not refer to the Absalomites, but, pointing to these as furnishing a salutary example, to those who, at the sight of the prosperous condition and joyous life on that side, might perhaps be seized with envy and covetousness. Beside &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; the meaning of &#1492;&#1489;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468; is nevertheless not: to set in vain hope upon anything (for the idea of hoping does not exist in this verb in itself, <a href="/job/27-12.htm">Job 27:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>, nor in this construction of the verb), but: to be befooled, blinded by something vain (Hitzig). Just as they are not to suffer their heart to be befooled by their own unjust acquisition, so also are they not, when the property of others increases (&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, root &#1504;&#1489;, to raise one's self, to mount up; cf. Arabic nabata, to sprout up, grow; nabara, to raise; intransitive, to increase, and many other verbal stems), to turn their heart towards it, as though it were something great and fortunate, that merited special attention and commanded respect. Two great truths are divinely attested to the poet. It is not to be rendered: once hath God spoken, now twice (<a href="/job/40-5.htm">Job 40:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-10.htm">2 Kings 6:10</a>) have I heard this; but after <a href="/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a> : One thing hath God spoken, two things (it is) that I have heard; or in accordance with the interpunction, which here, as in <a href="/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a> (cf. on <a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>), is not to be called in question: these two things have I heard. Two divine utterances actually do follow. The two great truths are: (1) that God has the power over everything earthly, that consequently nothing takes place without Him, and that whatever is opposed to Him must sooner or later succumb; (2) that of this very God, the sovereign Lord (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;), is mercy also, the energy of which is measured by His omnipotence, and which does not suffer him to succumb upon whom it is bestowed. With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; the poet establishes these two revealed maxims which God has impressed upon his mind, from His righteous government as displayed in the history of men. He recompenses each one in accordance with his doing, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, as Paul confesses (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>) no less than David, and even (vid., lxx) in the words of David. It shall be recompensed unto every man according to his conduct, which is the issue of his relationship to God. He who rises in opposition to the will and order of God, shall feel God's power (&#1506;&#1494;) as a power for punishment that dashes in pieces; and he who, anxious for salvation, resigns his own will to the will of God, receives from God's mercy or loving-kindness (&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;), as from an overflowing fulness, the promised reward of faithfulness: his resignation becomes experience, and his hoping attainment. </body></html>
