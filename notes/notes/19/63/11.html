Having committed ourselves to God, we must be easy and pleased, and quiet from the fear of evil. Those that follow hard after God, would soon fail, if God's right hand did not uphold them. It is he that strengthens us and comforts us. The psalmist doubts not but that though now sowing in tears, he should reap in joy. Messiah the Prince shall rejoice in God; he is already entered into the joy set before him, and his glory will be completed at his second coming. Blessed Lord, let our desire towards thee increase every hour; let our love be always upon thee; let all our enjoyment be in thee, and all our satisfaction from thee. Be thou all in all to us while we remain in the present wilderness state, and bring us home to the everlasting enjoyment of thee for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/63.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the king shall rejoice in God - This passage, as was remarked in the Introduction to the psalm, shows that this psalm could not have been composed in the time of Saul, since the title king was not then given to David. The use of the term here in the third person does not prove that the psalm could not have been written by David himself, for he may have spoken of himself simply as "the king," and all the more forcibly and properly as he was driven unjustly from his throne, and was now an exile, yet was still a king - the king. The title was his; the throne belonged to him, and not to Absalom who had driven him from it. It was not improper to allude to this fact in the manner in which it is referred to here, and to say that "the king" - the true, the real king - himself - should and would rejoice in God. He would find God to be his helper; and by God he would yet be restored to his throne.<p>Every one that sweareth by him shall glory - Everyone that sweareth to him, or maintains his oath of allegiance to him, shall be honored.<p>But the mouth of them that speak lies - All who have sworn falsely; all who have professed allegiance and have proved unfaithful; all those who, contrary to their oaths and their obligations, have been found in the rebellion. They shall not be permitted to exult or rejoice, but they shall be confounded and silenced. This expresses, therefore, the fullest confidence in God; the absolute belief of David that he would be again placed on his throne, and again permitted "to see the power and glory of God as" he had "seen it in the sanctuary" <a href="/psalms/63-2.htm">Psalm 63:2</a>; the belief that he would be restored to prosperity, and that his enemies would be humbled and destroyed - So it will be with all who put their trust in God. There is certain joy and triumph for them, if not in this world, at least in the world to come. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/63.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. the king&#8212;that is, David himself, and all who reverence God, "shall share a glorious part," while treacherous foes shall be for ever silenced (Ps 62:4).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/63.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The king; </span> I, who am already anointed king, and who shall be actually king, when these mine enemies are fallen by the sword. He speaks of himself in the third person, either out of modesty or out of prudence, because it was ambiguous, and might be understood either of himself or of Saul, whereby, he might avoid the envy of the expression, if this Psalm was composed before he was king. <span class="ital">That sweareth by him</span>; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Nor is it likely that the psalmist would justify those kinds of oaths; this practice of swearing by one’s name being accounted a part of that worship which is proper to God, both in the Old and New Testament. If this were meant of the king, it might better be rendered, <span class="ital">that sweareth it</span>, (for so the particle <span class="ital">beth</span> is sometimes used) <span class="ital">him</span>, as subjects used to swear homage to their prince.

He feels himself satisfied in his inmost nature just as after a feast of the most nourishing and dainty meats, and with lips of jubilant songs (accus. instrum. according to Ges. 138, rem. 3), i.e., with lips jubilant and attuned to song, shall his mouth sing praise. What now follows in <a href="/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a> we no longer, as formerly, take as a protasis subsequently introduced (like <a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>.): "when I remembered...meditated upon Thee," but so that <a href="/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a> is the protasis and <a href="/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a> the apodosis, cf. <a href="/psalms/21-12.htm">Psalm 21:12</a>; <a href="/job/9-16.htm">Job 9:16</a> (Hitzig): When I remember Thee (meminerim, Ew. 355, b) upon my bed (stratis meis, as in <a href="/psalms/132-3.htm">Psalm 132:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>, cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>) - says he now as the twilight watch is passing gradually into the morning - I meditate upon Thee in the night-watches (Symmachus, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8; &#787; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;), or during, throughout the night-watches (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>); i.e., it is no passing remembrance, but it so holds me that I pass a great part of the night absorbed in meditation on Thee. He has no lack of matter for his meditation; for God has become a help (auxilio, vid., on <a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>) to him: He has rescued him in this wilderness, and, well concealed under the shadow of His wings (vid., on <a href="/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/57-2.htm">Psalm 57:2</a>), which affords him a cool retreat in the heat of conflict and protection against his persecutors, he is able to exult (&#1488;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503;, the potential). Between himself and God there subsists a reciprocal relationship of active love. According to the schema of the crosswise position of words (Chiasmus), &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; intentionally jostle close against one another: he depends upon God, following close behind Him, i.e., following Him everywhere and not leaving Him when He wishes to avoid him; and on the other side God's right hand holds him fast, not letting him go, not abandoning him to his foes. </body></html>
