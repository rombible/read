The sinner here described is an atheist, one that saith there is no Judge or Governor of the world, no Providence ruling over the affairs of men. He says this in his heart. He cannot satisfy himself that there is none, but wishes there were none, and pleases himself that it is possible there may be none; he is willing to think there is none. This sinner is a fool; he is simple and unwise, and this is evidence of it: he is wicked and profane, and this is the cause. The word of God is a discerner of these thoughts. No man will say, There is no God, till he is so hardened in sin, that it is become his interest that there should be none to call him to an account. The disease of sin has infected the whole race of mankind. They are all gone aside, there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Whatever good is in any of the children of men, or is done by them, it is not of themselves, it is God's work in them. They are gone aside from the right way of their duty, the way that leads to happiness, and are turned into the paths of the destroyer. Let us lament the corruption of our nature, and see what need we have of the grace of God: let us not marvel that we are told we must be born again. And we must not rest in any thing short of union with Christ, and a new creation to holiness by his Spirit. The psalmist endeavours to convince sinners of the evil and danger of their way, while they think themselves very wise, and good, and safe. Their wickedness is described. Those that care not for God's people, for God's poor, care not for God himself. People run into all manner of wickedness, because they do not call upon God for his grace. What good can be expected from those that live without prayer? But those that will not fear God, may be made to fear at the shaking of a leaf. All our knowledge of the depravity of human nature should endear to us salvation out of Zion. But in heaven alone shall the whole company of the redeemed rejoice fully, and for evermore. The world is bad; oh that the Messiah would come and change its character! There is universal corruption; oh for the times of reformation! The triumphs of Zion's King will be the joys of Zion's children. The second coming of Christ, finally to do away the dominion of sin and Satan, will be the completing of this salvation, which is the hope, and will be the joy of every Israelite indeed. With this assurance we should comfort ourselves and one another, under the sins of sinners and sufferings of saints.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? - literally, "Do they not know, all the workers of iniquity, eating my people, they eat bread; Jehovah they call not." The several statements in this verse in confirmation of the fact of their depravity are:<p>(a) that they have no knowledge of God;<p>(b) that they find pleasure in the errors and imperfections of the people of God - sustaining themselves in their own wickedness by the fact that the professed friends of God are inconsistent in their lives; and<p>(c) that they do not call on the name of the Lord, or that they offer no worship to him.<p>The whole verse might have been, and should have been put in the form of a question. The first statement implied in the question is, that they have "no knowledge." This can be regarded as a proof of guilt only<p>(1) as they have opportunities of obtaining knowledge;<p>(2) as they neglect to improve those opportunities, and remain in voluntary ignorance; and<p>(3) as they do this from a design to practice wickedness.<p>See this argument stated at length by the apostle Paul in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19-28</a>. Compare the note at that passage. This proof of human depravity is everywhere manifested still in the world - in the fact that men have the opportunities of gaining the knowledge of God if they chose to do it; in the fact that they voluntarily neglect those opportunities; and in the fact that the reason of this is that they love iniquity.<p>Who eat up my people as they eat bread - They sustain themselves in their own course of life by the imperfections of the people of God. That is, they make use of their inconsistencies to confirm themselves in the belief that there is no God. They argue that a religion which produces no better fruits than what is seen in the lives of its professed friends can be of no value, or cannot be genuine; that if a professed belief in God produces no happier results than are found in their lives, it could be of no advantage to worship God; that they are themselves as good as those are who profess to be religious, and that, therefore, there can be no evidence from the lives of the professed friends of God that religion is either true or of any value. No inconsiderable part of the evidence in favor of religion, it is intended, shall be derived from the lives of its friends; and when that evidence is not furnished, of course no small part of the proof of its reality and value is lost. Hence, so much importance is attached everywhere in the Bible to the necessity of a consistent life on the part of the professed friends of religion. Compare <a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>. The words "my people" here are properly to be regarded as the words of the psalmist, identifying himself with the people of God, and speaking of them thus as "his own people." Thus one speaks of his own family or his own friends. Compare <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a>. Or this may be spoken by David, considered as the head or ruler of the nation, and he may thus speak of the people of God as his people. The connection does not allow of the construction which would refer the words to God.<p>And call not upon the Lord - They do not worship Yahweh. They give this evidence of wickedness that they do not pray; that they do not invoke the blessing of their Maker; that they do not publicly acknowledge him as God. It is remarkable that this is placed as the last or the crowning thing in the evidence of their depravity; and if rightly considered, it is so. To one who should look at things as they are; to one who sees all the claims and obligations which rest upon mankind; to one who appreciates his own guilt, his dependance, and his exposure to death and woe; to one who understands aright why man was made - there can be no more striking proof of human depravity than in the fact that a man in no way acknowledges his Maker - that he renders him no homage - that he never supplicates his favor - never deprecates his wrath - that, amidst the trials, the temptations, the perils of life, he endeavors to make his way through the world "as if there were no God." The highest crime that Gabriel could commit would be to renounce all allegiance to his Maker, and henceforward to live as if there were no God. All other iniquities that he might commit would spring out of that, and would be secondary to that. The great sin of man consists in renouncing God, and attempting to live as if there were no Supreme Being to whom he owes allegiance. All other sins spring out of that, and are subordinate to it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6.

Men who having no saving knowledge of divine things, enslave themselves to become workers of iniquity, have no heart to cry to the Lord for deliverance, but seek to amuse themselves with devouring the poor and despised people of God. It is hard bondage to be a "worker of iniquity;" a worker at the galleys, or in the mines of Siberia, is not more truly degraded and wretched; the toil is hard and the reward dreadful; those who have no knowledge choose such slavery, but those who are taught of God cry to be rescued from it. The same ignorance which keeps men bondsmen to evil, makes them hate the freeborn sons of God; hence they seek to eat them up "as they eat bread," - daily, ravenously, as though it were an ordinary, usual, every day matter to oppress the saints of God. As pikes in a pond eat up little fish, as eagles prey on smaller birds, as wolves rend the sheep of the pasture, so sinners naturally and as a matter of course persecute, malign, and mock the followers of the Lord Jesus. While thus preying, they forswear all praying, and in this act consistently, for how could they hope to be heard while their hands are full of blood? <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Have the workers of iniquity</span> lost their wits? have they neither religion nor common discretion? either of which would teach them not to make themselves so hateful to the all-seeing and almighty God, and to all men.

Of the being of God, of the nature of sin, and of the punishment due unto it? This question is put either by way of admiration, as Kimchi and Aben Ezra observe; the psalmist, or rather God speaking after the manner of men, wondering that there should be such ignorance and stupidity among men, as before expressed; or rather, as denying this to be the case, and affirming that they have knowledge, notwithstanding they think, and say, and do, as before related, as in <a href="/romans/9-21.htm">Romans 9:21</a>. Do not they know that there is a God? and that they are accountable to him for their actions? Verily they do: for this is said, not of sinners of the Gentiles; though even they, by the light of nature, know there is a God, and show the work of the law written in their hearts; and have a consciousness in them of good and evil; but of sinners in Zion, of the profligate part of mankind among the Jews, who had a divine revelation, by which they knew the one God of Israel; and a law, by which was the knowledge of sin, and whose sanctions were rewards and punishments. And it seems to design the chief among them, who had power over others, to eat them up and devour them; even their political and ecclesiastical governors see <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a>, who, though they had no spiritual understanding, nor experimental knowledge of things, yet had a theoretical and speculative one; so that their sins were attended with this aggravation, that they were against light and knowledge, particularly what follows: <p>who eat up my people as they eat bread: not David's people, but the Lord's people: see <a href="/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2</a>; whom he chose for his people, who were his covenant people, and who professed his name, and were called by it; these the workers of iniquity ate up, devoured, and consumed; see <a href="/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a>; by reproaching and persecuting them, doing injury to their persons, property, and character: they devoured their persons, by using them cruelly and putting them to death; they devoured their substance, by spoiling them of it, and converting it to their own use, as the Pharisees are said to devour widows' houses and they destroyed their good names and characters with their devouring words: and this they did with as much ease, delight, and pleasure, and without any remorse of conscience, and as constantly, as a man eats his bread. Or the words may be rendered, "they eat up my people, they eat bread"; that is, though they act such a wicked and cruel part, yet they have bread to eat, and fulness of it; they are not in straits, nor afflicted and punished; and because they are not, they are hardened in their impiety and iniquity: or "they eat bread", after they have persecuted and devoured the Lord's people, with peace of mind, without remorse of conscience, as if they had done no iniquity, like the adulterous woman in <a href="/proverbs/30-20.htm">Proverbs 30:20</a>; <p>and call not upon the Lord; or pray to him, or serve and worship him; for invocation includes the whole worship of God; and this they do not, though they know him, and are daily supplied by him, and eat his bread. Some read this clause with the former, "they eat bread, and call not on the Lord"; as if their sin was, that when they eat bread, they did not ask a blessing upon it, nor return thanks to God for it, which ought to be done; but the accent "athnach" under  "bread", will not admit of this sense, though it seems to be countenanced by the Targum. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>.

But a much better connexion with <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/14-5.htm" title="There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.">Psalm 14:5</a></span> is gained by rendering, <span class="ital">Were not all the workers of iniquity made to know</span>? (or, following the ancient versions in a change of the vocalisation, <span class="ital">shall not … be made to know</span>?) i.e. taught by sharp experience to know their error. Then <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/14-5.htm" title="There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.">Psalm 14:5</a></span> follows as the answer to the question. ‘Yes, indeed! there &c.’ For this pregnant sense of <span class="ital">know</span>, cp. <a href="/hosea/9-7.htm" title="The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of your iniquity, and the great hatred.">Hosea 9:7</a>; <a href="/judges/8-16.htm" title="And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.">Jdg 8:16</a> (<span class="ital">taught</span>, lit. <span class="ital">made to know</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who eat up</span> &c.] Lit. <span class="ital">eating my people they eat bread</span>. The A.V. follows the ancient versions in understanding this to mean, ‘they devour my people as naturally as they take their daily food.’ But the words seem rather to mean, ‘they live by devouring my people.’ Cp. <a href="/context/micah/3-1.htm" title="And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and you princes of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?...">Micah 3:1-3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm" title="The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for you have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.">Isaiah 3:14</a> f. And this they do without regard to Jehovah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But who are meant by <span class="ital">my people</span> and the <span class="ital">workers of iniquity</span>?

But it is more natural to explain ‘my people’ of the nation of Israel; and in this case ‘the workers of iniquity’ must be foreign oppressors, or, if we assume a reference to past history as in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/psalms/14-1.htm" title="The fool has said in his heart, There is no God.

Reducing men to poverty, robbing them, and devouring their substance, is called, in Scripture, devouring the men themselves (see <a href="/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>; <a href="/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>). Those who are plundered and despoiled are compared to "bread" in <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>. The Homeric <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, adduced by Dr. Kay, is an instance of the same metaphor. <span class="cmt_word">And call not upon the Lord</span>. This might have seemed scarcely to need mention, since "how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?" (<a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14</a>). But it connects them definitely with the atheists of ver. 1. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 13:4-5) In contrast to God's seeming to have forgotten him and to wish neither to see nor know anything of his need, he prays: &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492; (cf. <a href="/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>). In contrast to his being in perplexity what course to take and unable to help himself, he prays: &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, answer me, who cry for help, viz., by the fulfilment of my prayer as a real, actual answer. In contrast to the triumphing of his foe: &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, in order that the triumph of his enemy may not be made complete by his dying. To lighten the eyes that are dimmed with sorrow and ready to break, is equivalent to, to impart new life (<a href="/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a>), which is reflected in the fresh clear brightness of the eye (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/14-29.htm">1 Samuel 14:29</a>). The lightening light, to which &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512; points, is the light of love beaming from the divine countenance, <a href="/psalms/31-17.htm">Psalm 31:17</a>. Light, love, and life are closely allied notions in the Scriptures. He, upon whom God looks down in love, continues in life, new powers of life are imparted to him, it is not his lot to sleep the death, i.e., the sleep of death, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-39.htm">Jeremiah 51:39</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-57.htm">Jeremiah 51:57</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is the accusative of effect or sequence: to sleep so that the sleep becomes death (lxx &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), Ew. 281, e. Such is the light of life for which he prays, in order that his foe may not be able at last to say &#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (with accusative object, as in <a href="/jeremiah/38-5.htm">Jeremiah 38:5</a>)  equals  &#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1500;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/129-2.htm">Psalm 129:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-26.htm">Genesis 32:26</a>, I am able for him, a match for him, I am superior to him, have gained the mastery over him. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, on account of the future which follows, had better be taken as temporal (quum) than as expressing the reason (quod), cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1496; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>. </body></html>
