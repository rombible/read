Our Prophet and High Priest, of infinitely greater dignity than Moses, Aaron, or Samuel, has received and declared to us the will of the Father.

It cannot be meant literally that he spake to "Samuel" from the "cloudy pillar" - the pillar which guided the Israelites in the wilderness, unless that term be understood in the general sense as denoting the "Shechinah" - the visible symbol of the divine presence - the cloud that rested on the ark. The idea is, that God his people in ancient times from the cloud - the symbol of his presence; that he communed with them; that he heard their prayers; that he gave them his commandments; that he interposed in their behalf, and that it was not a vain thing that they worshipped him. All this was as true of Samuel - it is as true now of those who call upon God - as it was of Moses and Aaron.<p>They kept his testimonies ... - They obeyed his laws, and he thus heard and answered them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/99.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. cloudy pillar&#8212;the medium of divine intercourse (Ex 33:9; Nu 12:5).
