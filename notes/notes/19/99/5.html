Observe, reader, that God is to be worshipped and glorified, is the one inference always drawn from every position of David. And surely the greater the public mercies are in which we have a share, the more we are obliged to bear a part in the public homage paid to God. The setting up of the kingdom of Christ, especially, ought to be matter of our praise. Observe further, when we draw nigh to God to worship him, our hearts ought to be filled with high thoughts of him, and we ought to exalt him in our souls. And the more we abase ourselves, and the more prostrate we are before God, the more we exalt him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/99.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>99:1-5 God governs the world by his providence, governs the church by his grace, and both by his Son.

The meaning is, Let his name be, as it were, lifted up on high, so as to be conspicuous or seen from afar. Let it be done with a lofty voice; let it be with ascriptions of praise.<p>And worship at his footstool - By humble prostration at his feet. The footstool is that on which the feet rest when one is sitting, and the reference here is to the footstool on which the feet of a king rested when he sat on his throne or chair of state. To worship at his footstool - compare <a href="/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a> - denotes the deepest humility and the profoundest prostration and reverence. It is as if we could not look on his face, or on his throne, or on his gorgeous and magnificent robes, but bowed our heads in lowly reverence, and deemed it sufficient honor to lie low before that on which his feet rested. To show the dignity and majesty of God, the earth itself is represented as being merely his footstool; as being, in comparison with the heaven - the place of his seat - his "throne," only as the footstool is as compared with the splendid chair of state. <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34-35</a>.<p>For he is holy - See <a href="/psalms/99-3.htm">Psalm 99:3</a>. Margin, "it is holy." The translation in the text best expresses the sense. The fact that God is "holy" is a reason for lowly and profound prostration before him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/99.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.
