Shall I depend upon the strength of the hills? upon princes and great men? No; my confidence is in God only. Or, we must lift up our eyes above the hills; we must look to God who makes all earthly things to us what they are. We must see all our help in God; from him we must expect it, in his own way and time. This psalm teaches us to comfort ourselves in the Lord, when difficulties and dangers are greatest. It is almighty wisdom that contrives, and almighty power that works the safety of those that put themselves under God's protection. He is a wakeful, watchful Keeper; he is never weary; he not only does not sleep, but he does not so much as slumber. Under this shade they may sit with delight and assurance. He is always near his people for their protection and refreshment. The right hand is the working hand; let them but turn to their duty, and they shall find God ready to give them success. He will take care that his people shall not fall. Thou shalt not be hurt, neither by the open assaults, nor by the secret attempts of thine enemies. The Lord shall prevent the evil thou fearest, and sanctify, remove, or lighten the evil thou feelest. He will preserve the soul, that it be not defiled by sin, and disturbed by affliction; he will preserve it from perishing eternally. He will keep thee in life and death; going out to thy labour in the morning of thy days, and coming home to thy rest when the evening of old age calls thee in. It is a protection for life. The Spirit, who is their Preserver and Comforter, shall abide with them for ever. Let us be found in our work, assured that the blessings promised in this psalm are ours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/121.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord shall preserve thou going out and thy coming in - Preserve thee in going out and coming in; in going from thy dwelling, and returning to it; in going from home and coming back; that is, everywhere, and at all times.

No evil that will endanger their salvation can befal them; nothing can happen to them here but what God shall see to be conducive to their ultimate good; and in the heavenly world they shall be safe forever from every kind of evil, for in that world there will be no sin, and consequently no need of discipline to prepare them for the future.<p>"In foreign realms, and lands remote,<p>Supported by thy care,<p>Through burning climes they pass unhurt,<p>And breathe in tainted air.<p>When by the dreadful tempest borne,<p>High on the broken wave,<p>They know thou art not slow to hear,<p>Nor impotent to save.<p>The storm is laid - the winds retire,<p>Obedient to thy will;<p>The sea that roars at thy command,<p>At thy command is still.<p>In midst of dangers, fears, and death,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/121.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. thy going out, &c.&#8212;all thy ways (De 28:19; Ps 104:23).<p>evermore&#8212;includes a future state.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/121.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in; </span> shall guard and assist thee in all thy expeditions, and affairs, and actions, either at home or abroad.

And such persons, in the Punic language, are called Namphanians, as Austin observes (y); who says the word signifies a man of a good foot: and the word seems to be the contraction of , which signifies "his good" or "pleasant foot" (z); and so one that, wherever he comes and goes, things prosper with him, and with those that are in connection with him: such an one was Jacob in the house of Laban, whom the Lord blessed, as he says, "since my coming", or at "my foot"; see Gill on <a href="/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>; and such a foot Joseph had wherever he went, <a href="/genesis/39-5.htm">Genesis 39:5</a>.

The expression in fact is &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, and not &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;. And the mountains towards which the psalmist raises his eyes are not any mountains whatsoever. In Ezekiel the designation of his native land from the standpoint of the Mesopotamian plain is "the mountains of Israel." His longing gaze is directed towards the district of these mountains, they are his k&#803;ibla, i.e., the sight-point of his prayer, as of Daniel's, <a href="/daniel/6-11.htm">Daniel 6:11</a>. To render "from which my help cometh" (Luther) is inadmissible. &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; is an interrogative even in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/2-4.htm">Joshua 2:4</a>, where the question is an indirect one. The poet looks up to the mountains, the mountains of his native land, the holy mountains (<a href="/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>), when he longingly asks: whence will my help come? and to this question his longing desire itself returns the answer, that his help comes from no other quarter than from Jahve, the Maker of heaven and earth, from His who sits enthroned behind and upon these mountains, whose helpful power reaches to the remotest ends and corners of His creation, and with (&#1506;&#1501;) whom is help, i.e., both the willingness and the power to help, so that therefore help comes from nowhere but from (&#1502;&#1503;) Him alone. In <a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a> the poet has propounded a question, and in <a href="/psalms/121-2.htm">Psalm 121:2</a> replies to this question himself. In <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a> and further the answering one goes on speaking to the questioner. The poet is himself become objective, and his Ego, calm in God, promises him comfort, by unfolding to him the joyful prospects contained in that hope in Jahve. The subjective &#1488;&#1500; expresses a negative in both cases with an emotional rejection of that which is absolutely impossible. The poet says to himself: He will, indeed, surely not abandon thy foot to the tottering (&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1496;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-9.htm">Psalm 66:9</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>), thy Keeper will surely not slumber; and then confirms the assertion that this shall not come to pass by heightening the expression in accordance with the step-like character of the Psalm: Behold the Keeper of Israel slumbereth not and sleepeth not, i.e., He does not fall into slumber from weariness, and His life is not an alternate waking and sleeping. The eyes of His providence are ever open over Israel. </body></html>
