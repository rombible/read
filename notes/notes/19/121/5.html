Shall I depend upon the strength of the hills? upon princes and great men? No; my confidence is in God only. Or, we must lift up our eyes above the hills; we must look to God who makes all earthly things to us what they are. We must see all our help in God; from him we must expect it, in his own way and time. This psalm teaches us to comfort ourselves in the Lord, when difficulties and dangers are greatest. It is almighty wisdom that contrives, and almighty power that works the safety of those that put themselves under God's protection. He is a wakeful, watchful Keeper; he is never weary; he not only does not sleep, but he does not so much as slumber. Under this shade they may sit with delight and assurance. He is always near his people for their protection and refreshment. The right hand is the working hand; let them but turn to their duty, and they shall find God ready to give them success. He will take care that his people shall not fall. Thou shalt not be hurt, neither by the open assaults, nor by the secret attempts of thine enemies. The Lord shall prevent the evil thou fearest, and sanctify, remove, or lighten the evil thou feelest. He will preserve the soul, that it be not defiled by sin, and disturbed by affliction; he will preserve it from perishing eternally. He will keep thee in life and death; going out to thy labour in the morning of thy days, and coming home to thy rest when the evening of old age calls thee in. It is a protection for life. The Spirit, who is their Preserver and Comforter, shall abide with them for ever.

Perhaps the particular allusion to the right hand here may be that that was the place of a protector. He would thus be at hand, or would be ready to interpose in defense of him whom he was to guard. It is possible, however, that the idea here may be derived from the fact that in Scripture the geographer is represented as looking to the east, and not toward the north, as with us. Hence, the south is always spoken of as the right, or at the right hand (compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/89-12.htm">Psalm 89:12</a>); and as the intense rays of the sun are from the south, the idea may be, that God would be as a shade in the direction from which those burning rays came. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/121.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. upon thy right hand&#8212;a protector's place (Ps 109:31; 110:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/121.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy shade; </span> both to refresh thee and keep thee from the burning heat of the sun, as it is expressed in the next verse, and to protect thee by his power from all thine enemies; for which reason God is oft called a <span class="ital">shadow</span> in Scripture. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Upon thy right hand; </span> partly to uphold thy right hand, which is the chief instrument of action; and partly to defend thee in that place where thine enemies oppose thee; of which on <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/109-6.htm" title="Set you a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.">Psalm 109:6</a></span>.

This explains more fully who it is that keeps Israel and particular believers, and confirms the same; not a creature, but the Lord; the Word of the Lord, as the Targum, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7</a>, Christ, the Word and Wisdom of God; who is the keeper of his people by the designation of his Father, who has put them into his hands to be kept by him; and by their full will and consent, who commit the keeping of their souls to him; for which he is abundantly qualified, being able as the mighty God; faithful to him that has appointed him; tender and compassionate to those under his care, whom he keeps as the apple of his eye; and diligent and constant, for he keeps them night and day, lest any hurt them: he keeps them as they are his flock, made his care and charge; as they are the vineyard of the Lord of hosts; as they are a city, which, unless the Lord keeps, the watchmen watch in vain; as they are his body and members of it, and as they are his jewels and peculiar treasure: these he keeps in the love of God; in his own hands; in the covenant of grace; in an estate of grace; and in his own ways, safe to his kingdom and glory; <p>the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand; he is at the right hand of his people, to hold their right hand; to teach them to go, lead them into communion with himself, and hold them up safe; and to strengthen their right hand, assist them in working, without whom they can do nothing; and to counsel and direct them, and to protect and defend them against all their enemies. So a shadow signifies defence; see <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>; and such great personages are to others; in which sense Virgil (n) uses the word "shadow"; and much more true is this of God himself. And he is like the shadow of a great rock in a weary land; or of a spreading tree, which is a protection from heat, and very reviving and refreshing; see <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>. The allusion may be to the pillar of cloud by day, which guided and guarded the Israelites in the wilderness, and was a shadow from the heat, <a href="/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>; as Christ is from the heat of a fiery law, the flaming sword of justice, the wrath of God, and the fiery darts of Satan. <p>(n) "Et magnum reginae nomen obumbrat", Aeneid. l. xi. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/121.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/121.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">thy shade upon thy right hand</span>] ‘Shade’ seems simply to denote ‘protection’ generally, the idea of the metaphor being lost (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm" title="He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.">Psalm 91:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-9.htm" title="Only rebel not you against the LORD, neither fear you the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.">Numbers 14:9</a>); hence it can be joined with “upon thy right hand,” that being the usual position of the champion or protector (<a href="/psalms/16-8.htm" title="I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.">Psalm 16:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-31.htm" title="For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.">Psalm 109:31</a>).

With the shrill dissonance of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; the Psalm closes; and the cry for help with which it opens hovers over it, earnestly desiring its removal. </body></html>
