They did not do it from personal revenge or earthly politics, but in obedience to God's command. And the honour intended for all the saints of God, consists in their triumphs over the enemies of their salvation. Christ never intended his gospel should be spread by fire and sword, or his righteousness by the wrath of man. But let the high praises of God be in our mouths, while we wield the sword of the word of God, with the shield of faith, in warfare with the world, the flesh, and the devil. The saints shall be more than conquerors over the enemies of their souls, through the blood of the Lamb and the word of his testimony. The completing of this will be in the judgement of the great day. Then shall the judgement be executed. Behold Jesus, and his gospel church, chiefly in her millennial state. He and his people rejoice in each other; by their prayers and efforts they work with him, while he goes forth in the chariots of salvation, conquering sinners by grace, or in chariots of vengeance, to destroy his enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/149.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To execute upon them the judgment written - Either, that which is written in the law in general as what is threatened to wicked men; or, that which was written for their particular case, or which they were specifically commanded to do.

As it is an honor to be a magistrate, a judge, a sheriff, a constable, a commander of an army, an admiral in a navy, to execute the purposes of a government - an honor sought with great avidity among people as among the most valued distinctions of life - why should it be less honorable to execute the purposes of God? Are the objects which he seeks in his administration less important than those which are sought among people? Are his laws of less importance? Are his aims less pure? Is there less of justice, and equity, and benevolence in his plans?<p>(b) It is an honor which pertains to "all the saints" - to all who love and fear God - to be engaged in carrying out or executing his plans. In their own way, and in their own sphere - it may, indeed, be a very humble sphere - but each and all in their own sphere, are engaged in executing the purposes of God. In the duties of a family; in kindness to the poor; in the office of a teacher or a magistrate; in clearing a farm; in cultivating the land; in building a schoolhouse; in founding a church, a college, an asylum for the blind, the dumb, the lame, the insane; in contributing to send the gospel abroad over our own land, or among the pagan, or in going to carry that gospel to a benighted world - in some of these ways all who are truly the friends of God, or who are entitled to be enrolled among the "saints of the Lord" are, in fact, carrying out the purposes of the Lord - the "judgments written" to guide mankind; and man's highest honor here, as it will be in heaven, is to carry out the purposes of the Lord.<p>Praise ye the Lord - Hallelu-jah.

Such a new era has now dawned for the church of the saints, the Israel that has remained faithful to its God and the faith of its fathers. The Creator of Israel (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1493;, plural, with the plural suffix, like &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>, cf. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493; in <a href="/job/40-19.htm">Job 40:19</a>; according to Hupfeld and Hitzig, cf.

Therefore the church newly appropriated by its God and King is to celebrate Him, whose Name shines forth anew out of its history, with festive dance, timbrel, and cithern. For (as the occasion, hitherto only hinted at, is now expressly stated) Jahve takes a pleasure in His people; His wrath in comparison with His mercy is only like a swiftly passing moment (<a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>.). The futures that follow state that which is going on at the present time. &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; is, as frequently, a designation of the ecclesia pressa, which has hitherto, amidst patient endurance of suffering, waited for God's own act of redemption. He now adorns them with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, help against the victory over the hostile world; now the saints, hitherto enslaved and contemned, exult &#1489;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, in honour, or on account of the honour which vindicates them before the world and is anew bestowed upon them (&#1489;&#1468; of the reason, or, which is more probable in connection with the boldness of the expression, of the state and mood);<p>(Note: Such, too (with pomp, not "with an army"), is the meaning of &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; in 1 Macc. 10:60; 14:4, 5, vid., Grimm in loc.))<p>they shout for joy upon their beds, upon which they have hitherto poured forth their complaints over the present (cf. <a href="/hosea/7-14.htm">Hosea 7:14</a>), and ardently longed for a better future (<a href="/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>); for the bed is the place of soliloquy (<a href="/psalms/4-5.htm">Psalm 4:5</a>), and the tears shed there (<a href="/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>) are turned into shouts of joy in the case of Israel. </body></html>
