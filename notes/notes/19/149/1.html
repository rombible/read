Praise ye the Lord.<p><a href="/psalms/149-1.htm">Psalm 149:1</a><p>"Praise ye the Lord." Specially you, ye chosen people, whom he has made to be his saints. You have praised him aforetime, praise him yet again; yea, for ever praise him. With renewed zeal and fresh delight lift up your song unto Jehovah. "Sing unto the Lord a new song." Sing, for it is the fittest method for expressing reverent praise. Sing a hymn newly composed, for you have now a new knowledge of God. He is ever new in his manifestations; his mercies are new every morning; his deliverances are new in every night of sorrow; let your gratitude and thanksgivings be new also. It is well to repeat the old; it is more useful to invent the new. Novelty goes well with heartiness. Our singing should be "unto the Lord"; the songs we sing should be of him and to him, "for of him, and to him, and through him are all things." Among our novelties there should be new songs: alas! men are fonder of making new complaints than new Psalms. Our new songs should be devised in Jehovah's honour; indeed all our newest thoughts should run towards him. Never can we find a nobler subject for a song than the Lord, nor one more full of fresh matter for a new song, nor one which we are personally so much bound to sing as a new song "unto the Lord." "And his praise in the congregation of saints." Saints are precious, and a congregation of saints is a treasure house of jewels. God is in the midst of saints, and because of this we may well long to be among them. They are so full of his praise that we feel at home among them when we are ourselves full of praise. The sanctuary is the house of praise as well as the house of prayer. All saints praise God: they would not be saints if they did not. Their praise is sincere, suitable, seasonable, and acceptable. Personal praise is sweet unto God, but congregated praise has a multiplicity of sweetnesses in it. When holy ones meet, they adore the Holy One. Saints do not gather to amuse themselves with music, nor to extol one another, but to sing his praise whose saints they are. A congregation of saints is heaven upon earth: should not Jehovah, the Lord of saints, have all the praise that can come from such an assembly? Yet at times even saintly conclaves need to be stirred up to thanksgiving; for saints may be sad and apprehensive, and then their spirits require to be raised to a higher key, and stimulated to happier worship.<p><a href="/psalms/149-2.htm">Psalm 149:2</a><p>"Let Israel rejoice in him that made him." Here is that new creation which calls for the new song. It was Jehovah who made Israel to be Israel, and the tribes to become a great nation: therefore let the Founder of the nation be had in perpetual honour. Joy and rejoicing are evidently to be the special characteristics of the new song. The religion of the dead in sin is more apt to chant dirges than to sing hallelujahs; but when we are made new in the spirit of our minds we joy and rejoice in him that made us. Our joy is in our God and King: we choose no lower delight. "Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King." Those who had seen the tribes formed into a settled kingdom as well as into a united nation should rejoice. Israel is the nation, Zion is the capital of the kingdom, Israel rejoices in her Maker, Zion in her King. In the case of our God we who believe in him are as glad of his Government as we are of his Creation: his reign is as truly the making of us as was his divine power. The children of Israel are happy to be made a people; the children of Zion are equally happy to be ruled as a people. In every character our God is the source of joy to us: this verse issues a permit to our joy, yea it lays an injunction upon us to be glad in the Lord.<p><a href="/psalms/149-3.htm">Psalm 149:3</a><p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The scope and design of this Psalm is to stir up and encourage God’s people to praise him; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

But withal, the psalmist, or the Spirit of God, which dictated this Psalm to him, had a further prospect, even to the Messiah, of whom David was a type, and who was to succeed David in the throne, and to bring that kingdom to its highest perfection.

Here too &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, like &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/148-1.htm">Psalm 148:1</a>, is intended of the place whence the praise is to resound, and not according to <a href="/psalms/10-18.htm">Psalm 10:18</a> of earthly beings. The call is addressed in the first instance to the sea-monsters or dragons (<a href="/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>), i.e., as Pindar (Nem. iii. 23f.) expresses it, &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#836; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;'&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, and to the surging mass of waters (&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;) above and within the earth. Then to four phenomena of nature, coming down from heaven and ascending heavenwards, which are so arranged in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>, after the model of the chiasmus (crosswise position), that fire and smoke (&#1511;&#1496;&#1493;&#1512;), more especially of the mountains (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), hail and snow stand in reciprocal relation; and to the storm-wind (&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1505;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, an appositional construction, as in <a href="/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25</a>), which, beside a seeming freeness and untractableness, performs God's word. What is said of this last applies also to the fire, etc.; all these phenomena of nature are messengers and servants of God, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>. When the poet wishes that they all may join in concert with the rest of the creatures to the praise of God, he excepts the fact that they frequently become destructive powers executing judicial punishment, and only has before his mind their (more especially to the inhabitant of Palestine, to whom the opportunity of seeing hail, snow, and ice was more rare than with us, imposing) grandeur and their relatedness to the whole of creation, which is destined to glorify God and to be itself glorified. He next passes over to the mountains towering towards the skies and to all the heights of earth; to the fruit-trees, and to the cedars, the kings among the trees of the forest; to the wild beasts, which are called &#1495;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; because they represent the most active and powerful life in the animal world, and to all quadrupeds, which, more particularly the four-footed domestic animals, are called &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;; to the creeping things (&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;) which cleave to the ground as they move along; and to the birds, which are named with the descriptive epithet winged (&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-17.htm">Deuteronomy 4:17</a>, cf. <a href="/genesis/7-14.htm">Genesis 7:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17</a>, instead of &#1506;&#1493;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507;, <a href="/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>). And just as the call in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a> finds its centre of gravity, so to speak, at last in the soul of man, so here it is addressed finally to humanity, and that, because mankind lives in nations and is comprehended under the law of a state commonwealth, in the first instance to its heads: the kings of the earth, i.e., those who rule over the earth by countries, to the princes and all who have the administration of justice and are possessed of supreme power on the earth, then to men of both sexes and of every age.<p>All the beings mentioned from <a href="/psalms/148-1.htm">Psalm 148:1</a> onwards are to praise the Name of Jahve; for His Name, He (the God of this Name) alone (<a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a>) is &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;, so high that no name reaches up to Him, not even from afar; His glory (His glorious self-attestation) extends over earth and heaven (vid., <a href="/psalms/8-2.htm">Psalm 8:2</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, without our being able and obliged to decide which, introduces the matter and the ground of the praise; and the fact that the desire of the poet comprehends in &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; all the beings mentioned is seen from his saying "earth and heaven," as he glances back from the nearer things mentioned to those mentioned farther off (cf. <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>). In <a href="/psalms/148-14.htm">Psalm 148:14</a> the statement of the object and of the ground of the praise is continued. The motive from which the call to all creatures to Hallelujah proceeds, viz., the new mercy which God has shown towards His people, is also the final ground of the Hallelujah which is to sound forth; for the church of God on earth is the central-point of the universe, the aim of the history of the world, and the glorifying of this church is the turning-point for the transformation of the world. It is not to be rendered: He hath exalted the horn of His people, any more than in <a href="/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a> : I will make the horn of David to shoot forth. The horn in both instances is one such as the person named does not already possess, but which is given him (different from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>, <a href="/psalms/89-25.htm">Psalm 89:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/92-11.htm">Psalm 92:11</a>, and frequently). The Israel of the Exile had lost its horn, i.e., its comeliness and its defensive and offensive power. God has now given it a horn again, and that a high one, i.e., has helped Israel to attain again an independence among the nations that commands respect. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132.htm">Psalm 132</a>, where the horn is an object of the promise, we might directly understand by it the Branch (Zemach). Here, where the poet speaks out of his own present age, this is at least not the meaning which he associates with the words. What now follows is an apposition to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;: He has raised up a horn for His people - praise (we say: to the praise of; cf. the New Testament &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) to all His saints, the children of Israel, the people who stand near Him. Others, as Hengstenberg, take &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; as a second object, but we cannot say &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;. Israel is called &#1506;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;, the people of His near  equals  of His nearness or vicinity (Kster), as Jerusalem is called in <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:10</a> &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; instead of &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; (Ew. 287, a, b). It might also be said, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>, &#1506;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;, the nation of those who are near to Him (as the Targum renders it). In both instances &#1506;&#1501; is the governing noun, as, too, surely &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is in &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; ni, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>, which need not signify, by going back to the abstract primary signification of &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;, a man of my near fellowship, but can also signify a man of my neighbour, i.e., my nearest man, according to Ew. loc. cit. (cf. above on <a href="/psalms/145-10.htm">Psalm 145:10</a>). As a rule, the principal form of &#1506;&#1501; is pointed &#1506;&#1501;; and it is all the more unnecessary, with Olshausen and Hupfeld, to take the construction as adjectival for &#1506;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1500;&#1493;. It might, with Hitzig after Aben-Ezra, be more readily regarded as appositional (to a people, His near, i.e., standing near to Him). We have here an example of the genitival subordination, which is very extensive in Hebrew, instead of an appositional co-ordination: populo propinqui sui, in connection with which propinqui may be referred back to propinquum  equals  propinquitas, but also to propinquus (literally: a people of the kind of one that is near to Him). Thus is Israel styled in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>. In the consciousness of the dignity which lies in this name, the nation of the God of the history of salvation comes forward in this Psalm as the leader (choragus) of all creatures, and strikes up a Hallelujah that is to be followed by heaven and earth. </body></html>
