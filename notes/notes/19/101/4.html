It is also applicable to private families, and is the householder's psalm. It teaches all that have any power, whether more or less, to use it so as to be a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to them that do well. The chosen subject of the psalm is God's mercy and judgment. The Lord's providences concerning his people are commonly mixed; mercy and judgment. God has set the one over against the other, both to do good, like showers and sunshine. When, in his providence, he exercises us with the mixture of mercy and judgment, we must make suitable acknowledgments to him for both. Family mercies and family afflictions are both calls to family religion. Those who are in public stations are not thereby excused from care in governing their families; they are the more concerned to set a good example of ruling their own houses well. Whenever a man has a house of his own, let him seek to have God to dwell with him; and those may expect his presence, who walk with a perfect heart, in a perfect way. David resolves to practise no evil himself. He further resolves not to keep bad servants, nor to employ those about him that are wicked. He will not admit them into his family, lest they spread the infection of sin. A froward heart, one that delights to be cross and perverse, is not fit for society, the bond of which is Christian love. Nor will he countenance slanderers, those who take pleasure in wounding their neighbour's reputation. Also, God resists the proud, and false, deceitful people, who scruple not to tell lies, or commit frauds. Let every one be zealous and diligent to reform his own heart and ways, and to do this early; ever mindful of that future, most awful morning, when the King of righteousness shall cut off all wicked doers from the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/101.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A froward heart shall depart from me - The word here rendered froward means perverse, false, deceitful, depraved. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>. The "idea" here is that of one who is inclined to evil; who has some wrong passion or inclination to indulge; who has an obstinate and perverse will; who does not listen to reason or the voice of wise persuasion; who will do wrong, despite all the means which may be employed to induce him to do right. The language may either refer to the author of the psalm himself, as regulating his own conduct; or it may refer to those in his employ. In the former sense, it would mean that he would not himself be perverse and froward; in the latter sense, that he would not have such persons in his employ. The connection seems to require that we should understand it in the latter sense, as referring to the class of persons that the psalmist would have about him.<p>I will not know a wicked person - I will not countenance such a one; I will not recognize such a one among those who are admitted into my house, or own him as my friend; or, I will not have such in my employ. Probably the language embraces both these ideas - as it should in the case of all who are at the head of a family:<p>(a) I will not countenance or recognize as among my friends, who are to be admitted to my fireside and family, and who are to be familiar with me and my children, those who are profligate, wicked, and unprincipled, whatever may be their rank, their wealth, their accomplishments, their fascination of manner, or their power of conversation;<p>(b) I will have in my employ no one who is not honest, temperate, virtuous, pure. The welfare of a family depends more on the former of these things than the latter; no family can be well ordered where both are not found. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/101.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

The first verse, without any parallelism and in so far monostichic, is like the signal for a blowing of the trumpets. Instead of "serve Jahve with gladness (&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1492;)," it is expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-11.htm">Psalm 2:11</a>, "serve Jahve with fear (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;)." Fear and joy do not exclude one another. Fear becomes the exalted Lord, and the holy gravity of His requirements; joy becomes the gracious Lord, and His blessed service. The summons to manifest this joy in a religious, festive manner springs up out of an all-hopeful, world-embracing love, and this love is the spontaneous result of living faith in the promise that all tribes of the earth shall be blessed in the seed of Abraham, and in the prophecies in which this promise is unfolded. &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (as in <a href="/psalms/4-4.htm">Psalm 4:4</a>) Theodoret well interprets &#x3b4;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. They are to know from facts of outward and inward experience that Jahve is God: He hath made us, and not we ourselves. Thus runs the Cheth&#x3be;b, which the lxx follows, &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; (as also the Syriac and Vulgate); but Symmachus (like Rashi), contrary to all possibilities of language, renders &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;. Even the Midrash (Bereshith Rabba, ch. c. init.) finds in this confession the reverse of the arrogant words in the mouth of Pharaoh: "I myself have made myself" (<a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>). The Ker, on the other hand, reads &#1500;&#1493;,<p>(Note: According to the reckoning of the Masora, there are fifteen passages in the Old Testament in which &#1500;&#1488; is written and &#1500;&#1493; is read, viz., <a href="/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-21.htm">Leviticus 11:21</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-30.htm">Leviticus 25:30</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-18.htm">2 Samuel 16:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-10.htm">2 Kings 8:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>; <a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a> cf. the note there, <a href="/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/19-7.htm">Proverbs 19:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/26-2.htm">Proverbs 26:2</a>; <a href="/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>.

Hengstenberg calls this Ker quite unsuitable and bad; and Hupfeld, on the other hand, calls the Chethb an "unspeakable insipidity." But in reality both readings accord with the context, and it is clear that they are both in harmony with Scripture. Many a one has drawn balsamic consolation from the words ipse fecit nos et non ipsi nos; e.g., Melancthon when disconsolately sorrowful over the body of his son in Dresden on the 12th July 1559. But in ipse fecit nos et ipsius nos sumus there is also a rich mine of comfort and of admonition, for the Creator of also the Owner, His heart clings to His creature, and the creature owes itself entirely to Him, without whom it would not have had a being, and would not continue in being. Since, however, the parallel passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>, favours &#1493;&#1500;&#1493; rather than &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;; since, further, &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; ,reh is the easier reading, inasmuch as &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; leads one to expect that an antithesis will follow (Hitzig); and since the "His people and the sheep of His pasture" that follows is a more natural continuation of a preceding &#1493;&#1500;&#1493; &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493; than that it should be attached as a predicative object to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; over a parenthetical &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;: the Ker decidedly maintains the preference. In connection with both readings, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; has a sense related to the history of redemption, as in <a href="/1_samuel/12-6.htm">1 Samuel 12:6</a>. Israel is Jahve's work (&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;), <a href="/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>, not merely as a people, but as the people of God, who were kept in view even in the calling of Abram. </body></html>
