He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls as the sand of the sea. </span>“This,” he thinks, “may truly be called a kind of <span class="ital">spontaneous shower; </span>as both the manna and the quails offered themselves to their hands without any pains or labour in the people to procure them. By this shower, says the sacred writer, thou didst confirm thine inheritance, (see <a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm" title="For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>;) that is, didst recruit and refresh thy people; for they greatly needed it, as they were <span class="ital">weary; </span>that is, tired, and almost worn out with hunger, the hardships of which they bore with great impatience and murmuring.” There is, however, one great objection to this interpretation of the passage. It does not seem to comport with the next verse, which speaks of the congregation of Israel as dwelling in the inheritance refreshed by this rain, which inheritance was certainly the land of Canaan. In this they had dwelt for many ages when David wrote this Psalm, and though they had sometimes been chastised with drought, yet they had often witnessed the descent of abundant rains upon their country, which were the more necessary and desirable, because it was hilly and of a dry soil, and not watered, like Egypt, by the overflowings of a great river. See <a href="/context/deuteronomy/11-10.htm" title="For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from from where you came out, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs:...">Deuteronomy 11:10-11</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>68:7-14 Fresh mercies should put us in mind of former mercies. If God bring his people into a wilderness, he will be sure to go before them in it, and to bring them out of it. He provided for them, both in the wilderness and in Canaan. The daily manna seems here meant. And it looks to the spiritual provision for God's Israel. The Spirit of grace and the gospel of grace are the plentiful rain, with which God confirms his inheritance, and from which their fruit is found. Christ shall come as showers that water the earth. The account of Israel's victories is to be applied to the victories over death and hell, by the exalted Redeemer, for those that are his. Israel in Egypt among the kilns appeared wretched, but possessed of Canaan, during the reigns of David and Solomon, appeared glorious. Thus the slaves of Satan, when converted to Christ, when justified and sanctified by him, look honourable. When they reach heaven, all remains of their sinful state disappear, they shall be as the wings of the dove, covered with silver, and her feathers as gold. Full salvation will render those white as snow, who were vile and loathsome through the guilt and defilement of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/68.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain - Margin, shake out. Prof. Alexander, "a rain of free gifts." The Septuagint and the Vulgate render it, "a voluntary or willing rain." The Syriac, "the rain of a vow." The Hebrew word translated "plentiful" means free, voluntary, of its own accord - &#1504;&#1491;&#1489;&#1492;  neda&#770;ba&#770;h - (See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-12.htm">Psalm 51:12</a>, where it is rendered free); then it means that which is given freely; and hence, abundantly. It means, therefore, in this place, plentiful, abundant. The reference, however, is to the manna, with which the people were supplied from day to day, and which seemed to be showered upon them in abundance. The word rendered "didst send" means properly to shake out, as if God shook the clouds or the heavens, and the abundant supplies for their needs were thus shaken out.<p>Whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary - Thou didst strengthen thy people when they were exhausted, or were in danger of fainting. In other words, God sent a supply of food - manna, quails, etc. - when they were in the pathless wilderness, and when they were ready to perish. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/68.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10. a plentiful rain&#8212;a rain of gifts, as manna and quails.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/68.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Send a plentiful rain; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The Spirit of God is a free Spirit; and, where he is, there is liberty, in the exercise of grace, and in the discharge of duty. Or else the ministration of the Gospel (t) is meant; which is compared to rain, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>. This, especially in the first times of the Gospel, was a very large and plentiful one; it being sent all over the world, and brought forth fruit in every place: this was also a "liberal" one, flowed from the free grace of God; the subject of it is free grace; and the tendency and effect of it are, to make men free from the bondage of the law, and the spirit of bondage which that induces. The Targum is, <p>"thou hast let down the dews of quickening, and the rains of good pleasure;'' <p>grace, or free favour; <p>whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance when it was weary; that is, the church, as the Targum explains it; the inheritance of Christ, which he has chosen, the Father has given him, and he possesses: the people of God, "weary" with the burdensome rites and ceremonies of the law; with their own sins and corruptions, a burden too heavy for them to bear; with the sins of others, among whom they dwell; with the temptations of Satan, with which they are annoyed; with the persecutions of the men of the world, which make them weary sometimes, and faint in their minds; and with the common afflictions of life, which often make them weary of life itself. Now, by the plentiful ministration of the doctrines of the Gospel, accompanied with the Spirit and grace of God, the hearts of the Lord's people are refreshed, as the weary, dry, and thirsty land, is with a comfortable shower of rain; and by it weary souls have rest, or at least are directed by it to Christ, where they find it: and as the earth is "prepared" (u), as the word used signifies, by rain, for the nourishment of plants; so is the church by the Gospel, whose plants are an orchard of pomegranates, for the reviving and fructifying of those who are planted in it; whereby they appear to be trees of righteousness, and the planting of the Lord; and so are confirmed, settled, and established in the house of God, and in the truths of the Gospel. <p>(s)  "pluviam munificentiarum", Montanus; "vel liberalitatum", Vatablus, Gejerus, Michaelis; so Ainsworth; to the same purpose the Tigurine version, Cocceius, Junius &amp; Tremellius.

Like smoke, wax (&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1490;, root &#1491;&#1490;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;, Sanscrit tak, to shoot past, to run, Zend tak&#769;, whence vitak&#769;ina, dissolving, Neo-Persic guda&#770;chten; causative: to cause to run in different directions  equals  to melt or smelt) is an emblem of human feebleness. As Bakiuds observes, Si creatura creaturam non fert, quomodo creatura creatoris indignantis faciem ferre possit? The wish expressed in <a href="/psalms/68-4.htm">Psalm 68:4</a> forms the obverse of the preceding. The expressions for joy are heaped up in order to describe the transcendency of the joy that will follow the release from the yoke of the enemy. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; is expressively used in alternation with &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/68-3.htm">Psalm 68:3</a> : by the wrathful action, so to speak, that proceeds from His countenance just as the heat radiating from the fire melts the wax the foes are dispersed, whereas the righteous rejoice before His gracious countenance.<p>As the result of the challenge that has been now expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2-4</a>, Elohim, going before His people, begins His march; and in <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a> an appeal is made to praise Him with song, His name with the music of stringed instrument, and to make a way along which He may ride &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;. In view of <a href="/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a> we cannot take &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, as do the Targum and Talmud (B. Chagiga 12b), as a name of one of the seven heavens, a meaning to which, apart from other considerations, the verb &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, to be effaced, confused, dark, is not an appropriate stem-word; but it must be explained according to <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. There Jahve calls in the aid of His people, here He goes forth at the head of His people; He rides through the steppes in order to right against the enemies of His people. Not merely the historical reference assigned to the Psalm by Hitzig, but also the one adopted by ourselves, admits of allusion being made to the "steppes of Moab;" for the way to Mdeb, where the Syrian mercenaries of the Ammonites had encamped (<a href="/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>), lay through these steppes, and also the way to Rabbath Ammon (<a href="/2_samuel/10-7.htm">2 Samuel 10:7</a>.). &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; calls upon them to make a way for Him, the glorious, invincible King (cf. <a href="/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>); &#1505;&#1500;&#1500; signifies to cast up, heap up or pave, viz., a raised and suitable street or highway, Symmachus katastroo'sate. He who thus rides along makes the salvation of His people His aim: " is His name, therefore shout with joy before Him." The Beth in &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; (Symmachus, Quinta: &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b1;) is the Beth essentiae, which here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>, stands beside the subject: His name is (exists) in &#1497;&#1492;, i.e., His essential name is yh, His self-attestation, by which He makes Himself capable of being known and named, consists in His being the God of salvation, who, in the might of free grace, pervades all history. This Name is a fountain of exultant rejoicing to His people.<p>This Name is exemplificatively unfolded in <a href="/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>. The highly exalted One, who sits enthroned in the heaven of glory, rules in all history here below and takes an interest in the lowliest more especially, in all circumstances of their lives following after His own to succour them. He takes the place of a father to the orphan. He takes up the cause of the widow and contests it to a successful issue. Elohim is one who makes the solitary or isolated to dwell in the house; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; with He locale, which just as well answers the question where? as whither? &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, a house  equals  family bond, is the opposite of &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;, solitarius, recluse, <a href="/psalms/25-16.htm">Psalm 25:16</a>. Dachselt correctly renders it, in domum, h.e. familiam numerosam durabilemque eos ut patres-familias plantabit. He is further One who brings forth (out of the dungeon and out of captivity) those who are chained into abundance of prosperity. &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, occurring only here, is a pluralet. from &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; morf .tela, synonym &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, to be straight, fortunate. <a href="/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a> briefly and sharply expresses the reverse side of this His humanely condescending rule among mankind. &#1488;&#1498; is here (cf. <a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>) restrictive or adversative (as is more frequently the case with &#1488;&#1499;&#1503;); and the preterite is the preterite of that which is an actual matter of experience. The &#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., (not from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, the apostate ones, Aquila afista'menoi, but as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-7.htm">Psalm 66:7</a>, from &#1505;&#1512;&#1512;) the rebellious, Symmachus &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, who were not willing to submit to the rule of so gracious a God, had ever been excluded from these proofs of favour. These must inhabit &#1510;&#1495;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; (accusative of the object), a sun-scorched land; from &#1510;&#1495;&#1495;, to be dazzlingly bright, sunny, dried or parched up. They remain in the desert without coming into the land, which, fertilized by the waters of grace, is resplendent with a fresh verdure and with rich fruits. If the poet has before his mind in connection with this the bulk of the people delivered out of Egypt, &#x3c9;&#788;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9; (<a href="/hebrews/3-17.htm">Hebrews 3:17</a>), then the transition to what follows is much more easily effected. There is, however, no necessity for any such intermediation. The poet had the march through the desert to Canaan under the guidance of Jahve, the irresistible Conqueror, in his mind even from the beginning, and now he expressly calls to mind that marvellous divine leading in order that the present age may take heart thereat.</body></html>
