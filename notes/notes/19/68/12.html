If God bring his people into a wilderness, he will be sure to go before them in it, and to bring them out of it. He provided for them, both in the wilderness and in Canaan. The daily manna seems here meant. And it looks to the spiritual provision for God's Israel. The Spirit of grace and the gospel of grace are the plentiful rain, with which God confirms his inheritance, and from which their fruit is found. Christ shall come as showers that water the earth. The account of Israel's victories is to be applied to the victories over death and hell, by the exalted Redeemer, for those that are his. Israel in Egypt among the kilns appeared wretched, but possessed of Canaan, during the reigns of David and Solomon, appeared glorious. Thus the slaves of Satan, when converted to Christ, when justified and sanctified by him, look honourable. When they reach heaven, all remains of their sinful state disappear, they shall be as the wings of the dove, covered with silver, and her feathers as gold.

This is the Hebrew mode of expressing that which is emphatic or superlative. It is by simply repeating the word. The idea is, that they fled speedily; they fled at once, and in alarm. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-12.htm">Psalm 68:12-13</a> are marked by DeWette as a quotation, and the language is supposed by him to be the substance of the song that was sung by the women as referred to in <a href="/psalms/68-11.htm">Psalm 68:11</a>. This supposition is not improbable. The reference is, undoubtedly, to the former victories achieved by the people of God when they went out to war; and the idea is, that when the command came, when God gave the word <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-11.htm">Psalm 68:11</a>, their foes fled in consternation.<p>And she that tarried at home divided the spoil - The women remaining in their homes, while the men went out to war. On them devolved the office of dividing the plunder, and of giving the proper portions to each of the victors. They would take an interest in the battle, and receive the booty, and assign the portion due to each of the brave soldiers - the more acceptable as given to them by female hands. Possibly, however, the meaning may be, that the victors would bring the plunder home, and lay it at the feet of their wives and daughters to be divided among the women themselves. The dividing of the spoils of battle after a victory was always an important act.

Or "they fled, they fled" (y); or "they flee, they flee". This is either the subject matter of the word "published", the words of the publishers so saying; or the effect of the publication of the Gospel: for though some, by these kings of armies, understand the apostles either fleeing from place to place because of persecution, or running to and fro, as they interpret the words, to spread the Gospel; yet they rather intend the enemies of the Gospel, and the chief of them that opposed themselves to it; namely, Roman emperors and kings, and who fled before it; particularly at the time of the downfall of Paganism, when they fled to the mountains and hills, and called upon them to hide them from Christ, <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15</a>; <p>and she that tarried at home divided the spoil; the church, compared to a woman that keeps at home, <a href="//biblehub.com/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>, who shared in the spoils token out of the hands of Satan, and from among the Gentiles, even converted souls, brought unto her.

Ewald and Hitzig take &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; hypothetically: If God arise, He enemies will be scattered. This rendering is possible in itself so far as the syntax is concerned, but here everything conspires against it; for the futures in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2-4</a> form an unbroken chain; then a glance at the course of the Psalm from Psa 68:20 onwards shows that the circumstances of Israel, under which the poet writes, urged forth the wish: let God arise and humble His foes; and finally the primary passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>, makes it clear that the futures are the language of prayer transformed into the form of the wish. In <a href="/psalms/68-3.htm">Psalm 68:3</a> the wish is addressed directly to God Himself, and therefore becomes petition. &#1492;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; is inflected (as vice vers&#1490; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1507;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>, from &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507;) from &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1491;&#1507; (like &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1503;, <a href="/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>); it is a violation of all rule in favour of the conformity of sound (cf. &#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/14-43.htm">Leviticus 14:43</a>, and supra on <a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>) with &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507;, the object of which is easily supplied (dispellas, sc. hostes tuos), and is purposely omitted in order to direct attention more stedfastly to the omnipotence which to every creature is so irresistible. Like smoke, wax (&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1490;, root &#1491;&#1490;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;, Sanscrit tak, to shoot past, to run, Zend tak&#769;, whence vitak&#769;ina, dissolving, Neo-Persic guda&#770;chten; causative: to cause to run in different directions  equals  to melt or smelt) is an emblem of human feebleness. As Bakiuds observes, Si creatura creaturam non fert, quomodo creatura creatoris indignantis faciem ferre possit? The wish expressed in <a href="/psalms/68-4.htm">Psalm 68:4</a> forms the obverse of the preceding. The expressions for joy are heaped up in order to describe the transcendency of the joy that will follow the release from the yoke of the enemy. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; is expressively used in alternation with &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/68-3.htm">Psalm 68:3</a> : by the wrathful action, so to speak, that proceeds from His countenance just as the heat radiating from the fire melts the wax the foes are dispersed, whereas the righteous rejoice before His gracious countenance.<p>As the result of the challenge that has been now expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2-4</a>, Elohim, going before His people, begins His march; and in <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a> an appeal is made to praise Him with song, His name with the music of stringed instrument, and to make a way along which He may ride &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;. In view of <a href="/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a> we cannot take &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, as do the Targum and Talmud (B. Chagiga 12b), as a name of one of the seven heavens, a meaning to which, apart from other considerations, the verb &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, to be effaced, confused, dark, is not an appropriate stem-word; but it must be explained according to <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. There Jahve calls in the aid of His people, here He goes forth at the head of His people; He rides through the steppes in order to right against the enemies of His people. Not merely the historical reference assigned to the Psalm by Hitzig, but also the one adopted by ourselves, admits of allusion being made to the "steppes of Moab;" for the way to Mdeb, where the Syrian mercenaries of the Ammonites had encamped (<a href="/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>), lay through these steppes, and also the way to Rabbath Ammon (<a href="/2_samuel/10-7.htm">2 Samuel 10:7</a>.). &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; calls upon them to make a way for Him, the glorious, invincible King (cf. <a href="/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>); &#1505;&#1500;&#1500; signifies to cast up, heap up or pave, viz., a raised and suitable street or highway, Symmachus katastroo'sate. He who thus rides along makes the salvation of His people His aim: " is His name, therefore shout with joy before Him." The Beth in &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; (Symmachus, Quinta: &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b1;) is the Beth essentiae, which here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>, stands beside the subject: His name is (exists) in &#1497;&#1492;, i.e., His essential name is yh, His self-attestation, by which He makes Himself capable of being known and named, consists in His being the God of salvation, who, in the might of free grace, pervades all history. This Name is a fountain of exultant rejoicing to His people.<p>This Name is exemplificatively unfolded in <a href="/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>. The highly exalted One, who sits enthroned in the heaven of glory, rules in all history here below and takes an interest in the lowliest more especially, in all circumstances of their lives following after His own to succour them. He takes the place of a father to the orphan. He takes up the cause of the widow and contests it to a successful issue. Elohim is one who makes the solitary or isolated to dwell in the house; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; with He locale, which just as well answers the question where? as whither? &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, a house  equals  family bond, is the opposite of &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;, solitarius, recluse, <a href="/psalms/25-16.htm">Psalm 25:16</a>. Dachselt correctly renders it, in domum, h.e. familiam numerosam durabilemque eos ut patres-familias plantabit.
