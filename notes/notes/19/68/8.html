If God bring his people into a wilderness, he will be sure to go before them in it, and to bring them out of it. He provided for them, both in the wilderness and in Canaan. The daily manna seems here meant. And it looks to the spiritual provision for God's Israel. The Spirit of grace and the gospel of grace are the plentiful rain, with which God confirms his inheritance, and from which their fruit is found. Christ shall come as showers that water the earth. The account of Israel's victories is to be applied to the victories over death and hell, by the exalted Redeemer, for those that are his. Israel in Egypt among the kilns appeared wretched, but possessed of Canaan, during the reigns of David and Solomon, appeared glorious. Thus the slaves of Satan, when converted to Christ, when justified and sanctified by him, look honourable. When they reach heaven, all remains of their sinful state disappear, they shall be as the wings of the dove, covered with silver, and her feathers as gold. Full salvation will render those white as snow, who were vile and loathsome through the guilt and defilement of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/68.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The earth shook - See <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-18</a>.<p>The heavens also dropped at the presence of God - That is, dropped down rain and food. The idea is that the very heavens seemed to be shaken or convulsed, so that rain and food were shaken down - as ripe fruit falls from a tree that is shaken. Compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>. So also, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1-3</a>. The meaning is not that the heavens themselves dropped down, but that they dropped or distilled rain and food.<p>Even Sinai itself was moved - This was true; but this does not seem to be the idea intended here, for the words "even" and "was moved" are not in the original. The Hebrew is, literally, "This Sinai;" meaning probably" this was at Sinai," or, "this took place at Sinai." The correct translation perhaps would be, "The heavens distilled rain at the presence of God, this at Sinai, at the presence of God."<p>At the presence of God, the God of Israel - The whole region seemed to be moved and awed at the presence of God, or when he came down to visit his people.

Ewald and Hitzig take &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; hypothetically: If God arise, He enemies will be scattered. This rendering is possible in itself so far as the syntax is concerned, but here everything conspires against it; for the futures in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2-4</a> form an unbroken chain; then a glance at the course of the Psalm from Psa 68:20 onwards shows that the circumstances of Israel, under which the poet writes, urged forth the wish: let God arise and humble His foes; and finally the primary passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>, makes it clear that the futures are the language of prayer transformed into the form of the wish. In <a href="/psalms/68-3.htm">Psalm 68:3</a> the wish is addressed directly to God Himself, and therefore becomes petition. &#1492;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; is inflected (as vice vers&#1490; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1507;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>, from &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507;) from &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1491;&#1507; (like &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1503;, <a href="/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>); it is a violation of all rule in favour of the conformity of sound (cf. &#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/14-43.htm">Leviticus 14:43</a>, and supra on <a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>) with &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507;, the object of which is easily supplied (dispellas, sc. hostes tuos), and is purposely omitted in order to direct attention more stedfastly to the omnipotence which to every creature is so irresistible. Like smoke, wax (&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1490;, root &#1491;&#1490;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;, Sanscrit tak, to shoot past, to run, Zend tak&#769;, whence vitak&#769;ina, dissolving, Neo-Persic guda&#770;chten; causative: to cause to run in different directions  equals  to melt or smelt) is an emblem of human feebleness. As Bakiuds observes, Si creatura creaturam non fert, quomodo creatura creatoris indignantis faciem ferre possit? The wish expressed in <a href="/psalms/68-4.htm">Psalm 68:4</a> forms the obverse of the preceding. The expressions for joy are heaped up in order to describe the transcendency of the joy that will follow the release from the yoke of the enemy. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; is expressively used in alternation with &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/68-3.htm">Psalm 68:3</a> : by the wrathful action, so to speak, that proceeds from His countenance just as the heat radiating from the fire melts the wax the foes are dispersed, whereas the righteous rejoice before His gracious countenance.<p>As the result of the challenge that has been now expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2-4</a>, Elohim, going before His people, begins His march; and in <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a> an appeal is made to praise Him with song, His name with the music of stringed instrument, and to make a way along which He may ride &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;. In view of <a href="/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a> we cannot take &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, as do the Targum and Talmud (B. Chagiga 12b), as a name of one of the seven heavens, a meaning to which, apart from other considerations, the verb &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, to be effaced, confused, dark, is not an appropriate stem-word; but it must be explained according to <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. There Jahve calls in the aid of His people, here He goes forth at the head of His people; He rides through the steppes in order to right against the enemies of His people. Not merely the historical reference assigned to the Psalm by Hitzig, but also the one adopted by ourselves, admits of allusion being made to the "steppes of Moab;" for the way to Mdeb, where the Syrian mercenaries of the Ammonites had encamped (<a href="/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>), lay through these steppes, and also the way to Rabbath Ammon (<a href="/2_samuel/10-7.htm">2 Samuel 10:7</a>.). &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; calls upon them to make a way for Him, the glorious, invincible King (cf. <a href="/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>); &#1505;&#1500;&#1500; signifies to cast up, heap up or pave, viz., a raised and suitable street or highway, Symmachus katastroo'sate. He who thus rides along makes the salvation of His people His aim: " is His name, therefore shout with joy before Him." The Beth in &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; (Symmachus, Quinta: &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b1;) is the Beth essentiae, which here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>, stands beside the subject: His name is (exists) in &#1497;&#1492;, i.e., His essential name is yh, His self-attestation, by which He makes Himself capable of being known and named, consists in His being the God of salvation, who, in the might of free grace, pervades all history. This Name is a fountain of exultant rejoicing to His people.<p>This Name is exemplificatively unfolded in <a href="/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>. The highly exalted One, who sits enthroned in the heaven of glory, rules in all history here below and takes an interest in the lowliest more especially, in all circumstances of their lives following after His own to succour them. He takes the place of a father to the orphan. He takes up the cause of the widow and contests it to a successful issue. Elohim is one who makes the solitary or isolated to dwell in the house; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; with He locale, which just as well answers the question where? as whither? &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, a house  equals  family bond, is the opposite of &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;, solitarius, recluse, <a href="/psalms/25-16.htm">Psalm 25:16</a>. Dachselt correctly renders it, in domum, h.e. familiam numerosam durabilemque eos ut patres-familias plantabit. He is further One who brings forth (out of the dungeon and out of captivity) those who are chained into abundance of prosperity. &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, occurring only here, is a pluralet. from &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; morf .tela, synonym &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, to be straight, fortunate. <a href="/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a> briefly and sharply expresses the reverse side of this His humanely condescending rule among mankind. &#1488;&#1498; is here (cf. <a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>) restrictive or adversative (as is more frequently the case with &#1488;&#1499;&#1503;); and the preterite is the preterite of that which is an actual matter of experience. The &#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., (not from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, the apostate ones, Aquila afista'menoi, but as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-7.htm">Psalm 66:7</a>, from &#1505;&#1512;&#1512;) the rebellious, Symmachus &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, who were not willing to submit to the rule of so gracious a God, had ever been excluded from these proofs of favour. These must inhabit &#1510;&#1495;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; (accusative of the object), a sun-scorched land; from &#1510;&#1495;&#1495;, to be dazzlingly bright, sunny, dried or parched up. They remain in the desert without coming into the land, which, fertilized by the waters of grace, is resplendent with a fresh verdure and with rich fruits. If the poet has before his mind in connection with this the bulk of the people delivered out of Egypt, &#x3c9;&#788;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9; (<a href="/hebrews/3-17.htm">Hebrews 3:17</a>), then the transition to what follows is much more easily effected. There is, however, no necessity for any such intermediation. The poet had the march through the desert to Canaan under the guidance of Jahve, the irresistible Conqueror, in his mind even from the beginning, and now he expressly calls to mind that marvellous divine leading in order that the present age may take heart thereat.</body></html>
