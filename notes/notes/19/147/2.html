It is comely; it becomes us as reasonable creatures, much more as people in covenant with God. He gathers outcast sinners by his grace, and will bring them into his holy habitation. To those whom God heals with the consolations of his Spirit, he speaks peace, assures them their sins are pardoned. And for this, let others praise him also. Man's knowledge is soon ended; but God's knowledge is a dept that can never be fathomed. And while he telleth the number of the stars, he condescends to hear the broken-hearted sinner. While he feeds the young ravens, he will not leave his praying people destitute. Clouds look dull and melancholy, yet without them we could have no rain, therefore no fruit. Thus afflictions look black and unpleasant; but from clouds of affliction come showers that make the soul to yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness. The psalmist delights not in things wherein sinners trust and glory; but a serious and suitable regard to God is, in his sight, of very great price. We are not to be in doubt between hope and fear, but to act under the gracious influences of hope and fear united.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/147.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord doth build up Jerusalem - He builds up the walls; he restores the city; he has caused the temple to be reconstructed. This language would be applicable to a return from the captivity. There may be an allusion here to the language in <a href="/psalms/102-16.htm">Psalm 102:16</a> : "When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory." See the notes at that passage. What is there spoken of as what would be in the future is here spoken of as accomplished, and as a ground of praise.<p>He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel - Those who have been exiled from their native land, and who have been scattered as outcasts in a foreign country. This is appropriate language to use on the supposition that the psalm was composed after the return from the exile, for it is in such language that that return was predicted by the prophets. <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a> : "and he shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah," etc. <a href="/isaiah/56-8.htm">Isaiah 56:8</a> : "the Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel," etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/147.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Literally, after the Babylonish captivity, according to some; or rather when taken from the Jebusites by David; or spiritually the church, which is often called Jerusalem, even the Gospel church, of which Christ is the builder, his ministers are instruments, his people are the materials, and which, though now greatly fallen to decay, will be rebuilt by him in the latter day; when his work will be revived among his saints, his Gospel more powerfully preached, his ordinances more purely administered, and multitudes of souls converted; and which will be matter of praise and thanksgiving, as it is now matter of prayer; see <a href="/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>; <p>he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel; the exiles from Babylon, as some; or rather such who in the times of the judges had been carried captive by their neighbours, or fled from their cities, in the times of Saul for fear of the Philistines, and who were gathered to their own country, cities, and houses, when David began to reign. Spiritually this regards the whole Israel of God, the elect of God, whether Jews or Gentiles, and the outcasts of them; so called, not because ever cast out or cast off by the Lord, being received into his favour, covenant, and church; but either because cast out of the company of profane men, as evil and unworthy; or cast out of Israel, the church of God, very justly, for offences given; but, being brought to repentance, are restored and gathered in again: or rather this may represent the Lord's people as in a state of nature, like the wretched infant cast out into the open field, scattered up and down in the world, in a state of distance from God, Christ, and his people; these are gathered by Christ in redemption, who came to seek and collect them together; and by his spirit in conversion, when he gathers them to himself, and into his fold; and this, as it is an occasion of joy to angels and saints, is matter of praise and thanksgiving to the outcasts themselves, thus gathered in.

The rebuilding of Jerusalem after the return from the Babylonish captivity covered a space of above ninety years, from  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> till  <span class="date">B.C. 445</span>. First the temple was built (B.C. 533-515); then the city; finally, the walls and the gates ( <span class="date">B.C. 445</span>). It was in connection with this last portion of the building that the present psalm seems to have been written. <span class="cmt_word">He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.</span> The exiles returned gradually - some with Zerubbabel ( <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>); some with Ezra, in  <span class="date">B.C. 457</span>; others, doubtless, with Nehemiah, in  <span class="date">B.C. 445</span>; and again in  <span class="date">B.C. 434</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/146.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Man's help is of no avail; blessed is he (this is the last of the twenty-five &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; of the Psalter), on the contrary, who has the God of Jacob (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/144-15.htm">Psalm 144:15</a>) as Him in whom is his succour (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493; with Beth essentiae, vid., on <a href="/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>) - he, whose confidence (&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1512; as in <a href="/psalms/119-116.htm">Psalm 119:116</a>) rests on Jahve, whom he can by faith call his God. Men often are not able to give help although they might be willing to do so: He, however, is the Almighty, the Creator of the heavens, the earth, and the sea, and of all living things that fill these three (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6</a>). Men easily change their mind and do not keep their word: He, however, is He who keepeth truth or faithfulness, inasmuch as He unchangeably adheres to the fulfilling of His promises. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; is in form equivalent substantially to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;. And that which He is able to do as being the Almighty, and cannot as being the Truthful One leave undone, is also really His mode of active manifestation made evident in practical proofs: He obtains right for the oppressed, gives bread to the hungry, and consequently proves Himself to be the succour of those who suffer wrong without doing wrong, and as the provider for those who look for their daily bread from His gracious hand. With &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, the only determinate participle, the faithfulness of God to His promises is made especially prominent. </body></html>
