It is comely; it becomes us as reasonable creatures, much more as people in covenant with God. He gathers outcast sinners by his grace, and will bring them into his holy habitation. To those whom God heals with the consolations of his Spirit, he speaks peace, assures them their sins are pardoned. And for this, let others praise him also. Man's knowledge is soon ended; but God's knowledge is a dept that can never be fathomed. And while he telleth the number of the stars, he condescends to hear the broken-hearted sinner. While he feeds the young ravens, he will not leave his praying people destitute. Clouds look dull and melancholy, yet without them we could have no rain, therefore no fruit. Thus afflictions look black and unpleasant; but from clouds of affliction come showers that make the soul to yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness. The psalmist delights not in things wherein sinners trust and glory; but a serious and suitable regard to God is, in his sight, of very great price. We are not to be in doubt between hope and fear, but to act under the gracious influences of hope and fear united.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/147.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Great is our Lord - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1</a>.<p>And of great power - This seems to be added, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>, in view of the power required in making the heavens, and in guiding and numbering the stars: "Hast thou not known?

"Our Lord" is our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of the whole earth; the Lord of his own people by creation, by redemption, by marriage, and by the conquest of his grace, and their voluntary submission to him; he is "great" in his person, offices, and grace, and therefore greatly to be praised; see <a href="/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>; and particularly his "power" is very "great", as appears in the creation of all things out of nothing by him; in the sustaining and support of the world and all things in it: in the redemption of his people from the hand of their powerful enemies; in beginning, carrying on, and perfecting a work of grace on their hearts by his Spirit and power; and in the preservation of them unto eternal life, through a thousand dangers and difficulties: at his resurrection all power in heaven and earth were given him as Mediator; and in the latter day he will take to himself his great power and reign; and in the last day will raise the dead out of their graves; <p>his understanding is infinite; it reaches to all things, not to the stars of heaven only, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>, but to the fowls of the air, to the beasts of the field, and cattle upon a thousand hills; to all on the surface of the earth, or in the bowels of it; and to the fishes of the sea: it reaches to all men, and to all the thoughts of their hearts, the words of their mouths, and the actions of their lives; it reaches to all things past, that have been, to everything present, and to whatsoever is to come; it includes not only the knowledge of all things that are, or certainly will be, but of all things possible, or which he could bring into being if he would; it is concerned not only with the quality and nature of things it perfectly understands, but with the quantity of them; even all things in creation and providence, which are without number and past finding out by men; and so his understanding is without number, and cannot be declared, as the word signifies. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/147.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/147.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">Great</span> is <span class="ital">our Lord, and</span> abundant <span class="ital">in power</span>] The language is borrowed from <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm" title="Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.">Isaiah 40:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his understanding</span> is <span class="ital">infinite</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">to his understanding there is no number</span>, it is incalculable. <span class="ital">Number</span> is substituted for <span class="ital">searching</span> of <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm" title="Have you not known? have you not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, faints not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.">Isaiah 40:28</a>, perhaps to suggest a contrast to <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/147-5.htm" title="Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.">Psalm 147:5</a></span>.

Each consists of three words, which in the main is also the favourite measure of the lines in the Book of Job. The expression is as brief as possible. &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; is transferred from the yoke and chains to the person himself who is bound, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1495; is transferred from the eyes of the blind to the person himself. The five lines celebrate the God of the five-divisioned Tra, which furnishes abundant examples for these celebrations, and is directed with most considerate tenderness towards the strangers, orphans, and widows in particular. The orphan and the widow, says the sixth line, doth He recover, strengthen (with reference to &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491; see <a href="/psalms/20-9.htm">Psalm 20:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>). Valde gratus mihi est hic Psalmus, Bakius observes, ob Trifolium illud Dei: Advenas, Pupillos, et Viduas, versu uno luculentissime depictum, id quod in toto Psalterio nullibi fit. Whilst Jahve, however, makes the manifold sorrows of His saints to have a blessed issue, He bends (&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;) the way of the wicked, so that it leads into error and ends in the abyss (<a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>). This judicial manifestation of Jahve has only one line devoted to it. For He rules in love and in wrath, but delights most of all to rule in love. Jahve is, however, the God of Zion. The eternal duration of His kingdom is also the guarantee for its future glorious completion, for the victory of love. Hallelujah! </body></html>
