The thawing word may represent the gospel of Christ, and the thawing wind the Spirit of Christ; for the Spirit is compared to the wind, Joh 3:8. Converting grace softens the heart that was hard frozen, and melts it into tears of repentance, and makes good reflections to flow, which before were chilled and stopped up. The change which the thaw makes is very evident, yet how it is done no one can say. Such is the change wrought in the conversion of a soul, when God's word and Spirit are sent to melt it and restore it to itself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/147.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He casteth forth his ice like morsels - The word rendered morsels means properly a bit, a crumb, as of bread, <a href="/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a>; <a href="/judges/19-5.htm">Judges 19:5</a>.

Divided like morsels, as the Targum; cut into pieces, like morsels of bread. This seems to have respect to hail stones, which sometimes fall like pieces of ice, and are very prejudicial to the fruits of the earth: this was one of the ten plagues of Egypt; and whereby also many of the Canaanites were destroyed in the times of Joshua, <a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>; and there is an exceeding great storm of hail yet to come, very dreadful; see <a href="/revelation/16-21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a>. This is expressive of the wrath, vengeance, and judgments of God upon men, by which he is known in various perfections of his nature; as his power, justice, and holiness, for which he is celebrated, <a href="/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>; <p>who can stand before his cold? which he has purposed and promised shall be; for he has said, that "cold and heat shall not cease, as long as the earth remains"; and which he appoints and orders to be, for "by the breath of God frost is given", <a href="/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>; and this is sometimes and in some places so very vehement, that it is intolerable; men are obliged to keep within doors, to make them fires, and put on more clothes; and the "hands" of every man are sealed up from business; even "the beasts go into their dens, and remain in their places", or get what shelter they can; see <a href="/job/37-7.htm">Job 37:7</a>.

The object of the action is conceived of in &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; as the medium of it (cf. e.g., <a href="/job/16-4.htm">Job 16:4</a>).

Towards Him, the gracious Sustainer of all beings, are the ravens croaking for their food pointed (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/12-24.htm">Luke 12:24</a>, "Consider the ravens"), just like the earth that thirsts for rain. He is the all-conditioning One. Man, who is able to know that which the irrational creature unconsciously acknowledges, is in the feeling of his dependence to trust in Him and not in himself. In all those things to which the God-estranged self-confidence of man so readily clings, God has no delight (&#1497;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1509;, pausal form like &#1497;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;) and no pleasure, neither in the strength of the horse, whose rider imagines himself invincible, and, if he is obliged to flee, that he cannot be overtaken, nor in the legs of a man, upon which he imagines himself so firm that he cannot be thrown down, and which, when he is pursued, will presumptively carry him far enough away into safety. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1511;, Arab. sa&#770;q, is the leg from the knee to the foot, from Arab. sa&#770;qa, root sq, to drive, urge forward, more particularly to urge on to a gallop (like curs, according to Pott, from the root car, to go). What is meant here is, not that the strength of the horse and muscular power are of no avail when God wills to destroy a man (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>., <a href="/amos/2-14.htm">Amos 2:14</a>.), but only that God has no pleasure in the warrior's horse and in athletic strength. Those who fear Him, i.e., with a knowledge of the impotency of all power possessed by the creature in itself, and in humble trust feel themselves dependent upon His omnipotence - these are they in whom He takes pleasure (&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; with the accusative), those who, renouncing all carnal defiance and self-confident self-working, hope in His mercy. </body></html>
