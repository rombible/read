It is comely; it becomes us as reasonable creatures, much more as people in covenant with God. He gathers outcast sinners by his grace, and will bring them into his holy habitation. To those whom God heals with the consolations of his Spirit, he speaks peace, assures them their sins are pardoned. And for this, let others praise him also. Man's knowledge is soon ended; but God's knowledge is a dept that can never be fathomed. And while he telleth the number of the stars, he condescends to hear the broken-hearted sinner. While he feeds the young ravens, he will not leave his praying people destitute. Clouds look dull and melancholy, yet without them we could have no rain, therefore no fruit. Thus afflictions look black and unpleasant; but from clouds of affliction come showers that make the soul to yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness. The psalmist delights not in things wherein sinners trust and glory; but a serious and suitable regard to God is, in his sight, of very great price. We are not to be in doubt between hope and fear, but to act under the gracious influences of hope and fear united.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/147.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He delighteth not in the strength of the horse - The horse is among the noblest works of God - perhaps the noblest of all the animals that he has made.

It has been his will and pleasure to give the horse strength for the use and service of men, both for labour and war; and as this is a creature of his, and the work of his hands, it must be agreeable to him, <a href="/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19</a> yet a horse, though prepared for the battle, is a vain thing for safety, which is only of the Lord; neither can it deliver any by its great strength; nor are a king and his country saved by the multitude of an host, or by a large cavalry: nor are these what the Lord delights in, nor does he save men for the sake of them; though a well-mounted cavalry may be a pleasing sight to men, and they may raise their expectations, and promise themselves great things from them; yet these are of no account with God, who can save as well without them as with them, <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>. The Targum is, <p>"he delighteth not in the strength of those that ride on horses;'' <p>that are well mounted, and pride themselves in it; and are equipped for war, and are mighty to engage in it, and prepared to make their escape in danger: Kimchi's note is, <p>"he delighteth not in man, who puts his confidence in the strength of the horse;'' <p>see <a href="/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a>; <p>he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man; in which his strength lies, and of which he is apt to glory; but should not, it being displeasing to God; who delights not therein, but in lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a>; not in the legs of a man of war, as Arama; which are strong to stand his ground, or swift to flee away when hard-pressed; see <a href="/amos/2-14.htm">Amos 2:14</a>; so the Targum, <p>"he takes no pleasure in the legs of men that run;'' <p>that are swift to run races, or to flee in battle; to this sense are the notes of Jarchi and Kimchi. It seems to intend the infantry in an army, as the cavalry before; and both intimate that neither horse nor foot are to be trusted in for safety, how pleasing or promising they may be, since God seeth not as man does: or reference may be had to athletic exercises of horse and foot races, of wrestling, combats, &amp;c. men may delight in, but God does not. What are pleasing to him are exercises of a spiritual kind; such as fleeing to Jesus, the strong tower; running the Christian race, to obtain the incorruptible crown; wrestling against principalities and powers, and such acts of grace as are next mentioned. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/147.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He delighteth not in the <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.</span><p>(h) Though to use lawful means is both profitable and pleases God, yet to put our trust in them is to defraud God of his honour.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/147.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>.<span class="bld"> 11.</span> Based upon <a href="/context/psalms/33-16.htm" title="There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength....">Psalm 33:16-18</a>.

To be acquainted with human woe and to relieve it is an easy and small matter to Him who allots a number to the stars, that are to man innumerable (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), i.e., who has called them into being by His creative power in whatever number He has pleased, and yet a number known to Him (&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, the part. praes., which occurs frequently in descriptions of the Creator), and calls to them all names, i.e., names them all by names which are the expression of their true nature, which is well known to Him, the Creator. What Isaiah says (<a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>) with the words, "because of the greatness of might, and as being strong in power," and (<a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>) "His understanding is unsearchable," is here asserted in <a href="/psalms/147-5.htm">Psalm 147:5</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>): great is our Lord, and capable of much (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a>, &#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;), and to His understanding there is no number, i.e., in its depth and fulness it cannot be defined by any number. What a comfort for the church as it traverses its ways, that are often so labyrinthine and entangled! Its Lord is the Omniscient as well as the Almighty One. Its history, like the universe, is a work of God's infinitely profound and rich understanding. It is a mirror of gracious love and righteous anger.
