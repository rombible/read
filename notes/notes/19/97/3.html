Some apply this to the gifts of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, signified by cloven tongues of fire; but then no such effect followed as mentioned in the next clause: it seems best to interpret it of his wrath, which, like fire, was poured out to the uttermost on the Jews, for their disbelief and rejection of him; they would not have him to reign over them; they despised his Gospel, and slew his servants; wherefore he sent the Roman armies to them, who destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-7.htm">Matthew 22:7</a>, this will be also verified in the second coming of Christ, who will descend in flaming fire, and the earth will be burnt up, and all that is therein, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>, some Jewish writers interpret this of the war of Gog and Magog, in Ezekiel, which they suppose still future; as, when it is, fire will be sent and rained upon them, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>, but may be better applied to the Gog and Magog in <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>. <p>and burneth up his enemies round about; so that none can escape: this was true of the Jewish nation, who were burnt up; so that there was not left root nor branch in it, <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>, and will be true of the wicked, at the general conflagration of the world, upon Christ's second coming; and of the Gog and Magog army, after the resurrection. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/97.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/97.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A fire goeth before him.</span> So long as there is evil in the world, the "fire" of God's wrath must necessarily "go before him" at each theophany, to sweep the evil from his path (see <a href="/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>).
