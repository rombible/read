Care is taken for their safety. But something more is meant than their lives. The Lord will preserve the souls of his saints from sin, from apostacy, and despair, under their greatest trials. He will deliver them out of the hands of the wicked one, and preserve them safe to his heavenly kingdom. And those that rejoice in Christ Jesus, and in his exaltation, have fountains of joy prepared for them. Those that sow in tears, shall reap in joy. Gladness is sure to the upright in heart; the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment. Sinners tremble, but saints rejoice at God's holiness. As he hates sin, yet freely loves the person of the repentant sinner who believes in Christ, he will make a final separation between the person he loves and the sin he hates, and sanctify his people wholly, body, soul, and spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/97.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/33-1.htm">Psalm 33:1</a>.<p>And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness - Margin, "to the memorial" (compare <a href="/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a>). The idea is, "to the memory of his holiness;" that is, when his holiness comes before the mind; when it is remembered; when it is thought of. Give thanks or rejoice,<p>(a) that God is holy; that he is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity; that there is One eternally pure who presides over the universe; that there is One who will always do what is right;<p>(b) that such a Being is our God - our covenant-keeping God; that we may look to him, trust in him, enjoy him.<p>Wicked people do not rejoice that there is a God at all, and especially that God is a "holy God;" but it is one of the characteristics of true piety to rejoice in the thought that there is a God, and that he is perfectly holy, and hence, to feel conscious happiness whenever his name is mentioned, and whenever his attributes are referred to. The highest source of joy for man is that there is a God, and that God is exactly what he is, pure and holy. It would be a source of deepest sorrow if there were no God, or if God were in any respect, even the slightest, a different being from what he is. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/97.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. sown&#8212;to spring forth abundantly for such, who alone can and well may rejoice in the holy government of their sovereign Lord (compare Ps 30:4; 32:11).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/97.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In consideration of his holy and righteous nature and government, or of his faithfulness in making good that great promise of sending the Messias into the world; for holiness is sometimes taken for faithfulness, which is one part or branch of it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/97.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous,....
