Care is taken for their safety. But something more is meant than their lives. The Lord will preserve the souls of his saints from sin, from apostacy, and despair, under their greatest trials. He will deliver them out of the hands of the wicked one, and preserve them safe to his heavenly kingdom. And those that rejoice in Christ Jesus, and in his exaltation, have fountains of joy prepared for them. Those that sow in tears, shall reap in joy. Gladness is sure to the upright in heart; the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment. Sinners tremble, but saints rejoice at God's holiness. As he hates sin, yet freely loves the person of the repentant sinner who believes in Christ, he will make a final separation between the person he loves and the sin he hates, and sanctify his people wholly, body, soul, and spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/97.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/83-18.htm">Psalm 83:18</a>.<p>Thou art exalted far above all gods - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/95-3.htm">Psalm 95:3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/97.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. above all gods&#8212;(Ps 95:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/97.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As thou always wert so in truth, so thou hast now proved and declared thyself to be such in the eyes of the whole world, by subduing them under thy feet. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/97.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth,....
