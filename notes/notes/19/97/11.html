Observe, reader, whatever is the matter of our rejoicing ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving, and particularly the holiness of God.

Care is taken for their safety. But something more is meant than their lives. The Lord will preserve the souls of his saints from sin, from apostacy, and despair, under their greatest trials. He will deliver them out of the hands of the wicked one, and preserve them safe to his heavenly kingdom. And those that rejoice in Christ Jesus, and in his exaltation, have fountains of joy prepared for them. Those that sow in tears, shall reap in joy. Gladness is sure to the upright in heart; the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment. Sinners tremble, but saints rejoice at God's holiness. As he hates sin, yet freely loves the person of the repentant sinner who believes in Christ, he will make a final separation between the person he loves and the sin he hates, and sanctify his people wholly, body, soul, and spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/97.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Light is sown for the righteous - That is, There is light for the righteous; or, they shall be brought into light, though they may be for a time in darkness. The word rendered "sown" - &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;  za&#770;ra&#8219; - is from a verb which properly denotes to scatter, to disperse - as seed is scattered or dispersed when sown in a field. It is hence used with reference to moral subjects, as to sow righteousness, <a href="/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>; to sow iniquity, <a href="/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>; to sow mischief, <a href="/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>; that is, these things are scattered or sown, as seed is in a field, and produce a corresponding harvest. Thus light is scattered abroad, and will produce an appropriate harvest - a harvest of joy. It will spring up around the righteous, and he shall reap that which light tends to produce - happiness, intelligence, and peace. The figure of sowing light is an unusual one, but the meaning is plain. It is, that the righteous will not always be in darkness; that there is in preparation for him a harvest of joy; that it will as certainly be produced as a harvest will from grain that is sown; that though there may be present calamities, there will be ultimate peace and triumph.<p>And gladness for the upright in heart - The word gladness here - joy, or rejoicing - is parallel to the word light. Joy or gladness is sown for the righteous; that is, arrangements are made for producing joy, as preparations are made by sowing seed for a harvest. The world is full of arrangements for conferring happiness on the righteous. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/97.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. sown&#8212;to spring forth abundantly for such, who alone can and well may rejoice in the holy government of their sovereign Lord (compare Ps 30:4; 32:11).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/97.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Light, </span> i.e. joy and felicity, as this word is used, <span class="bld"><a href="/esther/8-16.htm" title="The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor.">Esther 8:16</a> <a href="/psalms/112-4.htm" title="To the upright there rises light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.">Psalm 112:4</a></span>, and oft elsewhere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is sown; </span> is prepared or laid up for them, and shall in due time be reaped by them, possibly in this life, but undoubtedly in the next.

Who are made righteous by the obedience of Christ, and live soberly and righteously; the light of joy and gladness, as it is explained in the next clause; see <a href="/esther/8-16.htm">Esther 8:16</a> so,  "light", is frequently used by Homer (x) for joy and gladness: these sometimes are without it, through the hidings of God's face, the prevalence of corruptions, the force of Satan's temptations, and the many afflictions they meet with; but joy and gladness, peace and comfort, are sown for them in the counsels and purposes of God, in his covenant, in the Scriptures, in the Gospel, and in the promises of it; and, though at present hidden, will spring up in God's due time, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>, and which also may be interpreted of the light of glory, which at present does not appear; but it is prepared in the purpose of God, and in his promise, and shall be enjoyed by the heirs of it. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions, render it, "light is risen for the righteous"; and so the Targum, <p>"light is risen and prepared for the righteous;'' <p>Christ, the light of the world, the sun of righteousness, is risen for them, and upon them, with healing in his wings, which bring joy and comfort to them: <p>and gladness for the upright in heart; such as have new hearts and right spirits formed in them, and are Israelites indeed, that have the truth of grace and the root of the matter in them: gladness is prepared, provided, and promised to them, and sooner or later they shall have it; the seed of it is sown, and it will spring up, and a large crop shall be enjoyed.
