God is often thus represented as encompassed with clouds. <a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>. See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7-15</a>. The word rendered "clouds" is the common word to denote a cloud; the word translated "darkness" means properly "thick clouds, cloudy darkness, gloom." It would refer to a cloud considered as dark, and as casting a gloom over the world. There is no reference here to the fact that the dealings of God are dark, mysterious, and incomprehensible, as if he were surrounded by clouds and darkness. This is indeed often true; but that is not the truth taught here. The meaning here is, that the character of God is suited to fill the mind with solemn awe, or with emotions of sublimity.<p>Righteousness and judgment - He is a righteous God; he is a God who will execute just judgment. Though he is encompassed with clouds, yet he is a just God; and this is suited to impress the mind with profound reverence. That he will do right we may be assured, even when he covers himself with clouds; the fact that he will thus do right is suited to calm the minds of those who love and obey him, and at the same time to fill the minds of the wicked with alarm.<p>Are the habitation of his throne - Margin, "establishment." The Hebrew word means "place;" the place where one stands, or where one abides; a habitation, or a dwelling. It then means a foundation or basis, <a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-5.htm">Psalm 104:5</a>. This would seem to be the idea here. His throne rests upon, or is sustained by, justice and righteousness. Nothing else would uphold the government of the universe; nothing else will sustain any government. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/97.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 97<p>Ps 97:1-12.
