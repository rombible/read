This petition includes all the good for which we come to throne of grace. If we obtain mercy there, we need no more to make us happy. It implies likewise our best plea, not our merit, but God's mercy, his free, rich mercy. We may flee to, and trust the mercy of God, when surrounded on all sides by difficulties and dangers. His enemies were too hard for him, if God did not help him. He resolves to make God's promises the matter of his praises, and so we have reason to make them. As we must not trust an arm of flesh when engaged for us, so we must not be afraid of an arm of flesh when stretched out against us. The sin of sinners will never be their security.

I will be thankful that he "has" spoken, and that he has given me assurances on which I may rely in the times of danger." The idea is, that he would "always" find in God that which was the ground or foundation for praise; and that that which called for special praise in meditating on the divine character, was the word or promise which God had made to his people.<p>I will not fear what flesh can do unto me - What man can do to me.

The relative clause at the same time gives the ground for this their fate from the character they bear: they persevere in their course without any regard to any other in their godlessness. The noun &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, which is used elsewhere of a change of clothes, of a reserve in time of war, of a relief of bands of workmen, here signifies a change of mind (Targum), as in <a href="/job/14-14.htm">Job 14:14</a> a change of condition; the plural means that every change of this kind is very far from them. In <a href="/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a> David again has the one faithless foe among the multitude of the rebels before his mind. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493; is equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/34-21.htm">Genesis 34:21</a>, those who stood in peaceful relationship to him (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="/psalms/41-10.htm">Psalm 41:10</a>). David classes himself with his faithful adherents. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is here a defensive and offensive treaty of mutual fidelity entered into in the presence of God. By &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; and &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; is meant the intention which, though not carried out as yet, is already in itself a violation and profanation of the solemn compact. In <a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a> the description passes into the tone of the caesural schema. It is impossible for &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, so far as the vowels are concerned, to be equivalent to &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, since this change of the vowels would obliterate the preposition; but one is forbidden to read &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (Targum, Symmachus, Jerome) by the fact that &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (lxx &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, as in <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>) cannot be the subject to &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;. Consequently &#1502; belongs to the noun itself, and the denominative &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492;), like &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1506;&#1491;&#1503;), dainties, signifies articles of food prepared from curdled milk; here it is used figuratively of "milk-words" or "butter-words" which come from the lips of the hypocrite softly, sweetly, and supplely as cream: os nectar promit, mens aconita vomit. In the following words &#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; (&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;) the Makkeph (in connection with which it would have to be read ukerob just the same as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a>, since the - has not a Metheg) is to be crossed out (as in fact it is even wanting here and there in MSS and printed editions). The words are an independent substantival clause: war (&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;, a pushing together, assault, battle, after the form &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; mrof eh with an unchangeable a&#770;) is his inward part and his words are swords; these two clauses correspond. &#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (properly like Arab. rkk, to be thin, weak, then also: to be soft, mild; root &#1512;&#1498;, &#1512;&#1511;, tendere, tenuare) has the accent on the ultima, vid., on <a href="/psalms/38-20.htm">Psalm 38:20</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; is a drawn, unsheathed sword (<a href="/psalms/37-14.htm">Psalm 37:14</a>).<p>The exhortation, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>, which begins a new strophe and is thereby less abrupt, is first of all a counsel which David gives to himself, but at the same time to all who suffer innocently, cf. <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>. Instead of the obscure &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;. &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;&#1498;, we read in <a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a> &#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1498;, and in <a href="/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a> &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498;, according to which the word is not a verb after the form &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1498; (Chajug', Gecatilia, and Kimchi), but an accusative of the object (just as it is in fact accented; for the Legarme of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; has a lesser disjunctive value than the Zinnor of &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;&#1498;). The lxx renders it &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. Thus are these words of the Psalm applied in <a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>. According to the Talmud &#1497;&#1492;&#1489; (the same form as &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;) signifies a burden. "One day," relates Rabba bar-Chana, B. Rosh ha-Shana, 26b, and elsewhere, "I was walking with an Arabian (Nabataean?) tradesman, and happened to be carrying a heavy pack. And he said to me, &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497;&#1500; &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1490;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;, Take thy burden and throw it on my camel." Hence it is wiser to refer &#1497;&#1492;&#1489; to &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;, to give, apportion, than to a stem &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;  equals  &#1497;&#1488;&#1489;, <a href="/psalms/119-131.htm">Psalm 119:131</a> (root &#1488;&#1489;, &#1488;&#1493;), to desire; so that it consequently does not mean desiring, longing, care, but that which is imposed, laid upon one, assigned or allotted to one (Bttcher), in which sense the Chaldee derivatives of &#1497;&#1492;&#1489; (Targum <a href="/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>, for &#1502;&#1504;&#1514;) do actually occur. On whomsoever one casts what is allotted to him to carry, to him one gives it to carry. The admonition proceeds on the principle that God is as willing as He is able to bear even the heaviest burden for us; but this bearing it for us is on the other side our own bearing of it in God's strength, and hence the promise that is added runs: He will sustain thee (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;), that thou mayest not through feebleness succumb. <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a> also favours this figure of a burden: He will not give, i.e., suffer to happen (<a href="/psalms/78-66.htm">Psalm 78:66</a>), tottering to the righteous for ever, He will never suffer the righteous to totter. The righteous shall never totter (or be moved) with the overthrow that follows; whereas David is sure of this, that his enemies shall not only fall to the ground, but go down into Hades (which is here, by a combination of two synonyms, &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, called a well, i.e., an opening, of a sinking in, i.e., a pit, as e.g., in <a href="/proverbs/8-31.htm">Proverbs 8:31</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a>), and that before they have halved their days, i.e., before they have reached the half of the age that might be attained under other circumstances (cf. <a href="/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-11.htm">Jeremiah 16:11</a>). By &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; prominence is given to the fact that it is the very same God who will not suffer the righteous to fall who casts down the ungodly; and by &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; David contrasts himself with them, as being of good courage now and in all time to come. </body></html>
