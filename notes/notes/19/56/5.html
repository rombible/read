This petition includes all the good for which we come to throne of grace. If we obtain mercy there, we need no more to make us happy. It implies likewise our best plea, not our merit, but God's mercy, his free, rich mercy. We may flee to, and trust the mercy of God, when surrounded on all sides by difficulties and dangers. His enemies were too hard for him, if God did not help him. He resolves to make God's promises the matter of his praises, and so we have reason to make them. As we must not trust an arm of flesh when engaged for us, so we must not be afraid of an arm of flesh when stretched out against us. The sin of sinners will never be their security.

This is a common mode of warfare among the ungodly. They put our language on the rack, they extort meanings from it which it cannot be made fairly to contain. Thus our Saviour's prophecy concerning the temple of his body, and countless accusations against his servants, were founded on wilful perversions. They who do this every day become great adepts in the art. A wolf can always find in a lamb's discourse a reason for eating him. Prayers are blasphemies if you choose to read them the wrong way upwards. "All their thoughts are against me for evil." No mixture of good will tone down their malice. Whether they viewed him as a king, a Psalmist, a man, a father, a warrior, a sufferer, it was all the same, they saw through coloured glass, and could not think a generous thought towards him. Even those actions of his which were an undoubted blessing to the commonwealth, they endeavoured to undervalue. Oh, foul spring, from which never a drop of pure water can come!<p><a href="/psalms/56-6.htm">Psalm 56:6</a><p>"They gather themselves together." Firebrands burn the fiercer for being pushed together. They are afraid to meet the good man till their numbers place terrible odds against him. Come out, ye cowards, man by man, and fight the old hero! No, ye wait till ye are assembled like thieves in bands, and even then ye waylay the man. There is nothing brave about you. "They hide themselves." In ambuscade they wait their opportunity. Men of malice are men of cowardice. He who dares not meet his man on the king's highway, writes himself down a villain. Constantly are the reputations of good men assailed with deep-laid schemes, and diabolical plots, in which the anonymous enemies stab in the dark. "They mark my steps," as hunters mark the trail of their game, and so track them. Malicious men are frequently very sharp-sighted to detect the failings, or supposed failings, of the righteous. Spies and mouchards are not all in the pay of earthly governments, some of them will have wages to take in red-hot coin from one who himself is more subtle than all the beasts of the field. "When they wait for my soul." Nothing less than his life would content them, only his present and eternal ruin could altogether glut them. The good man is no fool, he sees that he has enemies, and that they are many and crafty; he sees also his own danger, and then he shows his wisdom by spreading the whole case before the Lord, and putting himself under divine protection. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/56.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They wrest my words; </span> they misconstrue and pervert my most innocent expressions, and turn them into matter of calumny, wherewith they may incense Saul against me.

The relative clause at the same time gives the ground for this their fate from the character they bear: they persevere in their course without any regard to any other in their godlessness. The noun &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, which is used elsewhere of a change of clothes, of a reserve in time of war, of a relief of bands of workmen, here signifies a change of mind (Targum), as in <a href="/job/14-14.htm">Job 14:14</a> a change of condition; the plural means that every change of this kind is very far from them. In <a href="/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a> David again has the one faithless foe among the multitude of the rebels before his mind. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493; is equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/34-21.htm">Genesis 34:21</a>, those who stood in peaceful relationship to him (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="/psalms/41-10.htm">Psalm 41:10</a>). David classes himself with his faithful adherents. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is here a defensive and offensive treaty of mutual fidelity entered into in the presence of God. By &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; and &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; is meant the intention which, though not carried out as yet, is already in itself a violation and profanation of the solemn compact. In <a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a> the description passes into the tone of the caesural schema. It is impossible for &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, so far as the vowels are concerned, to be equivalent to &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, since this change of the vowels would obliterate the preposition; but one is forbidden to read &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (Targum, Symmachus, Jerome) by the fact that &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (lxx &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, as in <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>) cannot be the subject to &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;. Consequently &#1502; belongs to the noun itself, and the denominative &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492;), like &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1506;&#1491;&#1503;), dainties, signifies articles of food prepared from curdled milk; here it is used figuratively of "milk-words" or "butter-words" which come from the lips of the hypocrite softly, sweetly, and supplely as cream: os nectar promit, mens aconita vomit. In the following words &#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; (&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;) the Makkeph (in connection with which it would have to be read ukerob just the same as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a>, since the - has not a Metheg) is to be crossed out (as in fact it is even wanting here and there in MSS and printed editions). The words are an independent substantival clause: war (&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;, a pushing together, assault, battle, after the form &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; mrof eh with an unchangeable a&#770;) is his inward part and his words are swords; these two clauses correspond. &#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (properly like Arab. rkk, to be thin, weak, then also: to be soft, mild; root &#1512;&#1498;, &#1512;&#1511;, tendere, tenuare) has the accent on the ultima, vid., on <a href="/psalms/38-20.htm">Psalm 38:20</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; is a drawn, unsheathed sword (<a href="/psalms/37-14.htm">Psalm 37:14</a>).<p>The exhortation, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>, which begins a new strophe and is thereby less abrupt, is first of all a counsel which David gives to himself, but at the same time to all who suffer innocently, cf. <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>. Instead of the obscure &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;. &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;&#1498;, we read in <a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a> &#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1498;, and in <a href="/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a> &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498;, according to which the word is not a verb after the form &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1498; (Chajug', Gecatilia, and Kimchi), but an accusative of the object (just as it is in fact accented; for the Legarme of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; has a lesser disjunctive value than the Zinnor of &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;&#1498;). The lxx renders it &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. Thus are these words of the Psalm applied in <a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>. According to the Talmud &#1497;&#1492;&#1489; (the same form as &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;) signifies a burden. "One day," relates Rabba bar-Chana, B. Rosh ha-Shana, 26b, and elsewhere, "I was walking with an Arabian (Nabataean?) tradesman, and happened to be carrying a heavy pack. And he said to me, &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497;&#1500; &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1490;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;, Take thy burden and throw it on my camel." Hence it is wiser to refer &#1497;&#1492;&#1489; to &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;, to give, apportion, than to a stem &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;  equals  &#1497;&#1488;&#1489;, <a href="/psalms/119-131.htm">Psalm 119:131</a> (root &#1488;&#1489;, &#1488;&#1493;), to desire; so that it consequently does not mean desiring, longing, care, but that which is imposed, laid upon one, assigned or allotted to one (Bttcher), in which sense the Chaldee derivatives of &#1497;&#1492;&#1489; (Targum <a href="/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>, for &#1502;&#1504;&#1514;) do actually occur. On whomsoever one casts what is allotted to him to carry, to him one gives it to carry. The admonition proceeds on the principle that God is as willing as He is able to bear even the heaviest burden for us; but this bearing it for us is on the other side our own bearing of it in God's strength, and hence the promise that is added runs: He will sustain thee (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;), that thou mayest not through feebleness succumb. <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a> also favours this figure of a burden: He will not give, i.e., suffer to happen (<a href="/psalms/78-66.htm">Psalm 78:66</a>), tottering to the righteous for ever, He will never suffer the righteous to totter. The righteous shall never totter (or be moved) with the overthrow that follows; whereas David is sure of this, that his enemies shall not only fall to the ground, but go down into Hades (which is here, by a combination of two synonyms, &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, called a well, i.e., an opening, of a sinking in, i.e., a pit, as e.g., in <a href="/proverbs/8-31.htm">Proverbs 8:31</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a>), and that before they have halved their days, i.e., before they have reached the half of the age that might be attained under other circumstances (cf. <a href="/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-11.htm">Jeremiah 16:11</a>). By &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; prominence is given to the fact that it is the very same God who will not suffer the righteous to fall who casts down the ungodly; and by &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; David contrasts himself with them, as being of good courage now and in all time to come. </body></html>
