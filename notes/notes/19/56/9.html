Yet we are often tempted to repine and despond under small sorrows. For this we should check ourselves. David comforts himself, in his distress and fear, that God noticed all his grievances and all his griefs. God has a bottle and a book for his people's tears, both the tears for their sins, and those for their afflictions. He observes them with tender concern. Every true believer may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and then I will not fear what man shall do unto me; for man has no power but what is given him from above. Thy vows are upon me, O Lord; not as a burden, but as that by which I am known to be thy servant; as a bridle that restrains me from what would be hurtful, and directs me in the way of my duty. And vows of thankfulness properly accompany prayers for mercy. If God deliver us from sin, either from doing it, or by his pardoning mercy, he has delivered our souls from death, which is the wages of sin. Where the Lord has begun a good work he will carry it on and perfect it. David hopes that God would keep him even from the appearance of sin. We should aim in all our desires and expectations of deliverance, both from sin and trouble, that we may do the better service to the Lord; that we may serve him without fear. If his grace has delivered our souls from the death of sin, he will bring us to heaven, to walk before him for ever in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/56.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When I cry unto thee - This expresses strong confidence in prayer.

Their rebellion against the counsel of God is ineffective madness. If the poet has God's favour on his side, then he will face these pigmies that behave as though they were giants, who fight against him &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, moving on high, i.e., proudly (cf. &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="/psalms/73-8.htm">Psalm 73:8</a>), in the invincible might of God. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, inhiare, as in <a href="/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-1.htm">Psalm 35:1</a>, with &#1500; like &#1488;&#1500;, e.g., in <a href="/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>. Thus, then, he does not fear; in the day when (Ges. &#1431;123, 3, b) he might well be afraid (conjunctive future, as e.g., in <a href="/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>), he clings trustfully to (&#1488;&#1500; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>, and frequently, <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5</a>) his God, so that fear cannot come near him. He has the word of His promise on his side (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; as e.g., <a href="/psalms/130-5.htm">Psalm 130:5</a>); &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, through God will he praise this His word, inasmuch as it is gloriously verified in him. Hupfeld thus correctly interprets it; whereas others in part render it "in Elohim do I praise His word," in part (and the form of this favourite expression in <a href="/psalms/56-11.htm">Psalm 56:11</a> is opposed to it): "Elohim do I celebrate, His word." Hitzig, however, renders it: "Of God do I boast in matter," i.e., in the present affair; which is most chillingly prosaic in connection with an awkward brevity of language.
