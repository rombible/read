His enemies were too hard for him, if God did not help him. He resolves to make God's promises the matter of his praises, and so we have reason to make them. As we must not trust an arm of flesh when engaged for us, so we must not be afraid of an arm of flesh when stretched out against us. The sin of sinners will never be their security.

Beset by domestic and foreign foes, David appeals confidently to God, recites his complaints, and closes with joyful and assured anticipations of God's continued help.<p>1, 2. would swallow&#8212;literally, "pants as a raging beast" (Ac 9:1).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/56.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.<p>2 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High.<p>"Be merciful unto me, O God." In my deep distress my soul turns to thee, my God. Man has no mercy on me, therefore double thy mercy to me. If thy justice has let loose my enemies, let thy mercy shorten their chain. It Is sweet to see how the tender dove-like spirit of the Psalmist flies to the tenderest attribute for succour in the hour of peril. "For man would swallow me up." He is but thy creature, a mere man, yet like a monster he is eager for blood, he pants, he gapes for me; he would not merely wound me, or feed on my substance, but he would fain swallow me altogether, and so make an end of me. The open mouths of sinners when they rage against us should open our months in prayer. We may plead the cruelty of men as a reason for the divine interposition - a father is soon aroused when his children are shamefully entreated. "He fighting daily oppresseth me." He gives me no interval - he fights daily. He is successful in his unrighteous war - he oppresses me, he crushes me, he presses me sore. David has his eye on the leader of his foes, and lays his plaint against him in the right place. If we may thus plead against man, much more against that great enemy of souls, the devil. We ask the Lord to forgive us our trespasses, which is another way of saying, "Be merciful unto me, O God," and then we say, "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one." The more violent the attack of Satan the stronger our plea for deliverance.<p><a href="/psalms/56-2.htm">Psalm 56:2</a><p>"Mine enemies would daily swallow me up." Their appetite for blood never fails them. With them there is no truce or armistice. They are many, but one mind animates them. Nothing I can do can make them relent. Unless they can quite devour me they will never be content. The ogres of nursery tales exist in reality in the enemies of the church, who would crush the bones of the godly, and make a mouthful of them if they could. "For they be many that fight against me." Sinners are gregarious creatures. Persecutors hunt in packs. These wolves of the church seldom come down upon us singly. The number of our foes is a powerful plea for the interposition of the one Defender of the faithful, who is mightier than all their bands. These foes of the gracious are also keen-eyed, and ever on the watch, hence the margin calls them "observers." "O thou most High." Thus he invokes against the lofty ones of the earth the aid of one who is higher than the highest. Some translate the words differently, and think that the writer means that his foes assailed him from the high places in which pride and power had placed them. Saul, his great foe, attacked him from his throne with all the force which his high position placed at his disposal: our comfort in such a case is near to hand, for God will help us from a higher place than our proudest foes can occupy. The greatness of God as the Most High is a fertile source of consolation to weak saints oppressed by mighty enemies. <span class="bld">Jonath-elem-reehokim</span> is supposed to be the name of a song; but many render it, as the words signify, <span class="ital">concerning the dumb dove afar off</span>; all which agrees very well to David in his present circumstances.

For David could expect no mercy at the hands of men, among whom he was, whose tender mercies were cruel; he being at Gath, the city of Goliath, whom he had slain, and whose sword he had now with him; and among his brethren and friends, who he might justly fear would revenge his death upon him: wherefore he betakes himself to God, and pleads not any merit or righteousness of his own, but implores the grace and mercy of God; and he might expect to find grace and mercy in this his time of need, since there is mercy with the Lord; he is plenteous in it, distributes it freely, delights in so doing, and does it constantly; his mercy endures for ever, it is from everlasting to everlasting on them that fear him; <p>for man would swallow me up; the Targum renders it "isbi", a wicked man: it may be understood of some one man, some great man, as Achish king of Gath; or rather Saul king of Israel, who breathed and panted after his ruin and destruction, as the word (p), signifies; who sought to eat up his flesh, to take away his life, and utterly ruin him: or collectively of many, since it appears, by the following verse, that he had many enemies who were desirous to swallow him up. This he mentions as an aggravation of his distress, and as a reason why he hoped the Lord would be merciful to him; and that he, being God, would not suffer than to prevail; see <a href="/2_chronicles/14-12.htm">2 Chronicles 14:12</a>; <p>he fighting daily oppresseth me; this shows that Saul is more especially intended, who was continually with his army pursuing him, and sometimes surrounded him and his men, and reduced him to great distress.

Evening morning, and noon, as the beginning, middle, and close of the day, denote the day in its whole compass or extent: David thus gives expression to the incessancy with which he is determined to lay before God, both in the quiet of his spirit and in louder utterances, whatsoever moves him. The fut. consec. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; connects the hearing (answer) with the prayer as its inevitable result. Also in the praet. &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; expression is given to the certainty of faith; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; side by side with it denotes, with the same pregnancy of meaning as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, the state of undisturbed outward and inward safety and prosperity, into which God removes his soul when He rescues him. If we read mi-kerob, then &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; is, as the ancient versions regard it, the infinitive: ne appropinquent mihi; whereas since the time of J. H. Michaelis the preference has been given to the pronunciation mi-kera&#772;b: a conflictu mihi sc. parato, in which case it would be pointed &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1470; (with Metheg), whilst the MSS, in order to guard against the reading with a&#772;, point it &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1470;. Hitzig is right when he observes, that after the negative &#1502;&#1503; the infinitive is indicated beforehand, and that &#1500;&#1497;  equals  &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>, is better suited to this. Moreover, the confirmatory clause <a href="/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a> is connected with what precedes in a manner less liable to be misunderstood if &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; is taken as infinitive: that they may not be able to gain any advantage over me, cannot come near me to harm me (<a href="/psalms/91-10.htm">Psalm 91:10</a>). For it is not until now less precarious to take the enemies as the subject of &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, and to take &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; in a hostile sense, as in <a href="/job/10-17.htm">Job 10:17</a>; <a href="/job/13-19.htm">Job 13:19</a>; <a href="/job/23-6.htm">Job 23:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-13.htm">Job 31:13</a>, cf. &#1506;&#1501; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-16.htm">Psalm 94:16</a>, and this is only possible where the connection suggests this sense. Heidenheim's interpretation: among the magnates were those who succoured me (viz., Hushai, Zadok, and Abiathar, by whom the counsel of Athithopel was frustrated), does not give a thought characteristic of the Psalms. And with Aben-Ezra, who follows Numeri Rabba 294a, to think of the assistance of angels in connection with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, certainly strongly commends itself in view of <a href="/2_kings/6-16.htm">2 Kings 6:16</a> (with which Hitzig also compares <a href="/2_chronicles/32-7.htm">2 Chronicles 32:7</a>); here, however, it has no connection, whereas the thought, "as many (consisting of many) are they with me, i.e., do they come forward and fight with me," is very loosely attached to what has gone before. The Beth essentiae serves here, as it does frequently, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>, to denote the qualification of the subject. The preterite of confidence is followed in <a href="/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20</a> by the future of hope. Although side by side with &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; presumptively has the signification to answer, i.e., to be assured of the prayer being heard, yet this meaning is in this instance excluded by the fact that the enemies are the object, as is required by <a href="/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20</a> (even if <a href="/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a> is understood of those who are on the side of the poet). The rendering of the lxx: &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, is appropriate, but requires the pronunciation to be &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;, since the signification to bow down, to humble, cannot be proved to belong either to Kal or Hiphil. But even granted that &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1501; might, according to <a href="/1_kings/8-35.htm">1 Kings 8:35</a> (vid., Keil), signify &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;, it is nevertheless difficult to believe that &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1501; is not intended to have a meaning correlative with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, of which it is the continuation. Saadia has explained &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1501; in a manner worthy of attention, as being for &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1501;, he will testify against them; an interpretation which Aben-Ezra endorses. Hengstenberg's is better: "God will hear (the tumult of the enemies) and answer them (judicially)." The original text may have been &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1502;&#1493; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;. But as it now stands, &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501; represents a subordinate clause, with the omission of the &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, pledging that judicial response: since He it is who sitteth enthroned from earliest times (vid., on <a href="/psalms/7-10.htm">Psalm 7:10</a>). The bold expression &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501; is an abbreviation of the view of God expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-12.htm">Psalm 74:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-27.htm">Deuteronomy 33:27</a>, as of Him who from primeval days down to the present sits enthroned as King and Judge, who therefore will be able even at the present time to maintain His majesty, which is assailed in the person of His anointed one.</body></html>
