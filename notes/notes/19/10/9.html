We stand afar off from God by our unbelief, and then complain that God stands afar off from us. Passionate words against bad men do more hurt than good; if we speak of their badness, let it be to the Lord in prayer; he can make them better. The sinner proudly glories in his power and success. Wicked people will not seek after God, that is, will not call upon him. They live without prayer, and that is living without God. They have many thoughts, many objects and devices, but think not of the Lord in any of them; they have no submission to his will, nor aim for his glory. The cause of this is pride. Men think it below them to be religious. They could not break all the laws of justice and goodness toward man, if they had not first shaken off all sense of religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He lieth in wait secretly - Margin, in the secret places. See the note at <a href="/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>. The object here is merely to illustrate the thought in the previous verse, by an allusion to a lion and a hunter.<p>As a lion in his den - As a lion crouches down in his den, ready to spring upon his prey. That is, the lion is concealed, but is on the look out, and when his prey passes near his den, he suddenly springs upon it and secures it. So it is with the wicked man. He carefully lays his plans. He conceals his purposes. He is himself hidden, or his plans are all hidden. Suddenly he springs upon his victim, who is taken by surprise and has no power of defense or escape. The purpose here is not so much to describe the wicked man as a literal robber, as to compare the conduct of the wicked with that of a robber - one who, like a lion or a hunter, lies concealed until his victim is seen. This will describe the conduct of a large class of people - men who secretly lay plans of seduction, villany, and fraud, and who spring suddenly upon their victims when there is no hope of escape.<p>He lieth in wait to catch the poor - The helpless and defenseless.<p>He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net - As a hunter does the wild beast. Here the same thought is presented under a new image - that of a hunter. He lays his snare, gin, or pit-fall, and when the animal is allured into it, he springs the net suddenly on him, or the animal sinks into the pit, and is secured.

The praett. express those features of their character that have become a matter of actual experience. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, to praise aloud, generally with the accus., is here used with &#1506;&#1500; of the thing which calls forth praise. Far from hiding the shameful desire or passion (<a href="/psalms/112-10.htm">Psalm 112:10</a>) of his soul, he makes it an object and ground of high and sounding praise, imagining himself to be above all restraint human or divine. Hupfeld translates wrongly: "and he blesses the plunderer, he blasphemes Jahve." But the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; who persecutes the godly, is himself a &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; a covetous or rapacious person; for such is the designation (elsewhere with &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>, or &#1512;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; <a href="/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a>) not merely of one who "cuts off" (Arab. bd&#803;&#8219;), i.e., obtains unjust gain, by trading, but also by plunder, &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (here in connection with Mugrash, as in <a href="/numbers/23-20.htm">Numbers 23:20</a> with Tiphcha &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;) never directly signifies maledicere in biblical Hebrew as it does in the alter Talmudic (whence &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501; blasphemy, B. Sanhedrin 56a, and frequently), but to take leave of any one with a benediction, and then to bid farewell, to dismiss, to decline and abandon generally, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>, and frequently (cf. the word remercier, abdanken; and the phrase "das Zeitliche segnen"  equals  to depart this life). The declaration without a conjunction is climactic, like <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/amos/4-5.htm">Amos 4:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-7.htm">Jeremiah 15:7</a>. &#1504;&#1488;&#1509;, properly to prick, sting, is sued of utter rejection by word and deed.<p>(Note: Pasek stands between &#1504;&#1488;&#1509; and &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, because to blaspheme God is a terrible thought and not to be spoken of without hesitancy, cf. the Pasek in <a href="/psalms/74-18.htm">Psalm 74:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-52.htm">Psalm 89:52</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a> (<a href="/2_kings/19-23.htm">2 Kings 19:23</a>).)<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>, "the evil-doer according to his haughtiness" (cf. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>) is nom. absol., and &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (contrary to the accentuation) is virtually the predicate to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;. This word, which denotes the intrigues of the ungodly, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-2.htm">Psalm 10:2</a>, has in this verse, the general meaning: thoughts (from &#1494;&#1502;&#1501;, Arab. zmm, to join, combine), but not without being easily associated with the secondary idea of that which is subtly devised. The whole texture of his thoughts is, i.e., proceeds from and tends towards the thought, that he (viz., Jahve, whom he does not like to name) will punish with nothing (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500; the strongest form of subjective negation), that in fact there is no God at all. This second follows from the first; for to deny the existence of a living, acting, all-punishing (in one word: a personal) God, is equivalent to denying the existence of any real and true God whatever (Ewald). </body></html>
