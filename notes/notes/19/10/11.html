We stand afar off from God by our unbelief, and then complain that God stands afar off from us. Passionate words against bad men do more hurt than good; if we speak of their badness, let it be to the Lord in prayer; he can make them better. The sinner proudly glories in his power and success. Wicked people will not seek after God, that is, will not call upon him. They live without prayer, and that is living without God. They have many thoughts, many objects and devices, but think not of the Lord in any of them; they have no submission to his will, nor aim for his glory. The cause of this is pride. Men think it below them to be religious. They could not break all the laws of justice and goodness toward man, if they had not first shaken off all sense of religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten - That is, this is his practical, habitual feeling. He acts as if God had forgotten, or as if God takes no knowledge of what is occurring in the earth. Compare <a href="/psalms/10-6.htm">Psalm 10:6</a>.<p>He hideth his face - God has hidden his face; that is, he does not look on what is occurring.<p>He will never see it - That is, he will never see what is done. It cannot be supposed that any man would deliberately say either that the memory of God has failed, or that he will not see what is done upon the earth, but the meaning is, that this is the practical feeling of the wicked man; he acts as if this were so. He is no more restrained in his conduct than he would be if this were his deliberate conviction, or than if he had settled it in his mind that God is regardless of human actions. It is hardly necessary to say that this is a correct description of the conduct of wicked men. If they deliberately believed that God was regardless of human conduct, if they were certain that he would not behold what is done, their conduct would not be different from what it is now. They do not act as if his eye were upon them; they are not restrained by any sense of his presence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Or "he will never" the wickedness committed by the wicked; which is a very foolish thought, since what is done in the dark, and in the most secret manner, is seen by God, the darkness and the light are alike to him; he is all-seeing and ever-seeing, and everywhere seeing; and he it is that has made the eye, and shall not he see? <a href="/psalms/94-5.htm">Psalm 94:5</a>; the sense of the whole in general is, that God takes no notice of good men or bad men, nor of what is done by either of them; he does not concern himself with the affairs of this world, which is an impious denial of divine Providence; see <a href="/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>.

"The wish is father to the thought." As Delitzsch says, "The true personal God would disturb his plans, so he denies him. ' There is naught,' he says, 'but destiny, and that is blind; an absolute, and that has no eyes; an idea, and that has no grasp.'" He hideth his face. He looks away; he does not wish to be troubled or disturbed by what occurs on earth. So the Epicureans in later times. He win never see it (comp. <a href="/job/22-12.htm">Job 22:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This strophe, consisting of only three lines, describes his happiness which he allows nothing to disturb. The signification: to be lasting (prop. stiff, strong) is secured to the verb &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; (whence &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;) by <a href="/job/20-21.htm">Job 20:21</a>. He takes whatever ways he chooses, they always lead to the desired end; he stands fast, he neither stumbles nor goes astray, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>. The Cheth&#1502;b &#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493; (&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;) has no other meaning than that give to it by the Ker&#1502; (cf. <a href="/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a>). Whatever might cast a cloud over his happiness does not trouble him: neither the judgments of God, which are removed high as the heavens out of his sight, and consequently do not disturb his conscience (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; and the opposite, <a href="/psalms/18-23.htm">Psalm 18:23</a>), nor his adversaries whom he bloweth upon contemptuously. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; is the predicate: altissime remota. And &#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;, to breathe upon, does not in any case signify: actually to blow away or down (to express which &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; or &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507; would be used), but either to "snub," or, what is more appropriate to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-5.htm">Psalm 10:5</a>, to blow upon them disdainfully, to puff at them, like &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495; in <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/1-13.htm">Malachi 1:13</a>, and flare rosas (to despise the roses) in Prudentius. The meaning is not that he drives his enemies away without much difficulty, but that by his proud and haughty bearing he gives them to understand how little they interfere with him. </body></html>
