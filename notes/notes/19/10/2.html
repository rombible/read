We stand afar off from God by our unbelief, and then complain that God stands afar off from us. Passionate words against bad men do more hurt than good; if we speak of their badness, let it be to the Lord in prayer; he can make them better. The sinner proudly glories in his power and success. Wicked people will not seek after God, that is, will not call upon him. They live without prayer, and that is living without God. They have many thoughts, many objects and devices, but think not of the Lord in any of them; they have no submission to his will, nor aim for his glory. The cause of this is pride. Men think it below them to be religious. They could not break all the laws of justice and goodness toward man, if they had not first shaken off all sense of religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wicked in his pride - Margin: "In the pride of the wicked he doth." The margin is a literal translation of the Hebrew; but the sense is the same. The meaning is, that the fact that the wicked persecuted the poor, in the case referred to, was to be traced to his pride, haughtiness, ambition; that is, in pursuing his own selfish and ambitious purposes, he became utterly regardless of the rights and comforts of others. He esteemed their interest and happiness as unworthy of regard in comparison with his own aims and purposes, and trampled down all their rights in prosecuting his own ends. The term "wicked" here - in the original in the singular number, &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;  ra&#772;sha&#770;&#8219;, though perhaps used collectively - means properly the wicked one, or the wicked man, and doubtless refers to some enemy that David had in his eye, and from whom he was at that time suffering wrong. It is not possible now to ascertain with certainty who this was; but as the whole description proceeds in the singular number <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-3.htm">Psalm 10:3-11</a>, it is most natural to suppose that this refers to one individual.<p>Doth persecute the poor - &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1500;&#1511;  yidelaq &#8219;a&#770;n&#305;&#770;y. Prof. Alexander renders this, "burns the sufferer." Luther, muss der Elende leiden - "must the afflicted suffer." DeWette: angstigen sich die Elenden. The Latin Vulgate: "When the impious (man) is proud, the poor (man) is burned:" incenditur pauper. So the Septuagint. Gesenius (Lexicon) supposes it means, to burn with anguish. Horsley renders it, "In the exaltation of the impious one the helpless is consumed." But it seems to me that our common version has expressed the true sense. The word rendered persecuteth - &#1491;&#1500;&#1511;  da&#770;laq - means properly to burn, to flame; then to burn with love, with anger; then to burn after anyone, to persecute. See it; explained in the notes at <a href="/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>. According to the most natural application of the word here, it would seem to mean, "In the pride of the wicked, he persecutes the poor or the afflicted;" that is, he burns after him; he is inflamed against him; he hotly pursues him. The word poor in this place - &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;  &#8219;a&#770;n&#305;&#770;y - means the afflicted; the crushed; the downtrodden; those in circumstances of humiliation and poverty. The psalmist doubtless refers to himself as a poor and persecuted man; and the time in his life would seem to be when he was without a protector or friend, probably before he came to the throne.<p>Let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined - The artifice, plan, or scheme, which they have formed. That is, they have formed a scheme to take advantage of, or to destroy others; and the psalmist prays that, as a just retribution, this very calamity may come upon them. No man could have a right to complain if the mischief and wrong which he had devised for others should be brought upon himself; and if it were certain that this in all eases would occur, there could be nothing that would so effectually deter men from wrongdoing. The psalmist, then, simply prays that justice might be done. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/5-10.htm">Psalm 5:10</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a>, notes. The plural form of the verb is used here, but it is not certain that the psalmist had more than one enemy in view, for on expressing his feelings toward that one enemy he may have designed to use language which would be applicable to all in similar circumstances. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The accusation divides itself into two distinct charges - pride and tyranny; the one the root and cause of the other. The second sentence is the humble petition of the oppressed: "Let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined." The prayer is reasonable, just, and natural. Even our enemies themselves being judges, it is but right that men should be done by as they wished to do to others. We only weigh you in your own scales, and measure your corn with your own bushel. Terrible shall be the day, O persecuting Babylon! when thou shalt be made to drink of the winecup which thou thyself hast filled to the brim with the blood of saints. There are none who will dispute the justice of God, when he shall hang every Haman on his own gallows, and cast all the enemies of his Daniels into their own den of lions.<p><a href="/psalms/10-3.htm">Psalm 10:3</a><p>The indictment being read, and the petition presented, the evidence is now heard upon the first count. The evidence is very full and conclusive upon the matter of pride, and no jury could hesitate to give a verdict against the prisoner at the bar. Let us, however, hear the witnesses one by one. The first testifies that he is a boaster. "For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire." He is a very silly boaster, for he glories in a mere desire: a very brazen-faced boaster, for that desire is villainy; and a most abandoned sinner, to boast of that which is his shame. Bragging sinners are the worst and most contemptible of men, especially when their filthy desires - too filthy to be carried into act - become the theme of their boastings. When Mr. Hate-Good and Mr. Heady are joined in partnership, they drive a brisk trade in the devil's wares. This one proof is enough to condemn the prisoner at the bar. Take him away, jailor! But stay, another witness desires to be sworn and heard. This time, the impudence of the proud rebel is even more apparent; for he "blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth." This is insolence, which is pride unmasked. He is haughty enough to differ from the Judge of all the earth, and bless the men whom God hath cursed. So did the sinful generation in the days of Malachi, who called the proud happy, and set up those that worked wickedness (<a href="/malachi/3-15.htm">Malachi 3:15</a>).

The "poor" is the good and gracious man, who is commonly poor in this world's things, and is sensibly poor in spirit, or sensible of his spiritual poverty; or he is so called because "afflicted", as the word signifies; and he is afflicted because he is poor: these two characters generally go together. The "wicked" man is the wicked one, the lawless one, the man of sin, and son of perdition, antichrist, the great persecutor of Christ's poor saints and faithful witnesses, more or less, ever since he has been in power; and which arises from the "pride" of his heart, not bearing that any should refuse to pay homage to him, contradict his will, or dissent from him. The word (s) signifies to follow after, to pursue, as Jarchi, Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, interpret it; and "to pursue hotly", as it is rendered in <a href="/genesis/31-36.htm">Genesis 31:36</a>; and denotes the vehemence and heat of his wrath and fury, with which antichrist persecutes the followers of the Lamb; hence persecution is compared to the heat of the sun, <a href="/matthew/13-6.htm">Matthew 13:6</a>; Some render the words, "through the pride of the wicked the poor is burned", or "the poor burns" (t): which may be understood either literally, of the burning of the martyrs of Jesus by antichrist, as here in Queen Mary's days; and which was foretold, that some of the saints should fall by flame, as well as by sword, captivity, and spoil; and to which that part of the description of Christ answers, whose feet are said to be like fine brass, as if it burned in a furnace; and which is prefaced to the epistle to the church at Thyatira, which is an emblem of the apostate church: see <a href="/daniel/11-33.htm">Daniel 11:33</a>; or figuratively, of the poor saints burning with grief at the pride and wickedness of the man of sin, and with zeal for the honour and glory of God; see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-29.htm">2 Corinthians 11:29</a>, Sol 8:6; <p>let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined: we read the words as a petition; and so the sense is, let the wicked persecutors be taken in the wicked and crafty schemes which they have devised for the hurt of others, as they are, or will be; see <a href="/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>. But the psalmist is not yet come to petitions, nor does he until <a href="/psalms/10-12.htm">Psalm 10:12</a>; but is all along describing the wickedness of the wicked one. It seems better therefore to render the words as do the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions, "they are taken in the devices that they have imagined": and the meaning is, that the poor, who are persecuted by the wicked, are taken by their crafty schemes they lay for them, as Jarchi interprets it, and are put to death by them. So these words show the issue and event of persecution: and this sense best agrees with the boasted success of the wicked man <a href="/psalms/10-3.htm">Psalm 10:3</a>. <p>(s) "fervide persequitur", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "ferventer", Gejerus; so Ainsworth.

Some, however, translate, "They (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the poor) are ensnared in the devices which they (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wicked) have imagined;" and this is certainly a possible rendering.

Having interpreted the &#1492;-strophe as the representation of the earlier &#1510;&#1506;&#1511;&#1514; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; we have no need to supply dicendo or dicturus, as Seb.

The verb &#1496;&#1489;&#1506; (root &#1496;&#1489;, whence also &#1496;&#1489;&#1500;) signifies originally to press upon anything with anything flat, to be pressed into, then, as here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-15.htm">Psalm 69:15</a>, to sink in. &#1496;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; (pausal form in connection with Mugrash) in the parallel member of the verse corresponds to the attributive &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a>). The union of the epicene &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; with &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; by Makkeph proceeds from the view, that &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; is demonstrative as in <a href="/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a> : the net there (which they have hidden). The punctuation, it is true, recognises a relative &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/psalms/17-9.htm">Psalm 17:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-29.htm">Psalm 68:29</a>, but it mostly takes it as demonstrative, inasmuch as it connects it closely with the preceding noun, either by Makkeph (<a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/143-8.htm">Psalm 143:8</a>) or by marking the noun with a conjunctive accent (<a href="/psalms/10-2.htm">Psalm 10:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-5.htm">Psalm 31:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-12.htm">Psalm 132:12</a>). The verb &#1500;&#1499;&#1491; (Arabic to hang on, adhere to, IV to hold fast to) has the signification of seizing and catching in Hebrew.<p>In <a href="/psalms/9-17.htm">Psalm 9:17</a> Ben Naphtali points &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; with a&#772;: Jahve is known (part.

The readings of Ben Asher have become the textus receptus. That by which Jahve has made Himself known is stated immediately: He has executed judgment or right, by ensnaring the evil-doer (&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, as in <a href="/psalms/9-6.htm">Psalm 9:6</a>) in his own craftily planned work designed for the destruction of Israel. Thus Gussetius has already interpreted it. &#1504;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; is part. Kal from &#1504;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;. If it were part.

But it is not to be translated, with Ges. and Hengst.: "the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands," in which case it would have to be pointed &#1504;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; (3 praet.
