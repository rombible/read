God prepares the heart for prayer, by kindling holy desires, and strengthening our most holy faith, fixing the thoughts, and raising the affections, and then he graciously accepts the prayer. The preparation of the heart is from the Lord, and we must seek unto him for it. Let the poor, afflicted, persecuted, or tempted believer recollect, that Satan is the prince of this world, and that he is the father of all the ungodly. The children of God cannot expect kindness, truth, or justice from such persons as crucified the Lord of glory. But this once suffering Jesus, now reigns as King over all the earth, and of his dominion there shall be no end. Let us commit ourselves unto him, humbly trusting in his mercy. He will rescue the believer from every temptation, and break the arm of every wicked oppressor, and bruise Satan under our feet shortly. But in heaven alone will all sin and temptation be shut out, though in this life the believer has a foretaste of deliverance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast seen it - Thou seest all. Though people act as if their conduct was not observed, yet thou art intimately acquainted with all that they do. The workers of iniquity cannot hide themselves. The idea here is, that although God seemed not to notice the conduct of the wicked, and though the wicked acted as if he did not, yet that all this was seen by God, and that he would deal with men according to justice and to truth.<p>For thou beholdest mischief - All that is done on the earth, though perhaps in this case referring particularly to that which gave the psalmist trouble.<p>And spite - The word spite with us, though it originally denoted rancour, malice, ill-will, now denotes usually a less deliberate and fixed malice than is indicated by those words, but is used to denote a sudden fit of ill-will excited by temporary vexation. It relates to small subjects, and is accompanied with a desire of petty revenge, and implies that one would be gratified with the disappointment or misfortune of another. The word here, however, in the original, means anger, wrath, malice; and the idea is, that God had seen all the anger of the enemies of the psalmist.<p>To requite it with thy hand - By thine own interposition or agency - the hand being the instrument by which we accomplish anything. The idea is, that the psalmist felt assured that God would not pass this over. Though the wicked acted as if he did not see or regard their conduct, yet the psalmist felt assured that God would not be unmindful of it, but would, in due time, visit them with deserved punishment.<p>The poor committeth himself unto thee - Margin, "leaveth." The word rendered poor is the same as that which occurs in <a href="/psalms/10-10.htm">Psalm 10:10</a>. It means here those who are helpless and defenseless; the oppressed and the downtrodden. The word committeth or leaveth means that he leaves his cause with God; he trusts in his protection and interposition; he gives himself no anxiety as to the result. He knows that God can deliver him if he sees that it is best; and he is assured that God will do that which it is best should be done.<p>Thou art the helper of the fatherless - That is, this is the general character of God - the character in which he has revealed himself to man. Compare <a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/82-3.htm">Psalm 82:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-11.htm">Jeremiah 49:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/14-3.htm">Hosea 14:3</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>. The psalmist here refers to the "general character" of God as that in which all the oppressed, the crushed, the helpless may trust; and he mentions this particular case as one that best illustrated that character. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. mischief and spite&#8212;provocation and trouble of the sufferer (compare Ps 6:7; 7:14).<p>committeth&#8212;or, "leaves (his burden) on Thee."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast seen it; </span> or, <span class="ital">but thou hast seen it</span>, and therefore they are horribly mistaken, as they will find to their cost. <span class="ital">For</span>; or, <span class="ital">surely</span>, as this particle is oft used, as <span class="bld"><a href="/job/8-6.htm" title="If you were pure and upright; surely now he would awake for you, and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.">Job 8:6</a> <a href="/psalms/73-18.htm" title="Surely you did set them in slippery places: you cast them down into destruction.">Psalm 73:18</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou beholdest; </span> not as an idle spectator, but with an eye of observation and vindication, as it follows. <span class="ital">Mischief and spite</span>, i.e. all the injurious and spiteful or malicious carriages of wicked men towards those who are more righteous than they. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To requite it with thy hand, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">to give</span> (i.e. to restore or pay, the simple verb for the compound; which is usual in the Hebrew tongue) <span class="ital">it</span> (to wit, the mischief which they have done to others) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">with thy hand, </span> i.e. by thy own immediate and extraordinary providence, because the oppressed were destitute of all other succours.

Though the wicked say God will never see, <a href="/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>; he sees all things in general, all men and all their actions; all are manifest and open to him, and everything in particular, especially the wickedness of men; even that which is said or thought in the heart; <p>for thou beholdest mischief and spite; that mischief which arises from spite or malice in the heart; God beholds the inward principle from whence it proceeds, as well as that itself; the mischief devised in the heart, on the bed, and which lies under the tongue, designed against the people of God, either to the injury of their characters and estates, or to their bodies, and even to their souls, as much as in them lies, proceeding from implacable malice and enmity to them; <p>to requite it with thy hand: of power, to retaliate it upon their own heads, to render tribulation to them that trouble the saints, which is but a righteous thing with God: or "to put it in thy hand" (k); and the sense is, that God looks upon all the injuries the wicked out of spite devise to do to his people, and puts them in his hand, that they may be ever before him, and always in his sight, and he will take a proper opportunity of avenging them. The Targum interprets it of God's rewarding good men, as well as punishing the wicked, paraphrasing the whole thus, <p>"it is manifest before thee that thou wilt send sorrow and wrath upon the wicked; thou lookest to render a good reward to the righteous with thy hand;'' <p>the poor committeth himself unto thee: his body, and the outward concerns of life, as to a faithful Creator; his soul, and the spiritual and eternal welfare of it, as to the only Saviour and Redeemer; he commits all his ways to him, as the God of providence and grace; and at last he commits his spirit to him at death, as to his covenant God and Father: the words may be rendered, "the poor leaveth upon thee" (l); that is, he leaves himself and his upon the Lord; he leaves his burden on him, he casts all his care upon him, as he is advised and encouraged to do; he leaves his cause with him to plead it for him, who will plead it thoroughly and maintain it: the phrase is expressive of the poor's faith and hope in God; hence the Chaldee paraphrase renders it, "on thee will thy poor ones hope"; for the supply of their wants, and for help and assistance against their enemies; <p>thou art the helper of the fatherless; God is the Father of them, provides for them, supplies, supports, and defends them; nor will he in a spiritual sense leave his people orphans or comfortless, but will visit and help them; see <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; <p>(k)  "ut ponas in manibus tuis", Vatablus, Cocceius.

Faith triumphs over appearances, for it rests on the unchanging character of God, Who never ceases to ‘behold,’ to observe all that goes on upon the earth.

It is an appeal to experience. The ‘fatherless’ (or ‘orphan’) is mentioned as a typical example of the friendless and unprotected, who are under God’s special guardianship. Cp. the primitive law of <a href="/exodus/22-22.htm" title="You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.">Exodus 22:22</a> ff., reechoed in the latest utterance of prophecy, <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm" title="And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:5</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast seen it</span>.

The picture fixes upon one simple feature in which the meanness of the ungodly culminates; and it is possible that it is intended to be taken as emblematical rather than literally. &#1495;&#1510;&#1512; (from &#1495;&#1510;&#1512; to surround, cf. Arab. hdr, hs&#803;r, and especially hdr) is a farm premises walled in (Arab. hadar, hada&#770;r, hada&#770;ra), then losing the special characteristic of being walled round it comes to mean generally a settled abode (with a house of clay or stone) in opposition to a roaming life in tents (cf. <a href="/leviticus/25-31.htm">Leviticus 25:31</a>; <a href="/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>). In such a place where men are more sure of falling into his hands than in the open plain, he lies in wait (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, like Arab. q&#8219;d lh, subsedit  equals  insidiatus est ei), murders unobserved him who had never provoked his vengeance, and his eyes &#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; &#1497;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. &#1510;&#1508;&#1492; to spie, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-32.htm">Psalm 37:32</a>, might have been used instead of &#1510;&#1508;&#1503;; but &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; also obtains the meaning, to lie in ambush (<a href="/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>, <a href="/proverbs/1-18.htm">Proverbs 1:18</a>) from the primary notion of restraining one's self (Arab. d&#803;fn, fut. i. in Beduin Arabic: to keep still, to be immoveably lost in thought, vid., on <a href="/job/24-1.htm">Job 24:1</a>), which takes a transitive turn in &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; "to conceal." &#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492;, the dative of the object, is pointed just as though it came from &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;: Thy host, i.e., Thy church, O Jahve. The pausal form accordingly is &#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; with Segol, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-14.htm">Psalm 10:14</a>, not with S&#803;ere as in incorrect editions. And the appeal against this interpretation, which is found in the plur. &#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-10.htm">Psalm 10:10</a>, is set aside by the fact that this plural is taken as a double word: host (&#1495;&#1500;  equals  &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;  equals  &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; as in <a href="/obadiah/1-20.htm">Obadiah 1:20</a>) of the troubled ones (&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, not as Ben-Labrat supposes, for &#1504;&#1499;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, but from &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; weary, and mellow and decayed), as the Ker (which is followed by the Syriac version) and the Masora direct, and accordingly it is pointed &#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; with S&#803;ere. The punctuation therefore sets aside a word which was unintelligible to it, and cannot be binding on us. There is a verb &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, which, it is true, does not occur in the Old Testament, but in the Arabic, from the root Arab. h&#803;k, firmus fuit, firmum fecit (whence also Arab. h&#803;kl, intrans. to be firm, ferm, i.e., closed), it gains the signification in reference to colour: to be dark (cognate with &#1495;&#1499;&#1500;, whence &#1495;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;) and is also transferred to the gloom and blackness of misfortune.<p>(Note: Cf. Samachschari's Golden Necklaces, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/67.htm">Proverbs 67</a>, which Fleischer translates: "Which is blacker: the plumage of the raven, which is black as coal, or thy life, O stranger among strangers?" The word "blacker" is here expressed by Arab. ahlaku, just as the verb Arab. halika, with its infinitives halak or hulkat and its derivatives is applied to sorrow and misery.)<p>From this an abstract is formed &#1495;&#1500;&#1498; or &#1495;&#1500;&#1498; (like &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;): blackness, misfortune, or also of a defective development of the senses: imbecility; and from this an adjective &#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, or also (cf. &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, &#1506;&#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; <a href="/ezekiel/31-15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a>  equals  one in a condition of languishing, &#1506;&#1500;&#1507;) &#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, plur. &#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, after the form &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, Ew. 189, g. </body></html>
