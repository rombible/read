We must hope for that only which he has promised in his word. Like those who wish to see the dawn, being very desirous that light would come long before day; but still more earnestly does a good man long for the tokens of God's favour, and the visits of his grace. Let all that devote themselves to the Lord, cheerfully stay themselves on him. This redemption is redemption from all sin. Jesus Christ saves his people from their sins, both from the condemning and from the commanding power of sin. It is plenteous redemption; there is an all-sufficient fulness in the Redeemer, enough for all, enough for each; therefore enough for me, says the believer. Redemption from sin includes redemption from all other evils, therefore it is a plenteous redemption, through the atoning blood of Jesus, who shall redeem his people from all their sins. All that wait on God for mercy and grace, are sure to have peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/130.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I wait for the Lord - That is, in this state of distress and trouble - from these "depths" of woe, and sorrow, and conviction of sin. This implies two things:<p>(1) that he had no other dependence;<p>(2) that his soul was actually in a waiting posture, or that he actually looked to the Lord for his interposition.<p>My soul doth wait - I wait, with all my soul and heart.<p>And in his word do I hope - In his promise. I believe that he will fulfill that promise, and that I shall find a gracious answer to my prayers. Under conviction for sin, under deep sorrow and distress of any kind, this is the only hope of man. If God does not interpose, there is no deliverer; that he will interpose we may feel assured, if we come to him with a humble, a believing, and a penitent heart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/130.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6. wait for the Lord&#8212;in expectation (Ps 27:14).<p>watch for, &c.&#8212;in earnestness and anxiety.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/130.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I wait for the Lord, </span> that he would manifest his favour to me in the pardon of my sins. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In his word; </span> wherein he hath declared his merciful nature, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/34-6.htm" title="And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,">Exodus 34:6</a>,7</span>, and his gracious purpose and promises for the pardoning of sinners. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/130.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I wait for the Lord,.... For his gracious presence and the light of his countenance, being in darkness, as well as in the deep; for his salvation and deliverance out of the depths of distress; for an answer of prayer, having cried unto him for application of pardoning grace he had some view and hopes of; and for the performance of promises the Lord had made to him; and for eternal glory and happiness: all which are to be patiently and quietly waited for, God having his set time to do them; and may be confidently expected, since he is gracious and merciful, wise and powerful, faithful and immutable. David might also be waiting for the coming of Christ, as all the Old Testament saints did; through whom all the above are enjoyed; <p>my soul doth wait; which shows that this was not mere bodily service or waiting upon God and for him in an external way; but expresses the intenseness of his mind, the earnest desires of his heart after God, his affection for him, and the exercise of all other graces on him; his whole soul, and all the powers of it, were engaged in this work; <p>and in his word do I:hope: both in his essential Word the Messiah, who was the Hope of Israel as well as the Saviour of them; the object, ground, and foundation of hope, of all blessings, of grace and of glory: and in his word of promise concerning the coming of Christ, and salvation by him; concerning the pardon of sin through him, and eternal life by him; as well as in many other special and particular promises made to David, concerning himself, his family, and his kingdom. Arama and Kimchi interpret it of the promise of deliverance from captivity made to the Jews. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/130.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/130.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">I wait … my soul doth wait … do I hope</span>] The perfect tense of the original denotes what long has been, as well as what still is, the attitude of the Psalmist’s mind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in his word</span>] Of promise (<a href="/psalms/119-74.htm" title="They that fear you will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in your word.">Psalm 119:74</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-81.htm" title="My soul faints for your salvation: but I hope in your word.">Psalm 119:81</a>) to pardon and deliver: e.g. such prophecies as those in <a href="/context/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:...">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-8.htm" title="And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.">Jeremiah 33:8</a>; &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5–8</span>.

"Waiting for the Lord" is patiently bearing our affliction, whatever it may be, and confidently looking forward to deliverance from it in God's good time.

But side by side with the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of the lxx we also find the reading exanthee'sai; and in this sense Jerome renders (statim ut) viruerit, Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (to shoot into a stalk), Aquila &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, the Sexta &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (to attain to full solidity). The Targum paraphrases &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1507; in both senses: to shoot up and to pluck off. The former signification, after which Venema interprets: antequam se evaginet vel evaginetur, i.e., antequam e vaginulis suis se evolvat et succrescat, is also advocated by Parchon, Kimchi, and Aben-Ezra. In the same sense von Ortenberg conjectures &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1500;&#1507;. Since the grass of the house-tops or roofs, if one wishes to pull it up, can be pulled up just as well when it is withered as when it is green, and since it is the most natural thing to take &#1495;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; as the subject to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1507;, we decide in favour of the intransitive signification, "to put itself forth, to develope, shoot forth into ear." The roof-grass withers before it has put forth ears of blossoms, just because it has no deep root, and therefore cannot stand against the heat of the sun.<p>(Note: So, too, Geiger in the Deutsche Morgenlndische Zeitschrift, xiv. 278f., according to whom Arab. slf (s&#780;lf) occurs in Saadia and Abu-Said in the signification "to be in the first maturity, to blossom," - a sense &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1507; may also have here; cf. the Talmudic &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1508;&#1508;&#1497; used of unripe dates that are still in blossom.)<p>The poet pursues the figure of the grass of the house-tops still further. The encompassing lap or bosom (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) is called elsewhere &#1495;&#1510;&#1503; (<a href="/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-13.htm">Nehemiah 5:13</a>); here it is &#1495;&#1510;&#1503;, like the Arabic h&#803;id&#803;n (diminutive h&#803;od&#803;ein), of the same root with &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1494;, a creek, in <a href="/psalms/107-30.htm">Psalm 107:30</a>. The enemies of Israel are as grass upon the house-tops, which is not garnered in; their life closes with sure destruction, the germ of which they (without any need for any rooting out) carry within themselves. The observation of Knapp, that any Western poet would have left off with <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a>, is based upon the error that <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/129-7.htm">Psalm 129:7-8</a> are an idle embellishment. The greeting addressed to the reapers in <a href="/psalms/129-8.htm">Psalm 129:8</a> is taken from life; it is not denied even to heathen reapers. Similarly Boaz (<a href="/ruth/2-4.htm">Ruth 2:4</a>) greets them with "Jahve be with you," and receivers the counter-salutation, "Jahve bless thee." Here it is the passers-by who call out to those who are harvesting: The blessing (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;) of Jahve happen to you (&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;,<p>(Note: Here and there &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; is found as an error of the copyist. The Hebrew Psalter, Basel 1547, 12mo, notes it as a various reading.)<p>as in the Aaronitish blessing), and (since "we bless you in the name of Jahve" would be a purposeless excess of politeness in the mouth of the same speakers) receive in their turn the counter-salutation: We bless you in the name of Jahve. As a contrast it follows that there is before the righteous a garnering in of that which they have sown amidst the exchange of joyful benedictory greetings. </body></html>
