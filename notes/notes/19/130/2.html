Many things present themselves as diversions, many things offer themselves as remedies, but the soul finds that the Lord alone can heal. And until men are sensible of the guilt of sin, and quit all to come at once to God, it is in vain for them to expect any relief. The Holy Ghost gives to such poor souls a fresh sense of their deep necessity, to stir them up in earnest applications, by the prayer of faith, by crying to God. And as they love their souls, as they are concerned for the glory of the Lord, they are not to be wanting in this duty. Why is it that these matters are so long uncertain with them? Is it not from sloth and despondency that they content themselves with common and customary applications to God? Then let us up and be doing; it must be done, and it is attended with safety. We are to humble ourselves before God, as guilty in his sight. Let us acknowledge our sinfulness; we cannot justify ourselves, or plead not guilty. It is our unspeakable comfort that there is forgiveness with him, for that is what we need. Jesus Christ is the great Ransom; he is ever an Advocate for us, and through him we hope to obtain forgiveness. There is forgiveness with thee, not that thou mayest be presumed upon, but that thou mayest be feared. The fear of God often is put for the whole worship of God. The only motive and encouragement for sinners is this, that there is forgiveness with the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/130.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lord, hear my voice - This is the prayer; this is what he cried.

It is therefore: they drew their furrow-turning long (dative of the object instead of the accusative with Hiph., as e.g., in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-2.htm">Isaiah 29:2</a>, cf. with Piel in <a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/116-16.htm">Psalm 116:16</a>, and Kal <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-6.htm">Psalm 69:6</a>, after the Aramaic style, although it is not unhebraic). Righteous is Jahve - this is an universal truth, which has been verified in the present circumstances; - He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked (&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; as in <a href="/psalms/2-3.htm">Psalm 2:3</a>; here, however, it is suggested by the metaphor in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>, cf. <a href="/job/39-10.htm">Job 39:10</a>; lxx &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, i.e., &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1511;), with which they held Israel bound. From that which has just been experienced Israel derives the hope that all Zion's haters (a newly coined name for the enemies of the religion of Israel) will be obliged to retreat with shame and confusion. </body></html>
