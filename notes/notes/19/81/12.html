We may have enough from God, if we pray for it in faith. All the wickedness of the world is owing to man's wilfulness. People are not religious, because they will not be so. God is not the Author of their sin, he leaves them to the lusts of their own hearts, and the counsels of their own heads; if they do not well, the blame must be upon themselves. The Lord is unwilling that any should perish. What enemies sinners are to themselves! It is sin that makes our troubles long, and our salvation slow. Upon the same conditions of faith and obedience, do Christians hold those spiritual and eternal good things, which the pleasant fields and fertile hills of Canaan showed forth. Christ is the Bread of life; he is the Rock of salvation, and his promises are as honey to pious minds. But those who reject him as their Lord and Master, must also lose him as their Saviour and their reward.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/81.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust - Margin, as in Hebrew, to the hardness of their own hearts. Literally, "I sent them, or I dismissed them, to the hardness of their hearts." I suffered them to have what, in the hardness of their hearts they desired, or what their hard and rebellious hearts prompted them to desire: I indulged them in their wishes. I gave them what they asked, and left them to themselves to work out the problem about success and happiness in their own way - to let them see what must be the result of forsaking the true God. The world - and the church too - has been often suffered to make this experiment.<p>And they walked in their own counsels - As they thought wise and best.

Sometimes God gave them up, when they sinned, into the hands of the Moabites, or Ammonites, or Philistines, or other neighbouring nations, for their chastisement; but to be delivered up unto their own hearts' lust is worse than that; nay, than to be delivered to Satan: salvation may be the consequence of that, but damnation of this; and yet it is a righteous judgment; for as men like not to retain God in their knowledge, it is but just with him to give them up to vile affections, to a reprobate mind, to do things not convenient, <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a> there is nothing men are more desirous of than to have their hearts' lusts; and there is no greater judgment can befall them than to be left to the power of them, which must unavoidably issue in their ruin here and hereafter: and they walked in their own counsels; which were bad; after the imagination of their own evil hearts, and not after the counsels and directions of God in his word, and by his servants. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/81.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/81.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>.

It begins, as one would expect in a Passover speech, with a reference to the &#1505;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; of Egypt (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11-14</a>; <a href="/exodus/5-4.htm">Exodus 5:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>.), and to the duwd, the task-basket for the transport of the clay and of the bricks (<a href="/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/5-7.htm">Exodus 5:7</a>.).<p>(Note: In the Papyrus Leydensis i. 346 the Israelites are called the "Aperiu (&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;), who dragged along the stones for the great watch-tower of the city of Rameses," and in the Pap. Leyd. i. 349, according to Lauth, the "Aperiu, who dragged along the stones for the storehouse of the city of Rameses.")<p>Out of such distress did He free the poor people who cried for deliverance (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>); He answered them &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1512;&#1506;&#1501;, i.e., not (according to <a href="/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>): affording them protection against the storm, but (according to <a href="/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/77-17.htm">Psalm 77:17</a>.): out of the thunder-clouds in which He at the same time revealed and veiled Himself, casting down the enemies of Israel with His lightnings, which is intended to refer pre-eminently to the passage through the Red Sea (vid., <a href="/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a>); and He proved them (&#1488;&#1489;&#1495;&#1504;&#1498;, with o&#774; contracted from o&#772;, cf. on <a href="/job/35-6.htm">Job 35:6</a>) at the waters of Merbah, viz., whether they would trust Him further on after such glorious tokens of His power and loving-kindness. The name "Waters of Mer&#305;&#770;bah," which properly is borne only by Mer&#305;&#770;bath Kadesh, the place of the giving of water in the fortieth year (<a href="/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>), is here transferred to the place of the giving of water in the first year, which was named Massah u-Mer&#305;&#770;bah (<a href="/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>), as the remembrances of these two miracles, which took place under similar circumstances, in general blend together (vid., on <a href="/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a>.). It is not now said that Israel did not act in response to the expectation of God, who had son wondrously verified Himself; the music, as Seal imports, here rises, and makes a long and forcible pause in what is being said. What now follows further, are, as the further progress of <a href="/psalms/81-12.htm">Psalm 81:12</a> shows, the words of God addressed to the Israel of the desert, which at the same time with its faithfulness are brought to the remembrance of the Israel of the present. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-19.htm">Deuteronomy 8:19</a>, to bear testimony that concerns him against any one. &#1488;&#1501; (according to the sense, o si, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>, which is in many ways akin to this Psalm) properly opens a searching question which wishes that the thing asked may come about (whether thou wilt indeed give me a willing hearing?!). In <a href="/psalms/81-10.htm">Psalm 81:10</a> the key-note of the revelation of the Law from Sinai is struck: the fundamental command which opens the decalogue demanded fidelity to Jahve and forbade idol-worship as the sin of sins. &#1488;&#1500; &#1494;&#1512; is an idol in opposition to the God of Israel as the true God; and &#1488;&#1500; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;, a strange god in opposition to the true God as the God of Israel. To this one God Israel ought to yield itself all the more undividedly and heartily as it was more manifestly indebted entirely to Him, who in His condescension had chosen it, and in His wonder-working might had redeemed it (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1498;, part.
