What God had done on Israel's behalf, was kept in remembrance by public solemnities. To make a deliverance appear more gracious, more glorious, it is good to observe all that makes the trouble we are delivered from appear more grievous. We ought never to forget the base and ruinous drudgery to which Satan, our oppressor, brought us. But when, in distress of conscience, we are led to cry for deliverance, the Lord answers our prayers, and sets us at liberty. Convictions of sin, and trials by affliction, prove his regard to his people. If the Jews, on their solemn feast-days, were thus to call to mind their redemption out of Egypt, much more ought we, on the Christian sabbath, to call to mind a more glorious redemption, wrought out for us by our Lord Jesus Christ, from worse bondage.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/81.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Take a psalm - literally, "Lift up a psalm; perhaps, as we should say, "Raise the tune."

The retrospective description begins, as is rarely the case, with the second modus, inasmuch as "the speaker thinks more of the bare nature of the act than of the time" (Ew. 136, b). As in the blessing of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>) Joseph is compared to the layer (&#1489;&#1468;&#1503;) of a fruitful growth (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;), whose shoots (&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;) climb over the wall: so here Israel is compared to a vine (<a href="/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>; &#1490;&#1468;&#1508;&#1503; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>), which has become great in Egypt and been transplanted thence into the Land of Promise. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;, lxx &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-10.htm">Job 19:10</a>, perhaps with an allusion to the &#1502;&#1505;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; of the people journeying to Canaan (<a href="/psalms/78-52.htm">Psalm 78:52</a>).<p>(Note: Exod. Rabba, ch. 44, with reference to this passage, says: "When husbandmen seek to improve a vine, what do they do? They root (&#1506;&#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;) it out of its place and plant (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;) it in another." And Levit. Rabba, ch. 36, says: "As one does not plant a vine in a place where there are great, rough stones, but examines the ground and then plants it, so didst Thou drive out peoples and didst plant it," etc.)<p>Here God made His vine a way and a place (&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, to clear, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, to turn, turn aside, Arabic fanija, to disappear, pass away; root &#1508;&#1503;, to urge forward), and after He had secured to it a free soil and unchecked possibility of extension, it (the vine) rooted its roots, i.e., struck them ever deeper and wider, and filled the earth round about (cf. the antitype in the final days, <a href="/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>). The Israelitish kingdom of God extended itself on every side in accordance with the promise. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6</a>, and vegetable &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, a shoot) also has the vine as its subject, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80-11.htm">Psalm 80:11-12</a> state this in a continued allegory, by the "mountains" pointing to the southern boundary, by the "cedars" to the northern, by the "sea" to the western, and by the "river" (Euphrates) to the eastern boundary of the country (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a> and other passages). &#1510;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; and &#1506;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492; are accusatives of the so-called more remote object (Ges. 143, 1). &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; is a cutting  equals  a branch; &#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1514;, a (vegetable) sucker  equals  a young, tender shoot; &#1488;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;, the cedars of Lebanon as being living monuments of the creative might of God. The allegory exceeds the measure of the reality of nature, inasmuch as this is obliged to be extended according to the reality of that which is typified and historical. But how unlike to the former times is the present! The poet asks "wherefore?" for the present state of things is a riddle to him. The surroundings of the vine are torn down; all who come in contact with it pluck it (&#1488;&#1512;&#1492;, to pick off, pluck off, Talmudic of the gathering of figs); the boar out of the wood (&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;&#1512; with &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1514;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;, Ajin)<p>(Note: According to Kiddushin, 30a, because this Ajin is the middle letter of the Psalter as the Waw of &#1490;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-42.htm">Leviticus 11:42</a>, is the middle letter of the Tra. One would hardly like to be at the pains of proving the correctness of this statement; nevertheless in the seventeenth century there lived one Laymarius, a clergyman, who was not afraid of this trouble, and found the calculations of the Masora (e.g., that &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492; occurs 222 times) in part inaccurate; vid., Monatliche Unterredungen, 1691, S. 467, and besides, Geiger, Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel, S. 258f.))<p>cuts it off (&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1501;, formed out of &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1501;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1501;<p>(Note: Saadia appropriately renders it Arab. yqrd&#803;ha&#770;, by referring, as does Dunash also, to the Talmudic &#1511;&#1512;&#1505;&#1501;, which occurs of ants, like Arab. qrd&#803;, of rodents. So Peah ii. 7, Menachoth 71b, on which Rashi observes, "the locust (&#1495;&#1490;&#1489;) is accustomed to eat from above, the ant tears off the corn-stalk from below." Elsewhere &#1511;&#1497;&#1512;&#1505;&#1501; denotes the breaking off of dry branches from the tree, as &#1494;&#1512;&#1491; the removal of green branches.))<p>viz., with its tusks; and that which moves about the fields (vid., concerning &#1494;&#1497;&#1494;, <a href="/psalms/50-11.htm">Psalm 50:11</a>), i.e., the untractable, lively wild beast, devours it. Without doubt the poet associates a distinct nation with the wild boar in his mind; for animals are also in other instances the emblems of nations, as e.g., the leviathan, the water-serpent, the behemoth (<a href="/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>), and flies (<a href="/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>) are emblems of Egypt. The Midrash interprets it of Ser-Edom, and &#1494;&#1497;&#1494; &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>, of the nomadic Arabs.<p>In <a href="/psalms/80-15.htm">Psalm 80:15</a> the prayer begins for the third time with threefold urgency, supplicating for the vine renewed divine providence, and a renewal of the care of divine grace. We have divided the verse differently from the accentuation, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496; is to be understood according to Ges. 142. The junction by means of &#1493; is at once opposed to the supposition that &#1493;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a> signifies a slip or plant, plantam (Targum, Syriac, Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, and others), and that consequently the whole of <a href="/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a> is governed by &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;. Nor can it mean its (the vine's) stand or base, &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; (Bttcher), since one does not plant a "stand." The lxx renders &#1493;&#1499;&#1504;&#1492;: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, which is imper. aor. 1. med., therefore in the sense of &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492;.<p>(Note: Perhaps the Caph majusculum is the result of an erasure that required to be made, vid., Geiger, Urschrift, S. 295. Accordingly the Ajin suspensum might also be the result of a later inserted correction, for there is a Phoenician inscription that has &#1497;&#1512; (wood, forest); vid., Levy, Phnizisches Wrterbuch, S. 22.)<p>But the alternation of &#1506;&#1500; (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a>, and Arab. jn &#8219;la&#770;, to cover over) with the accusative of the object makes it more natural to derive &#1499;&#1504;&#1492;, not from &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1503;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, but from &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1503; Arab. kanna  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1503;, to cover, conceal, protect (whence Arab. kinn, a covering, shelter, hiding-place): and protect him whom...or: protect what Thy right hand has planted. The pointing certainly seems to take &#1499;&#1504;&#1492; as the feminine of &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; (lxx, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-7.htm">Daniel 11:7</a>, &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;); for an imperat. paragog. Kal of the form &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; does not occur elsewhere, although it might have been regarded by the punctuists as possible from the form &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, volve, <a href="/psalms/119-22.htm">Psalm 119:22</a>. If it is regarded as impossible, then one might read &#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;. At any rate the word is imperative, as the following &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, eum quem, also shows, instead of which, if &#1499;&#1504;&#1492; were a substantive, one would expect to find a relative clause without &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as in <a href="/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a>. Moreover <a href="/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a> requires this, since &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500; can only be used of visiting with punishment. And who then would the slip (branch) and the son of man be in distinction from the vine? If we take &#1489;&#1504;&#1492; as imperative, then, as one might expect, the vine and the son of man are both the people of God. The Targum renders <a href="/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a> thus: "and upon the King Messiah, whom Thou hast established for Thyself," after <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-12</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>; but, as in the latter passage, it is not the Christ Himself, but the nation out of which He is to proceed, that is meant. &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1509; has the sense of firm appropriation, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-14.htm">Isaiah 44:14</a>, inasmuch as the notion of making fast passes over into that of laying firm hold of, of seizure. Rosenmller well renders it: quem adoptatum tot nexibus tibi adstrinxisti.<p>The figure of the vine, which rules all the language here, is also still continued in <a href="/psalms/80-17.htm">Psalm 80:17</a>; for the partt. fem. refer to &#1490;&#1468;&#1508;&#1503; ot refer, - the verb, however, may take the plural form, because those of Israel are this "vine," which combusta igne, succisa (as in <a href="/isaiah/33-12.htm">Isaiah 33:12</a>; Aramaic, be cut off, tear off, in <a href="/psalms/80-13.htm">Psalm 80:13</a> the Targum word for &#1488;&#1512;&#1492;; Arabic, ksh&#803;, to clear away, peel off), is just perishing, or hangs in danger of destruction (&#1497;&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;) before the threatening of the wrathful countenance of God. The absence of anything to denote the subject, and the form of expression, which still keeps within the circle of the figure of the vine, forbid us to understand this <a href="/psalms/80-17.htm">Psalm 80:17</a> of the extirpation of the foes. According to the sense &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1498; &#1506;&#1500;<p>(Note: The &#1514;&#1492;&#1497; has Gaja, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1470;&#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; (<a href="/psalms/81-3.htm">Psalm 81:3</a>), &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1499;&#1512; (<a href="/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7</a>), and the like. This Gaja beside the Sheb (instead of beside the following vowel) belongs to the peculiarities of the metrical books, which in general, on account of their more melodious mode of delivery, have many such a Gaja beside Sheb, which does not occur in the prose books. Thus, e.g., &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; and &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; always have Gaja beside the Sheb when they have Rebia magnum without a conjunctive, probably because Rebia and Dech had such a fulness of tone that a first stroke fell even upon the Sheb-letters.)<p>coincides with the supplicatory &#1499;&#1504;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;.
