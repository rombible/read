It was not because they might not; they were fairly invited into covenant with God: it was not because they could not; for the word was nigh them, even in their mouth, and in their heart: it was purely because they would not.

We may have enough from God, if we pray for it in faith. All the wickedness of the world is owing to man's wilfulness. People are not religious, because they will not be so. God is not the Author of their sin, he leaves them to the lusts of their own hearts, and the counsels of their own heads; if they do not well, the blame must be upon themselves. The Lord is unwilling that any should perish. What enemies sinners are to themselves! It is sin that makes our troubles long, and our salvation slow. Upon the same conditions of faith and obedience, do Christians hold those spiritual and eternal good things, which the pleasant fields and fertile hills of Canaan showed forth. Christ is the Bread of life; he is the Rock of salvation, and his promises are as honey to pious minds. But those who reject him as their Lord and Master, must also lose him as their Saviour and their reward.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/81.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But my people ... - See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-10.htm">Psalm 78:10-11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17-19</a>.

It is called &#1495;&#1511; as being a legally sanctioned decree, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; as being a lawfully binding appointment, and &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; as being a positive declaration of the divine will. The &#1500; in &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; characterizes Israel as the receiver, in &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; the God of Israel as the owner, i.e., Author and Lawgiver. By &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;&#1514;&#1493; the establishing of the statute is dated back to the time of the Exodus; but the statement of the time of its being established, "when He went out over the land of Egypt," cannot be understood of the exodus of the people out of Egypt, natural as this may be here, where Israel has just been called &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; (pathetic for &#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507;), by a comparison with <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>, where Joseph is spoken of in the same words. For this expression does not describe the going forth out of a country, perhaps in the sight of its inhabitants, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-3.htm">Numbers 33:3</a>, cf. <a href="/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a> (Hengstenberg), but the going out over a country. Elohim is the subject, and &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; is to be understood according to <a href="/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4</a> (Kimchi, De Dieu, Dathe, Rosenmller, and others): when He went out for judgment over the land of Egypt (cf. <a href="/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>). This statement of the time of itself at once decides the reference of the Psalm to the Passover, which commemorates the sparing of Israel at that time (<a href="/exodus/12-27.htm">Exodus 12:27</a>), and which was instituted on that very night of judgment. The accentuation divides the verse correctly. According to this, &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is not a relative clause to &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;: where I heard a language that I understood not (<a href="/psalms/114-1.htm">Psalm 114:1</a>). Certainly &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1492;, "to understand a language," is an expression that is in itself not inadmissible (cf. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, to understand writing, to be able to read, <a href="/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11</a>.), the selection of which instead of the more customary phrase &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-19.htm">Isaiah 33:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>) might be easily intelligible here beside &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;; but the omission of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;) is harsh, the thought it here purposeless, and excluded with our way of taking &#1489;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;. From the speech of God that follows it is evident that the clause is intended to serve as an introduction of this divine speech, whether it now be rendered sermonem quem non novi (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-44.htm">Psalm 18:44</a>, populus quem non novi), or alicujus, quem non novi (Ges. 123, rem. 1), both of which are admissible. It is not in some way an introduction to the following speech of God as one which it has been suddenly given to the psalmist to hear: "An unknown language, or the language of one unknown, do I hear?" Thus Dderlein explains it: Subitanea et digna poetico impetu digressio, cum vates sese divino adflatu subito perculsum sentit et oraculum audire sibi persuadet; and in the same way De Wette, Olshausen, Hupfeld, and others. But the oracle of God cannot appear so strange to the Israelitish poet and seer as the spirit-voice to Eliphaz (<a href="/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16</a>); and moreover &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; after the foregoing historical predicates has the presumption of the imperfect signification in its favour. Thus, then, it will have to be interpreted according to <a href="/exodus/6-2.htm">Exodus 6:2</a>. It was the language of a known, but still also unknown God, which Israel heard in the redemption of that period. It was the God who had been made manifest as &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; only, so to speak, by way of prelude hitherto, who now appeared at this juncture of the patriarchal history, which had been all along kept in view, in the marvellous and new light of the judgment which was executed upon Egypt, and of the protection, redemption, and election of Israel, as being One hitherto unknown, as the history of salvation actually then, having arrived at Sinai, receives an entirely new form, inasmuch as from this time onwards the congregation or church is a nation, and Jahve the King of a nation, and the bond of union between them a national law educating it for the real, vital salvation that is to come. The words of Jahve that follow are now not the words heard then in the time of the Exodus. The remembrance of the words heard forms only a transition to those that now make themselves heard. For when the poet remembers the language which He who reveals Himself in a manner never before seen and heard of spoke to His people at that time, the Ever-living One Himself, who is yesterday and to-day the same One, speaks in order to remind His people of what He was to them then, and of what He spake to them then. </body></html>
