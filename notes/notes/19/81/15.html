We may have enough from God, if we pray for it in faith. All the wickedness of the world is owing to man's wilfulness. People are not religious, because they will not be so. God is not the Author of their sin, he leaves them to the lusts of their own hearts, and the counsels of their own heads; if they do not well, the blame must be upon themselves. The Lord is unwilling that any should perish. What enemies sinners are to themselves! It is sin that makes our troubles long, and our salvation slow. Upon the same conditions of faith and obedience, do Christians hold those spiritual and eternal good things, which the pleasant fields and fertile hills of Canaan showed forth. Christ is the Bread of life; he is the Rock of salvation, and his promises are as honey to pious minds. But those who reject him as their Lord and Master, must also lose him as their Saviour and their reward.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/81.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The haters of the Lord - The enemies of the Lord, often represented as those who hate him - hatred being always in fact or in form connected with an unwillingness to submit to God. It is hatred of his law; hatred of his government; hatred of his plans; hatred of his character. See <a href="/romans/1-30.htm">Romans 1:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/7-7.htm">John 7:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-23.htm">John 15:23-25</a>. Compare <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>.<p>Should have submitted themselves unto him - Margin, yielded retained obedience. Hebrew, lied. See the phrase explained in the notes at <a href="/psalms/18-44.htm">Psalm 18:44</a>. The meaning is, that they would have been so subdued as to acknowledge his authority or supremacy, while it is, at the same time, implied that this would have been forced and not cordial. No external power, though it may so conquer as to make people outwardly obedient, can affect the will, or subdue that. The grace of God alone can do that, and it is the special triumph of grace that it can do it.<p>But their time - The time of his people. They would have continued to be a happy and a flourishing nation.<p>Should have endured for ever - Perpetually - as long as they continued to be obedient. If a nation were obedient to the will of God; if it wholly obeyed his laws; if it countenanced by statute no form of sin; if it protected no iniquity; if it were temperate, just, virtuous, honest, there is no reason why its institutions should not be perpetual, or why it should ever be overthrown. Sin is, in all cases, the cause of the ruin of nations, as it is of individuals. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/81.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-16.

The name "Waters of Mer&#305;&#770;bah," which properly is borne only by Mer&#305;&#770;bath Kadesh, the place of the giving of water in the fortieth year (<a href="/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>), is here transferred to the place of the giving of water in the first year, which was named Massah u-Mer&#305;&#770;bah (<a href="/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>), as the remembrances of these two miracles, which took place under similar circumstances, in general blend together (vid., on <a href="/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a>.). It is not now said that Israel did not act in response to the expectation of God, who had son wondrously verified Himself; the music, as Seal imports, here rises, and makes a long and forcible pause in what is being said. What now follows further, are, as the further progress of <a href="/psalms/81-12.htm">Psalm 81:12</a> shows, the words of God addressed to the Israel of the desert, which at the same time with its faithfulness are brought to the remembrance of the Israel of the present. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-19.htm">Deuteronomy 8:19</a>, to bear testimony that concerns him against any one. &#1488;&#1501; (according to the sense, o si, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>, which is in many ways akin to this Psalm) properly opens a searching question which wishes that the thing asked may come about (whether thou wilt indeed give me a willing hearing?!). In <a href="/psalms/81-10.htm">Psalm 81:10</a> the key-note of the revelation of the Law from Sinai is struck: the fundamental command which opens the decalogue demanded fidelity to Jahve and forbade idol-worship as the sin of sins. &#1488;&#1500; &#1494;&#1512; is an idol in opposition to the God of Israel as the true God; and &#1488;&#1500; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;, a strange god in opposition to the true God as the God of Israel. To this one God Israel ought to yield itself all the more undividedly and heartily as it was more manifestly indebted entirely to Him, who in His condescension had chosen it, and in His wonder-working might had redeemed it (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1498;, part.
