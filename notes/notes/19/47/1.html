While his people express confidence and joy, and animate each other in serving him, let sinners submit to his authority, and accept his salvation. Jesus Christ shall subdue the Gentiles; he shall bring them as sheep into the fold, not for slaughter, but for preservation. He shall subdue their affections, and make them a willing people in the day of his power. Also it speaks of his giving them rest and settlement. Apply this spiritually; the Lord himself has undertaken to be the inheritance of his people. It shows the faith and submission of the saints.

The most natural and most enthusiastic tokens of exultation are to be used in view of the victories of the Lord, and his universal reign. Our joy in God may be demonstrative, and yet he will not censure it. "All ye people." The joy is to extend to all nations; Israel may lead the van, but all the Gentiles are to follow in the march of triumph, for they have an equal share in that Kingdom where there is neither Greek nor Jew, but Christ is all and in all. Even now if they did but know it, it is the best hope of all nations that Jehovah ruleth over them. If they cannot all speak the same tongue, the symbolic language of the hands they can all use. All people will be ruled by the Lord in the latter days, and will exult in that rule; were they wise they would submit to it now, and rejoice to do so; yea, they would clap their hands in rapture at the thought. "Shout," let your voices keep tune with your hands. "Unto God," let him have all the honours of the day, and let them be loud, joyous, universal, and undivided. "With the voice of triumph," with gladsome sounds, consonant with such splendid victories, so great a King, so excellent a rule, and such gladsome subjects. Many are human languages, and yet the nations may triumph as with one voice. Faith's view of God's government is full of transport. The prospect of the universal reign of the Prince of Peace is enough to make the tongue of the dumb sing; what will the reality be? Well might the poet of the seasons bid mountains and valleys raise their joyous hymn - <p>"For the Great Shepherd reigns,<p>And his unsuffering kingdom yet will come." <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm may seem to have been composed upon the occasion of that great solemnity of carrying the ark from the house of Obed-edom into the city of Zion; of which see 2Sa 6 1Ch 13 <span class="bld">1 Chronicles 16</span>. But as Zion was a type of the church, and the ark a type of Christ; so this hath a further reference, even to Christ’s ascension into heaven, and, as consequent thereunto, to the spreading of his kingdom in all the parts and nations of the world; which is the chief scope and design of the psalmist. or at least of the Holy Ghost, in this Psalm; as will plainly appear from the words and matter of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The church is exhorted to praise God, who subdueth her enemies, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/47-1.htm" title="O clap your hands, all you people; shout to God with the voice of triumph....">Psalm 47:1-3</a></span>, and giveth her an excellent inheritance, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/47-4.htm" title="He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved.

Wherefore they are called upon to declare their joy and gladness by "clapping their hands"; which is a gesture expressive of exultation and joy; see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/98-8.htm">Psalm 98:8</a>, <a href="/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a>. It was used at the unction and coronation of a king, <a href="/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12</a>; and so very proper to be used on occasion of the Messiah being made or declared Lord and Christ, as he was at his ascension, <a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>; <p>shout unto God with the voice of triumph; as when triumphs are made on account of victories obtained, which was now the case; Christ having conquered sin, Satan, and the world, by his sufferings and death, and having spoiled principalities and powers, made a show of them, openly triumphing over them, when he ascended on high, and led captivity captive; and he having sent his apostles into the Gentile world with his Gospel, they were caused to triumph in him wherever they came. And now these external actions of clapping hands, and shouting with the voice, are expressive of inward spiritual joy; which those among the people who were conquered by the grace of God, and had a sight of their ascended Lord and Saviour, were filled with: and who are exhorted to express it in this manner, unto God: not to angels, nor to men, no, not to ministers, who brought the joyful tidings to them; but to God, either to God the Father, for all their temporal and spiritual blessings; especially for the unspeakable gift of his Son, to suffer and die for them: or to the Son of God, God manifest in the flesh; God that was gone up with a shout, <a href="/psalms/47-5.htm">Psalm 47:5</a>; and was now at the right hand of God, crowned with glory and honour; who, by the sufferings of death, had obtained eternal redemption for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/47.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><<To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.>> O <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.</span><p>(a) Here is figured Christ to whom all his should give willing obedience, and who would show himself terrible to the wicked.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/47.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">all ye people</span>] Render all ye peoples, here and in <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/47-3.htm" title="He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.">Psalm 47:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/47-9.htm" title="The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong to God: he is greatly exalted.">Psalm 47:9</a></span> <span class="ital">a</span>.
