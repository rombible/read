The universal and absolute sovereignty of a holy God would be too terrible for us even to think of, were it not exercised by his Son from a mercy-seat; but now it is only terrible to the workers of iniquity. While his people express confidence and joy, and animate each other in serving him, let sinners submit to his authority, and accept his salvation. Jesus Christ shall subdue the Gentiles; he shall bring them as sheep into the fold, not for slaughter, but for preservation. He shall subdue their affections, and make them a willing people in the day of his power. Also it speaks of his giving them rest and settlement. Apply this spiritually; the Lord himself has undertaken to be the inheritance of his people. It shows the faith and submission of the saints.

Of all the countries which compose the world, he has chosen "this" to be the inheritance of his own people, or the place where they should dwell. The thought in this verse is based on the idea so common in the writings of the Hebrews, that their country was the glory of all lands - the place of all on earth most desirable to dwell in. It is in view of this fact that they are here called on to praise God, and to rejoice in him.<p>The excellency of Jacob - literally, "the pride - &#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;  ga&#770;'o&#770;n - of Jacob." Septuagint, "beauty" - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;  kallone&#772;n. So the Vulgate, "speciem." The meaning is, that it was a land of which Jacob, the ancestor of the people, might be proud, or which he did boast of. It was ever regarded as an honor among the Jews that they dwelt in a land which had been the abode of the prophets; and especially was anything regarded as of value that could be traced to Jacob; that bad been once in his possession; or that could be regarded as his gift. Compare <a href="/john/4-12.htm">John 4:12</a>.<p>Whom he loved - As one of the patriarchs. Perhaps special allusion is here made to "Jacob" rather than to Abraham and Isaac, because the land came actually into the possession of the Hebrew people in the time of Jacob's sons. It was divided among the descendants of his sons, the twelve tribes, bearing their names; and thus Jacob was most naturally referred to as having been in possession of the land. Abraham and Isaac dwelt in the land as strangers and pilgrims <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9-10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>, having no possession there, not even of a burying-place except as they purchased it (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/23-12.htm">Genesis 23:12-16</a>); and the land actually came into the possession of the nation only in the family of Jacob. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/47.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

We feel his reign to be so gracious that we even now ask to be in the fullest degree the subjects of it. We submit our will, our choice, our desire, wholly to him. Our heritage here and hereafter we leave to him, let him do with us as seemeth him good. "The excellence of Jacob whom he loved." He gave his ancient people their portion, he will give us ours, and we ask nothing better; this is the most spiritual and real manner of clapping our hands because of his sovereignty, namely, to leave all our affairs in his hands, for then our hands are empty of all care for self, and free to be used in his honour. He was the boast and glory of Israel, he is and shall be ours. He loved his people and became their greatest glory; he loves us, and he shall be our exceeding joy. As for the latter days, we ask nothing better than to stand in our appointed lot, for if we have but a portion in our Lord Jesus, it is enough for our largest desires.

In a passage founded upon this, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-5.htm">Psalm 66:5</a>, stands &#1502;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;; here, according to Targum and Masora (vid., Psalter, ii. 472), &#1502;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;.<p>(Note: Nevertheless &#1502;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; is also found here as a various reading that goes back to the time of the Talmud. The oldest Hebrew Psalter of 1477 reads thus, vide Repertorium fr Bibl. und Morgenlnd. Liter. v. (1779), 148. Norzi decides in favour of it, and Biesenthal has also adopted it in his edition of the Psalter (1837), which in other respects is a reproduction of Heidenheim's text.)<p>Even an Elohimic Psalm gives to the God of Israel in opposition to all the world no other name than &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; does not here signify stupenda (<a href="/jeremiah/8-21.htm">Jeremiah 8:21</a>), but in accordance with the phrase &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>, and frequently: devastations, viz., among the enemies who have kept the field against the city of God. The participle &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is designedly used in carrying forward the description. The annihilation of the worldly power which the church has just now experienced for its rescue, is a prelude to the ceasing of all war, <a href="/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a> (<a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>). Unto the ends of the earth will Jahve make an end of waging war; and since He has no pleasure in war in general, much less in war waged against His own people, all the implements of war He in part breaks to pieces and in part consigns to the flames (cf. <a href="/isaiah/54-16.htm">Isaiah 54:16</a>.). Cease, cries He (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>) to the nations, from making war upon my people, and know that I am God, the invincible One, - invincible both in Myself and in My people, - who will be acknowledged in My exaltation by all the world. A similar inferential admonition closes <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-12</a>. With this admonition, which is both warning and threatening at the same time, the nations are dismissed; but the church yet once more boasts that Jahve Tsebaoth is its God and its stronghold. </body></html>
