But here is a needful rule; Sing ye praises with understanding. As those that understand why and for what reasons they praise God, and what is the meaning of the service. It is not an acceptable service, if it is not a reasonable service. We are never to forget the end of Messiah's exaltation, so continually do the prophets dwell upon the conversion of the nations to the gospel of Christ. Why do we vainly fancy that we belong to him, unless the Spirit reign in our hearts by faith? Lord, is it not thy glory and delight to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins, now that thou art exalted as a Prince and a Saviour? Set up thy kingdom in our hearts. Bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. And so sweetly constrain all the powers and faculties of the souls of thy redeemed, into holy love, fear, and delight in thee, that praise with the understanding may rise from every heart, both here and for ever, to Thee, our God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God reigneth over the heathen - Over the "nations;" not over the "heathen" in the sense in which that term is understood now.

How we ought to long for the day when this truth shall be changed in its aspect, and the rule now unrecognized shall be delighted in! The great truth that God reigneth in providence is the guarantee that in a gracious gospel sense his promise shall be fulfilled, and his kingdom shall come. "He sitteth upon the throne of his holiness." Unmoved he occupies an undisputed throne, whose decrees, acts, and commands are holiness itself. What other throne is like this? Never was it stained with injustice, or defiled with sin. Neither is he who sits upon it dismayed, or in a dilemma. He sits in serenity, for he knows his own power, and sees that his purposes will not miscarry.

He reigned over Israel under the former dispensation, and now he reigns over the Gentiles under the Gospel dispensation; as appears by the numerous instances of conversion among them in the first ages of Christianity; and by the many churches that were planted by the means of the apostles; and by the destruction of the Roman Pagan empire under the sixth seal, <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>; and which will still more appear by the destruction of Rome Papal, when all the Heathens shall perish out of the land; and by the fulness and forces of the Gentiles being brought into a submission to him; all which are reasons to sing praises to him; <p>God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness; or his holy throne, which is heaven; on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; on his Father's throne; having done his work on earth he is received up into heaven, and is set down on a throne at the right hand of God, an honour which none of the angels have: he has ceased from his work and entered into his rest, and sits and sees of the travail of his soul; all which is matter of joy to his people, and a reason why they should sing praises; and the rather, since they are set down with him in heavenly places: or this may be understood of his sitting on the throne of judgment to judge the world in righteousness at the last day, it following upon his reign over the Gentiles; though the other sense best agrees with his immediate ascension to heaven. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/47.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/47.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>.

The psalmist, however, does not in consequence or this particular event call upon them to tremble with fear, but to rejoice; for fear is an involuntary, extorted inward emotion, but joy a perfectly voluntary one. The true and final victory of Jahve consists not in a submission that is brought about by war and bloodshed and in consternation that stupefies the mind, but in a change in the minds and hearts of the peoples, so that they render joyful worship unto Him. In order that He may thus become the God of all peoples, He has first of all become the God of Israel; and Israel longs that this the purpose of its election may be attained. Out of this longing springs the call in <a href="/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a>. The peoples are to show the God of revelation their joy by their gestures and their words; for Jahve is absolutely exalted (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, here it is a predicate, just as in <a href="/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56</a> it is an attribute), terrible, and the sphere of His dominion has Israel for its central point, not, however, for its limit, but it extends over the whole earth. Everything must do homage to Him in His own people, whether willingly or by constraint. According to the tenses employed, what is affirmed in <a href="/psalms/47-4.htm">Psalm 47:4</a> appears to be a principle derived from their recent experience, inasmuch as the contemporary fact is not expressed in an historical form, but generalized and idealised. But &#1497;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/47-5.htm">Psalm 47:5</a>, is against this, since the choosing (election) is an act done once for all and not a continued act; we are therefore driven to regard the futures, as in <a href="/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1</a>, as a statement of historical facts. Concerning &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, He bent, made to stoop, vid., <a href="/psalms/18-48.htm">Psalm 18:48</a>. There is now no necessity for altering &#1497;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; into &#1497;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;, and more especially since this is not suited to the fact which has given occasion to the Psalm. On the contrary, &#1497;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; presupposes that in the event of the day God has shown Himself to be a faithful and powerful Lord [lit. feudal Lord] of the land of Israel; the hostile confederation had thought of nothing less than driving Israel entirely out of its inheritance (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-11.htm">2 Chronicles 20:11</a>). The Holy Land is called the pride (&#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;) of Jacob, as being the gift of grace of which this, the people of God's love, can boast. In <a href="/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a> &#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; has a different meaning (of the sin of pride), and again another sense in <a href="/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a> (of the glory of all Israel in accordance with the promise); here it is similar to <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>. &#1488;&#1514; has a conjunctive accent instead of being followed by Makkeph, as in <a href="/psalms/60-2.htm">Psalm 60:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-12.htm">Proverbs 3:12</a> (these are the only three instances). The strophe which follows supports the view that the poet, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/47-5.htm">Psalm 47:5</a>, has a recent act of God before his mind. </body></html>
