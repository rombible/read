And therefore it is reasonable to conclude, that the bringing the nations of the earth to the knowledge and worship of Jehovah, and under subjection to the gospel, whereby, instead of being slaves, they were made free from the bondage of sin and death, was the great subject signified by these magnificent expressions. The Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ידבר עמים תחתינו</span>, is literally, <span class="ital">He shall speak the people under us, </span>that is, shall conquer, and make them subject to us by his word, the rod of his strength, to be sent forth out of Zion, (<a href="/psalms/110-2.htm" title="The LORD shall send the rod of your strength out of Zion: rule you in the middle of your enemies.">Psalm 110:2</a>,) whereby the people were to be made willing in the day of his power; by <span class="ital">the law, </span>the gospel law, or <span class="ital">word of the Lord, </span>which was to go forth from Jerusalem, <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>. In consequence of our Lord’s ascension, his all-subduing word went forth, and, under its influence and direction, the convinced and converted nations renounced their idols and their lusts, and bowed their willing necks to the yoke of Jesus, and became his holy and happy subjects. “This,” says Dr. Horne, “is that great conquest foreshowed by the victories of Joshua, David, and all the faithful heroes of old time, and foretold in language borrowed from their histories.” <span class="ital">And the nations under our feet — </span>The Gentile converts were in some sort brought under the Jews, because they were subjected to Christ and to his apostles, and to the primitive church, who were Jews.

The universal and absolute sovereignty of a holy God would be too terrible for us even to think of, were it not exercised by his Son from a mercy-seat; but now it is only terrible to the workers of iniquity. While his people express confidence and joy, and animate each other in serving him, let sinners submit to his authority, and accept his salvation. Jesus Christ shall subdue the Gentiles; he shall bring them as sheep into the fold, not for slaughter, but for preservation. He shall subdue their affections, and make them a willing people in the day of his power. Also it speaks of his giving them rest and settlement. Apply this spiritually; the Lord himself has undertaken to be the inheritance of his people. It shows the faith and submission of the saints.

The battle is not ours but the Lord's. He will take his own time, but he will certainly achieve victory for his church. Truth and righteousness shall through grace climb to the ascendant. We wage no doubtful warfare. Hearts the most rebellious, and wills the most stubborn, shall submit to all-conquering grace. All the Lord's people, Whether Jews or Gentiles, may clap their hands at this, for God's victory will be theirs; but surely apostles, prophets, ministers, and those who suffer and labour most, may take the largest share in the joy. Idolatry, infidelity, superstition we shall yet tread upon, as men tread down the stones of the street. "And the nations under our feet." The church of God shall be the greatest of monarchies, her victory shall be signal and decisive. Christ shall take to himself his great power and reign, and all the tribes of men shall own at once his glory and the glory of his people in him.

The Gentile converts were in some sort brought under the Jews, because they were subjected to Christ, and to his apostles, and to the primitive church, which were Jews.

As Joshua, his type, subdued the Canaanites; and as David, another type of subdued the Syrians, Moabites, and others: the Jews from these words expect, that, in the times of the Messiah they look for, the Gentiles in a literal sense will be subdued by him, and become subject to them; but these, and all other expressions of the like kind, are to be understood in a spiritual sense; such as <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>; and which will have their accomplishment in the latter day, in the subjection of the Gentiles to the word and ordinances of the Gospel administered in his churches: though the passage here refers to the times following the ascension of Christ to heaven, when he went forth in the ministry of his apostles conquering and to conquer; and which he made use of to cause the people to fall under him, and to be willing to be saved by him; to submit to his righteousness, and to his ordinances, the sceptre of his kingdom; and which was causing them to triumph, and subduing the people under them, who through the Gospel preached by them became obedient by word and deed; and which was an occasion of joy even to the conquered ones. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/47.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He shall <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.</span><p>(b) He has made the Jews who were the keepers of the law and prophets, schoolmasters to the Gentiles, that they would with gladness obey them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/47.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3, 4</span>.

The oldest Hebrew Psalter of 1477 reads thus, vide Repertorium fr Bibl. und Morgenlnd. Liter. v. (1779), 148. Norzi decides in favour of it, and Biesenthal has also adopted it in his edition of the Psalter (1837), which in other respects is a reproduction of Heidenheim's text.)<p>Even an Elohimic Psalm gives to the God of Israel in opposition to all the world no other name than &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; does not here signify stupenda (<a href="/jeremiah/8-21.htm">Jeremiah 8:21</a>), but in accordance with the phrase &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>, and frequently: devastations, viz., among the enemies who have kept the field against the city of God. The participle &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is designedly used in carrying forward the description. The annihilation of the worldly power which the church has just now experienced for its rescue, is a prelude to the ceasing of all war, <a href="/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a> (<a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>). Unto the ends of the earth will Jahve make an end of waging war; and since He has no pleasure in war in general, much less in war waged against His own people, all the implements of war He in part breaks to pieces and in part consigns to the flames (cf. <a href="/isaiah/54-16.htm">Isaiah 54:16</a>.). Cease, cries He (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>) to the nations, from making war upon my people, and know that I am God, the invincible One, - invincible both in Myself and in My people, - who will be acknowledged in My exaltation by all the world. A similar inferential admonition closes <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-12</a>. With this admonition, which is both warning and threatening at the same time, the nations are dismissed; but the church yet once more boasts that Jahve Tsebaoth is its God and its stronghold. </body></html>
