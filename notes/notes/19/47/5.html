It is not an acceptable service, if it is not a reasonable service. We are never to forget the end of Messiah's exaltation, so continually do the prophets dwell upon the conversion of the nations to the gospel of Christ. Why do we vainly fancy that we belong to him, unless the Spirit reign in our hearts by faith? Lord, is it not thy glory and delight to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins, now that thou art exalted as a Prince and a Saviour? Set up thy kingdom in our hearts. Bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.

Faith hears the people already shouting command of the first verse is here regarded as a fact. The fight is over, the conqueror ascends to his triumphal chariot, and rides up to the gates of the city which is made resplendent with the joy of his return. The words are fully applicable to the ascension of the Redeemer. We doubt not that angels and glorified spirits welcomed him with acclamations. He came not without song, shall we imagine that he returned in silence? "The Lord with the sound of a trumpet." Jesus is Jehovah. The joyful strain of the trumpet betokens the splendour of his triumph. It was meet to welcome one returning from the wars with martial music. Fresh from Bozrah, with his garments all red from the winepress, he ascended, leading captivity captive, and well might the clarion ring out the tidings of Immanuel's victorious return. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/47.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God is gone up:</span> this is meant literally of the ark, wherein God was present, which went or was carried up to the hill of Zion, where the tabernacle was erected for it, and afterwards to the hill of Moriah into the temple; which solemnity was accompanied with the shouts and acclamations of the people, and with the sound of trumpets: but mystically it respects Christ’s ascension into heaven, as may be gathered by comparing this with <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a></span>, where the like words uttered concerning the ark upon the same occasion, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/68-18.htm" title="You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts for men; yes, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.">Psalm 68:18</a></span>, are directly applied to Christ’s ascension. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/47.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>God is gone up with a shout,....

The triumphal procession, carrying up (at least in ancient times) the Ark which was the symbol of God’s presence to the Temple which was the symbol of heaven, and celebrating the victory which He had won for them with shouts and blowing of trumpets, was the outward and visible emblem of this ‘ascension,’ and suggests the form of the expression here.

If the interposition has been one of a striking and unusual character, if the relief has been great, the deliverance signal, the triumph accorded to his people extraordinary, then he "goes up with a shout" - amid the exulting cries and loud jubilations of rescued Israel. When the occasion is such as to call for a public manifestation of thanksgiving at the house of God (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-28.htm">2 Chronicles 20:28</a>), then he "goes up" also "with the sound of the trumpet," which was always sounded by the priests on great occasions of festal joy and gladness (see <a href="/2_samuel/6-15.htm">2 Samuel 6:15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-14.htm">2 Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-42.htm">1 Chronicles 16:42</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-6.htm">2 Chronicles 7:6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-27.htm">2 Chronicles 29:27</a>; <a href="/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 46:9-12) The mighty deeds of Jahve still lie visibly before them in their results, and those who are without the pale of the church are to see for themselves and be convinced. In a passage founded upon this, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-5.htm">Psalm 66:5</a>, stands &#1502;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;; here, according to Targum and Masora (vid., Psalter, ii. 472), &#1502;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;.<p>(Note: Nevertheless &#1502;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; is also found here as a various reading that goes back to the time of the Talmud. The oldest Hebrew Psalter of 1477 reads thus, vide Repertorium fr Bibl. und Morgenlnd. Liter. v. (1779), 148. Norzi decides in favour of it, and Biesenthal has also adopted it in his edition of the Psalter (1837), which in other respects is a reproduction of Heidenheim's text.)<p>Even an Elohimic Psalm gives to the God of Israel in opposition to all the world no other name than &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; does not here signify stupenda (<a href="/jeremiah/8-21.htm">Jeremiah 8:21</a>), but in accordance with the phrase &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>, and frequently: devastations, viz., among the enemies who have kept the field against the city of God. The participle &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is designedly used in carrying forward the description. The annihilation of the worldly power which the church has just now experienced for its rescue, is a prelude to the ceasing of all war, <a href="/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a> (<a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>). Unto the ends of the earth will Jahve make an end of waging war; and since He has no pleasure in war in general, much less in war waged against His own people, all the implements of war He in part breaks to pieces and in part consigns to the flames (cf. <a href="/isaiah/54-16.htm">Isaiah 54:16</a>.). Cease, cries He (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>) to the nations, from making war upon my people, and know that I am God, the invincible One, - invincible both in Myself and in My people, - who will be acknowledged in My exaltation by all the world. A similar inferential admonition closes <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-12</a>. With this admonition, which is both warning and threatening at the same time, the nations are dismissed; but the church yet once more boasts that Jahve Tsebaoth is its God and its stronghold. </body></html>
