To be saved from the hurtful sword, or from wasting sickness, without deliverance from the dominion of sin and the wrath to come, is but a small advantage. The public prosperity David desired for his people, is stated. It adds much to the comfort and happiness of parents in this world, to see their children likely to do well. To see them as plants, not as weeds, not as thorns; to see them as plants growing, not withered and blasted; to see them likely to bring forth fruit unto God in their day; to see them in their youth growing strong in the Spirit. Plenty is to be desired, that we may be thankful to God, generous to our friends, and charitable to the poor; otherwise, what profit is it to have our garners full? Also, uninterrupted peace. War brings abundance of mischiefs, whether it be to attack others or to defend ourselves. And in proportion as we do not adhere to the worship and service of God, we cease to be a happy people. The subjects of the Saviour, the Son of David, share the blessings of his authority and victories, and are happy because they have the Lord for their God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/144.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That our garners may be full - That our fields may yield abundance, so that our granaries may be always filled.<p>Affording all manner of store - Margin, "From kind to kind."

David's praise of God as his all-sufficient help is enhanced by a recognition of the intrinsic worthlessness of man. Confidently imploring God's interposition against his enemies, he breaks forth into praise and joyful anticipations of the prosperity of his kingdom, when freed from vain and wicked men.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/144.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So as they may fill our streets, being brought in thither for food to the towns and cities.

Or "our corners" (s), the corners of their houses, as Aben Ezra and Kimchi; the nooks that were in them might be full of provisions for the supply of the family; or that their barns and granaries might be full of all kind of corn, as wheat, rye, barley, &amp;c. which might be sufficient from year to year, as the Targum; plenty of all food is intended, in opposition to a scarcity, dearth, and famine, <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>; that so there might be enough for increasing families. Spiritually it may design that large provision of grace in the churches of Christ, and the fulness of the blessings of the Gospel the ministers of it come forth with, bringing out of their treasure things new and old, in the ministration of the word and administration of ordinances; <p>that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets; or millions; in which lay the riches of men formerly, and indeed in our nation now, where wool is the staple commodity of it; and these are creatures that breed and increase much; when they stand well, a few soon become a thousand, and these thousands produce ten thousands or millions, more. The Hebrew word  "sheep", seems to be derived from the Arabic word "tzana", which signifies to be "fruitful", whether in men or beasts: "tzana": "foecunda fuit, et multos liberos hubuit mulier-----idem significat, et multa habuit pecora", Golius, col. 1428; and though for the most part they bring but one at a time, yet Aristotle (t) says, sometimes two, three, and four; and in India, Aelianus (u) says, they bring four, and never less than three. It is a beautiful sight to see them driven in such numbers through the streets of cities to markets, or to pasture. Or rather this may design the country towns and villages, where large flocks of them are kept. The people of God resemble these in their meekness, harmlessness, innocence, and other things; and who not only increase in grace and gifts, and spiritual knowledge, and in all goodness, which is desirable, but also in numbers, as they did in the first times of the Gospel, and will in the last, when they shall be increased as a flock; the fulness of the Gentiles, the other sheep, shall be brought in, and the nation of the Jews called at once. <p>(s) "anguli nostri", Pagninus, Vatablus, Cocceius, Michaelis.

We see from <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a> that &#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-5.htm">Psalm 144:5</a>, has Jahve and not the heavens as its subject; and from <a href="/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a> that the suffix em in <a href="/psalms/144-6.htm">Psalm 144:6</a> is meant in both instances to be referred to the enemies. The enemies are called sons of a foreign country, i.e., barbarians, as in <a href="/psalms/18-45.htm">Psalm 18:45</a>. The fact that Jahve stretches forth His hand out of the heavens and rescues David out of great waters, is taken verbatim from <a href="/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>; and the poet has added the interpretation to the figure here. On <a href="/psalms/144-8.htm">Psalm 144:8</a> cf. <a href="/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/41-7.htm">Psalm 41:7</a>. The combination of words "right hand of falsehood" is the same as in <a href="/psalms/109-2.htm">Psalm 109:2</a>. But our poet, although so great an imitator, has, however, much also that is peculiar to himself. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, "to send forth lightning;" the verb &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492; in the Aramaeo-Arabic signification "to tear out of, rescue," which in David always only signifies "to tear open, open wide" (one's mouth), <a href="/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-14.htm">Psalm 66:14</a>; and the combination "the right hand of falsehood" (like "the tongue of falsehood" in <a href="/psalms/109-2.htm">Psalm 109:2</a>), i.e., the hand raised for a false oath, are only found here. The figure of Omnipotence, "He toucheth the mountains and they smoke," is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-32.htm">Psalm 104:32</a>, taken from the mountains that smoked at the giving of the Law, <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>. The mountains, as in <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/76-5.htm">Psalm 76:5</a>), point to the worldly powers. God only needs to touch these as with the tip of His finger, and the inward fire, which will consume them, at once makes itself known by the smoke, which ascends from them. The prayer for victory is followed by a vow of thanksgiving for that which is to be bestowed. </body></html>
