Happy those to whom the Lord gives that noblest victory, conquest and dominion over their own spirits. A prayer for further mercy is fitly begun with a thanksgiving for former mercy. There was a special power of God, inclining the people of Israel to be subject to David; it was typical of the bringing souls into subjection to the Lord Jesus. Man's days have little substance, considering how many thoughts and cares of a never-dying soul are employed about a poor dying body. Man's life is as a shadow that passes away. In their highest earthly exaltation, believers will recollect how mean, sinful, and vile they are in themselves; thus they will be preserved from self-importance and presumption.

Not only good, but goodness itself; the donor of all the blessings of goodness to him; the author of all goodness in him; the provider of all goodness for him, laid up to be used hereafter.

The former reading seems best, and is followed by the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and other versions: and this may be typical of the subduing of Christ's people under him; who are made willing, in the day of his power, to receive and own him as their King; profess subjection to his Gospel, and submit to his ordinances. <p>(d) "gratia mea", Cocceius, Gejerus.

Instead of <span class="ital">my people</span> both texts read <span class="ital">peoples</span>, which is supported by some MSS and several Versions (Aq. Syr. Jer. Targ.) here. If Israel is the speaker, this reading must be adopted here, and the reference must be to the subjugation of neighbouring nations: but if the leader of the community is speaking, the more difficult reading ‘my people,’ which is supported by the LXX, may be right. The reference will then be to his success in overcoming internal dissensions (cp. “the strivings of my people,” <a href="/2_samuel/22-44.htm" title="You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people, you have kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.">2 Samuel 22:44</a>) and the establishment of his authority.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/144.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust</span>. The general resemblance to <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a> is striking, but there are peculiar and original touches which indicate the author, not the copyist. For instance, the expression, "my goodness," occurs nowhere else. <span class="cmt_word">Who subdueth my people under me.</span> Another reading gives, "Who subdueth <span class="accented">peoples</span> under me." Either reading suits the circumstances of David, who had to subdue a great portion of his own people under him (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-31</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6-21</a>), and also conquered many foreign nations (<a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1-14</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/143.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this second half the Psalm seems still more like a reproduction of the thoughts of earlier Psalms. The prayer, "answer me speedily, hide not Thy face from me," sounds like <a href="/psalms/69-18.htm">Psalm 69:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-9.htm">Psalm 27:9</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/102-3.htm">Psalm 102:3</a>. The expression of languishing longing, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;, is like <a href="/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>. And the apodosis, "else I should become like those who go down into the pit," agrees word for word with <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/88-5.htm">Psalm 88:5</a>. In connection with the words, "cause me to hear Thy loving-kindness in the early morning," one is reminded of the similar prayer of Moses in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/90-14.htm">Psalm 90:14</a>, and with the confirmatory "for in Thee do I trust" of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2</a>, and frequently. With the prayer that the night of affliction may have an end with the next morning's dawn, and that God's helping loving-kindness may make itself felt by him, is joined the prayer that God would be pleased to grant him to know the way that he has to go in order to escape the destruction into which they are anxious to ensnare him. This last prayer has its type in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>, and in the Psalter in <a href="/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a>); and its confirmation: for to Thee have I lifted up my soul, viz., in a craving after salvation and in the confidence of faith, has its type in <a href="/psalms/25-1.htm">Psalm 25:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/86-4.htm">Psalm 86:4</a>. But the words &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, which are added to the petition "deliver me from mine enemies" (<a href="/psalms/59-2.htm">Psalm 59:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-16.htm">Psalm 31:16</a>), are peculiar, and in their expression without example. The Syriac version leaves them untranslated. The lxx renders: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, by which the defective mode of writing &#1499;&#1505;&#1514;&#1497; is indirectly attested, instead of which the translators read &#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1497; (cf. &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505; &#1506;&#1500; in <a href="/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>); for elsewhere not &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; but &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505; is reproduced with &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;. The Targum renders it &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1498; &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;, Thy Logos do I account as (my) Redeemer (i.e., regard it as such), as if the Hebrew words were to be rendered: upon Thee do I reckon or count, &#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="/exodus/12-4.htm">Exodus 12:4</a>. Luther closely follows the lxx: "to Thee have I fled for refuge." Jerome, however, inasmuch as he renders: ad te protectus sum, has pointed &#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; (&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;). Hitzig (on the passage before us and <a href="/proverbs/7-20.htm">Proverbs 7:20</a>) reads &#1499;&#1505;&#1514;&#1497; from &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1488;  equals  &#1505;&#1499;&#1488;, to look ("towards Thee do I look"). But the Hebrew contains no trace of that verb; the full moon is called &#1499;&#1505;&#1488; (&#1499;&#1505;&#1492;), not as being "a sight or vision, species," but from its covered orb.<p>The &#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; before us only admits of two interpretations: (1) Ad (apud) te texi  equals  to Thee have I secretly confided it (Rashi, Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, Coccejus, J. H. Michaelis, J. D. Michalis, Rosenmller, Gesenius, and De Wette). But such a constructio praegnans, in connection with which &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; would veer round from the signification to veil (cf. &#1499;&#1505;&#1492; &#1502;&#1503;, <a href="/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17</a>) into its opposite, and the clause have the meaning of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>, is hardly conceivable. (2) Ad (apud) te abscondidi, scil. me (Saadia, Calvin, Maurer, Ewald, and Hengstenberg), in favour of which we decide; for it is evident from <a href="/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>, that &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; can express the act of covering as an act that is referred to the person himself who covers, and so can obtain a reflexive meaning. Therefore: towards Thee, with Thee have I made a hiding  equals  hidden myself, which according to the sense is equivalent to &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, as Hupfeld (with a few MSS) wishes to read; but Abulwald has already remarked that the same goal is reached with &#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;. Jahve, with whom he hides himself, is alone able to make known to him what is right and beneficial in the position in which he finds himself, in which he is exposed to temporal and spiritual dangers, and is able to teach him to carry out the recognised will of God ("the will of God, good and well-pleasing and perfect," <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>); and this it is for which he prays to Him in <a href="/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a> (&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498;; another reading, &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498;). For Jahve is indeed his God, who cannot leave him, who is assailed and tempted without and within, in error; may His good Spirit then (&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1498; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; for &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20</a>)<p>(Note: Properly, "Thy Spirit, &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, a spirit, the good one, although such irregularities may also be a negligent usage of the language, like the Arabic msjd 'l-ja&#770;m&#8219;, the chief mosque, which many grammarians regard as a construct relationship, others as an ellipsis (inasmuch as they supply Arab. 'l-mka&#770;n between the words); the former is confirmed from the Hebrew, vid., Ewald, 287, a.))<p>lead him in a level country, for, as it is said in Isaiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-7.htm">Isaiah 26:7</a>, in looking up to Jahve, "the path which the righteous man takes is smoothness; Thou makest the course of the righteous smooth." The geographical term &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-21.htm">Jeremiah 48:21</a>, is here applied spiritually. Here, too, reminiscences of Psalms already read meet us everywhere: cf. on "to do Thy will," <a href="/psalms/40-9.htm">Psalm 40:9</a>; on "for Thou art my God," <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>, and frequently; on "Thy good Spirit," <a href="/psalms/51-14.htm">Psalm 51:14</a>; on "a level country," and the whole petition, <a href="/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a> (where the expression is "a level path"), together with <a href="/psalms/5-9.htm">Psalm 5:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4</a>., <a href="/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4</a>. And the Psalm also further unrolls itself in such now well-known thoughts of the Psalms: For Thy Name's sake, Jahve (<a href="/psalms/25-11.htm">Psalm 25:11</a>), quicken me again (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a>, and frequently); by virtue of Thy righteousness be pleased to bring my soul out of distress (<a href="/psalms/142-8.htm">Psalm 142:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/25-17.htm">Psalm 25:17</a>, and frequently); and by virtue of Thy loving-kindness cut off mine enemies (<a href="/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a>). As in <a href="/psalms/143-1.htm">Psalm 143:1</a> faithfulness and righteousness, here loving-kindness (mercy) and righteousness, are coupled together; and that so that mercy is not named beside towtsiy', nor righteousness beside &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;, but the reverse (vid., on <a href="/psalms/143-1.htm">Psalm 143:1</a>). It is impossible that God should suffer him who has hidden himself in Him to die and perish, and should suffer his enemies on the other hand to triumph. Therefore the poet confirms the prayer for the cutting off (&#1492;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; as in <a href="/psalms/94-23.htm">Psalm 94:23</a>) of his enemies and the destruction (&#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;, elsewhere &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;) of the oppressors of his soul (elsewhere &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;) with the words: for I am Thy servant. </body></html>
