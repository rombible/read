<span class="ital">may be as plants — </span>Flourishing and thriving, and growing in strength and stature, as plants do <span class="ital">in their youth; that our daughters — </span>Upon whom the hope of posterity depends;

Or, <span class="ital">in our folds, </span>or <span class="ital">stables, </span>as the Chaldee, Dr. Waterland, and others, render <span class="greekheb">חוצותינו</span>, or, as the LXX. translate the word, <span class="greekheb">εν τοις εξοδοις αυτων</span>, <span class="ital">in their outlets, out-goings, </span>or <span class="ital">walks; </span>that is, in the fields where they abide. <span class="ital">That our oxen may be strong to labour — </span>The oxen are not described by number, as the sheep, but very properly by their firmness and usefulness for tillage; Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">מסבלים</span>, <span class="ital">portare facti, formed to bear, </span>namely, the <span class="ital">yoke. </span>Some, indeed, interpret the expression, <span class="ital">laden, burdened, with flesh and fat. </span>But the former seems the more probable sense of the word. <span class="ital">That there be no breaking in — </span>Namely, of enemies, invading our land, or assaulting our cities, and making breaches in our walls; <span class="ital">nor going out — </span>Namely, of our people, either out of the towns and cities to fight with an invading enemy, or out of the land into captivity. <span class="ital">No complaining — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">צוחה</span>, no <span class="ital">outcry, </span>or <span class="ital">howling, </span>or <span class="ital">lamentation </span>on account of any sad tidings, or public calamities, or grievances; <span class="ital">in our streets — </span><span class="greekheb">ברחבתינו</span>, a very different word from that rendered <span class="ital">streets </span>in the preceding verse. This properly means the <span class="ital">broad, spacious ways </span>of cities and towns, but the former word <span class="ital">out-places, </span>as <span class="ital">out-buildings, folds, </span>or <span class="ital">fields. </span>Kimchi observes of these verses, that all those three blessings, namely, of the womb, of the earth, and of cattle, which are mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm" title="Blessed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground, and the fruit of your cattle, the increase of your cows, and the flocks of your sheep.">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>, are specified here.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/144.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>144:9-15 Fresh favours call for fresh returns of thanks; we must praise God for the mercies we hope for by his promise, as well as those we have received by his providence. To be saved from the hurtful sword, or from wasting sickness, without deliverance from the dominion of sin and the wrath to come, is but a small advantage. The public prosperity David desired for his people, is stated. It adds much to the comfort and happiness of parents in this world, to see their children likely to do well. To see them as plants, not as weeds, not as thorns; to see them as plants growing, not withered and blasted; to see them likely to bring forth fruit unto God in their day; to see them in their youth growing strong in the Spirit. Plenty is to be desired, that we may be thankful to God, generous to our friends, and charitable to the poor; otherwise, what profit is it to have our garners full? Also, uninterrupted peace. War brings abundance of mischiefs, whether it be to attack others or to defend ourselves. And in proportion as we do not adhere to the worship and service of God, we cease to be a happy people. The subjects of the Saviour, the Son of David, share the blessings of his authority and victories, and are happy because they have the Lord for their God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/144.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rid me, and deliver me ... - See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7-8</a>. The language is here repeated. The prayer had been interrupted by the thought that the answer to it would lay the foundation for praise, and by an acknowledgment of entire dependence on God. The psalmist now, after repeating the prayer, suggests what would result from the answer to it, and dwells on the happy consequences which must follow; the bright scenes in his own reign, in the prosperity of the people, in the happiness of the nation, in domestic comforts, and in the abundance which the land would produce when these dangers should pass away, when people now engaged in the conflict of arms might return to the peaceful pursuits of life, when families would be safe in their dwellings, and when the earth cultivated in time of peace would again produce abundance, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-12.htm">Psalm 144:12-14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/144.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 144<p>Ps 144:1-15.

We see from <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a> that &#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-5.htm">Psalm 144:5</a>, has Jahve and not the heavens as its subject; and from <a href="/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a> that the suffix em in <a href="/psalms/144-6.htm">Psalm 144:6</a> is meant in both instances to be referred to the enemies. The enemies are called sons of a foreign country, i.e., barbarians, as in <a href="/psalms/18-45.htm">Psalm 18:45</a>. The fact that Jahve stretches forth His hand out of the heavens and rescues David out of great waters, is taken verbatim from <a href="/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>; and the poet has added the interpretation to the figure here. On <a href="/psalms/144-8.htm">Psalm 144:8</a> cf. <a href="/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/41-7.htm">Psalm 41:7</a>. The combination of words "right hand of falsehood" is the same as in <a href="/psalms/109-2.htm">Psalm 109:2</a>. But our poet, although so great an imitator, has, however, much also that is peculiar to himself. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, "to send forth lightning;" the verb &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492; in the Aramaeo-Arabic signification "to tear out of, rescue," which in David always only signifies "to tear open, open wide" (one's mouth), <a href="/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-14.htm">Psalm 66:14</a>; and the combination "the right hand of falsehood" (like "the tongue of falsehood" in <a href="/psalms/109-2.htm">Psalm 109:2</a>), i.e., the hand raised for a false oath, are only found here. The figure of Omnipotence, "He toucheth the mountains and they smoke," is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-32.htm">Psalm 104:32</a>, taken from the mountains that smoked at the giving of the Law, <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>. The mountains, as in <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/76-5.htm">Psalm 76:5</a>), point to the worldly powers. God only needs to touch these as with the tip of His finger, and the inward fire, which will consume them, at once makes itself known by the smoke, which ascends from them. The prayer for victory is followed by a vow of thanksgiving for that which is to be bestowed. </body></html>
