But since <span class= "ital">allûphîm </span>elsewhere means “heads of families” (<a href="/jeremiah/13-21.htm" title="What will you say when he shall punish you? for you have taught them to be captains, and as chief over you: shall not sorrows take you, as a woman in travail?">Jeremiah 13:21</a>, &c) or “princes,” and the noun cognate with the verb is used of a post connected with the revenue (<a href="/1_kings/11-28.htm" title="And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.">1Kings 11:28</a>; comp. the connection between the Greek <span class= "greekheb">ϕορός</span> and <span class= "greekheb">ϕέρτερος</span>), the participle passive may easily here mean “honoured,” or “high in office.” Or, from the use of the cognate Chaldee form in <a href="/ezra/6-3.htm" title="In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof three score cubits, and the breadth thereof three score cubits;">Ezra 6:3</a>, “strongly laid,” we might render, <span class= "ital">our princes firmly established; </span>and this is the best explanation of the passage.<p><span class= "bld">No breaking in.—</span>Heb., a “breach,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the town walls.

To be saved from the hurtful sword, or from wasting sickness, without deliverance from the dominion of sin and the wrath to come, is but a small advantage. The public prosperity David desired for his people, is stated. It adds much to the comfort and happiness of parents in this world, to see their children likely to do well. To see them as plants, not as weeds, not as thorns; to see them as plants growing, not withered and blasted; to see them likely to bring forth fruit unto God in their day; to see them in their youth growing strong in the Spirit. Plenty is to be desired, that we may be thankful to God, generous to our friends, and charitable to the poor; otherwise, what profit is it to have our garners full? Also, uninterrupted peace. War brings abundance of mischiefs, whether it be to attack others or to defend ourselves. And in proportion as we do not adhere to the worship and service of God, we cease to be a happy people. The subjects of the Saviour, the Son of David, share the blessings of his authority and victories, and are happy because they have the Lord for their God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/144.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That our oxen may be strong to labour - Margin, "able to bear burdens;" or, "laden with flesh."

That property may be safe everywhere. The image is that of security, peace, order, prosperity.<p>That there be no complaining in our streets - literally, "outcry; clamor."

(1) Most commentators follow the Ancient Versions in regarding the word <span class="ital">allûphîm</span> here as a variant form for <span class="ital">alâphîm</span>, ‘oxen’ or ‘cattle.’ Oxen, it is thought, are naturally mentioned after sheep. The participle <span class="ital">m’subbâlîm</span> is variously explained. As it is passive in form it can hardly mean <span class="ital">capable of bearing burdens, strong to labour</span> (A.V.); and as it is masculine, it can hardly mean <span class="ital">laden with young, pregnant</span>. It is not a natural expression fox <span class="ital">fat</span> and <span class="ital">strong</span>, as the LXX, Aq., Symm. and Jerome render it, i.e. loaded with flesh. Most probably it means well laden (R.V.) with the produce of the fields which they draw home in carts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) <span class="ital">Allûphîm</span> however may mean <span class="ital">chieftains</span> (cp. <a href="/context/zechariah/12-5.htm" title="And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God....">Zechariah 12:5-6</a>), and in <a href="/ezra/6-3.htm" title="In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof three score cubits, and the breadth thereof three score cubits;">Ezra 6:3</a> the verb in Aramaic appears to mean <span class="ital">set up</span> or <span class="ital">firmly established</span>. In such a late Psalm it is quite possible that the word might be used in the sense it bears in Aramaic (cp. the word for <span class="ital">rescue</span> in <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/144-7.htm" title="Send your hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;">Psalm 144:7</a></span>), and the meaning <span class="ital">our chieftains firmly established</span> suits the context very well. It is of course to be connected with the remainder of the verse, and not with <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/144-13.htm" title="That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:">Psalm 144:13</a></span>.

We see from <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a> that &#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-5.htm">Psalm 144:5</a>, has Jahve and not the heavens as its subject; and from <a href="/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a> that the suffix em in <a href="/psalms/144-6.htm">Psalm 144:6</a> is meant in both instances to be referred to the enemies. The enemies are called sons of a foreign country, i.e., barbarians, as in <a href="/psalms/18-45.htm">Psalm 18:45</a>. The fact that Jahve stretches forth His hand out of the heavens and rescues David out of great waters, is taken verbatim from <a href="/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>; and the poet has added the interpretation to the figure here. On <a href="/psalms/144-8.htm">Psalm 144:8</a> cf. <a href="/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/41-7.htm">Psalm 41:7</a>. The combination of words "right hand of falsehood" is the same as in <a href="/psalms/109-2.htm">Psalm 109:2</a>. But our poet, although so great an imitator, has, however, much also that is peculiar to himself. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, "to send forth lightning;" the verb &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492; in the Aramaeo-Arabic signification "to tear out of, rescue," which in David always only signifies "to tear open, open wide" (one's mouth), <a href="/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-14.htm">Psalm 66:14</a>; and the combination "the right hand of falsehood" (like "the tongue of falsehood" in <a href="/psalms/109-2.htm">Psalm 109:2</a>), i.e., the hand raised for a false oath, are only found here. The figure of Omnipotence, "He toucheth the mountains and they smoke," is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-32.htm">Psalm 104:32</a>, taken from the mountains that smoked at the giving of the Law, <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>. The mountains, as in <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/76-5.htm">Psalm 76:5</a>), point to the worldly powers. God only needs to touch these as with the tip of His finger, and the inward fire, which will consume them, at once makes itself known by the smoke, which ascends from them. The prayer for victory is followed by a vow of thanksgiving for that which is to be bestowed. </body></html>
