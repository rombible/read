Happy those to whom the Lord gives that noblest victory, conquest and dominion over their own spirits. A prayer for further mercy is fitly begun with a thanksgiving for former mercy. There was a special power of God, inclining the people of Israel to be subject to David; it was typical of the bringing souls into subjection to the Lord Jesus. Man's days have little substance, considering how many thoughts and cares of a never-dying soul are employed about a poor dying body. Man's life is as a shadow that passes away. In their highest earthly exaltation, believers will recollect how mean, sinful, and vile they are in themselves; thus they will be preserved from self-importance and presumption. God's time to help his people is, when they are sinking, and all other helps fail.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/144.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Those mouth speaketh vanity - Vain things; things not real and true; falsehood; lies.

Truth is solid and reliable; falsehood is unreliable and vain.<p>And their right hand is a right hand of falsehood - The meaning here seems to be that even under the solemnities of an oath, when they lifted up their hands to swear, when they solemnly appealed to God, there was no reliance to be placed on what they affirmed or promised. Oaths were taken by lifting up the right hand as toward God.

The Latin interpreter of the Arabic version renders it, "their oath is an oath of iniquity"; and Ben Balaam in Aben Ezra, and R. Adnim in Ben Melech, say the word so signifies in the Arabic language; and Schultens (m) has observed the same: but the word in that language signifies the right hand as well as an oath, and need not be restrained to that; it is better to take it in the large sense, as Cocceius (n) does; whether they lifted up the hand to pray, or to swear; or gave it to covenant with, to make contracts and agreements; or stretched it out to work with; it was a right hand of falsehood. <p>(m) Observat.

In <a href="/psalms/18-48.htm">Psalm 18:48</a> we however read &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, and the Masora has enumerated <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>, together with <a href="/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>, as the three passages in which it is written &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;, whilst one expects &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1490; &#1491;&#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;), as the Targum, Syriac, and Jerome (yet not the lxx) in fact render it.

Either, therefore, we have to read &#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;,<p>(Note: Rashi is acquainted with an otherwise unknown note of the Masora: &#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;; but this Ker is imaginary.)<p>or we must fall in with the strong expression, and this is possible: there is, indeed, no necessity for the subduing to be intended of the use of despotic power, it can also be intended to God-given power, and of subjugating authority. David, the anointed one, but not having as yet ascended the throne, here gives expression to the hope that Jahve will grant him deeds of victory which will compel Israel to submit to him, whether willingly or reluctantly. </body></html>
