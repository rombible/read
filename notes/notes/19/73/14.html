But he lays down the great principle by which he resolved to abide. It is the goodness of God. This is a truth which cannot be shaken. Good thoughts of God will fortify against Satan's temptations. The faith even of strong believers may be sorely shaken, and ready to fail. There are storms that will try the firmest anchors. Foolish and wicked people have sometimes a great share of outward prosperity. They seem to have the least share of the troubles of this life; and they seem to have the greatest share of its comforts. They live without the fear of God, yet they prosper, and get on in the world. Wicked men often spend their lives without much sickness, and end them without great pain; while many godly persons scarcely know what health is, and die with great sufferings. Often the wicked are not frightened, either by the remembrance of their sins, or the prospect of their misery, but they die without terror. We cannot judge men's state beyond death, by what passes at their death. He looked abroad, and saw many of God's people greatly at a loss. Because the wicked are so very daring, therefore his people return hither; they know not what to say to it, and the rather, because they drink deep of the bitter cup of affliction. He spoke feelingly when he spoke of his own troubles; there is no disputing against sense, except by faith. From all this arose a strong temptation to cast off religion. But let us learn that the true course of sanctification consists in cleansing a man from all pollution both of soul and body. The heart is cleansed by the blood of Christ laid hold upon by faith; and by the begun works of the Lord's Spirit, manifested in the hearty resolution, purpose, and study of holiness, and a blameless course of life and actions, the hands are cleansed. It is not in vain to serve God and keep his ordinances.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/73.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For all the day long - Continually.

Nevertheless the traditional reading also gives a suitable sense; not (since the fat tends to make the eyes appear to be deeper in) "their eyes come forward prae adipe," but, "they stare forth ex adipe, out of the fat of their bloated visage," &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489; being equivalent to &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="/job/15-27.htm">Job 15:27</a>. This is a feature of the character faithfully drawn after nature. Further, just as in general &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; wells over in the gestures and language (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>), so is it also with their "views or images of the heart" (from &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492;, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1493;&#1497;, the cock with its gift of divination as speculator): the illusions of their unbounded self-confidence come forth outwardly, they overflow after the manner of a river,<p>(Note: On the other hand, Redslob (Deutsch. Morgenl&#1492;nd. Zeitschr. 1860, S. 675) interprets it thus: they run over the fencings of the heart, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492; in the signification to put or stick through, to stick into (infigere), by comparing &#1511;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>, and &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;.

Certainly the root &#1494;&#1498;, Arab. zk, d&#817;k, has the primary notion of piercing (cf. &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;), and also the notion of purity, which it obtains, proceeds from the idea of the brilliance which pierces into the eye; but the primary notion of &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492; is that of cutting through (whence &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, like &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1507;, a knife, from &#1495;&#1500;&#1507;, <a href="/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>).)<p>viz., as <a href="/psalms/73-8.htm">Psalm 73:8</a> says, in words that are proud beyond measure (<a href="/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>). Luther: "they destroy everything" (synon. they make it as or into rottenness, from &#1502;&#1511;&#1511;). But &#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1511; is here equivalent to the Aramaic &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511; (&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;): they mock and openly speak &#1489;&#1512;&#1506; (with a&#772; in connection with Munach transformed from Dech), with evil disposition (cf. <a href="/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>), oppression; i.e., they openly express their resolve which aims at oppression. Their fellow-man is the sport of their caprice; they speak or dictate &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, down from an eminence, upon which they imagine themselves to be raised high above others. Even in the heavens above do they set (&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; as in <a href="/psalms/49-15.htm">Psalm 49:15</a> instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;, - there, in accordance with tradition, Milel; here at the commencement of the verse Milra) their mouth; even these do not remain untouched by their scandalous language (cf. Jde 1:16); the Most High and Holy One, too, is blasphemed by them, and their tongue runs officiously and imperiously through the earth below, everywhere disparaging that which exists and giving new laws. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>, a Kal sounding much like Hithpa., in the signification grassari. In <a href="/psalms/73-10.htm">Psalm 73:10</a> the Chethb &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; (therefore he, this class of man, turns a people subject to him hither, i.e., to himself) is to be rejected, because &#1492;&#1500;&#1501; is not appropriate to it. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; is the subject, and the suffix refers not to God (Stier), whose name has not been previously mentioned, but to the kind of men hitherto described: what is meant is the people which, in order that it may turn itself hither (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, not: to turn back, but to turn one's self towards, as e.g., in <a href="/jeremiah/15-19.htm">Jeremiah 15:19</a>)<p>(Note: In general &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; does not necessarily signify to turn back, but, like the Arabic &#8219;a&#770;da, Persic gashten, to enter into a new (active or passive) state.))<p>becomes his, i.e., this class's people (cf. for this sense of the suffix as describing the issue or event, <a href="/psalms/18-24.htm">Psalm 18:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-12.htm">Psalm 65:12</a>). They gain adherents (<a href="/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>) from those who leave the fear of God and turn to them; and &#1502;&#1497; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;, water of fulness, i.e., of full measure (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a>, streams of duration  equals  that do not dry up), which is here an emblem of their corrupt principles (cf. <a href="/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>), is quaffed or sucked in (&#1502;&#1510;&#1492;, root &#1502;&#1509;, whence first of all &#1502;&#1510;&#1509;, Arab. ms&#803;s&#803;, to suck) by these befooled ones (&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;, &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  equals  &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;). This is what is meant to be further said, and not that this band of servile followers is in fulness absorbed by them (Sachs). Around the proud free-thinkers there gathers a rabble submissive to them, which eagerly drinks in everything that proceeds from them as though it were the true water of life. Even in David's time (<a href="/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-2.htm">Psalm 36:2</a>) there were already such stout spirits (<a href="/isaiah/46-12.htm">Isaiah 46:12</a>) with a servu&#770;m imitatorum pecus. A still far more favourable soil for these &#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; was the worldly age of Solomon. </body></html>
