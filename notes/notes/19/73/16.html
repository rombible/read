Indeed, it is a problem not to be solved by the mere light of nature; for if there were not another life after this, we could not fully reconcile the prosperity of the wicked with the justice of God. Here, then, we have “a second reason why a man should not be too forward to arraign God’s dispensations of injustice, namely, the extreme difficulty of comprehending the whole of them, which, indeed, is not to be done by the human mind, unless God himself shall vouchsafe it the necessary information.” — Horne.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/73.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>73:15-20 The psalmist having shown the progress of his temptation, shows how faith and grace prevailed. He kept up respect for God's people, and with that he restrained himself from speaking what he had thought amiss. It is a sign that we repent of the evil thoughts of the heart, if we suppress them. Nothing gives more offence to God's children, than to say it is vain to serve God; for there is nothing more contrary to their universal experience. He prayed to God to make this matter plain to him; and he understood the wretched end of wicked people; even in the height of their prosperity they were but ripening for ruin. The sanctuary must be the resort of a tempted soul. The righteous man's afflictions end in peace, therefore he is happy; the wicked man's enjoyments end in destruction, therefore he is miserable. The prosperity of the wicked is short and uncertain, slippery places. See what their prosperity is; it is but a vain show, it is only a corrupt imagination, not substance, but a mere shadow; it is as a dream, which may please us a little while we are slumbering, yet even then it disturbs our repose.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/73.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When I thought to know this - When I endeavored to comprehend this, or to explain it to myself.

Certainly the root &#1494;&#1498;, Arab. zk, d&#817;k, has the primary notion of piercing (cf. &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;), and also the notion of purity, which it obtains, proceeds from the idea of the brilliance which pierces into the eye; but the primary notion of &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492; is that of cutting through (whence &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, like &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1507;, a knife, from &#1495;&#1500;&#1507;, <a href="/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>).)<p>viz., as <a href="/psalms/73-8.htm">Psalm 73:8</a> says, in words that are proud beyond measure (<a href="/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>). Luther: "they destroy everything" (synon. they make it as or into rottenness, from &#1502;&#1511;&#1511;). But &#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1511; is here equivalent to the Aramaic &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511; (&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;): they mock and openly speak &#1489;&#1512;&#1506; (with a&#772; in connection with Munach transformed from Dech), with evil disposition (cf. <a href="/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>), oppression; i.e., they openly express their resolve which aims at oppression. Their fellow-man is the sport of their caprice; they speak or dictate &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, down from an eminence, upon which they imagine themselves to be raised high above others. Even in the heavens above do they set (&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; as in <a href="/psalms/49-15.htm">Psalm 49:15</a> instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;, - there, in accordance with tradition, Milel; here at the commencement of the verse Milra) their mouth; even these do not remain untouched by their scandalous language (cf. Jde 1:16); the Most High and Holy One, too, is blasphemed by them, and their tongue runs officiously and imperiously through the earth below, everywhere disparaging that which exists and giving new laws. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>, a Kal sounding much like Hithpa., in the signification grassari.

This is what is meant to be further said, and not that this band of servile followers is in fulness absorbed by them (Sachs). Around the proud free-thinkers there gathers a rabble submissive to them, which eagerly drinks in everything that proceeds from them as though it were the true water of life. Even in David's time (<a href="/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-2.htm">Psalm 36:2</a>) there were already such stout spirits (<a href="/isaiah/46-12.htm">Isaiah 46:12</a>) with a servu&#770;m imitatorum pecus. A still far more favourable soil for these &#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; was the worldly age of Solomon. </body></html>
