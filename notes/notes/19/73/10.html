Some think it intends those people who resort to the company of the wicked, because they find their temporal advantage by it; while others are of opinion that the people of God are meant, who, by continually revolving in their thoughts the subject here treated of, namely, the prosperity of the wicked, are sore grieved, and enforced to shed tears in abundance.” Certainly a variety of discordant interpretations have been given of the verse. But a literal translation, which the following is, seems, in some degree at least, to determine its meaning. <span class="ital">Therefore — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">לכן</span>, <span class="ital">lachen, on this account, his people shall return thither, and waters of fullness shall be wrung out to them — </span>As if he had said, Because of the prosperity of the wicked, and the afflicted state of the righteous, <span class="ital">his people, </span>that is, the people of God, will be under a strong temptation to return; and many will actually return to the company of the ungodly, which they had forsaken, in order to share their prosperity: but in consequence thereof, <span class="ital">waters of a full cup shall be wrung out to them, </span>they shall bring upon themselves many chastisements and troubles, and shall be oppressed with grief and sorrow for their sin and folly. <span class="ital">Waters, </span>in Scripture, frequently signify afflictions, although, it must be acknowledged, they also often signify mercies and comforts; but the former, and not the latter sense of the metaphor, seems to be intended here: for when did, or do, the people of God receive mercies and comforts, or blessings of any kind, by returning to the sins and follies which they had forsaken, or to the society of the ungodly, from which they had withdrawn themselves? Do they not uniformly meet with chastisement and trouble? The clause, “waters of a full cup,” &c., may probably refer to the cups of liquor, mingled with poison, which were, in those days, given to criminals. The verse, it must be observed, is in the future tense, and it seems most natural, as Mr. Scott has remarked, to interpret it as expressive of the psalmist’s apprehension, that the prosperity of daring sinners would eventually prove a strong temptation, and a great source of sorrow to believers.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/73.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>73:1-14 The psalmist was strongly tempted to envy the prosperity of the wicked; a common temptation, which has tried the graces of many saints. But he lays down the great principle by which he resolved to abide. It is the goodness of God. This is a truth which cannot be shaken. Good thoughts of God will fortify against Satan's temptations. The faith even of strong believers may be sorely shaken, and ready to fail. There are storms that will try the firmest anchors. Foolish and wicked people have sometimes a great share of outward prosperity. They seem to have the least share of the troubles of this life; and they seem to have the greatest share of its comforts. They live without the fear of God, yet they prosper, and get on in the world. Wicked men often spend their lives without much sickness, and end them without great pain; while many godly persons scarcely know what health is, and die with great sufferings. Often the wicked are not frightened, either by the remembrance of their sins, or the prospect of their misery, but they die without terror. We cannot judge men's state beyond death, by what passes at their death. He looked abroad, and saw many of God's people greatly at a loss. Because the wicked are so very daring, therefore his people return hither; they know not what to say to it, and the rather, because they drink deep of the bitter cup of affliction. He spoke feelingly when he spoke of his own troubles; there is no disputing against sense, except by faith. From all this arose a strong temptation to cast off religion. But let us learn that the true course of sanctification consists in cleansing a man from all pollution both of soul and body. The heart is cleansed by the blood of Christ laid hold upon by faith; and by the begun works of the Lord's Spirit, manifested in the hearty resolution, purpose, and study of holiness, and a blameless course of life and actions, the hands are cleansed. It is not in vain to serve God and keep his ordinances.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/73.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore his people - Those that truly love God; the pious in the earth.<p>Return hither - Return to this subject. In their musings - their meditations on divine things - they come back to this inquiry. The subject occupies their minds, and they recur to it as a subject which perplexes them; as a thing that is incomprehensible. They think it over again and again, and are more and more perplexed and embarrassed. The difficulties which these facts suggest about God and his government are such that they cannot solve them.<p>And waters of a full cup are wrung out to them - literally, "waters of fullness;" or, full waters. The Chaldee renders this, "Many tears flow from them." The Septuagint, and the Latin Vulgate, "And full days shall be found by them." The word rendered "are wrung out" - from &#1502;&#1510;&#1492;  ma&#770;tsa&#770;h - means properly to "suck;" then, to suck out; to drink greedily. See <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>. It is applied to one who drinks greedily of an intoxicating cup; and then, to one who drinks a cup of poison to the dregs. <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>. The meaning here is, that the facts in the case, and the questions which arose in regard to those facts, and which so perplexed them, were like a bitter cup; a cup of poison, or an intoxicating cup which overpowered their faculties - and that they, in their perplexities, "exhausted" the cup. They drank it all, even to the dregs. They did not merely taste it; but they drank it. It was a subject full of perplexity; a subject that wholly overpowered all their faculties, and "exhausted" all their powers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/73.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-12.

And whilst the wicked prosper, God doth wring out waters out of the cup of tribulation, and causeth his holy ones to drink them up: compare <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/75-8.htm" title="For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he pours out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.">Psalm 75:8</a> 80:5 <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a> <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15</a></span>, &c. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. And those hypocritical Israelites find themselves gainers by their apostacy, and they partake of the same prosperity with their leaders, and God seems to give them a full cup of consolation, and to pour forth his mercies upon them in such abundance, as if he would wring or squeeze out all his blessings out of his stores to bestow upon them.

A difficult verse. The general sense appears to be that attracted by the prosperity and pretensions of the wicked a crowd of imitators turn to follow them, and in their company drink to the dregs the cup of sinful pleasure.

The pronoun <span class="ital">his</span> is commonly explained to refer to the wicked regarded as a whole, or to some conspicuous leader among them. The context hardly allows of its reference to God.

The clause as it stands affirms that their dying has no pangs, i.e., it is a painless death; but not merely does this assertion not harmonize with <a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18</a>., but it is also introduced too early here, since the poet cannot surely begin the description of the good fortune of the ungodly with the painlessness of their death, and then for the first time come to speak of their healthy condition. We may therefore read, with Ewald, Hitzig, Bttcher, and Olshausen:<p>&#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1495;&#1512;&#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;<p>&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488; &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;<p>i.e., they have (suffer) no pangs, vigorous (&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; like &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23</a>, &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>) and well-nourished is their belly; by which means the difficult &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; is got rid of, and the gloomy picture is enriched by another form ending with mo. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, here in a derisive sense, signifies the body, like the Arabic allun, a&#770;lun (from a&#770;l, coaluit, cohaesit, to condense inwardly, to gain consistency).<p>(Note: Hitzig calls to mind &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, "corporeal;" but this word is Ionic and equivalent to &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, solidus, the ground-word of which is the Sanscrit sarvas, whole, complete.)<p>The observation of <a href="/psalms/73-4.htm">Psalm 73:4</a> is pursued further in <a href="/psalms/73-5.htm">Psalm 73:5</a> : whilst one would have thought that the godly formed an exception to the common wretchedness of mankind, it is just the wicked who are exempt from all trouble and calamity. It is also here to be written &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1502;&#1493;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-14.htm">Psalm 59:14</a>, not &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;. Therefore is haughtiness their neck-chain, and brutishness their mantle. &#1506;&#1504;&#1511; is a denominative from &#1506;&#1504;&#1511;  equals  &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;: to hang round the neck; the neck is the seat of pride (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;): haughtiness hangs around their neck (like &#1506;&#1504;&#1511;, a neck-ornament). Accordingly in <a href="/psalms/73-6.htm">Psalm 73:6</a> &#1492;&#1502;&#1505; is the subject, although the interpunction construes it differently, viz., "they wrap round as a garment the injustice belonging to them," in order, that is, to avoid the construction of &#1497;&#1506;&#1496;&#1507; (vid., <a href="/psalms/65-14.htm">Psalm 65:14</a>) with &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;; but active verbs can take a dative of the object (e.g., &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; &#1500; ,, &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; &#1500;) in the sense: to be or to grant to any one that which the primary notion of the verb asserts. It may therefore be rendered: they put on the garment of violence (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; like &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497; &#1504;&#1511;&#1501;, <a href="/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a>), or even by avoiding every enallage numeri: violence covers them as a garment; so that &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; is an apposition which is put forth in advance. </body></html>
