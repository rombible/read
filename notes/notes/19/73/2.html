But he lays down the great principle by which he resolved to abide. It is the goodness of God. This is a truth which cannot be shaken. Good thoughts of God will fortify against Satan's temptations. The faith even of strong believers may be sorely shaken, and ready to fail. There are storms that will try the firmest anchors. Foolish and wicked people have sometimes a great share of outward prosperity. They seem to have the least share of the troubles of this life; and they seem to have the greatest share of its comforts. They live without the fear of God, yet they prosper, and get on in the world. Wicked men often spend their lives without much sickness, and end them without great pain; while many godly persons scarcely know what health is, and die with great sufferings. Often the wicked are not frightened, either by the remembrance of their sins, or the prospect of their misery, but they die without terror. We cannot judge men's state beyond death, by what passes at their death. He looked abroad, and saw many of God's people greatly at a loss. Because the wicked are so very daring, therefore his people return hither; they know not what to say to it, and the rather, because they drink deep of the bitter cup of affliction. He spoke feelingly when he spoke of his own troubles; there is no disputing against sense, except by faith. From all this arose a strong temptation to cast off religion. But let us learn that the true course of sanctification consists in cleansing a man from all pollution both of soul and body. The heart is cleansed by the blood of Christ laid hold upon by faith; and by the begun works of the Lord's Spirit, manifested in the hearty resolution, purpose, and study of holiness, and a blameless course of life and actions, the hands are cleansed. It is not in vain to serve God and keep his ordinances.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/73.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But as for me - literally, "And I." The meaning is, "And I, who so confidently now trust in God, and believe that he is good, was formerly in a far different state of mind; I was so hesitating, so troubled, and so doubtful, that I had almost entirely lost confidence in him as a wise and just moral governor."<p>My feet were almost gone - I was just ready to fall. Of course, this refers to his state of mind. In regard to his faith or confidence in God, he was like a man standing in a slippery place, and scarcely able to remain upright.<p>My steps had well nigh slipped - The expression rendered "well nigh" means "like nothing," or "as nothing;" that is, in reference to firmness it was as if there was "nothing" left. There was nothing which would keep him from slipping. The word rendered "slipped" means "poured out." That is, in his going he was like water poured out, instead of being like something solid and firm. The idea is, that his faith seemed to be all gone. He was like a falling man; a man who had no strength to walk. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/73.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

As the blessing of such a dominion after God's heart, not merely fertility but extraordinary fruitfulness may be confidently desired for the land &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;..), rendered by the Syriac version sugo, abundance, is correctly derived by the Jewish lexicographers from &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1505;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; (in the law relating to leprosy), Mishnic &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1492;, Aramaic &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1488;, Arabic fs&#780;a&#770;, but also fs&#780;s&#780; (vid., Job, at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14-16</a>), to extend, expandere; so that it signifies an abundance that occupies a broad space. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, unto the summit, as in <a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>. The idea thus obtained is the same as when Hofmann (Weissagung und Erf&#1516;llung, i. 180f.) takes &#1508;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1505;  equals  &#1488;&#1508;&#1505;) in the signification of a boundary line: "close upon the summit of the mountain shall the last corn stand," with reference to the terrace-like structure of the heights. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; does not refer back to &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (Hitzig, who misleads one by referring to <a href="/joel/2-3.htm">Joel 2:3</a>), but to &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;: may the corn stand so high and thick that the fields, being moved by the wind, shall shake, i.e., wave up and down, like the lofty thick forest of Lebanon. The lxx, which renders huperarthee'setai, takes &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, as Ewald does: may its fruit rise to a summit, i.e., rise high, like Lebanon. But a verb &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is unknown; and how bombastic is this figure in comparison with that grand, but beautiful figure, which we would not willingly exchange even for the conjecture &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (may it be rich)! The other wish refers to a rapid, joyful increase of the population: may men blossom out of this city and out of that city as the herb of the earth (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-25.htm">Job 5:25</a>, where &#1510;&#1488;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1498; also accords in sound with &#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;), i.e., fresh, beautiful, and abundant as it. Israel actually became under Solomon's sceptre as numerous "as the sand by the sea" (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>), but increase of population is also a settled feature in the picture of the Messianic time (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-20.htm">Isaiah 49:20</a>, <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a> [4]; cf. Sir. 44:21). If, however, under the just and benign rule of the king, both land and people are thus blessed, eternal duration may be desired for his name. May this name, is the wish of the poet, ever send forth new shoots (&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; Chethib), or receive new shoots (&#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; Ker, from Niph. &#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;), as long as the sun turns its face towards us, inasmuch as the happy and blessed results of the dominion of the king ever afford new occasion for glorifying his name. May they bless themselves in him, may all nations call him blessed, and that, as &#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1493;<p>(Note: Pronounce wejithba&#772;rchu, because the tone rests on the first letter of the root; whereas in <a href="/psalms/72-15.htm">Psalm 72:15</a> it is jeba&#772;rachenu with Chateph. vid., the rule in the Luther. Zeitschrift, 1863, S. 412.)<p>implies, so blessed that his abundance of blessing appears to them to be the highest that they can desire for themselves. To et benedicant sibi in eo we have to supply in thought the most universal, as yet undefined subject, which is then more exactly defined as omnes gentes with the second synonymous predicate. The accentuation (Athnach, Mugrash, Silluk) is blameless. </body></html>
