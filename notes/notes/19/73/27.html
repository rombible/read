This temptation, the working of envy and discontent, is very painful. In reflecting upon it, the psalmist owns it was his folly and ignorance thus to vex himself. If good men, at any time, through the surprise and strength of temptation, think, or speak, or act amiss, they will reflect upon it with sorrow and shame. We must ascribe our safety in temptation, and our victory, not to our own wisdom, but to the gracious presence of God with us, and Christ's intercession for us. All who commit themselves to God, shall be guided with the counsel both of his word and of his Spirit, the best counsellors here, and shall be received to his glory in another world; the believing hopes and prospects of which will reconcile us to all dark providences. And the psalmist was hereby quickened to cleave the closer to God. Heaven itself could not make us happy without the presence and love of our God. The world and all its glory vanishes. The body will fail by sickness, age, and death; when the flesh fails, the conduct, courage, and comfort fail. But Christ Jesus, our Lord, offers to be all in all to every poor sinner, who renounces all other portions and confidences. By sin we are all far from God. And a profession Christ, if we go on in sin, will increase our condemnation. May we draw near, and keep near, to our God, by faith and prayer, and find it good to do so. Those that with an upright heart put their trust in God, shall never want matter for thanksgiving to him. Blessed Lord, who hast so graciously promised to become our portion in the next world, prevent us from choosing any other in this.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/73.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish - All that are estranged from thee; all who are not thy friends.

Placing himself upon the standpoint of the end, he sees how the ungodly come to terrible destruction in a moment: they come to an end (&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, not &#1505;&#1508;&#1492;), it is all over with them (&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;) in consequence of (&#1502;&#1503; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/76-7.htm">Psalm 76:7</a>, and unconnected as in <a href="/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>) frightful occurrences (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514;, a favourite word, especially in the Book of Job), which clear them out of the way. It is with them as with a dream, after (&#1502;&#1503; as in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-8.htm">1 Chronicles 8:8</a>) one is awoke. One forgets the vision on account of its nothingness (<a href="/job/20-8.htm">Job 20:8</a>). So the evil-doers who boast themselves &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (<a href="/acts/25-23.htm">Acts 25:23</a>) are before God a &#1510;&#1500;&#1501;, a phantom or unsubstantial shadow. When He, the sovereign Lord, shall awake, i.e., arouse Himself to judgment after He has looked on with forbearance, then He will despise their shadowy image, will cast it contemptuously from Him. Luther renders, So machstu Herr jr Bilde in der Stad verschmecht (So dost Thou, Lord, make their image despised in the city). But neither has the Kal &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492; this double transitive signification, "to give over to contempt," nor is the mention of the city in place here. In <a href="/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a> also &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; in the signification in urbem gives no right sense; it signifies heat of anger or fury, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-8.htm">Jeremiah 15:8</a>, heat of anguish, and Schrder maintains the former signification (vid., on <a href="/psalms/139-20.htm">Psalm 139:20</a>), in fervore (irae), here also; but the pointing &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is against it. Therefore &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is to be regarded, with the Targum, as syncopated from &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (cf. &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, <a href="/jeremiah/39-7.htm">Jeremiah 39:7</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-10.htm">2 Chronicles 31:10</a>; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a>, and the like); not, however, to be explained, "when they awake," viz., from the sleep of death (Targum),<p>(Note: The Targum version is, "As the dream of a drunken man, who awakes out of his sleep, wilt Thou, O Lord, on the day of the great judgment, when they awake out of their graves, in wrath abandon their image to contempt." The text of our editions is to be thus corrected according to Bechai (on <a href="/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>) and Nachmani (in his treatise &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; &#1492;&#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;).)<p>or after <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a>, "when Thou awakest them," viz., out of their sleep of security (De Wette, Kurtz), but after <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-23.htm">Psalm 35:23</a>, "when Thou awakest," viz., to sit in judgment.<p>Thus far we have the divine answer, which is reproduced by the poet after the manner of prayer. Hengstenberg now goes on by rendering it, "for my heart was incensed;" but we cannot take &#1497;&#1514;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1509; according to the sequence of tenses as an imperfect, nor understand &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; as a particle expression the reason. On the contrary, the poet, from the standpoint of the explanation he has received, speaks of a possible return (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; seq. fut.  equals  &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;) of his temptation, and condemns it beforehand: si exacerbaretur animus meus atque in renibus meis pungerer. &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1509;, to become sour, bitter, passionate; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;, with the more exactly defining accusative &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, to be pricked, piqued, irritated. With &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; begins the apodosis: then should I be... I should have become (perfect as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-15.htm">Psalm 73:15</a>, according to Ges. 126, 5). Concerning &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, non sapere, vid., <a href="/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; can be taken as compar. decurtata for &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;; nevertheless, as apparently follows from <a href="//biblehub.com/job/40-15.htm">Job 40:15</a>, the poet surely has the p-ehe-mou, the water ox, i.e., the hippopotamus, in his mind, which being Hebraized is &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;,<p>(Note: The Egyptian p frequently passes over into the Hebrew b, and vice vers, as in the name Aperiu  equals  &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;; p, however, is retained in &#1508;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;  equals  phar-aa, grand-house (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; in Horapollo), the name of the Egyptian rulers, which begins with the sign of the plan of a house  equals  p.)<p>and, as a plump colossus of flesh, is at once an emblem of colossal stupidity (Maurer, Hitzig). The meaning of the poet is, that he would not be a man in relation to God, over against God (&#1506;&#1501;, as in <a href="/psalms/78-37.htm">Psalm 78:37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>, cf. Arab. ma&#8219;a, in comparison with), if he should again give way to the same doubts, but would be like the most stupid animal, which stands before God incapable of such knowledge as He willingly imparts to earnestly inquiring man. </body></html>
