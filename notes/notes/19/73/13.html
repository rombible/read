True religion is properly and fully described in this verse, by its two principal parts and works, the cleansing of the heart from sinful lusts and passions, and of the hands, or outward man, from a course of sinful actions.

But he lays down the great principle by which he resolved to abide. It is the goodness of God. This is a truth which cannot be shaken. Good thoughts of God will fortify against Satan's temptations. The faith even of strong believers may be sorely shaken, and ready to fail. There are storms that will try the firmest anchors. Foolish and wicked people have sometimes a great share of outward prosperity. They seem to have the least share of the troubles of this life; and they seem to have the greatest share of its comforts. They live without the fear of God, yet they prosper, and get on in the world. Wicked men often spend their lives without much sickness, and end them without great pain; while many godly persons scarcely know what health is, and die with great sufferings. Often the wicked are not frightened, either by the remembrance of their sins, or the prospect of their misery, but they die without terror. We cannot judge men's state beyond death, by what passes at their death. He looked abroad, and saw many of God's people greatly at a loss. Because the wicked are so very daring, therefore his people return hither; they know not what to say to it, and the rather, because they drink deep of the bitter cup of affliction. He spoke feelingly when he spoke of his own troubles; there is no disputing against sense, except by faith. From all this arose a strong temptation to cast off religion. But let us learn that the true course of sanctification consists in cleansing a man from all pollution both of soul and body. The heart is cleansed by the blood of Christ laid hold upon by faith; and by the begun works of the Lord's Spirit, manifested in the hearty resolution, purpose, and study of holiness, and a blameless course of life and actions, the hands are cleansed. It is not in vain to serve God and keep his ordinances.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/73.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So in Shakespeare, Richard III:<p>How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands<p>Of this most grievous, guilty murder done!<p>And make my hands never so clean - Or, rather, should I cleanse my hands with lye, or alkali. The word &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;  bo&#770;r, means properly purity, cleanliness, pureness; and then it is used to denote that which cleanses, alkali, lye, or vegetable salt. The ancients made use of this, mingled with oil, instead of soap, for the purpose of washing, and also in smelting metals, to make them melt more readily; see the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>. The Chaldee renders it accurately, &#1489;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1488; - in soap. I have no doubt that this is the sense, and that Job means to say, if he should make use of the purest water and of soap to cleanse himself, still he would be regarded as impure. God would throw him at once into the ditch, and he would be covered with moral filth and defilement again in his sight. <p><a href="/psalms/73-13.htm">Psalm 73:13</a>Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain - That is, There is no advantage in all my efforts to become pure and holy. It does not assist me in obtaining the favor of God; and it would be just as well to live a sinful life - to indulge in the pleasures of sense - to make the world my portion. Nothing is to be gained by all my painful efforts at self-discipline; by all my endeavors to become righteous. It would have been as well for me - or better - if I had lived a life of sin like other people. The righteous obtain from God fewer blessings than the wicked; they have less happiness and less prosperity in this world; they are subjected to more trouble and sorrow; and to all else there must be added the struggles, the conflict, the warfare, the painful effort "to be" pure, and to lead a holy life, all of which is now seen to be of no advantage whatever. Such thoughts as these were not confined to the psalmist. They are thoughts which will start up in the mind, and which it is not easy to calm down.<p>And washed my hands in innocency - That is, It has been of no use that I have washed my hands in innocency. The word "innocency" here means "purity." He had washed his hands in that which was pure; as, pure water. To wash the hands is emblematic of innocence or purity.

The Prayer book Version inserts, between this verse and the last, the words, "and I said;" which is correct, though somewhat free, exegesis.

Nevertheless the traditional reading also gives a suitable sense; not (since the fat tends to make the eyes appear to be deeper in) "their eyes come forward prae adipe," but, "they stare forth ex adipe, out of the fat of their bloated visage," &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489; being equivalent to &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="/job/15-27.htm">Job 15:27</a>.

Their fellow-man is the sport of their caprice; they speak or dictate &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, down from an eminence, upon which they imagine themselves to be raised high above others.

Jde 1:16); the Most High and Holy One, too, is blasphemed by them, and their tongue runs officiously and imperiously through the earth below, everywhere disparaging that which exists and giving new laws. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>, a Kal sounding much like Hithpa., in the signification grassari.

This is what is meant to be further said, and not that this band of servile followers is in fulness absorbed by them (Sachs). Around the proud free-thinkers there gathers a rabble submissive to them, which eagerly drinks in everything that proceeds from them as though it were the true water of life. Even in David's time (<a href="/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-2.htm">Psalm 36:2</a>) there were already such stout spirits (<a href="/isaiah/46-12.htm">Isaiah 46:12</a>) with a servu&#770;m imitatorum pecus. A still far more favourable soil for these &#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; was the worldly age of Solomon. </body></html>
