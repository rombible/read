This temptation, the working of envy and discontent, is very painful. In reflecting upon it, the psalmist owns it was his folly and ignorance thus to vex himself. If good men, at any time, through the surprise and strength of temptation, think, or speak, or act amiss, they will reflect upon it with sorrow and shame. We must ascribe our safety in temptation, and our victory, not to our own wisdom, but to the gracious presence of God with us, and Christ's intercession for us. All who commit themselves to God, shall be guided with the counsel both of his word and of his Spirit, the best counsellors here, and shall be received to his glory in another world; the believing hopes and prospects of which will reconcile us to all dark providences. And the psalmist was hereby quickened to cleave the closer to God. Heaven itself could not make us happy without the presence and love of our God. The world and all its glory vanishes. The body will fail by sickness, age, and death; when the flesh fails, the conduct, courage, and comfort fail. But Christ Jesus, our Lord, offers to be all in all to every poor sinner, who renounces all other portions and confidences. By sin we are all far from God. And a profession Christ, if we go on in sin, will increase our condemnation. May we draw near, and keep near, to our God, by faith and prayer, and find it good to do so. Those that with an upright heart put their trust in God, shall never want matter for thanksgiving to him. Blessed Lord, who hast so graciously promised to become our portion in the next world, prevent us from choosing any other in this.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/73.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So foolish was I, and ignorant - Such low and imperfect views did I take of the subject.

The poet has resolved the riddle of such an unequal distribution of the fortunes of men in a totally different way. Instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-15.htm">Psalm 73:15</a>, to read &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1492;&#1501; (B&#1510;ttcher), or better, by taking up the following &#1492;&#1504;&#1492;, which even Saadia allows himself to do, contrary to the accents (Arab. mt&#817;l hd&#817;a&#770;), &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (Ewald), is unnecessary, since prepositions are sometimes used elliptically (&#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/isaiah/59-18.htm">Isaiah 59:18</a>), or even without anything further (<a href="/hosea/7-16.htm">Hosea 7:16</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>) as adverbs, which must therefore be regarded as possible also in the case of &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; (Aramaic, Arabic &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;, Aethiopic kem). The poet means to say, If I had made up my mind to the same course of reasoning, I should have faithlessly forsaken the fellowship of the children of God, and should consequently also have forfeited their blessings. The subjunctive signification of the perfects in the hypothetical protasis and apodosis, <a href="/psalms/73-15.htm">Psalm 73:15</a> (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/23-22.htm">Jeremiah 23:22</a>), follows solely from the context; futures instead of perfects would signify si dicerem...perfide agerem. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; is the totality of those, in whom the filial relationship in which God has placed Isreal in relation to Himself is become an inward or spiritual reality, the true Israel, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-1.htm">Psalm 73:1</a>, the "righteous generation," <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>. It is an appellative, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>. For on the point of the uhiothesi'a the New Testament differs from the Old Testament in this way, viz., that in the Old Testament it is always only as a people that Israel is called &#1489;&#1503;, or as a whole &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, but that the individual, and that in his direct relationship to God, dared not as yet call himself "child of God." The individual character is not as yet freed from its absorption in the species, it is not as yet independent; it is the time of the minor's &#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, and the adoption is as yet only effected nationally, salvation is as yet within the limits of the nationality, its common human form has not as yet appeared. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491; with &#1489;&#1468; signifies to deal faithlessly with any one, and more especially (whether God, a friend, or a spouse) faithlessly to forsake him; here, in this sense of malicious desertion, it contents itself with the simple accusative.<p>On the one side, by joining in the speech of the free-thinkers he would have placed himself outside the circle of the children of God, of the truly pious; on the other side, however, when by meditation he sought to penetrate it (&#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;), the doubt-provoking phenomenon (&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;) still continued to be to him &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, trouble, i.e., something that troubled him without any result, an unsolvable riddle (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>). Whether we read &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; or &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, the sense remains the same; the Ker &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; prefers, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-11.htm">Job 31:11</a>, the attractional gender. Neither here nor in <a href="/job/30-26.htm">Job 30:26</a> and elsewhere is it to be supposed that &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492; is equivalent to &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492; (Ewald, Hupfeld). The cohortative from of the future here, as frequently (Ges. 128, 1), with or without a conditional particle (<a href="/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-38.htm">2 Samuel 22:38</a>; <a href="/job/16-6.htm">Job 16:6</a>; <a href="/job/11-17.htm">Job 11:17</a>; <a href="/job/19-18.htm">Job 19:18</a>; <a href="/job/30-26.htm">Job 30:26</a>), forms a hypothetical protasis: and (yet) when I meditated; Symmachus (according to Montfaucon), &#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;. As Vaihinger aptly observes, "thinking alone will give neither the right light nor true happiness." Both are found only in faith. The poet at last struck upon the way of faith, and there he found light and peace. The future after &#1506;&#1491; frequently has the signification of the imperfect subjunctive, <a href="/job/32-11.htm">Job 32:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:3</a>, cf. <a href="/proverbs/12-19.htm">Proverbs 12:19</a> (donec nutem  equals  only a moment); also in an historical connection like <a href="/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-34.htm">2 Chronicles 29:34</a>, it is conceived of as subjunctive (donec ulciseretur, se sanctificarent), sometimes, however, as indicative, as in <a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a> (donec transibat) and in our passage, where &#1488;&#1491; introduces the objective goal at which the riddle found its solution: until I went into the sanctuary of God, (purposely) attended to (&#1500; as in the primary passage <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-29.htm">Deuteronomy 32:29</a>, cf. <a href="/job/14-21.htm">Job 14:21</a>) their life's end. The cohortative is used here exactly as in &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, but with the collateral notion of that which is intentional, which here fully accords with the connection. He went into God's dread sanctuary (plural as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-36.htm">Psalm 68:36</a>, cf. &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; in the Psalms of Asaph, <a href="/psalms/67-7.htm">Psalm 67:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-69.htm">Psalm 78:69</a>); here he prayed for light in the darkness of his conflict, here were his eyes opened to the holy plans and ways of God (<a href="/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14</a>), here the sight of the sad end of the evil-doers was presented to him. By "God's sanctuaries" Ewald and Hitzig understand His secrets; but this meaning is without support in the usage of the language. And is it not a thought perfectly in harmony with the context and with experience, that a light arose upon him when he withdrew from the bustle of the world into the quiet of God's dwelling - place, and there devoutly gave his mind to the matter?<p>The strophe closes with a summary confession of the explanation received there. &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; is construed with Lamed inasmuch as collocare is equivalent to locum assignare (vid., <a href="/psalms/73-6.htm">Psalm 73:6</a>). God makes the evil-doers to stand on smooth, slippery places, where one may easily lose one's footing (cf. <a href="/psalms/35-6.htm">Psalm 35:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>). There, then, they also inevitably fall; God casts them down &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, into ruins, fragores  equals  ruinae, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, to be confused, desolate, to rumble. The word only has the appearance of being from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;: ensnarings, sudden attacks (Hitzig), which is still more ill suited to <a href="/psalms/74-3.htm">Psalm 74:3</a> than to this passage; desolation and ruin can be said even of persons, as &#1492;&#1512;&#1505;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>, &#1493;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-15.htm">Isaiah 8:15</a>, &#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1509;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-21.htm">Jeremiah 51:21-23</a>. The poet knows no other theodicy but this, nor was any other known generally in the pre-exilic literature of Israel (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1-13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/12.htm">Jeremiah 12</a>, and the <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>). The later prophecy and the Chokma were much in advance of this, inasmuch as they point to a last universal judgment (vid., more particularly <a href="/malachi/3-13.htm">Malachi 3:13</a>.), but not one that breaks off this present state; the present state and the future state, time and eternity, are even there not as yet thoroughly separated. </body></html>
