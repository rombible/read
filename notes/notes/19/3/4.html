David had always found God ready to answer his prayers. Nothing can fix a gulf between the communications of God's grace towards us, and the working of his grace in us; between his favour and our faith. He had always been very safe under the Divine protection. This is applicable to the common mercies of every night, for which we ought to give thanks every morning. Many lie down, and cannot sleep, through pain of body, or anguish of mind, or the continual alarms of fear in the night. But it seems here rather to be meant of the calmness of David's spirit, in the midst of his dangers. The Lord, by his grace and the consolations of his Spirit, made him easy. It is a great mercy, when we are in trouble, to have our minds stayed upon God. Behold the Son of David composing himself to his rest upon the cross, that bed of sorrows; commending his Spirit into the Father's hands in full confidence of a joyful resurrection. Behold this, O Christian: let faith teach thee how to sleep, and how to die; while it assures thee that as sleep is a short death, so death is only a longer sleep; the same God watches over thee, in thy bed and in thy grave. David's faith became triumphant. He began the psalm with complaints of the strength and malice of his enemies; but concludes with rejoicing in the power and grace of his God, and now sees more with him than against him. Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; he has power to save, be the danger ever so great. All that have the Lord for their God, are sure of salvation; for he who is their God, is the God of Salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I cried unto the Lord - That is, in these troubles, as he had always done in affliction. The form of the verb here is future - "I will cry" or call unto the Lord; probably, however, designed to state a general habit with him, that when troubles came he always called on the Lord. He speaks now of himself as if in the midst of the trouble; gives utterance to the feeling which he has always had in his sorrows; and says, "I will call upon the Lord," thus declaring his purpose to make his appeal confidently to him. Thus, the language is not so much retrospective as it is indicative of the uniform state of his mind in the midst of afflictions.<p>With my voice - Not merely mentally, but he gave utterance to the deep anguish of his soul in words. So the Saviour did in the garden of Gethsemane <a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>; and so, perhaps, most persons do in deep affliction. It is natural then to cry out for help; and besides the fact that we may hope that any prayer then, though mental only, would bring relief by being answered, there is a measure of relief found by the very act of giving utterance or vent to the deep and, as it were, pent-up feelings of the soul. In calmer times we are satisfied with unuttered aspirations, with gentle ejaculations, with sweet mental communion with God; in overwhelming trials we give utterance to our feelings in the earnest language of pleading.<p>And he heard me - Or, "then he hears me;" that is, when I call. The psalmist refers to what he had constantly found to be true, that God was a hearer of prayer.<p>Out of his holy hill - Zion. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>. That was the place to which David had removed the ark, and which was regarded, therefore, as the special dwelling-place of the Most High. To him, as dwelling in Zion, prayer was accustomed to be offered, and there he was accustomed to answer prayer. To this fact David here refers as one that had been illustrated in his former days. To that God who had thus answered him he felt that he might confidently appeal now.<p>Selah - Indicating another strophe or musical pause.

The experience which the psalmist had of being heard in prayer, was what gave great encouragement to his faith, as to his interest in God and salvation by him, when his enemies were so increased about him; for crying here is to be understood of prayer, as it is often used in this book of Psalms: and so the Targum renders it, "I prayed"; and this designs vocal prayer. Sometimes there is a crying in prayer and no voice heard, as it is said of Moses, <a href="/exodus/14-15.htm">Exodus 14:15</a>; and was the case of Hannah, <a href="/1_samuel/1-13.htm">1 Samuel 1:13</a>; but this was with a voice, and a loud one, as in <a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>; denoting ardour, fervency, and importunity; and such prayer avails much with God. The object addressed in prayer is the Lord, the God of his life, and who was able to save him, and supply all his wants; <p>and he heard me out of his holy hill; either out of the church, the holy hill of Zion, <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>; where David prayed and God granted his presence, and gave an answer to his prayers; or out from the mercy seat and ark, which was a type of the propitiatory, Christ, and which David had brought to his own city, the hill of Zion; or from heaven, the habitation of God's holiness: David was a man of prayer, and he was often heard and answered by God. And this also is true of Christ, he offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to God <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>, that was able to save him; and he was heard by him, yea, the Father always heard him: and God is a God hearing and answering the prayers of his people, sooner or later: sometimes before, sometimes at, and sometimes after their crying to him. <p>Selah; on this word; see Gill on <a href="/psalms/3-2.htm">Psalm 3:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill.

The exhortation is not addressed to those whom he has seen in a state of rebellion, but to kings in general with reference to what he has prophetically seen and heard. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; are not those who judge the earth, but the judges, i.e., rulers (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-3.htm">Amos 2:3</a>, cf. 1:8), belonging to the earth, throughout its length or breadth.

This general call to reflection is followed, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>, by a special exhortation in reference to Jahve, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>, in reference to the Son. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; answer to each other: the latter is not according to <a href="/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a> in the sense of &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/96-9.htm">Psalm 96:9</a>, but, - since "to shake with trembling" (Hitz.) is a tautology, and as an imperative &#1490;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; everywhere else signifies: rejoice, - according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/100-2.htm">Psalm 100:2</a>, in the sense of rapturous manifestation of joy at the happiness and honour of being permitted to be servants of such a God. The lxx correctly renders it: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837;. Their rejoicing, in order that it may not run to the excess of security and haughtiness, is to be blended with trembling (&#1489;&#1468; as <a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>), viz., with the trembling of reverence and self-control, for God is a consuming fire, <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>.<p>The second exhortation, which now follows, having reference to their relationship to the Anointed One, has been missed by all the ancient versions except the Syriac, as though its clearness had blinded the translators, since they render &#1489;&#1512;, either &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; purity, chastity, discipline (lxx, Targ., Ital., Vulg.), or &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; pure, unmixed (Aq., Symm., Jer.: adorate pure). Thus also Hupfeld renders it "yield sincerely," whereas it is rendered by Ewald "receive wholesome warning," and by Hitzig "submit to duty" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; like the Arabic birr  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;); Olshausen even thinks, there may be some mistake in &#1489;&#1512;, and Diestel decides for &#1489;&#1493; instead of &#1489;&#1512;. But the context and the usage of the language require osculamini filium. The Piel &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1511; means to kiss, and never anything else; and while &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; in Hebrew means purity and nothing more, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; as an adverb, pure, cannot be supported, nothing is more natural here, after Jahve has acknowledged His Anointed One as His Son, than that &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (<a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/31-2.htm">Proverbs 31:2</a>, even &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;) - which has nothing strange about it when found in solemn discourse, and here helps one over the dissonance of &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; - should, in a like absolute manner to &#1495;&#1511;, denote the unique son, and in fact the Son of God.<p>(Note: Apart from the fact of &#1489;&#1512; not having the article, its indefiniteness comes under the point of view of that which, because it combines with it the idea of the majestic, great, and terrible, is called by the Arabian grammarians Arab. 'l-tnk&#305;&#770;r lt'd&#305;&#770;m or ltkt&#305;&#770;r or lthw&#305;&#770;l; by the boundlessness which lies in it it challenges the imagination to magnify the notion which it thus expresses. An Arabic expositor would here (as in <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a> above) render it "Kiss a son and such a son!" (vid., Ibn Hisha&#770;m in De Sacy's Anthol. Grammat. p. 85, where it is to be translated hic est vir, qualis vir!). Examples which support this doctrine are &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; <a href="/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a> by a hand, viz., God's almighty hand which is the hand of hands, and <a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a> &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489; before a sword, viz., the divine sword which brooks no opposing weapon.)<p>The exhortation to submit to Jahve is followed, as Aben-Ezra has observed, by the exhortation to do homage to Jahve's Son. To kiss is equivalent to to do homage. Samuel kisses Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), saying that thereby he does homage to him.<p>(Note: On this vid., Scacchi Myrothecium, to. iii.((1637) c. 35.)<p>The subject to what follows is now, however, not the Son, but Jahve. It is certainly at least quite as natural to the New Testament consciousness to refer "lest He be angry" to the Son (vid., <a href="/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a>.), and since the warning against putting trust (&#1495;&#1505;&#1493;&#1514;) in princes, <a href="/psalms/118-9.htm">Psalm 118:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>, cannot be applied to the Christ of God, the reference of &#1489;&#1493; to Him (Hengst.) cannot be regarded as impossible. But since &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468; is the usual word for taking confiding refuge in Jahve, and the future day of wrath is always referred to in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>) as the day of the wrath of God, we refer the ne irascatur to Him whose son the Anointed One is; therefore it is to be rendered: lest Jahve be angry and ye perish &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;. This &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is the accus. of more exact definition. If the way of any one perish. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>, he himself is lost with regard to the way, since this leads him into the abyss. It is questionable whether &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; means "for a little" in the sense of brevi or facile. The usus loquendi and position of the words favour the latter (Hupf.). Everywhere else &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; means by itself (without such additions as in <a href="/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-47.htm">Ezekiel 16:47</a>) "for a little, nearly, easily." At least this meaning is secured to it when it occurs after hypothetical antecedent clauses as in <a href="/psalms/81-15.htm">Psalm 81:15</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a>; <a href="/job/32-22.htm">Job 32:22</a>. Therefore it is to be rendered: for His wrath might kindle easily, or might kindle suddenly. The poet warns the rulers in their own highest interest not to challenge the wrathful zeal of Jahve for His Christ, which according to <a href="/psalms/2-5.htm">Psalm 2:5</a> is inevitable. Well is it with all those who have nothing to fear from this outburst of wrath, because they hide themselves in Jahve as their refuge. The construct state &#1495;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497; connects &#1489;&#1493;, without a genitive relation, with itself as forming together one notion, Ges. 116, 1. &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; the usual word for fleeing confidingly to Jahve, means according to its radical notion not so much refugere, confugere, as se abdere, condere, and is therefore never combined with &#1488;&#1500;, but always with &#1489;&#1468;.<p>(Note: On old names of towns, which show this ancient &#1495;&#1505;&#1492;. Wetzstein's remark on <a href="/job/24-8.htm">Job 24:8</a> [Comm. on Job, en loc.]. The Arabic still has hsy in the reference of the primary meaning to water which, sucked in and hidden, flows under the sand and only comes to sight on digging. The rocky bottom on which it collects beneath the surface of the sand and by which it is prevented from oozing away or drying up is called Arab. hasa&#770; or hisa&#770; a hiding-place or place of protection, and a fountain dug there is called Arab. &#8219;yn 'l-hy.) </body></html>
