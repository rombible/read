David had always found God ready to answer his prayers. Nothing can fix a gulf between the communications of God's grace towards us, and the working of his grace in us; between his favour and our faith. He had always been very safe under the Divine protection. This is applicable to the common mercies of every night, for which we ought to give thanks every morning. Many lie down, and cannot sleep, through pain of body, or anguish of mind, or the continual alarms of fear in the night. But it seems here rather to be meant of the calmness of David's spirit, in the midst of his dangers. The Lord, by his grace and the consolations of his Spirit, made him easy. It is a great mercy, when we are in trouble, to have our minds stayed upon God. Behold the Son of David composing himself to his rest upon the cross, that bed of sorrows; commending his Spirit into the Father's hands in full confidence of a joyful resurrection. Behold this, O Christian: let faith teach thee how to sleep, and how to die; while it assures thee that as sleep is a short death, so death is only a longer sleep; the same God watches over thee, in thy bed and in thy grave. David's faith became triumphant. He began the psalm with complaints of the strength and malice of his enemies; but concludes with rejoicing in the power and grace of his God, and now sees more with him than against him. Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; he has power to save, be the danger ever so great. All that have the Lord for their God, are sure of salvation; for he who is their God, is the God of Salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I laid me down and slept - Notwithstanding these troubles and dangers I had such confidence that God hears prayer, and such calm trust in his protection, that I laid me down gently and slept securely. The psalmist mentions this as a remarkable proof of the divine protection and favor. He was driven from his capital, his throne, and his home. He was compelled to wander as a poor fugitive, accompanied by only a few friends. He was pursued by enemies, who were numbered by thousands. He was made an exile, and persecuted by his own son; and with this son there were men of age and of experience in war. The forces of his enemies might come upon him at any moment. In these circumstances, persecuted as he was, and under all the anxiety and distress which he felt in view of the ungrateful conduct of his own son, he regarded it as a singular proof of the divine favor, and as an illustration of the peace which confidence in God gives to those who put their trust in him, that on such a dreadful night he was permitted to lie calmly down and sleep. As such a proof and illustration it may be regarded here: a proof of the unspeakable value of the divine favor, and an illustration of the effect of confidence in God in giving calmness and peace of mind in time of trouble. <a href="/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>.<p>I awaked - Still safe and secure. He had not been suddenly attacked by his foes, and made to sleep the sleep of death; he had not been crushed by anguish of spirit. That we are "awaked" in the morning after a night's refreshing slumber; that we are raised up again to the enjoyments of life; that we are permitted again to greet our friends and to unite with them in the privileges of devotion, should always be regarded as a new proof of the goodness of God, and should lead to acts of praise. We have no power to awake ourselves; and when we remember how many are taken away from our world each night - how many there are who lie down to sleep to wake no more, we should never rise from a bed of repose without giving our first thoughts in gratitude to our Great Preserver.<p>For the Lord sustained me - He kept me from danger; he preserved me from death. And it is as true now as it was then, that God is the supporter of life when men sleep. He guards us; he causes the action of the heart to be continued as it propels the blood through our frame; he secures the gentle heaving of the lungs, both when we slumber and when we wake. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. the Lord sustained me&#8212;literally, "will sustain me," as if his language or thought when he laid down, and the reason of his composure.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/3.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me.<p>6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.<p>David's faith enabled him to lie down; anxiety would certainly have kept him on tiptoe, watching for an enemy. Yea, he was able to sleep, to sleep in the midst of trouble, surrounded by foes. "So he giveth his beloved sleep." There is a sleep of presumption; God deliver us from it! There is a sleep of holy confidence; God help us so to close our eyes! But David says he awaked also. Some sleep the sleep of death; but he, though exposed to many enemies, reclined his head on the bosom of his God, slept happily beneath the wing of Providence in sweet security, and then awoke in safety. "For the Lord sustained me." The sweet influence of the Pleiades of promise shone upon the sleeper, and he awoke conscious that the Lord had preserved him. An excellent divine has well remarked - "This quietude of a man's heart by faith in God, is a higher sort of work than the natural resolution of manly courage, for it is the gracious operation of God's Holy Spirit upholding a man above nature, and therefore the Lord must have all the glory of it."<p>Buckling on his harness for the day's battle, our hero sings, "I will not be afraid often thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about." Observe that he does not attempt to under-estimate the number or wisdom of his enemies. He reckons them at tens of thousands, and he views them as cunning huntsmen chasing him with cruel skill. Yet he trembles not, but looking his foeman in the face he is ready for the battle. There may be no way of escape; they may hem me in as the deer are surrounded by a circle of hunters; they may surround me on every side, but in the name of God I will dash through them; or, if I remain in the midst of them, yet shall they not hurt me; I shall be free in my very prison.<p>But David is too wise to venture to the battle without prayer; he therefore betakes himself to his knees, and cries aloud to Jehovah. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I laid me down and slept, </span> to wit, securely, casting all my cares and fears upon God, and relying upon his help.

After the battle was over between Absalom's men and his, says Aben Ezra; but rather this was in the midst of his trouble and distress, since he afterwards prays for salvation: and this sleep was either, as Jarchi observes, through his heart being overwhelmed with grief; for there have been instances of persons sleeping through sorrow, as Elijah, Jonah, and the disciples of Christ, <a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>; or rather this is expressive of the calmness and serenity of his mind amidst his troubles; he laid himself down in peace, and slept quietly and comfortably; he did not lose a night's rest, his sleep was sweet unto him; which was a blessing of life from the Lord that everyone does not enjoy; see <a href="/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>; <p>I awakened; in the morning, alive and cheerful, Some lay themselves down and never awake more, as Sisera the captain of Jabin's army, and Ishbosheth the son of Saul; and this might have been David's case, considering the circumstances he was in: and others, through perplexing thoughts and cares, or pains of body, or uneasy dreams, rise fatigued and distressed; but David arose in good health of body, and tranquillity of mind, and comfortably refreshed; <p>for the Lord sustained me; the psalmist committed himself to the care and protection of God; he laid himself down in his arms, and there slept in safety; the Lord preserved him, who is Israel's keeper, that neither slumbers nor sleeps: and he rose in health and cheerfulness in the morning, supported by his right hand. This shows, that lying down to sleep, when in such circumstances, and awaking with cheerfulness, were not owing to rashness, stupidity, and insensibility, but to divine supports. These words may be interpreted, as they are by some of the ancients, of the death of Christ, and of his resurrection from the dead by the power of God; death is often expressed by sleep, and the resurrection of the dead by an awaking out of sleep, <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>; and Christ's death being signified by lying down and sleeping, may denote both the voluntariness of it, that he laid down his life freely and willingly; and his short continuance under the power of death, it was but like a night's sleep; and his resurrection from the dead, being expressed by an awaking through the Lord's sustaining him, shows that it was by the power of God, even the exceeding greatness of his power: and the whole of this may be applied to the case and state of the saints and people of God, who at times have rest and peace amidst their enemies; though they have tribulation in the world, they have peace in Christ; and notwithstanding the temptations of Satan, and the corruptions of their own hearts, they have joy and comfort through believing in Christ; the Lord sustains them with precious promises, and supports them with the discoveries of his love, and upholds them with the right hand of his righteousness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.

With &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; (<a href="/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>), itaque, appropriate conclusions are drawn from some general moral matter of face (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/5-7.htm">Proverbs 5:7</a>) or some fact connected with the history of redemption (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>). The exhortation is not addressed to those whom he has seen in a state of rebellion, but to kings in general with reference to what he has prophetically seen and heard. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; are not those who judge the earth, but the judges, i.e., rulers (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-3.htm">Amos 2:3</a>, cf. 1:8), belonging to the earth, throughout its length or breadth. The Hiph. &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; signifies to show intelligence or discernment; the Niph. &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512; as a so-called Niph. tolerativum, to let one's self be chastened or instructed, like &#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1509; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/13-10.htm">Proverbs 13:10</a>, to allow one's self to be advised, &#1504;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>, to allow one's self to be sought, &#1504;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; to allow one's self to be found, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>, and frequently. This general call to reflection is followed, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>, by a special exhortation in reference to Jahve, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>, in reference to the Son. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; answer to each other: the latter is not according to <a href="/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a> in the sense of &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/96-9.htm">Psalm 96:9</a>, but, - since "to shake with trembling" (Hitz.) is a tautology, and as an imperative &#1490;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; everywhere else signifies: rejoice, - according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/100-2.htm">Psalm 100:2</a>, in the sense of rapturous manifestation of joy at the happiness and honour of being permitted to be servants of such a God. The lxx correctly renders it: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837;. Their rejoicing, in order that it may not run to the excess of security and haughtiness, is to be blended with trembling (&#1489;&#1468; as <a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>), viz., with the trembling of reverence and self-control, for God is a consuming fire, <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>.<p>The second exhortation, which now follows, having reference to their relationship to the Anointed One, has been missed by all the ancient versions except the Syriac, as though its clearness had blinded the translators, since they render &#1489;&#1512;, either &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; purity, chastity, discipline (lxx, Targ., Ital., Vulg.), or &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; pure, unmixed (Aq., Symm., Jer.: adorate pure). Thus also Hupfeld renders it "yield sincerely," whereas it is rendered by Ewald "receive wholesome warning," and by Hitzig "submit to duty" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; like the Arabic birr  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;); Olshausen even thinks, there may be some mistake in &#1489;&#1512;, and Diestel decides for &#1489;&#1493; instead of &#1489;&#1512;. But the context and the usage of the language require osculamini filium. The Piel &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1511; means to kiss, and never anything else; and while &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; in Hebrew means purity and nothing more, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; as an adverb, pure, cannot be supported, nothing is more natural here, after Jahve has acknowledged His Anointed One as His Son, than that &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (<a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/31-2.htm">Proverbs 31:2</a>, even &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;) - which has nothing strange about it when found in solemn discourse, and here helps one over the dissonance of &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; - should, in a like absolute manner to &#1495;&#1511;, denote the unique son, and in fact the Son of God.<p>(Note: Apart from the fact of &#1489;&#1512; not having the article, its indefiniteness comes under the point of view of that which, because it combines with it the idea of the majestic, great, and terrible, is called by the Arabian grammarians Arab. 'l-tnk&#305;&#770;r lt'd&#305;&#770;m or ltkt&#305;&#770;r or lthw&#305;&#770;l; by the boundlessness which lies in it it challenges the imagination to magnify the notion which it thus expresses. An Arabic expositor would here (as in <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a> above) render it "Kiss a son and such a son!" (vid., Ibn Hisha&#770;m in De Sacy's Anthol. Grammat. p. 85, where it is to be translated hic est vir, qualis vir!). Examples which support this doctrine are &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; <a href="/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a> by a hand, viz., God's almighty hand which is the hand of hands, and <a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a> &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489; before a sword, viz., the divine sword which brooks no opposing weapon.)<p>The exhortation to submit to Jahve is followed, as Aben-Ezra has observed, by the exhortation to do homage to Jahve's Son. To kiss is equivalent to to do homage. Samuel kisses Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), saying that thereby he does homage to him.<p>(Note: On this vid., Scacchi Myrothecium, to. iii.((1637) c. 35.)<p>The subject to what follows is now, however, not the Son, but Jahve. It is certainly at least quite as natural to the New Testament consciousness to refer "lest He be angry" to the Son (vid., <a href="/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a>.), and since the warning against putting trust (&#1495;&#1505;&#1493;&#1514;) in princes, <a href="/psalms/118-9.htm">Psalm 118:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>, cannot be applied to the Christ of God, the reference of &#1489;&#1493; to Him (Hengst.) cannot be regarded as impossible. But since &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468; is the usual word for taking confiding refuge in Jahve, and the future day of wrath is always referred to in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>) as the day of the wrath of God, we refer the ne irascatur to Him whose son the Anointed One is; therefore it is to be rendered: lest Jahve be angry and ye perish &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;. This &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is the accus. of more exact definition. If the way of any one perish. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>, he himself is lost with regard to the way, since this leads him into the abyss. It is questionable whether &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; means "for a little" in the sense of brevi or facile. The usus loquendi and position of the words favour the latter (Hupf.). Everywhere else &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; means by itself (without such additions as in <a href="/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-47.htm">Ezekiel 16:47</a>) "for a little, nearly, easily." At least this meaning is secured to it when it occurs after hypothetical antecedent clauses as in <a href="/psalms/81-15.htm">Psalm 81:15</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a>; <a href="/job/32-22.htm">Job 32:22</a>. Therefore it is to be rendered: for His wrath might kindle easily, or might kindle suddenly. The poet warns the rulers in their own highest interest not to challenge the wrathful zeal of Jahve for His Christ, which according to <a href="/psalms/2-5.htm">Psalm 2:5</a> is inevitable. Well is it with all those who have nothing to fear from this outburst of wrath, because they hide themselves in Jahve as their refuge.
