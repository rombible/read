David had always found God ready to answer his prayers. Nothing can fix a gulf between the communications of God's grace towards us, and the working of his grace in us; between his favour and our faith. He had always been very safe under the Divine protection. This is applicable to the common mercies of every night, for which we ought to give thanks every morning. Many lie down, and cannot sleep, through pain of body, or anguish of mind, or the continual alarms of fear in the night. But it seems here rather to be meant of the calmness of David's spirit, in the midst of his dangers. The Lord, by his grace and the consolations of his Spirit, made him easy. It is a great mercy, when we are in trouble, to have our minds stayed upon God. Behold the Son of David composing himself to his rest upon the cross, that bed of sorrows; commending his Spirit into the Father's hands in full confidence of a joyful resurrection. Behold this, O Christian: let faith teach thee how to sleep, and how to die; while it assures thee that as sleep is a short death, so death is only a longer sleep; the same God watches over thee, in thy bed and in thy grave. David's faith became triumphant. He began the psalm with complaints of the strength and malice of his enemies; but concludes with rejoicing in the power and grace of his God, and now sees more with him than against him. Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; he has power to save, be the danger ever so great. All that have the Lord for their God, are sure of salvation; for he who is their God, is the God of Salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will not be afraid - As the result of this new proof of the divine protection, and in view of all that God has done and has promised, the psalmist now says that he would not be afraid though any number of foes should rise up against him. Perhaps this confiding and exulting spirit may be regarded in some measure as the "result" of the calm and refreshing slumber which he had enjoyed. The mind as well as the body had been refreshed and invigorated. With the bright light of a new morning he looked with more cheerful views and hopes on the things around him, and felt new strength to meet the dangers to which he was exposed. Who in trouble and sorrow has not felt this? Who has not experienced the influence of the slumbers of a night and of the light of the morning, in giving new vigour and inspiring new hopes, as if the returning day was an emblem of brighter scenes in life, and the passing away of the shades of night a token that all trouble and sorrow would flee away?<p>Of ten thousands of people - Myriads: Though myriads are arrayed against me. He does not, of course, pretend to any exactness here; but he felt that the number of his enemies was very great. This "was" the case in the rebellion of Absalom. Ahithophel proposed to Absalom to "choose out twelve thousand men" with whom he might pursue after David, implying that the number with him was actually much greater than that, <a href="/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1</a>)<p>That have set themselves against me - That have arrayed themselves against me; or that have risen up in rebellion against me.<p>Round about - Intending to hem me in on every side.

David was a man of courage from his youth; the instances of his attacking the lion and the bear, when he kept his father's sheep, his engaging with Goliath, and his military exploits, show it; and though there were now many thousands up in arms against him, and his own son at the head of them; all the tribes of Israel were revolting from him, and he was only attended with a few of his friends, yet he was not dismayed; for that he refers to this insurrection appears by what follows, <p>that have set themselves against me round about; and this was owing not to himself; but to the Lord's sustaining of him; see <a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; and such courage and greatness of soul did his antitype the Messiah express, and to a greater degree, when Judas, with his band of soldiers, and the multitude with clubs and staves, entered the garden to apprehend him; and when the prince of this world was marching towards him, and when he was engaged with all the powers of darkness, and when the sorrows of death compassed him about, yet he failed not, nor was he discouraged: and something of this spirit appears in true believers, When they are in the exercise of faith, have the presence of God, and the discoveries of his love; they are then not afraid what man can do unto them; nor are they afraid of devils themselves, but wrestle against them; nor of any nor all their enemies, they having victory over them, given by God through Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will not be afraid of (c) ten thousands of people, that have set <i>themselves</i> against me round about.</span><p>(c) When he considered the truth of God's promise, and tried the same, his faith increased marvellously.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

The exhortation is not addressed to those whom he has seen in a state of rebellion, but to kings in general with reference to what he has prophetically seen and heard. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; are not those who judge the earth, but the judges, i.e., rulers (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-3.htm">Amos 2:3</a>, cf. 1:8), belonging to the earth, throughout its length or breadth.

This general call to reflection is followed, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>, by a special exhortation in reference to Jahve, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>, in reference to the Son. &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; answer to each other: the latter is not according to <a href="/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a> in the sense of &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/96-9.htm">Psalm 96:9</a>, but, - since "to shake with trembling" (Hitz.) is a tautology, and as an imperative &#1490;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; everywhere else signifies: rejoice, - according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/100-2.htm">Psalm 100:2</a>, in the sense of rapturous manifestation of joy at the happiness and honour of being permitted to be servants of such a God. The lxx correctly renders it: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837;. Their rejoicing, in order that it may not run to the excess of security and haughtiness, is to be blended with trembling (&#1489;&#1468; as <a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>), viz., with the trembling of reverence and self-control, for God is a consuming fire, <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>.<p>The second exhortation, which now follows, having reference to their relationship to the Anointed One, has been missed by all the ancient versions except the Syriac, as though its clearness had blinded the translators, since they render &#1489;&#1512;, either &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; purity, chastity, discipline (lxx, Targ., Ital., Vulg.), or &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; pure, unmixed (Aq., Symm., Jer.: adorate pure). Thus also Hupfeld renders it "yield sincerely," whereas it is rendered by Ewald "receive wholesome warning," and by Hitzig "submit to duty" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; like the Arabic birr  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;); Olshausen even thinks, there may be some mistake in &#1489;&#1512;, and Diestel decides for &#1489;&#1493; instead of &#1489;&#1512;. But the context and the usage of the language require osculamini filium. The Piel &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1511; means to kiss, and never anything else; and while &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; in Hebrew means purity and nothing more, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; as an adverb, pure, cannot be supported, nothing is more natural here, after Jahve has acknowledged His Anointed One as His Son, than that &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (<a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/31-2.htm">Proverbs 31:2</a>, even &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;) - which has nothing strange about it when found in solemn discourse, and here helps one over the dissonance of &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; - should, in a like absolute manner to &#1495;&#1511;, denote the unique son, and in fact the Son of God.<p>(Note: Apart from the fact of &#1489;&#1512; not having the article, its indefiniteness comes under the point of view of that which, because it combines with it the idea of the majestic, great, and terrible, is called by the Arabian grammarians Arab. 'l-tnk&#305;&#770;r lt'd&#305;&#770;m or ltkt&#305;&#770;r or lthw&#305;&#770;l; by the boundlessness which lies in it it challenges the imagination to magnify the notion which it thus expresses. An Arabic expositor would here (as in <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a> above) render it "Kiss a son and such a son!" (vid., Ibn Hisha&#770;m in De Sacy's Anthol. Grammat. p. 85, where it is to be translated hic est vir, qualis vir!). Examples which support this doctrine are &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; <a href="/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a> by a hand, viz., God's almighty hand which is the hand of hands, and <a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a> &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489; before a sword, viz., the divine sword which brooks no opposing weapon.)<p>The exhortation to submit to Jahve is followed, as Aben-Ezra has observed, by the exhortation to do homage to Jahve's Son. To kiss is equivalent to to do homage. Samuel kisses Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), saying that thereby he does homage to him.<p>(Note: On this vid., Scacchi Myrothecium, to. iii.((1637) c. 35.)<p>The subject to what follows is now, however, not the Son, but Jahve. It is certainly at least quite as natural to the New Testament consciousness to refer "lest He be angry" to the Son (vid., <a href="/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a>.), and since the warning against putting trust (&#1495;&#1505;&#1493;&#1514;) in princes, <a href="/psalms/118-9.htm">Psalm 118:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>, cannot be applied to the Christ of God, the reference of &#1489;&#1493; to Him (Hengst.) cannot be regarded as impossible. But since &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468; is the usual word for taking confiding refuge in Jahve, and the future day of wrath is always referred to in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>) as the day of the wrath of God, we refer the ne irascatur to Him whose son the Anointed One is; therefore it is to be rendered: lest Jahve be angry and ye perish &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;. This &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; is the accus. of more exact definition. If the way of any one perish. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>, he himself is lost with regard to the way, since this leads him into the abyss. It is questionable whether &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; means "for a little" in the sense of brevi or facile. The usus loquendi and position of the words favour the latter (Hupf.). Everywhere else &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; means by itself (without such additions as in <a href="/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-47.htm">Ezekiel 16:47</a>) "for a little, nearly, easily." At least this meaning is secured to it when it occurs after hypothetical antecedent clauses as in <a href="/psalms/81-15.htm">Psalm 81:15</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a>; <a href="/job/32-22.htm">Job 32:22</a>. Therefore it is to be rendered: for His wrath might kindle easily, or might kindle suddenly. The poet warns the rulers in their own highest interest not to challenge the wrathful zeal of Jahve for His Christ, which according to <a href="/psalms/2-5.htm">Psalm 2:5</a> is inevitable. Well is it with all those who have nothing to fear from this outburst of wrath, because they hide themselves in Jahve as their refuge. The construct state &#1495;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497; connects &#1489;&#1493;, without a genitive relation, with itself as forming together one notion, Ges. 116, 1. &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; the usual word for fleeing confidingly to Jahve, means according to its radical notion not so much refugere, confugere, as se abdere, condere, and is therefore never combined with &#1488;&#1500;, but always with &#1489;&#1468;.<p>(Note: On old names of towns, which show this ancient &#1495;&#1505;&#1492;. Wetzstein's remark on <a href="/job/24-8.htm">Job 24:8</a> [Comm. on Job, en loc.]. The Arabic still has hsy in the reference of the primary meaning to water which, sucked in and hidden, flows under the sand and only comes to sight on digging. The rocky bottom on which it collects beneath the surface of the sand and by which it is prevented from oozing away or drying up is called Arab. hasa&#770; or hisa&#770; a hiding-place or place of protection, and a fountain dug there is called Arab. &#8219;yn 'l-hy.) </body></html>
