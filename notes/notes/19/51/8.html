The blood of Christ is called the blood of sprinkling, Heb 12:24. If this blood of Christ, which cleanses from all sin, cleanse us from our sin, then we shall be clean indeed, Heb 10:2. He asks not to be comforted, till he is first cleansed; if sin, the bitter root of sorrow, be taken away, he can pray in faith, Let me have a well-grounded peace, of thy creating, so that the bones broken by convictions may rejoice, may be comforted. Hide thy face from my sins; blot out all mine iniquities out of thy book; blot them out, as a cloud is blotted out and dispelled by the beams of the sun. And the believer desires renewal to holiness as much as the joy of salvation. David now saw, more than ever, what an unclean heart he had, and sadly laments it; but he sees it is not in his own power to amend it, and therefore begs God would create in him a clean heart. When the sinner feels this change is necessary, and reads the promise of God to that purpose, he begins to ask it. He knew he had by his sin grieved the Holy Spirit, and provoked him to withdraw. This he dreads more than anything. He prays that Divine comforts may be restored to him. When we give ourselves cause to doubt our interest in salvation, how can we expect the joy of it? This had made him weak; he prays, I am ready to fall, either into sin or into despair, therefore uphold me with thy Spirit. Thy Spirit is a free Spirit, a free Agent himself, working freely. And the more cheerful we are in our duty, the more constant we shall be to it. What is this but the liberty wherewith Christ makes his people free, which is contrasted with the yoke of bondage? Ga 5:1. It is the Spirit of adoption spoken to the heart. Those to whom God is the God of salvation, he will deliver from guilt; for the salvation he is the God of, is salvation from sin. We may therefore plead with him, Lord, thou art the God of my salvation, therefore deliver me from the dominion of sin. And when the lips are opened, what should they speak but the praises of God for his forgiving mercy?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Make me to hear joy and gladness - That is, the voice of forgiveness, causing joy and rejoicing. What he wished to hear was the kind voice of God in pronouncing his pardon; not the voice of anger and condemnation. God now condemned him. The law condemned him. His own conscience condemned him. The result was anguish and sorrow. The burden was great and overpowering - such as to crush him; to break all his "bones." He longed to hear the sweet voice of forgiveness, by which he might have peace, and by which his soul might be made to rejoice.

Which he had not heard for some time; sin had sadly broke in upon and interrupted his spiritual peace and joy; for though the love and favour of God cannot be lost, yet his sensible presence, which puts joy and gladness into the heart, may; and though an interest in Christ ever continues, and union to him is always the same; yet a view of interest in him, which fills with joy unspeakable and full of glory, and communion with him, may not be had for a time: and though justification by his righteousness, from whence flows much peace, is an invariable blessing; yet the comfortable perception of it may be taken away: and though salvation by Christ is a certain thing, yet the joy of it may be lost for a season; which was now the case of the psalmist: and when he desires that God would cause him to hear joy and gladness, his meaning is, that he might have that made known unto him; namely, the forgiveness of his sins, which would give him joy: not by an articulate voice from heaven, which he did not expect; nor by an angel from thence, which was not usual; but by the prophet, who as yet might not have declared to him that God had put away his sin; or, if he had, he might desire to have it repeated, for his fuller assurance, and greater joy; or by his Spirit, in an impulse on his mind, saying to him, thy sins are forgiven thee; which would give him great joy, fulness of it, even what is inconceivable and inexpressible, signified by these two words, "joy" and "gladness"; <p>that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice: a backsliding believer is not only like a bone out of joint, <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; but his falls are sometimes both to the bruising of him, and to the breaking of his bones; of which when he is sensible, the quick sense of his sin is as the pain of a broken bone; see <a href="/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3</a>; and here the breaking of them is ascribed to God; not that he is the cause or occasion of falling into sin, which breaks the bones, <a href="/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>; but of afflictions, corrections, and chastisements for sin, which are sometimes expressed by this phrase, <a href="/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>; and which David was threatened with, and gave him great uneasiness; and of the menaces and threatenings of the law, which being let into his conscience, worked wrath and terror there; and also of that true contrition of heart, and brokenness of spirit, which the Lord produces, and can only cure, by the discoveries of pardoning grace; which affects the whole frame of nature, the report of which makes the bones fat, and all of them to say, who is a God like unto thee? <a href="/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/51.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Make me to hear <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> joy and gladness; <i>that</i> the <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> bones <i>which</i> thou hast broken may rejoice.</span><p>(g) He means God's comfortable mercies toward repentant sinners.<p>(h) By the bones he understands all strength of soul and body, which by cares and mourning are consumed.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make me to hear joy and gladness</span> (comp. below, ver. 12). On forgiveness follows naturally the sense of it, and this sense is in itself a deep satisfaction. But the psalmist seems to ask for something more.

Concerning the interchangeable names for sin, vid., on <a href="/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>. Although the primary occasion of the Psalm is the sin of adultery, still David says &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;, not merely because many other sins were developed out of it, as his guilt of blood in the case of Uriah, the scandal put into the mouths of the enemies of Jahve, and his self-delusion, which lasted almost a whole year; but also because each solitary sin, the more it is perceived in its fundamental character and, as it were, microscopically discerned, all the more does it appear as a manifold and entangled skein of sins, and stands forth in a still more intimate and terrible relation, as of cause and effect, to the whole corrupt and degenerated condition in which the sinner finds himself. In &#1502;&#1495;&#1492; sins are conceived of as a cumulative debt (according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-22.htm">Isaiah 44:22</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>, like a thick, dark cloud) written down (<a href="/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a>) against the time of the payment by punishment.

In &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;, the usual word for a declarative and de facto making clean, sin is conceived of as a leprosy, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/13-6.htm">Leviticus 13:6</a>, <a href="/leviticus/13-34.htm">Leviticus 13:34</a>. the Ker&#1502; runs &#1492;&#1512;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1504;&#1497; (imperat.
