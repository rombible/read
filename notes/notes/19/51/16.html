But as they cannot make satisfaction for sin, so God cannot take any satisfaction in them, otherwise than as expressing love and duty to him. The good work wrought in every true penitent, is a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, and sorrow for sin. It is a heart that is tender, and pliable to God's word. Oh that there were such a heart in every one of us! God is graciously pleased to accept this; it is instead of all burnt-offering and sacrifice. The broken heart is acceptable to God only through Jesus Christ; there is no true repentance without faith in him. Men despise that which is broken, but God will not. He will not overlook it, he will not refuse or reject it; though it makes God no satisfaction for the wrong done to him by sin. Those who have been in spiritual troubles, know how to pity and pray for others afflicted in like manner. David was afraid lest his sin should bring judgements upon the city and kingdom. No personal fears or troubles of conscience can make the soul, which has received grace, careless about the interests of the church of God. And let this be the continued joy of all the redeemed, that they have redemption through the blood of Christ, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thou desirest not sacrifice ... - On the words rendered in this verse "sacrifice" and "burnt-offering," see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>. On the main sentiment here expressed - that God did not "desire" such sacrifices - see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6-8</a>. The idea here is, that any mere external offering, however precious or costly it might be, was not what God required in such cases. He demanded the expression of deep and sincere repentance; the sacrifices of a contrite heart and of a broken spirit: <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>. No offering without this could be acceptable; nothing without this could secure pardon. In mere outward sacrifices - in bloody offerings themselves, unaccompanied with the expression of genuine penitence, God could have no pleasure. This is one of the numerous passages in the Old Testament which show that the external offerings of the law were valueless unless accompanied by the religion of the heart; or that the Jewish religion, much as it abounded in forms, yet required the offerings of pure hearts in order that man might be acceptable to God. Under all dispensations the real nature of religion is the same. Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9-10</a>. The phrase "else would I give it," in the margin, "that I should give it," expresses a willingness to make such an offering, if it was required, while, at the same time, there is the implied statement that it would be valueless without the heart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

But there were none. As Hammond observes, "The Mosaical Law allows no reconciliation, no sacrifice, for such sins." <span class="cmt_word">Thou delightest not in burnt offering.</span> In the mere act of sacrifice - the untimely slaying of his own creatures - God could at no time have had any pleasure. His satisfaction could only arise from the spirit in which sacrifices were offered - the gratitude, devotion, self-renunciation, obedience, of those who approached him with them (comp. <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-8.htm">Psalm 50:8-13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/51.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the second part, the prayer for justification is followed by the prayer for renewing. A clean heart that is not beclouded by sin and a consciousness of sin (for &#1500;&#1489; includes the conscience, Psychology, S. 134; tr. p. 160); a stedfast spirit (&#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, cf. <a href="/psalms/78-37.htm">Psalm 78:37</a>; <a href="/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7</a>) is a spirit certain respecting his state of favour and well-grounded in it. David's prayer has reference to the very same thing that is promised by the prophets as a future work of salvation wrought by God the Redeemer on His people (<a href="/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>); it has reference to those spiritual facts of experience which, it is true, could be experienced even under the Old Testament relatively and anticipatively, but to the actual realization of which the New Testament history, fulfilling ancient prophecy has first of all produced effectual and comprehensive grounds and motives, viz., &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; (&#1500;&#1489;  equals  &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;), &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). David, without distinguishing between them, thinks of himself as king, as Israelite, and as man. Consequently we are not at liberty to say that &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; (as in <a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>), &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  equals  &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, is here the Spirit of grace in distinction from the Spirit of office. If Jahve should reject David as He rejected Saul, this would be the extreme manifestation of anger (<a href="/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>) towards him as king and as a man at the same time. The Holy Spirit is none other than that which came upon him by means of the anointing, <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>. This Spirit, by sin, he has grieved and forfeited. Hence he prays God to show favour rather than execute His right, and not to take this His Holy Spirit from him. </body></html>
