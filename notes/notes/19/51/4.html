An individual would have felt his guilt against the nation or other individuals, as well as against Jehovah. The fact that St. Paul quotes (from the LXX.) part of the verse in <a href="/romans/3-4.htm" title="God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.">Romans 3:4</a> (see Note, <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary</span>) has naturally opened up an avenue for discussion on the bearing of the words on the doctrines of free-will and predestination. But the immediate object of his quotation appears to be to contrast the <span class= "ital">faithfulness </span>of the God of the covenant with the <span class= "ital">falsehood </span>of the covenant people (“Let God be true, and every man a liar”).

The clause seems to imply not only a sense of <span class= "bld">a </span>breach of the covenant, but some manifest judgment from Jehovah in consequence; and, as usual, it is of its effect on the heathen that the psalmist thinks.

Whither should backsliding children return, but to the Lord their God, who alone can heal them? he drew up, by Divine teaching, an account of the workings of his heart toward God. Those that truly repent of their sins, will not be ashamed to own their repentance. Also, he instructs others what to do, and what to say. David had not only done much, but suffered much in the cause of God; yet he flees to God's infinite mercy, and depends upon that alone for pardon and peace. He begs the pardon of sin. The blood of Christ, sprinkled upon the conscience, blots out the transgression, and, having reconciled us to God, reconciles us to ourselves. The believer longs to have the whole debt of his sins blotted out, and every stain cleansed; he would be thoroughly washed from all his sins; but the hypocrite always has some secret reserve, and would have some favorite lust spared. David had such a deep sense of his sin, that he was continually thinking of it, with sorrow and shame. His sin was committed against God, whose truth we deny by wilful sin; with him we deal deceitfully. And the truly penitent will ever trace back the streams of actual sin to the fountain of original depravity. He confesses his original corruption. This is that foolishness which is bound in the heart of a child, that proneness to evil, and that backwardness to good, which is the burden of the regenerate, and the ruin of the unregenerate. He is encouraged, in his repentance, to hope that God would graciously accept him. Thou desirest truth in the inward part; to this God looks, in a returning sinner. Where there is truth, God will give wisdom. Those who sincerely endeavour to do their duty shall be taught their duty; but they will expect good only from Divine grace overcoming their corrupt nature.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Against thee, thee only, have I sinned - That is, the sin, considered as an offence against God, now appeared to him so enormous and so aggravated, that, for the moment, he lost sight of it considered in any other of its bearings. It "was" a sin, as all other sins are, primarily and mainly against God; it derived its chief enormity from that fact. We are not to suppose that David did not believe and notice that he had done wrong to people, or that he had offended against human laws, and against the well-being of society. His crime against Uriah and his family was of the deepest and most aggravated character, but still the offence derived its chief heinousness from the fact that it was a violation of the law of God. The state of mind here illustrated is that which occurs in every case of true penitence. It is not merely because that which has been done is a violation of human law; it is not that it brings us to poverty or disgrace; it is not that it exposes us to punishment on earth from a parent, a teacher, or civil ruler; it is not that it exposes us to punishment in the world to come: it is that it is of itself, and apart from all other relations and consequences, "an offence against God;" a violation of his pure and holy law; a wrong done against him, and in his sight. Unless there is this feeling there can be no true penitence; and unless there is this feeling there can be no hope of pardon, for God forgives offences only as committed against himself; not as involving us in dangerous consequences, or as committed against our fellow-men.<p>And done this evil in thy sight - Or, When thine eye was fixed on me. Compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>. God saw what he had done; and David knew, or might have known, that the eye of God was upon him in his wickedness. It was to him then a great aggravation of his sin that he had "dared" to commit it when he "knew" that God saw everything. The presence of a child - or even of an idiot - would restrain people from many acts of sin which they would venture to commit if alone; how much more should the fact that God is always present, and always sees all that is done, restrain us from open and from secret transgression.<p>That thou mightest be justified when thou speakest - That thy character might be vindicated in all that thou hast said; in the law which thou hast revealed; in the condemnation of the sin in that law; and in the punishment which thou mayest appoint. That is, he acknowledged his guilt. He did not seek to apologise for it, or to vindicate it. God was right, and he was wrong. The sin deserved all that God in his law "had" declared it to deserve; it deserved all that God by any sentence which he might pass upon him "would" declare it to deserve. The sin was so aggravated that "any" sentence which God might pronounce would not be beyond the measure of its ill-desert.<p>And be clear when thou judgest - Be regarded as right, holy, pure, in the judgment which thou mayest appoint.

All sin, though committed against a fellow creature, being a transgression of the law, is against the lawgiver; and, indeed, begins at the neglect or contempt of his commandment, as David's sin did, <a href="/2_samuel/12-9.htm">2 Samuel 12:9</a>; and being committed against God, that had bestowed so many favours upon him, was a cutting consideration to him, which made his sorrow appear to be of a godly sort; wherefore he makes his humble and hearty confession to the Lord, and who only could forgive his sin; <p>and done this evil in thy sight; for with respect to men it was secretly done; and was only known to God, with whom the darkness and the light are both alike; <p>that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest; not that David committed this sin that God might be just, and pure, and holy; but this was the event and consequence of it: God, by taking notice of it, resenting it, and reproving for it, appeared to be a righteous Being, and of purer eyes than to behold sin with pleasure; see <a href="/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>. Or these words may be connected with his acknowledgment and confession of sin; which were done to this end and purpose, to justify God in his charge of it upon him, and in threatening him with evils on account of it, by the mouth of Nathan the prophet: or with his petitions for pardoning grace and mercy; that so he might appear to be just to his promise, of forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin, to humble penitents; and particularly that he might appear to be just and faithful to his Son, in forgiving sin for his sake; whom he had set forth, in his purposes and promises, to be the propitiation for sin, to declare his righteousness, <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; see <a href="/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/51.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done <i>this</i> evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> speakest, <i>and</i> be clear when thou judgest.</span><p>(e) When you give sentence against sinners, they must confess you to be just, and themselves sinners.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/51.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. David’s confession to Nathan was couched in the simple words (two only in the Heb.), “I have sinned against Jehovah.” The additional words “thee only” have been taken as a proof that the Psalm cannot have been written by David. But they need not, as we have seen already, be pressed with such extreme logical precision as to exclude sin against man. All sin, even that by which man is most grievously injured, is, in its ultimate nature, sin against God, as a breach of His holy law; just as man’s duty to his fellow-man is based upon his duty to God and is regarded as part of it. Moreover the king, as Jehovah’s representative, was in an especial and peculiar way responsible to Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and done</span> this <span class="ital">evil</span>] Better as R.V., and done that which is evil in thy sight. Cp. <a href="/2_samuel/11-27.htm" title="And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.">2 Samuel 11:27</a>, “the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of Jehovah”: and <a href="/2_samuel/12-9.htm" title="Why have you despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? you have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.">2 Samuel 12:9</a>, “Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that thou mightest</span> &c.] Better, that thou mayest be justified when thou givest sentence: i.e., that Thy righteousness and holiness may be declared and vindicated when Thou dost pronounce sentence on my sin. <span class="ital">When thou speakest</span> is shewn by the parallelism to mean, ‘when Thou dost pronounce sentence.’ <span class="ital">Be justified</span> corresponds to the cardinal divine attribute of righteousness: <span class="ital">be clear</span> to that of holiness. Cp. <a href="/isaiah/5-16.htm" title="But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.">Isaiah 5:16</a>, “God the Holy One proves Himself holy in righteousness.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But this is a hard saying. Can it be meant that the vindication of God’s holiness is the object of man’s sin? (1) Grammar forbids us to relieve the difficulty by rendering <span class="ital">so that thou art justified</span> (consequence) instead of <span class="ital">in order that thou mayest be justified</span> (purpose). (2) We might regard <span class="ital">that</span> as depending upon <span class="ital"><a href="/context/psalms/51-3.htm" title="For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me....">Psalm 51:3-4</a></span> <span class="ital">a</span> taken together, and introducing the object of the Psalmist’s confession. ‘I confess my sin, that thou mayest be justified in pronouncing sentence upon me.’The sinner’s confession and self-condemnation is a justification of God’s sentence upon sin, just as, conversely, the sinner’s self-justification is a challenge and impugnment of God’s justice (<a href="/joshua/7-19.htm" title="And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="/job/40-8.htm" title="Will you also cancel my judgment? will you condemn me, that you may be righteous?">Job 40:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-10.htm" title="If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.">1 John 1:10</a>). (3) Probably however we are meant to understand that man’s sin brings out into a clearer light the justice and holiness of God, Who pronounces sentence upon it. The Psalmist flings himself at the footstool of the Divine Justice. The consequence of his sin, and therefore in a sense its purpose (for nothing is independent of the sovereign Will of God), is to enhance before men the justice and holiness of God, the absolutely Righteous and Pure. “The Biblical writers … drew no sharp accurate line between events as the consequence of the Divine order, and events as following from the Divine purpose. To them all was ordained and designed of God. Even sin itself in all its manifestations, though the whole guilt of it rested with man, did not flow uncontrolled, but only in channels hewn for it by God, and to subserve His purposes.… We must not expect that the Hebrew mind … altogether averse from philosophical speculation, should have exactly defined for itself the distinction between an action viewed as the <span class="ital">consequence</span>, and the same action viewed as the <span class="ital">end</span>, of another action. The mind which holds the simple fundamental truth that all is of God, may also hold, almost as a matter of course, that all is <span class="ital">designed</span> of God” (Bishop Perowne). In this connexion passages such as <a href="/2_samuel/24-1.htm" title="And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.">2 Samuel 24:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm" title="Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.">Isaiah 6:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-17.htm" title="O LORD, why have you made us to err from your ways, and hardened our heart from your fear?

But the O.T. firmly maintains the truth of man’s responsibility: and St Paul, in applying the words of this verse to the course of Israel’s history (<a href="/romans/3-4.htm" title="God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.">Romans 3:4</a>) rebuts as the suggestion of an unhealthy conscience the notion that God is responsible for sin which He overrules to His glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The quotation in <a href="/romans/3-4.htm" title="God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.">Romans 3:4</a> is from the LXX, in which the Heb. word for <span class="ital">be clear</span> is taken in its Aramaic sense, <span class="ital">be victorious, prevail</span>, and the last word (<span class="ital">when thou judgest</span>) is ambiguously rendered. The Greek word may be passive, <span class="ital">when thou art judged</span> (as P.B.V., derived from LXX through the Vulg., and A.V. in Rom.), i.e. when Thy justice is challenged: but more probably it is middle, ‘when Thou comest into judgement.’ So R.V. in Rom.

It is not those who are addressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>, as Hengstenberg thinks, who are here addressed. Even the position of the words &#1493;&#1500;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; clearly shows that the divine discourse is now turned to another class, viz., to the evil-doers, who, in connection with open and manifest sins and vices, take the word of God upon their lips, a distinct class from those who base their sanctity upon outward works of piety, who outwardly fulfil the commands of God, but satisfy and deceive themselves with this outward observance. &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;, what hast thou, that thou  equals  it belongs not to thee, it does not behove thee. With &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-17.htm">Psalm 50:17</a>, an adversative subordinate clause beings: since thou dost not care to know anything of the moral ennobling which it is the design of the Law to give, and my words, instead of having them as a constant test-line before thine eyes, thou castest behind thee and so turnest thy back upon them (cf. <a href="/isaiah/38-17.htm">Isaiah 38:17</a>). &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509; is not from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (lxx, Targum, and Saadia), in which case it would have to be pointed &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509;, but from &#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, and is construed here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-9.htm">Job 34:9</a>, with &#1506;&#1501;: to have pleasure in intercourse with any one. In <a href="/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a> the transgression of the eighth commandment is condemned, in <a href="/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a> that of the seventh, in <a href="/psalms/50-19.htm">Psalm 50:19</a>. that of the ninth (concerning the truthfulness of testimony). &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, to give up one's mouth unrestrainedly to evil, i.e., so that evil issues from it. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-20.htm">Psalm 50:20</a>, has reference to gossiping company (cf. <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; signifies a thrust, a push (cf. &#1492;&#1491;&#1507;), after which the lxx renders it &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (cf. <a href="/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a>), but it also signifies vexation and mockery (cf. &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1507;); it is therefore to be rendered: to bring reproach (Jerome, opprobrium) upon any one, to cover him with dishonour. The preposition &#1489;&#1468; with &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; has, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1</a>, and frequently, a hostile signification. "Thy mother's son" is he who is born of the same mother with thyself, and not merely of the same father, consequently thy brother after the flesh in the fullest sense. What Jahve says in this passage is exactly the same as that which the apostle of Jesus Christ says in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-24</a>. This contradiction between the knowledge and the life of men God must, for His holiness' sake, unmask and punish, <a href="/psalms/50-20.htm">Psalm 50:20</a>. The sinner thinks otherwise: God is like himself, i.e., that is also not accounted by God as sin, which he allows himself to do under the cloak of his dead knowledge. For just as a man is in himself, such is his conception also of his God (vid., <a href="/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>.). But God will not encourage this foolish idea: "I will therefore reprove thee and set (it) in order before thine eyes" (&#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, not &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, in order to give expression, the second time at least, to the mood, the form of which has been obliterated by the suffix); He will set before the eyes of the sinner, who practically and also in theory denies the divine holiness, the real state of his heart and life, so that he shall be terrified at it. Instead of &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, the infin. intensit. here, under the influence of the close connection of the clauses (Ew. 240, c), is &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;; the oratio obliqua begins with it, without &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (quod). &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; exactly corresponds to the German deines Gleichen, thine equal. </body></html>
