Observe, reader, sin defiles us, renders us odious in the sight of the holy God, and uneasy to ourselves; it unfits us for communion with God, in grace or glory. But when God pardons sin, he cleanses us from it, so that we become acceptable to him, easy to ourselves, and have liberty of access to him. Nathan had assured David, upon his first profession of repentance, that his sin was pardoned. <span class="ital">The Lord has taken away thy sin, thou shalt not die, </span><a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm" title="And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD.

God had forgiven him, but he could not forgive himself, and therefore he is thus importunate for pardon as one that thought himself unworthy of it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/51.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>51:1-6 David, being convinced of his sin, poured out his soul to God in prayer for mercy and grace. Whither should backsliding children return, but to the Lord their God, who alone can heal them? he drew up, by Divine teaching, an account of the workings of his heart toward God. Those that truly repent of their sins, will not be ashamed to own their repentance. Also, he instructs others what to do, and what to say. David had not only done much, but suffered much in the cause of God; yet he flees to God's infinite mercy, and depends upon that alone for pardon and peace. He begs the pardon of sin. The blood of Christ, sprinkled upon the conscience, blots out the transgression, and, having reconciled us to God, reconciles us to ourselves. The believer longs to have the whole debt of his sins blotted out, and every stain cleansed; he would be thoroughly washed from all his sins; but the hypocrite always has some secret reserve, and would have some favorite lust spared. David had such a deep sense of his sin, that he was continually thinking of it, with sorrow and shame. His sin was committed against God, whose truth we deny by wilful sin; with him we deal deceitfully. And the truly penitent will ever trace back the streams of actual sin to the fountain of original depravity. He confesses his original corruption. This is that foolishness which is bound in the heart of a child, that proneness to evil, and that backwardness to good, which is the burden of the regenerate, and the ruin of the unregenerate. He is encouraged, in his repentance, to hope that God would graciously accept him. Thou desirest truth in the inward part; to this God looks, in a returning sinner. Where there is truth, God will give wisdom. Those who sincerely endeavour to do their duty shall be taught their duty; but they will expect good only from Divine grace overcoming their corrupt nature.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wash me throughly from mine iniquity - literally, "Multiply to wash me." The word rendered "throughly" is a verb, either in the infinitive or imperative mood, and suggests the idea of "multiplying" or "increasing."

The psalmist makes use of three words to express his sin by, in this verse <a href="/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1</a>;  which signifies "rebellion", as all sin has in it rebellion against God the lawgiver, and a contempt of his commandments;  "perverseness", "crookedness", sin being a going out of the plain way of God's righteous law; and  "a missing the mark"; going besides it or not coming up to it: and these he makes rise of to set forth the malignity of sin, and the deep sense he had of the exceeding sinfulness of it; and these are the three words used by the Lord in <a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; when he declares himself to be a sin forgiving God; so that David's sin came within the reach of pardoning mercy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/51.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wash me <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.</span><p>(c) My sins strike so fast in me, that I have need of some singular kind of washing.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wash me throughly from mine iniquity</span>.

It is not those who are addressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>, as Hengstenberg thinks, who are here addressed. Even the position of the words &#1493;&#1500;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; clearly shows that the divine discourse is now turned to another class, viz., to the evil-doers, who, in connection with open and manifest sins and vices, take the word of God upon their lips, a distinct class from those who base their sanctity upon outward works of piety, who outwardly fulfil the commands of God, but satisfy and deceive themselves with this outward observance. &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;, what hast thou, that thou  equals  it belongs not to thee, it does not behove thee. With &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-17.htm">Psalm 50:17</a>, an adversative subordinate clause beings: since thou dost not care to know anything of the moral ennobling which it is the design of the Law to give, and my words, instead of having them as a constant test-line before thine eyes, thou castest behind thee and so turnest thy back upon them (cf. <a href="/isaiah/38-17.htm">Isaiah 38:17</a>). &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509; is not from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (lxx, Targum, and Saadia), in which case it would have to be pointed &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509;, but from &#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, and is construed here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/34-9.htm">Job 34:9</a>, with &#1506;&#1501;: to have pleasure in intercourse with any one. In <a href="/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a> the transgression of the eighth commandment is condemned, in <a href="/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a> that of the seventh, in <a href="/psalms/50-19.htm">Psalm 50:19</a>. that of the ninth (concerning the truthfulness of testimony). &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, to give up one's mouth unrestrainedly to evil, i.e., so that evil issues from it. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-20.htm">Psalm 50:20</a>, has reference to gossiping company (cf. <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; signifies a thrust, a push (cf. &#1492;&#1491;&#1507;), after which the lxx renders it &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (cf. <a href="/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a>), but it also signifies vexation and mockery (cf. &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1507;); it is therefore to be rendered: to bring reproach (Jerome, opprobrium) upon any one, to cover him with dishonour. The preposition &#1489;&#1468; with &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; has, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1</a>, and frequently, a hostile signification. "Thy mother's son" is he who is born of the same mother with thyself, and not merely of the same father, consequently thy brother after the flesh in the fullest sense. What Jahve says in this passage is exactly the same as that which the apostle of Jesus Christ says in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-24</a>. This contradiction between the knowledge and the life of men God must, for His holiness' sake, unmask and punish, <a href="/psalms/50-20.htm">Psalm 50:20</a>. The sinner thinks otherwise: God is like himself, i.e., that is also not accounted by God as sin, which he allows himself to do under the cloak of his dead knowledge. For just as a man is in himself, such is his conception also of his God (vid., <a href="/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>.). But God will not encourage this foolish idea: "I will therefore reprove thee and set (it) in order before thine eyes" (&#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, not &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, in order to give expression, the second time at least, to the mood, the form of which has been obliterated by the suffix); He will set before the eyes of the sinner, who practically and also in theory denies the divine holiness, the real state of his heart and life, so that he shall be terrified at it. Instead of &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, the infin. intensit. here, under the influence of the close connection of the clauses (Ew. 240, c), is &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;; the oratio obliqua begins with it, without &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (quod). &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; exactly corresponds to the German deines Gleichen, thine equal. </body></html>
