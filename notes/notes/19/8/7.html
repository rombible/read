What is man, so mean a creature, that he should be thus honoured! so sinful a creature, that he should be thus favoured! Man has sovereign dominion over the inferior creatures, under God, and is appointed their lord. This refers to Christ. In Heb 2:6-8, the apostle, to prove the sovereign dominion of Christ, shows he is that Man, that Son of man, here spoken of, whom God has made to have dominion over the works of his hands. The greatest favour ever showed to the human race, and the greatest honour ever put upon human nature, were exemplified in the Lord Jesus. With good reason does the psalmist conclude as he began, Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, which has been honoured with the presence of the Redeemer, and is still enlightened by his gospel, and governed by his wisdom and power! What words can reach his praises, who has a right to our obedience as our Redeemer?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All sheep and oxen - Flocks and herds. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>, "over the cattle." Nothing is more manifest than the control which man exercises over flocks and herds - making them subservient to his use, and obedient to his will.<p>And the beasts of the field - Those not included in the general phrase "sheep and oxen." The word rendered "field," &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;  s&#769;a&#770;deh - or the poetic form, as here -      &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;  s&#769;a&#770;day, means properly a plain; a level tract of country; then, a field, or a tilled farm, <a href="/genesis/23-17.htm">Genesis 23:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/47-20.htm">Genesis 47:20-21</a>,; and then the fields, the open country, as opposed to a city, a village, a camp <a href="/genesis/25-27.htm">Genesis 25:27</a>; and hence, in this place the expression means the beasts that roam at large - wild beasts, <a href="/genesis/2-20.htm">Genesis 2:20</a>; <a href="/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>. Here the allusion is to the power which man has of subduing the wild beasts; of capturing them, and making them subservient to his purposes; of preventing their increase and their depredations; and of taming them so that they shall obey his will, and become his servants. Nothing is more remarkable than this, and nothing furnishcs a better illustration of Scripture than the conformity of this with the declaration <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/9-2.htm">Genesis 9:2</a>, "And the fear of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air," etc. Compare the notes at <a href="/james/3-7.htm">James 3:7</a>. It is to be remembered that no small number of what are now domestic animals were originally wild, and that they have been subdued and tamed by the power anti skill of man. No animal has shown himself superior to this power and skill. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-8. God has placed man next in dignity to angels, and but a little lower, and has crowned him with the empire of the world.<p>glory and honour&#8212;are the attributes of royal dignity (Ps 21:5; 45:3). The position assigned man is that described (Ge 1:26-28) as belonging to Adam, in his original condition, the terms employed in detailing the subjects of man's dominion corresponding with those there used. In a modified sense, in his present fallen state, man is still invested with some remains of this original dominion. It is very evident, however, by the apostle's inspired expositions (Heb 2:6-8; 1Co 15:27, 28) that the language here employed finds its fulfilment only in the final exaltation of Christ's human nature. There is no limit to the "all things" mentioned, God only excepted, who "puts all things under." Man, in the person and glorious destiny of Jesus of Nazareth, the second Adam, the head and representative of the race, will not only be restored to his original position, but exalted far beyond it. "The last enemy, death," through fear of which, man, in his present estate, is "all his lifetime in bondage" [Heb 2:15], "shall be destroyed" [1Co 15:26]. Then all things will have been put under his feet, "principalities and powers being made subject to him" [1Pe 3:22]. This view, so far from being alien from the scope of the passage, is more consistent than any other; for man as a race cannot well be conceived to have a higher honor put upon him than to be thus exalted in the person and destiny of Jesus of Nazareth. And at the same time, by no other of His glorious manifestations has God more illustriously declared those attributes which distinguish His name than in the scheme of redemption, of which this economy forms such an important and essential feature. In the generic import of the language, as describing man's present relation to the works of God's hands, it may be regarded as typical, thus allowing not only the usual application, but also this higher sense which the inspired writers of the New Testament have assigned it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All sheep and oxen; </span> here is no perfect enumeration, but under these are comprehended all other beasts, and much more men and angels. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The beasts of the field, </span> i.e. the wild beasts; which together with divers fowls and fishes were subject to Christ, and are governed and employed as it pleaseth him; although many of them be without the reach and are not brought under the, power of any other man. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All sheep and oxen,....

The &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; of God is the impress (cognate Arabic wasm, a sign, Greek &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;) of His nature, which we see in His works of creation and His acts of salvation, a nature which can only be known from this visible and comprehensible representation (nomen  equals  gnomen). <p>(Note: Cf. Oehler's art. Name in Herzog's Real-Encyklopdie.)<p>This name of God is certainly not yet so known and praised everywhere, as the church to which it has been made known by a positive revelation can know and praise it; but, nevertheless, it, viz., the divine name uttered in creation and its works, by which God has made Himself known and capable of being recognised and named, ifs &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; amplum et gloriosum, everywhere through out the earth, even if it were entirely without any echo. The clause with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; must not be rendered: Who, do Thou be pleased to put Thy glory upon the heavens (Gesenius even: quam tuam magnificentiam pone in caelis), for such a use of the imperat. after &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is unheard of; and, moreover, although it is true a thought admissible in its connection with the redemptive history (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-6.htm">Psalm 57:6</a>, 12) is thus obtained, it is here, however, one that runs counter to the fundamental tone, and to the circumstances, of the Psalm. For the primary thought of the Psalm is this, that the God, whose glory the heavens reflect, has also glorified Himself in the earth and in man; and the situation of the poet is this, that he has the moon and stars before his eyes: how then could he wish that heaven to be made glorious whose glory is shining into his eyes! It is just as impracticable to take &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; as a contraction of &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;   <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-41.htm">2 Samuel 22:41</a>,  equals  &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, as Ammonius and others, and last of all Bhl, have done, or with Thenius (Stud. u. Krit. 1860 S. 712f.) to read it so at once. For even if the thought: "which (the earth) gives (announces) Thy glory all over the heavens" is not contrary to the connection, and if &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a>, and &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>, can be compared with this &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;, still the phrase &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500; means nothing but to lay majesty on any one, to clothe him with it, <a href="/numbers/27-20.htm">Numbers 27:20</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-25.htm">1 Chronicles 29:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/21-6.htm">Psalm 21:6</a>; and this is just the thought one looks for, viz., that the name of the God, who has put His glory upon the heavens (<a href="/psalms/148-13.htm">Psalm 148:13</a>) is also glorious here below. We must, therefore, take &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, although it is always the form of the imper. elsewhere, as infin., just as &#1512;&#1491;&#1492; occurs once in <a href="/genesis/46-3.htm">Genesis 46:3</a> as infin. (like the Arab. r&#305;&#774;da a giving to drink, l&#305;&#774;da a bringing forth - forms to which &#1500;&#1491;&#1492; and the like in Hebrew certainly more exactly correspond).<p>&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1498; signifies the setting of Thy glory (prop. &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) just like &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492; the knowledge of Jahve, and Obad. Psa 8:5, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1498;, probably the setting of thy nest, Ges. 133. 1. It may be interpreted: O Thou whose laying of Thy glory is upon the heavens, i.e., Thou who hast chosen this as the place on which Thou hast laid Thy glory (Hengst.). In accordance with this Jerome translates it: qui posuisti gloriam tuam super caelos. Thus also the Syriac version with the Targum: dejabt (&#1491;&#1497;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;) shubhoch 'al shemajo, and Symmachus: &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;. This use of the nomen verbale and the genitival relation of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; to &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1498;, which is taken as one notion, is still remarkable. Hitzig considers that no reasonable man would think and write thus: but thereby at the same time utterly condemns his own conjecture &#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1498; (whose extending of glory over the heavens). This, moreover, goes beyond the limits of the language, which is only acquainted with &#1514;&#1468;&#1503; as the name of an animal. All difficulty would vanish if one might, with Hupfeld, read &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;. But &#1514;&#1504;&#1492; has not the slightest appearance of being a corruption of &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1492;. It might be more readily supposed that &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is an erroneous pointing for &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; (to stretch or extend, cf. <a href="/hosea/8-10.htm">Hosea 8:10</a> to stretch forth, distribute): Thou whose glory stretches over the heavens, - an interpretation which is more probable than that it is, with Paulus and Kurtz, to be read &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;: Thou whose glory is praised (pass. of the &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/11-40.htm">Judges 11:40</a>, which belongs to the dialect of Northern Palestine), instead of which one would more readily expect &#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;.

The lxx translates it the utterance of praise, &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;; and &#1506;&#1494; certainly sometimes has the meaning of power ascribed to God in praise, and so a laudatory acknowledgment of His might; but this is only when connected with verbs of giving, <a href="/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-35.htm">Psalm 68:35</a>; <a href="/psalms/96-7.htm">Psalm 96:7</a>. In itself, when standing alone, it cannot mean this. It is in this passage: might, or victorious power, which God creates for Himself out of the mouths of children that confess Him. This offensive and defensive power, as Luther has observed on this passage, is conceived of as a strong building, &#1506;&#1494; as &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; (<a href="/jeremiah/16-19.htm">Jeremiah 16:19</a>) i.e., a fortress, refuge, bulwark, fortification, for the foundation of which He has taken the mouth, i.e., the stammering of children; and this He has done because of His enemies, to restrain (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; to cause any one to sit or lie down, rest, to put him to silence, e.g., <a href="/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/7-24.htm">Ezekiel 7:24</a>) such as are enraged against Him and His, and are inspired with a thirst for vengeance which expresses itself in curses (the same combination is found in <a href="/psalms/44-17.htm">Psalm 44:17</a>). Those meant, are the fierce and calumniating opponents of revelation. Jahve has placed the mouth of children in opposition to these, as a strong defensive controversive power. He has chosen that which is foolish and weak in the eyes of the world to put to shame the wise and that which is strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). It is by obscure and naturally feeble instruments that He makes His name glorious here below. and overcomes whatsoever is opposed to this glorifying. </body></html>
