At the time of enditing this Psalm, David seems to have had before his eyes the heavens, as they appear by night, and therefore does not notice the sun, but only mentions the moon and stars, which, though not altogether so serviceable to man as the sun, yet are no less demonstrations of the wisdom, power, and goodness of the Creator. <span class="ital">What is man! — </span>How mean and inconsiderable a thing is man if compared with these thy other works, and especially with thy own glorious majesty, whose infinite wisdom and power thus shine forth from the structure of the heavens! when we consider how the glory of God shines in the upper world, we may well wonder he should regard or take any notice of so mean a creature as man; that he who is resident in, and president over, that bright and blessed part of the creation, should so much humble himself as to behold the things done on earth, <a href="/context/psalms/113-5.htm" title="Who is like to the LORD our God, who dwells on high,...">Psalm 113:5-6</a>.

Thus the psalmist, having before his eyes “the awful magnificence of the wide extended firmament, adorned by the moon walking in brightness, and rendered brilliant by the vivid lustre of a multitude of shining orbs, differing from each other in magnitude and splendour;” and turning from the survey of this beauty of the heavens with their glorious show, “to take a view of the creature man, is still more affected by the mercy than he had before been by the majesty of the Lord; since far less wonderful it is that God should make such a world as this than that he who made such a world should be mindful of man in his fallen estate, and should visit human nature with his salvation.” — Horne. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:3-9 We are to consider the heavens, that man thus may be directed to set his affections on things above. What is man, so mean a creature, that he should be thus honoured! so sinful a creature, that he should be thus favoured! Man has sovereign dominion over the inferior creatures, under God, and is appointed their lord. This refers to Christ. In Heb 2:6-8, the apostle, to prove the sovereign dominion of Christ, shows he is that Man, that Son of man, here spoken of, whom God has made to have dominion over the works of his hands. The greatest favour ever showed to the human race, and the greatest honour ever put upon human nature, were exemplified in the Lord Jesus. With good reason does the psalmist conclude as he began, Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, which has been honoured with the presence of the Redeemer, and is still enlightened by his gospel, and governed by his wisdom and power! What words can reach his praises, who has a right to our obedience as our Redeemer?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><p><a href="/psalms/8-3.htm">Psalm 8:3</a>When I consider thy heavens - When I contemplate or look upon.

Pride is one of the distinguishing characteristics of puny man, and has been one of the chief causes of all the contentions, wars, devastations, systems of slavery, and ambitious projects which have desolated and demoralized our sinful world. Yet there is no disposition more incongruous to the character and circumstance of man. Perhaps there are no rational beings throughout the universe among whom pride would appear more unseemly or incompatible than in man, considering the situation in which he is placed, He is exposed to numerous degradations and calamities, to the rage of storms and tempests, the devastations of earthquakes and volcanoes, the fury of whirlwinds, and the tempestuous billows of the ocean, to the ravages of the sword, famine, pestilence, and numerous diseases; and at length he must sink into the grave, and his body must become the companion of worms! The most dignified and haughty of the sons of men are liable to these and similar degradations as well as the meanest of the human family. Yet, in such circumstances, man - that puny worm of the dust, whose knowledge is so limited, and whose follies are so numerous and glaring - has the effrontery to strut in all the haughtiness of pride, and to glory in his shame.<p>When other arguments and motives produce little effect on certain minds, no considerations seem likely to have a more powerful tendency to counteract this deplorable propensity in human beings, than those which are borrowed from the objects connected with astronomy. They show us what an insignificant being - what a mere atom, indeed, man appears amidst the immensity of creation! Though he is an object of the paternal care and mercy of the Most High, yet he is but as a grain of sand to the whole earth, when compared to the countless myriads of beings that people the amplitudes of creation. What is the whole of this globe on which we dwell compared with the solar system, which contains a mass of matter ten thousand times greater? What is it in comparison of the hundred millions of suns and worlds which by the telescope have been described throughout the starry regions? What, then, is a kingdom, a province, or a baronial territory, of which we are as proud as if we were the lords of the universe and for which we engage in so much devastation and carnage? What are they, when set in competition with the glories of the sky? Could we take our station on the lofty pinnacles of heaven, and look down on this scarcely distinguishable speck of earth, we should be ready to exclaim with Seneca, "Is it to this little spot that the great designs and vast desires of men are confined? Is it for this there is so much disturbance of nations, so much carnage, and so many ruinous wars? Oh, the folly of deceived men, to imagine great kingdoms in the compass of an atom, to raise armies to decide a point of earth with the sword!" Dr. Chalmers, in his Astronomical Discourses, very truthfully says, "We gave you but a feeble image of our comparative insignificance, when we said that the glories of an extended forest would suffer no more from the fall of a single leaf, than the glories of this extended universe would suffer though the globe we tread upon, 'and all that it inherits, should dissolve.'" <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy heavens; </span> thine by creation, as it follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of thy fingers.</span> i.e. of thy hand, as it is expressed, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/102-25.htm" title="Of old have you laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of your hands.">Psalm 102:25</a></span>; a part being here put for the whole; God’s <span class="ital">hand and finger</span> being indifferently used to note his power, as <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/8-19.htm" title="Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:19</a> <a href="/luke/11-20.htm" title="But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come on you.">Luke 11:20</a></span>, &c.

David, in his shepherd-life, had had abundant opportunity of "considering the heavens," and had evidently scanned them with the eye of a poet and an intense admirer of nature. It is probably in remembrance of the nights when he watched his father's flock, that he makes no mention of the sun, but only of "the moon and the stars." <span class="cmt_word">The work of thy fingers</span>; and therefore "thy heavens."

Man brings forth what he has conceived, he reaps what he has sown. Starting from this primary passage, we find the punishment which sin brings with it frequently represented under these figures of &#1492;&#1491;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1500;&#1491; (&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;, &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;, &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;), &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; and &#1511;&#1510;&#1512;, and first of all in <a href="/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>. The act, guilt, and punishment of sin appear in general as notions that run into one another. David sees in the sin of his enemies their self-destruction. It is singular, that travail is first spoken of, and then only afterwards pregnancy. For &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500; signifies, as in Sol 8:5, &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, not: to conceive (Hitz.). The Arab. h&#803;abila (synonym of h&#803;amala) is not to conceive in distinction from being pregnant, but it is both: to be and to become pregnant. The accentuation indicates the correct relationship of the three members of the sentence. First of all comes the general statement: Behold he shall travail with, i.e., bring forth with writhing as in the pains of labour, &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, evil, as the result which proceeds from his wickedness. Then, by this thought being divided into its two factors (Hupf.) it goes on to say: that is, he shall conceive (concipere) &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, and bear &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;. The former signifies trouble, molestia, just as &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; signifies that which makes &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;; the latter falsehood, viz., self-deception, delusion, vanity, inasmuch as the burden prepared for others, returns as a heavy and oppressive burden upon the sinner himself, as is said in <a href="/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a>; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-4.htm">Isaiah 59:4</a>, where &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; denotes the accursed wages of sin which consist in the unmasking of its nothingness, and in the undeceiving of its self-delusion. He diggeth a pit for himself, is another turn of the same thought, <a href="/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a>. <a href="/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a> mentions the digging, and <a href="/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a> the subsequent falling into the pit; the aorist &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; is, for instance, like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>, <a href="/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/29-10.htm">Psalm 29:10</a>. The attributive &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500; is virtually a genitive to &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, and is rightly taken by Ges. 124, 3, a as present: in the midst of the execution of the work of destruction prepared for others it becomes his own. The trouble, &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, prepared for others returns upon his own head (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, clinging to it, just as &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; signifies descending and resting upon it), and the violence, &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, done to others, being turned back by the Judge who dwells above (<a href="/micah/1-12.htm">Micah 1:12</a>), descends upon his own pate (&#1511;&#1491;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493; with o by q, as e.g., in <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>). Thus is the righteousness of God revealed in wrath upon the oppressor and in mercy upon him who is innocently oppressed. Then will the rescued one, then will David, give thanks unto Jahve, as is due to Him after the revelation of His righteousness, and will sing of the name of Jahve the Most High (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; as an appended name of God is always used without the art., e.g., <a href="/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a>). In the revelation of Himself He has made Himself a name. He has, however, revealed Himself as the almighty Judge and Deliverer, as the God of salvation, who rules over everything that takes place here below. It is this name, which He has made by His acts, that David will then echo back to Him in his song of thanksgiving. </body></html>
