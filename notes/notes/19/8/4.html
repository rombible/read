What is man, so mean a creature, that he should be thus honoured! so sinful a creature, that he should be thus favoured! Man has sovereign dominion over the inferior creatures, under God, and is appointed their lord. This refers to Christ. In Heb 2:6-8, the apostle, to prove the sovereign dominion of Christ, shows he is that Man, that Son of man, here spoken of, whom God has made to have dominion over the works of his hands. The greatest favour ever showed to the human race, and the greatest honour ever put upon human nature, were exemplified in the Lord Jesus. With good reason does the psalmist conclude as he began, Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, which has been honoured with the presence of the Redeemer, and is still enlightened by his gospel, and governed by his wisdom and power! What words can reach his praises, who has a right to our obedience as our Redeemer?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What is man - What claim has one so weak, and frail, and short-lived, to be remembered by time? What is there in man that entitles him to so much notice? Why has God conferred on him so signal honor? Why has he placed him over the works of his hands? Why has he made so many arrangements for his comfort? Why has he done so much to save him? He is so insignificant his life is so much like a vapor, he so soon disappears, he is so sinful and polluted, that the question may well be asked, why such honor has been conferred on him, and why such a dominion over the world has been given him. See these thoughts more fully expanded in the notes at <a href="/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6</a>.<p>That thou art mindful of him - That thou dost remember him; that is, think of him, attend to him - that he does not pass away wholly from thy thoughts. Why should a God who is so vast and glorious, and who has all the starry worlds, so beautiful and grand, to claim his attention - why should he turn his thoughts on man? And especially why should he honor him as he has done by giving him dominion over the works of his hands?<p>And the son of man - Any descendant of man - any one of the race. What was man, as he was originally made, that such exalted honor should have been conferred on him; and what has any one of his descendants become, in virtue of his native faculties or acquired endowments, that he should be thus honored? The design is the same as in the former part of the verse, to express the idea that there was nothing in man, considered in any respect, that entitled him to this exalted honor. Nothing that man has done since the time when the question was asked by the psalmist has contributed to diminish the force of the inquiry.<p>That thou visitest him - As thou dost; that is, with the attention and care which thou dost bestow upon him; not forgetting him; not leaving him; not passing him by. The word used here - &#1508;&#1511;&#1491;  pa&#770;qad - would properly express a visitation for any purpose - for inspection, for mercy; for friendship, for judgment, etc. Here it refers to the attention bestowed by God on man in conferring on him such marks of favor and honor as he had done - such attention that he never seemed to forget him, but was constantly coming to him with some new proof of favor. What God has done for man since the psalmist wrote this, has done nothing to weaken the force of this inquiry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. man&#8212;literally, "frail man," an allusion to his essential infirmity.<p>son of man&#8212;only varies the form of speech.<p>visitest&#8212;in favor (Ps 65:10).

That is, the psalmist, while he was considering the greatness and glory of the celestial bodies, thought this within himself, and so expressed it; which is to be understood, not of man in general, nor of Adam in a state of innocence; he could not be called "Enosh", the word here used, which signifies a frail, weak, sickly mortal man; nor could he with any propriety be said to be the son of man, as in the following clause: nor of fallen man, or of Adam's posterity, descending from him by ordinary generation; for all things are not put in subjection to them, as is hereafter said of man: but this is to be understood of the man Christ Jesus, as it is interpreted in <a href="/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6</a>; or of that individual of human nature which Christ assumed. The name of Enosh well agrees with him, who was a man of no note and esteem among men, a worm and no man, a man of sorrows and acquainted with griefs, encompassed with infirmities, and was subject to death, and did die. Now it was a marvellous thing that God should be mindful of that individual of human nature; that he should prepare it in his council and covenant; that among the vast numbers of individuals which it came up in his infinite mind to create, he should choose this, to exalt it, and appoint it to union with his own Son, and take that delight in it he did; that when it was formed by his Spirit, he should anoint it with the oil of gladness above his fellows; that he should take such providential care of it, and so often and so strongly express his affection for it; that he should regard it, and support it under sufferings; and when in the grave, did not leave it, nor suffer it to see corruption; but raised it from the dead, and gave it glory, and exalted it at his own right hand; <p>and the son of man, that thou visitest him? The name of "the son of man" is the name of the Messiah, in <a href="/psalms/80-17.htm">Psalm 80:17</a>; and is often given to Christ, and used by him of himself in the New Testament. And this visiting of him is not to be understood in a way of wrath, though he was so visited by God, when he bore the chastisements of his people; but in a way of favour, by bestowing upon him without measure the gifts and graces of his Spirit; by affording him his gracious presence, and tilling him with spiritual peace and joy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">What is <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</span><p>(b) It was sufficient for him to have set forth his glory by the heavens, though he had not come so low as to man who is but dust.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>.

He is not, like Job, impatient of God's constant observation (<a href="/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17-20</a>), but simply filled with wonder at his marvellous condescension (comp. <a href="/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3</a>). And the son of man, that thou visitest him? The "son of man" here is a mere variant for "man" in the preceding hemistich. The clause merely emphasizes the general idea. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 7:15-18) This closing strophe foretells to the enemy of God, as if dictated by the judge, what awaits him; and concludes with a prospect of thanksgiving and praise. Man brings forth what he has conceived, he reaps what he has sown. Starting from this primary passage, we find the punishment which sin brings with it frequently represented under these figures of &#1492;&#1491;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1500;&#1491; (&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;, &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;, &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;), &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; and &#1511;&#1510;&#1512;, and first of all in <a href="/job/15-35.htm">Job 15:35</a>. The act, guilt, and punishment of sin appear in general as notions that run into one another. David sees in the sin of his enemies their self-destruction. It is singular, that travail is first spoken of, and then only afterwards pregnancy. For &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500; signifies, as in Sol 8:5, &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, not: to conceive (Hitz.). The Arab. h&#803;abila (synonym of h&#803;amala) is not to conceive in distinction from being pregnant, but it is both: to be and to become pregnant. The accentuation indicates the correct relationship of the three members of the sentence. First of all comes the general statement: Behold he shall travail with, i.e., bring forth with writhing as in the pains of labour, &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, evil, as the result which proceeds from his wickedness. Then, by this thought being divided into its two factors (Hupf.) it goes on to say: that is, he shall conceive (concipere) &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, and bear &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;. The former signifies trouble, molestia, just as &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; signifies that which makes &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;; the latter falsehood, viz., self-deception, delusion, vanity, inasmuch as the burden prepared for others, returns as a heavy and oppressive burden upon the sinner himself, as is said in <a href="/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a>; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-4.htm">Isaiah 59:4</a>, where &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; denotes the accursed wages of sin which consist in the unmasking of its nothingness, and in the undeceiving of its self-delusion. He diggeth a pit for himself, is another turn of the same thought, <a href="/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a>. <a href="/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a> mentions the digging, and <a href="/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a> the subsequent falling into the pit; the aorist &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; is, for instance, like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>, <a href="/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/29-10.htm">Psalm 29:10</a>. The attributive &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500; is virtually a genitive to &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, and is rightly taken by Ges. 124, 3, a as present: in the midst of the execution of the work of destruction prepared for others it becomes his own. The trouble, &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, prepared for others returns upon his own head (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, clinging to it, just as &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; signifies descending and resting upon it), and the violence, &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, done to others, being turned back by the Judge who dwells above (<a href="/micah/1-12.htm">Micah 1:12</a>), descends upon his own pate (&#1511;&#1491;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493; with o by q, as e.g., in <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>). Thus is the righteousness of God revealed in wrath upon the oppressor and in mercy upon him who is innocently oppressed. Then will the rescued one, then will David, give thanks unto Jahve, as is due to Him after the revelation of His righteousness, and will sing of the name of Jahve the Most High (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; as an appended name of God is always used without the art., e.g., <a href="/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a>). In the revelation of Himself He has made Himself a name. He has, however, revealed Himself as the almighty Judge and Deliverer, as the God of salvation, who rules over everything that takes place here below. It is this name, which He has made by His acts, that David will then echo back to Him in his song of thanksgiving. </body></html>
