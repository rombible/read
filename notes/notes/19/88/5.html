Thus greatly may good men be afflicted, and such dismal thoughts may they have about their afflictions, and such dark conclusion may they make about their end, through the power of melancholy and the weakness of faith. He complained most of God's displeasure. Even the children of God's love may sometimes think themselves children of wrath and no outward trouble can be so hard upon them as that. Probably the psalmist described his own case, yet he leads to Christ. Thus are we called to look unto Jesus, wounded and bruised for our iniquities. But the wrath of God poured the greatest bitterness into his cup. This weighed him down into darkness and the deep.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/88.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Free among the dead - Luther renders this, "I lie forgotten among the dead." DeWette renders it, "Pertaining to the dead - (den Todten angehorend) - stricken down, like the slain, I lie in the grave," and explains it as meaning, "I am as good as dead." The word rendered "free" - &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;  chophsh&#305;&#770;y - means properly, according to Gesenius (Lexicon),<p>(1) prostrate, weak, feeble;<p>(2) free, as opposed to a slave or a captive;<p>(3) free from public taxes or burdens.<p>The word is translated "free" in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-5.htm">Exodus 21:5</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-26.htm">Exodus 21:26-27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-13</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/15-18.htm">Deuteronomy 15:18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>; <a href="/job/3-19.htm">Job 3:19</a>; <a href="/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-9.htm">Jeremiah 34:9-11</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/34-14.htm">Jeremiah 34:14</a>; and at liberty in <a href="/jeremiah/34-16.htm">Jeremiah 34:16</a>. It occurs nowhere else except in this verse. In all these places (except in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>, where it refers to a house or family made free, and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>, where it refers to the freedom of the wild ass), it denotes the freedom of one who had been a servant or slave. In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3-19.htm">Job 3:19</a>, it has reference to the grave, and to the fact that the grave delivers a slave or servant from obligation to his master: "And the servant is free from his master." This is the idea, I apprehend, here. It is not, as DeWette supposes, that he was weak and feeble, as the spirits of the departed are represented to be (compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9-11</a>), but that the dead are made free from the burdens, the toils, the calamities, the servitudes of life; that they are like those who are emancipated from bondage (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-1.htm">Job 7:1-2</a>; <a href="/job/14-6.htm">Job 14:6</a>); that death comes to discharge them, or to set them at liberty. So the psalmist applies the expression here to himself, as if he had already reached that point; as if it were so certain that he must die that he could speak of it as if it had occurred; as if he were actually in the condition of the dead. The idea is that he was to all appearance near the grave, and that there was no hope of his recovery. It is not here, however, the idea of release or emancipation which was mainly before his mind, or any idea of consolation as from that, but it is the idea of death - of hopeless disease that must end in death. This he expresses in the usual language; but it is evident that he did not admit any comfort into his mind from the idea of freedom in the grave.<p>Like the slain that lie in the grave - When slain in battle. They are free from the perils and the toils of life; they are emancipated from its cares and dangers. Death is freedom; and it is possible to derive solace from that idea of death, as Job did <a href="/job/3-19.htm">Job 3:19</a>; but the psalmist here, as remarked above, did not so admit that idea into his mind as to be comforted by it.<p>Whom thou rememberest no more - As if they were forgotten by thee; as if they were no longer the object of thy care. They are suffered to lie and waste away, with no care on thy part to restore them to life, or to preserve them from offensiveness and decay. So the great, the beautiful, and the good lie neglected in the grave.<p>And they are cut off from thy hand - Margin, "by." The Hebrew is literally "from thy hand," but still the idea is that it was by the agency of God. They had been cut down, and were forgotten - as if God regarded them no more. So we shall all moulder in the grave - in that deep, dark, cold, silent, repulsive abode, as if even God had forgotten us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/88.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

This contrast, upon the correct apprehension of which depends the understanding of the whole Psalm, is missed when it is said, "whilst in relation to other countries it is always only the whole nation that comes under consideration, Zion is not reckoned up as a nation, but by persons" (Hofmann). With this rendering the &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491; retires into the background; in that case this giving of prominence to the value of the individual exceeds the ancient range of conception, and it is also an inadmissible appraisement that in Zion each individual is as important as a nation as a whole.

Whilst from among foreign peoples more and more are continually acquiring the right of natives in Zion, and thus are entering into a new national alliance, so that a breach of their original national friendships is taking place, He Himself (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/20-9.htm">1 Samuel 20:9</a>), the Most High, will uphold Zion (<a href="/psalms/48-9.htm">Psalm 48:9</a>), so that under His protection and blessing it shall become ever greater and more glorious. <a href="/psalms/87-6.htm">Psalm 87:6</a> tells us what will be the result of such a progressive incorporation in the church of Zion of those who have hitherto been far removed, viz., Jahve will reckon when He writeth down (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489; as in <a href="/joshua/18-8.htm">Joshua 18:8</a>) the nations; or better - since this would more readily be expressed by &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;, and the book of the living (<a href="/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>) is one already existing from time immemorial - He will reckon in the list (&#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489; after the form &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;, <a href="/ezekiel/13-9.htm">Ezekiel 13:9</a>) of the nations, i.e., when He goes over the nations that are written down there and chosen for the coming salvation, "this one was born there;" He will therefore acknowledge them one after another as those born in Zion. The end of all history is that Zion shall become the metropolis of all nations. When the fulness of the Gentiles is thus come in, then shall all and each one as well singing as dancing say (supply &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;): All my fountains are in thee.

One would rather render cholaliym, "flute-players" (lxx &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;); but to pipe or play the flute is &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; (a denominative from &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;),    <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-40.htm">1 Kings 1:40</a>, whereas to dance is &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; (Pilel of &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;); it is therefore  equals  &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, like &#1500;&#1510;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>. But it must not moreover be rendered, "And singers as well as dancers (will say);" for "singers" is &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, not &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, which signifies cantantes, not cantores. Singing as dancing, i.e., making known their festive joy as well by the one as by the other, shall the men of all nations incorporated in Zion say: All my fountains, i.e., fountains of salvation (after <a href="/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>), are in thee (O city of God). It has also been interpreted: my looks (i.e., the object on which my eye is fixed, or the delight of my eyes), or: my thoughts (after the modern Hebrew &#1506;&#1497;&#1468;&#1503; of spiritual meditation); but both are incongruous. The conjecture, too, of Bttcher, and even before him of Schnurrer (Dissertationes, p. 150), &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, all who take up their abode (instead of which Hupfeld conjectures &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, all my near-dwellers, i.e., those who dwell with me under the same roof)<p>(Note: Hupfeld cites Rashi as having thus explained it; but his gloss is to be rendered: my whole inmost part (after the Aramaic  equals  &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;) is with thee, i.e., they salvation.)),<p>is not Hebrew, and deprives us of the thought which corresponds to the aim of the whole, that Jerusalem shall be universally regarded as the place where the water of life springs for the whole of mankind, and shall be universally praised as this place of fountains. </body></html>
