Thus greatly may good men be afflicted, and such dismal thoughts may they have about their afflictions, and such dark conclusion may they make about their end, through the power of melancholy and the weakness of faith. He complained most of God's displeasure. Even the children of God's love may sometimes think themselves children of wrath and no outward trouble can be so hard upon them as that. Probably the psalmist described his own case, yet he leads to Christ. Thus are we called to look unto Jesus, wounded and bruised for our iniquities. But the wrath of God poured the greatest bitterness into his cup.

The words rendered "lowest pit" mean literally the pit under, or beneath. The reference is to the sepulchre, as in <a href="/psalms/88-4.htm">Psalm 88:4</a>.<p>In darkness - The dark grave; the realms of the dead. See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a>.<p>In the deeps - The caverns; the deep places of the earth or the sea. All these expressions are designed to convey the idea that he was near the grave; that there was no hope for him; that he must die. Perhaps also there is connected with this the idea of trouble, of anguish, of sorrow; of that mental darkness of which the grave was an image, and into which he was plunged by the prospect of death. The whole scene was a sad one, and he was overwhelmed with grief, and saw only the prospect of continued sorrow and gloom. Even a good man may be made afraid - may have his mind made sad and sorrowful - by the prospect of dying. See <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38.htm">Isaiah 38</a>. Death is naturally gloomy; and when the light of religion does not shine upon the soul, and its comforts do not fill the heart, it is but natural that the mind should be full of gloom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/88.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

The allusion is to a dark and deep pit, under ground, such as in the eastern countries they used to put their captives and prisoners into in the night, and take them out in the morning; and which custom continues still among the Turks.

To Zion, however, or of Zion (&#1500; of reference to), shall it be said &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;. Zion, the one city, stands in contrast to all the countries, the one city of God in contrast to the kingdoms of the world, and &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in contrast to &#1494;&#1492;. This contrast, upon the correct apprehension of which depends the understanding of the whole Psalm, is missed when it is said, "whilst in relation to other countries it is always only the whole nation that comes under consideration, Zion is not reckoned up as a nation, but by persons" (Hofmann). With this rendering the &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491; retires into the background; in that case this giving of prominence to the value of the individual exceeds the ancient range of conception, and it is also an inadmissible appraisement that in Zion each individual is as important as a nation as a whole. Elsewhere &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-13.htm">Leviticus 17:13</a>, or &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-8.htm">Esther 1:8</a>, signifies each and every one; accordingly here &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (individual and, or after, individual) affirms a progressus in infinitum, where one is ever added to another. Of an immeasurable multitude, and of each individual in this multitude in particular, it is said that he was born in Zion. Now, too, &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; has a significant connection with what precedes. Whilst from among foreign peoples more and more are continually acquiring the right of natives in Zion, and thus are entering into a new national alliance, so that a breach of their original national friendships is taking place, He Himself (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/20-9.htm">1 Samuel 20:9</a>), the Most High, will uphold Zion (<a href="/psalms/48-9.htm">Psalm 48:9</a>), so that under His protection and blessing it shall become ever greater and more glorious. <a href="/psalms/87-6.htm">Psalm 87:6</a> tells us what will be the result of such a progressive incorporation in the church of Zion of those who have hitherto been far removed, viz., Jahve will reckon when He writeth down (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489; as in <a href="/joshua/18-8.htm">Joshua 18:8</a>) the nations; or better - since this would more readily be expressed by &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;, and the book of the living (<a href="/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>) is one already existing from time immemorial - He will reckon in the list (&#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489; after the form &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;, <a href="/ezekiel/13-9.htm">Ezekiel 13:9</a>) of the nations, i.e., when He goes over the nations that are written down there and chosen for the coming salvation, "this one was born there;" He will therefore acknowledge them one after another as those born in Zion. The end of all history is that Zion shall become the metropolis of all nations. When the fulness of the Gentiles is thus come in, then shall all and each one as well singing as dancing say (supply &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;): All my fountains are in thee. Among the old translators the rendering of Aquila is the best: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#903; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, which Jerome follows, et cantores quasi in choris: omnes fontes mei in te. One would rather render cholaliym, "flute-players" (lxx &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;); but to pipe or play the flute is &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; (a denominative from &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;),    <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-40.htm">1 Kings 1:40</a>, whereas to dance is &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; (Pilel of &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;); it is therefore  equals  &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, like &#1500;&#1510;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>. But it must not moreover be rendered, "And singers as well as dancers (will say);" for "singers" is &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, not &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, which signifies cantantes, not cantores. Singing as dancing, i.e., making known their festive joy as well by the one as by the other, shall the men of all nations incorporated in Zion say: All my fountains, i.e., fountains of salvation (after <a href="/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>), are in thee (O city of God). It has also been interpreted: my looks (i.e., the object on which my eye is fixed, or the delight of my eyes), or: my thoughts (after the modern Hebrew &#1506;&#1497;&#1468;&#1503; of spiritual meditation); but both are incongruous. The conjecture, too, of Bttcher, and even before him of Schnurrer (Dissertationes, p. 150), &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, all who take up their abode (instead of which Hupfeld conjectures &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, all my near-dwellers, i.e., those who dwell with me under the same roof)<p>(Note: Hupfeld cites Rashi as having thus explained it; but his gloss is to be rendered: my whole inmost part (after the Aramaic  equals  &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;) is with thee, i.e., they salvation.)),<p>is not Hebrew, and deprives us of the thought which corresponds to the aim of the whole, that Jerusalem shall be universally regarded as the place where the water of life springs for the whole of mankind, and shall be universally praised as this place of fountains. </body></html>
