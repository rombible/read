This prayer is a prediction that Christ would be preserved, through all the hardships and difficulties of his humiliation, to the glories and joys of his exalted state, and is a pattern to Christians to commit the keeping of their souls to God, trusting him to preserve them to his heavenly kingdom. Those are our worst enemies, that are enemies to our souls. They are God's sword, which cannot move without him, and which he will sheathe when he has done his work with it. They are his hand, by which he chastises his people. There is no fleeing from God's hand, but by fleeing to it. It is very comfortable, when we are in fear of the power of man, to see it dependent upon, and in subjection to the power of God. Most men look on the things of this world as the best things; and they look no further, nor show any care to provide for another life. The things of this world are called treasures, they are so accounted; but to the soul, and when compared with eternal blessings, they are trash. The most afflicted Christian need not envy the most prosperous men of the world, who have their portion in this life. Clothed with Christ's righteousness, having through his grace a good heart and a good life, may we by faith behold God's face, and set him always before us. When we awake every morning, may we be satisfied with his likeness set before us in his word, and with his likeness stamped upon us by his renewing grace. Happiness in the other world is prepared only for those that are justified and sanctified: they shall be put in possession of it when the soul awakes, at death, out of its slumber in the body, and when the body awakes, at the resurrection, out of its slumber in the grave. There is no satisfaction for a soul but in God, and in his good will towards us, and his good work in us; yet that satisfaction will not be perfect till we come to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They have now compassed us - Myself, and those who are associated with me. It would seem from this that the psalmist was not alone. It is to be observed, however, that there is a difference of reading in the Hebrew text. The Masoretic reading is: "us;" the Hebrew text is "me," though in the other expression the plural is used - "our steps." There is no impropriety in supposing that the psalmist refers to his followers, associates, or friends, meaning that the wrong was done not to him alone, but to others connected with him. The meaning of "compassed" is, that they "surrounded" him on every side. Wherever he went, they were there.<p>In our steps - Wherever we go.<p>They have set their eyes - As those do who are intent on any thing; as the lion does that is seeking its prey <a href="/psalms/17-12.htm">Psalm 17:12</a>. They looked keenly and directly at the object. They did not allow their eyes to wander. They were not indifferent to the object of their pursuit.<p>Bowing down to the earth - That is, as the translators evidently understood this, having their eyes bowed down to the ground, or looking steadily to the ground. The image, according to Dr. Horsley, is borrowed from a hunter taking aim at an animal upon the ground. A more literal translation, however, would be, "They have fixed their eyes to lay me prostrate upon the ground." The Hebrew word - &#1504;&#1496;&#1492;  na&#770;t&#803;a&#770;h - means properly "to stretch out, to extend;" then, "to incline, to bow, to depress;" and hence, the idea of "prostrating;" thus, to make the shoulder bend downward, <a href="/genesis/49-15.htm">Genesis 49:15</a>; to bring down the mind to an object, <a href="/psalms/119-112.htm">Psalm 119:112</a>; to bow the heavens, <a href="/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>. Hence, the idea of prostrating an enemy; and the sense here clearly is, that they had fixed their eyes intently on the psalmist, with a purpose to prostrate him to the ground, or completely to overwhelm him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

The sense is, they could not stir a step but they were at their heels, surrounding them on every side. This was true of David, when he was pursued by Saul, and followed by him to Keilah and the wilderness of Maon, <a href="/1_samuel/23-8.htm">1 Samuel 23:8</a>; according to the "Cetib", or textual writing, it should be rendered, "they have compassed me"; but, according to the "Keri", or marginal reading, and the points, it is as we have translated it, and which is followed by the Targum, and both are right, and design David as a principal person, and those that were with him, who were encompassed by Saul and his men. This also was verified in Christ, when Judas followed him into the garden with a band of men to betray him, and when he was enclosed by wicked men as he went to the cross, and hung upon it, <a href="/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>; and may likewise be accommodated to the case of all the saints, who are troubled on every side, are beset with the corruptions of their hearts, the temptations of Satan, and the reproaches and persecutions of the men of the world, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>; <p>they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; which posture either denotes fraudulence and hypocrisy, showing, by looking only upon the ground, as if they were harmless and inoffensive, and had no ill designs, and took no notice of anything; which, as it was true of David's enemies, so of the Jews and of Judas with respect to Christ, and of false teachers with respect to the church, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20</a>, <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>; or else inhumanity and contempt, not caring to turn their eyes to look upon them in distress, but kept their eyes fixed upon the earth, so Christ was treated by the Jews, <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>; or rather their being intent upon mischief, their diligence and watchfulness to observe all motions, and take every opportunity "to strike", or "cast me down to the earth", as the Arabic and Syriac versions render it; or the sense is, as Kimchi gives it, their eyes are upon our ways, to spread nets for us in the earth to take us. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>.

(So Dr. Kay, the 'Speaker's Commentary,' and the Revised Version.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David refers to the divine testing and illumination of the inward parts, which he has experienced in himself, in support of his sincerity. The preterites in <a href="/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a> express the divine acts that preceded the result &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, viz., the testing He has instituted, which is referred to in &#1510;&#1512;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; and also &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468; as a trying of gold by fire, and in &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; as an investigation (<a href="/job/7-18.htm">Job 7:18</a>). The result of the close scrutiny to which God has subjected him in the night, when the bottom of a man's heart is at once made manifest, whether it be in his thoughts when awake or in the dream and fancies of the sleeper, was and is this, that He does not find, viz., anything whatever to punish in him, anything that is separated as dross from the gold. To the mind of the New Testament believer with his deep, and as it were microscopically penetrating, insight into the depth of sin, such a confession concerning himself would be more difficult than to the mind of an Old Testament saint. For a separation and disunion of flesh and spirit, which was unknown in the same degree to the Old Testament, has been accomplished in the New Testament consciousness by the facts and operations of redemption revealed in the New Testament; although at the same time it must be remembered that in such confessions the Old Testament consciousness does not claim to be clear from sins, but only from a conscious love of sin, and from a self-love that is hostile to God.<p>With &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; David begins his confession of how Jahve found him to be, instead of finding anything punishable in him. This word is either an infinitive like &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="/psalms/77-10.htm">Psalm 77:10</a>) with the regular ultima accentuation, formed after the manner of the &#1492;&#1500; verbs, - in accordance with which Hitzig renders it: my thinking does not overstep my mouth, - or even 1 pers. praet., which is properly Milel, but does also occur as Milra, e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-16.htm">Isaiah 44:16</a> (vid., on <a href="/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>), - according to which Bttcher translates: should I think anything evil, it dare not pass beyond my mouth, - or (since &#1494;&#1502;&#1501; may denote the determination that precedes the act, e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/4-28.htm">Jeremiah 4:28</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-17.htm">Lamentations 2:17</a>): I have determined my mouth shall not transgress. This last rendering is opposed by the fact, that &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; by itself in the ethical signification "to transgress" (cf. post-biblical &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;) is not the usage of the biblical Hebrew, and that when &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; stand close together, &#1508;&#1497; is presumptively the object. We therefore give the preference to Bttcher's explanation, which renders &#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; as a hypothetical perfect and is favoured by <a href="/proverbs/30-32.htm">Proverbs 30:32</a> (which is to be translated: and if thou thinkest evil, (lay) thy hand on thy mouth!). Nevertheless &#1489;&#1500; &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1470;&#1508;&#1497; is not the expression of a fact, but of a purpose, as the combination of &#1489;&#1500; with the future requires it to be taken. The psalmist is able to testify of himself that he so keeps evil thoughts in subjection within him, even when they may arise, that they do not pass beyond his mouth, much less that he should put them into action. But perhaps the psalmist wrote &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498; originally, "my reflecting does not go beyond Thy commandment" (according to <a href="/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-29.htm">Proverbs 8:29</a>), - a meaning better suited, as a result of the search, to the nightly investigation. The &#1500; of &#1500;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; fo &#1500; need not be the &#1500; of reference (as to); it is that of the state or condition, as in <a href="/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-22.htm">Psalm 69:22</a>. &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, as perhaps also in <a href="/job/31-33.htm">Job 31:33</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-7.htm">Hosea 6:7</a> (if &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; is not there the name of the first man), means, men as they are by nature and habit. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; does not admit of being connected with &#1500;&#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;: at the doings of the world contrary to Thy revealed will (Hofmann and others); for &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468; cannot mean: to act contrary to any one, but only: to work upon any one, <a href="/job/35-6.htm">Job 35:6</a>. These words must therefore be regarded as a closer definition, placed first, of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; which follows: in connection with the doings of men, by virtue of the divine commandment, he has taken care of the paths of the oppressor, viz., not to go in them; <a href="/1_samuel/25-21.htm">1 Samuel 25:21</a> is an instance in support of this rendering, where &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/2-6.htm">Job 2:6</a>, means: I have kept (Nabal's possession), not seizing upon it myself. Jerome correctly translates vias latronis; for &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; signifies one who breaks in, i.e., one who does damage intentionally and by violence. The confession concerning himself is still continued in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-5.htm">Psalm 17:5</a>, for the inf. absol. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1498;, if taken as imperative would express a prayer for constancy, that is alien to the circumstances described. The perfect after &#1489;&#1468;&#1500; is also against such a rendering. It must therefore be taken as inf. historicus, and explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a>. The noun following the inf. absol., which is usually the object, is the subject in this instance, as, e.g., in <a href="/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a>, and frequently. It is &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, and not &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512; (a step) never having the &#1513;&#1473; dageshed, except in <a href="/psalms/17-11.htm">Psalm 17:11</a> and <a href="/job/31-7.htm">Job 31:7</a>. </body></html>
