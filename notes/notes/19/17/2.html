Feigned prayers are fruitless; but if our hearts lead our prayers, God will meet them with his favour. The psalmist had been used to pray, so that it was not his distress and danger that now first brought him to his duty. And he was encouraged by his faith to expect God would notice his prayers. Constant resolution and watchfulness against sins of the tongue, will be a good evidence of our integrity. Aware of man's propensity to wicked works, and of his own peculiar temptations, David had made God's word his preservative from the paths of Satan, which lead to destruction. If we carefully avoid the paths of sin, it will be very lead to destruction. If we carefully avoid the paths of sin, it will be very comfortable in the reflection, when we are in trouble. Those that are, through grace, going in God's paths, should pray that their goings may be held up in those paths. David prays, Lord, still hold me up. Those who would proceed and persevere in the ways of God, must, by faith prayer, get daily fresh supplies of grace and strength from him. Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, distinguishing favours, not common mercies, but be gracious to me; do as thou usest to do to those who love thy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let my sentence - Hebrew, "my judgment." The allusion is to a judgment or sentence as coming from God in regard to the matter referred to in the psalm, to wit, the injuries which he had received from his enemies. He felt that they had done him injustice and wrong; he felt assured that a sentence or judgment from God in the case would be in his favor. So Job often felt that if he could bring his case directly before God, God would decide in his favor. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-1.htm">Job 23:1-6</a>.<p>Come forth from thy presence - From before thee. That is, he asks God to pronounce a sentence in his case.<p>Let thine eyes behold - He asked God to examine the case with his own eyes, or attentively to consider it, and to see where justice was.<p>The things that are equal - The things that are just and right. He felt assured that his own cause was right, and he prays here that justice in the case may be done. He felt that, if that were done, he would be delivered from his enemies. As between ourselves and our fellow-men, it is right to pray to God that he would see that exact justice should be done, for we may be able to feel certain that justice is on our side, and that we are injured by them; but as between ourselves and God, we can never offer that prayer, for if justice were done to us we could not but be condemned. Before him our plea must be for mercy, not justice. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. sentence&#8212;acquitting judgment.<p>from thy presence&#8212;Thy tribunal.<p>things that are equal&#8212;just and right, do Thou regard.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My sentence, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">my right</span> or <span class="ital">judgment</span>, i.e. judgment in my cause, or on my behalf. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From thy presence, </span> i.e. from thee, and from thy tribunal, to which I bring my cause.

The lines have fallen to him in a charming district, viz., in the pleasurable fellowship of God, this most blessed domain of love has become his paradisaic possession. With &#1488;&#1507; he rises from the fact to the perfect contentment which it secures to him: such a heritage seems to him to be fair, he finds a source of inward pleasure and satisfaction in it. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; - according to Ew. 173, d, lengthened from the construct form &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1514; (like &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514; <a href="/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a>); according to Hupfeld, springing from &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; (by the same apocope that is so common in Syriac, perhaps like &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; <a href="/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1</a> from &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;) just like &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> - is rather, since in the former view there is no law for the change of vowel and such an application of the form as we find in <a href="/psalms/60-13.htm">Psalm 60:13</a> (<a href="/psalms/108-13.htm">Psalm 108:13</a>) is opposed to the latter, a stunted form of &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492;: the heritage  equals  such a heritage pleases me, lit., seems fair to me (&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;, cognate root &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, &#1510;&#1508;&#1512;, cognate in meaning &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, Arab. bs&#774;r, to rub, polish, make shining, intr. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512; to be shining, beautiful). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; of beauty known and felt by him (cf. <a href="/esther/3-9.htm">Esther 3:9</a> with <a href="/1_samuel/25-36.htm">1 Samuel 25:36</a> &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, and the later way of expressing it <a href="/daniel/3-32.htm">Daniel 3:32</a>). But since the giver and the gift are one and the same, the joy he has in the inheritance becomes of itself a constant thanksgiving to and blessing of the Giver, that He (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; quippe qui) has counselled him (<a href="/psalms/73-24.htm">Psalm 73:24</a>) to choose the one thing needful, the good part. Even in the night-seasons his heart keeps watch, even then his reins admonish him (&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;, here of moral incitement, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>, to warn). The reins are conceived of as the seat of the blessed feeling that Jahve is his possession (vid., Psychol. S. 268; tr. p. 316). He is impelled from within to offer hearth-felt thanks to his merciful and faithful God. He has Jahve always before him, Jahve is the point towards which he constantly directs his undiverted gaze; and it is easy for him to have Him thus ever present, for He is &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (supply &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, as in <a href="/psalms/22-29.htm">Psalm 22:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>), at my right hand (i.e., where my right hand begins, close beside me), so that he has no need to draw upon his power of imagination. The words &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1496;, without any conjunction, express the natural effect of this, both in consciousness and in reality: he will not and cannot totter, he will not yield and be overthrown. </body></html>
