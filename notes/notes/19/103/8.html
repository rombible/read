He has revealed himself and his grace to them. By his ways we may understand his precepts, the ways he requires us to walk in; and his promises and purposes. He always has been full of compassion. How unlike are those to God, who take every occasion to chide, and never know when to cease! What would become of us, if God should deal so with us? The Scripture says a great deal of the mercy of God, and we all have experienced it. The father pities his children that are weak in knowledge, and teaches them; pities them when they are froward, and bears with them; pities them when they are sick, and comforts them; pities them when they are fallen, and helps them to rise; pities them when they have offended, and, upon their submission, forgives them; pities them when wronged, and rights them: thus the Lord pities those that fear him. See why he pities. He considers the frailty of our bodies, and the folly of our souls, how little we can do, how little we can bear; in all which his compassion appears.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/103.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord is merciful and gracious - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a>. The idea here is derived evidently from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a> - that great and glorious statement of God himself in regard to his own character. Our world is a different world under that statement from what it would be if that and kindred declarations had not been made. There is here a "progression" of thought; an "advance" on the previous statements. At first the psalmist referred to his own individual experience <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3-5</a>; then he referred to the dealings of God toward the Hebrew people <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103-6.htm">Psalm 103:6-7</a>; and now he rises to the general contemplation of his character as it relates to all mankind. It was a characteristic of God in respect to all, that he was kind, compassionate, and forbearing.<p>Slow to anger - That is, patient; not soon excited; bearing much, and bearing it long. See <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>.<p>And plenteous in mercy - Margin, "great of mercy."

So he made himself known to Moses, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, and so David found him to be, and therefore calls upon his soul to bless his name. God is "merciful" in the most tender and affectionate manner; he has bowels of mercy, which yearn towards his people, as those of a tender parent to its child, as the word signifies; his mercy is free, without any motive or merit in men to engage it; he delights in showing it; he constantly bestows it; it is the source of all good things; it is communicated through Christ; all mercies temporal and spiritual come by him; and this lays a foundation for faith and hope: and he is gracious, as appears in the eternal choice of his people to salvation; in providing a Saviour and a ransom for them; in giving all grace and the blessings of it to them in his Son; in giving him for them, and all things to them with him; in justifying them by his righteousness; in pardoning their sins for his sake; in taking them into his family; in regenerating, calling, preserving, and saving them: <p>slow to anger, or "longsuffering" (d); even to wicked men, to the vessels of wrath, to the old world, yea, to Jezebel, to whom he gave space to repent; which longsuffering being abused and despised, is an aggravation of condemnation: but rather here it intends God's longsuffering to his people, as before conversion, waiting till the time comes that he is gracious to them; and after conversion, notwithstanding their backslidings and revoltings; and this longsuffering is their salvation: <p>and plenteous in mercy; large and abundant in it, as appears by the various instances of it, and ways and methods in which he shows it; in election, in the covenant, in redemption, in regeneration, in pardon and eternal life; and by the abundance of it which he bestows on every one of his people; and by the vast numbers which do partake of it. <p>(d)  "longanimis", V.

In such soliloquies it is the Ego that speaks, gathering itself up with the spirit, the stronger, more manly part of man (Psychology, S. 104f.; tr. p. 126), or even, because the soul as the spiritual medium of the spirit and of the body represents the whole person of man (Psychology, S. 203; tr. p. 240), the Ego rendering objective in the soul the whole of its own personality. So here in <a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a> the soul, which is addressed, represents the whole man. The &#1511;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; which occurs here is a more choice expression for &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;): the heart, which is called &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, the reins, the liver, etc.; for according to the scriptural conception (Psychology, S. 266; tr. p. 313) these organs of the cavities of the breast and abdomen serve not merely for the bodily life, but also the psycho-spiritual life. The summoning &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; is repeated per anaphoram. There is nothing the soul of man is so prone to forget as to render thanks that are due, and more especially thanks that are due to God. It therefore needs to be expressly aroused in order that it may not leave the blessing with which God blesses it unacknowledged, and may not forget all His acts performed (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;) on it (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, e.g., in <a href="/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>), which are purely deeds of loving-kindness), which is the primal condition and the foundation of all the others, viz., sin-pardoning mercy. The verbs &#1505;&#1500;&#1495; and &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; with a dative of the object denote the bestowment of that which is expressed by the verbal notion. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-21.htm">Deuteronomy 29:21</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-19.htm">1 Chronicles 21:19</a>, from &#1495;&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, root &#1492;&#1500;, solutum, laxum esse) are not merely bodily diseases, but all kinds of inward and outward sufferings. &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; the lxx renders &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, as in <a href="/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>); but in this antithesis to life it is more natural to render the "pit" (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;) as a name of Hades, as in <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>. Just as the soul owes its deliverance from guilt and distress and death to God, so also does it owe to God that with which it is endowed out of the riches of divine love. The verb &#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;, without any such addition as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/5-13.htm">Psalm 5:13</a>, is "to crown," cf. <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>. As is usually the case, it is construed with a double accusative; the crown is as it were woven out of loving-kindness and compassion. The Beth of &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; in <a href="/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a> instead of the accusative (<a href="/psalms/104-28.htm">Psalm 104:28</a>) denotes the means of satisfaction, which is at the same time that which satisfies. &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; the Targum renders: dies senectutis tuae, whereas in <a href="/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a> it is ornatus ejus; the Peshto renders: corpus tuum, and in <a href="/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a> inversely, juventus eorum. These significations, "old age" or "youth," are pure inventions. And since the words are addressed to the soul, &#1506;&#1491;&#1497; cannot also, like &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; in other instances, be a name of the soul itself (Aben-Ezra, Mendelssohn, Philippsohn, Hengstenberg, and others). We, therefore, with Hitzig, fall back upon the sense of the word in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a>, where the lxx renders &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, but here more freely, apparently starting from the primary notion of &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;  equals  Arabic chadd, the cheek: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (whereas Saadia's victum tuum is based upon a comparison of the Arabic gda&#770;, to nourish). The poet tells the soul (i.e., his own person, himself) that God satisfies it with good, so that it as it were gets its cheeks full of it (cf. <a href="/psalms/81-11.htm">Psalm 81:11</a>). The comparison &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is, as in <a href="/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a> (cf. <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>), to be referred to the annual moulting of the eagle. Its renewing of its plumage is an emblem of the renovation of his youth by grace. The predicate to &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1499;&#1497; (plural of extension in relation to time) stands first regularly in the sing. fem. </body></html>
