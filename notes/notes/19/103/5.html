The word there adopted (“trappings,” or “ornaments”) would Commend itself here, from the evident allusion in the next clause to the moulting of the bird, and its appearance in new plumage, if the expression “to satisfy ornament with good” were in any way intelligible. The LXX. and Vulg. have “desire; the Syriac “body;” but the Chaldee, “age,” which is supported (Gesenius) by the derivation, gives the best sense:—<p>Who satisfleth thine age with good, so that<p>Thy youth renews itself like the eagle.<p><span class= "bld">The eagle’s.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">nesher; </span>properly, the <span class= "ital">griffon, </span>or <span class= "ital">great vulture. </span>See <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm" title="You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.">Exodus 19:4</a>; and Note to <a href="/obadiah/1-4.htm" title="Though you exalt yourself as the eagle, and though you set your nest among the stars, there will I bring you down, said the LORD.">Obadiah 1:4</a>.<p>The rendering of the Prayer Book, “like the eagle’s,” follows the LXX. The idea that the eagle renewed its youth formed the basis of a Rabbinical story, and no doubt appears also in the myth of the Phœnix. But the psalmist merely refers to the fresh and vigorous appearance of the bird with its new plumage.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/103.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>103:1-5 By the pardon of sin, that is taken away which kept good things from us, and we are restored to the favor of God, who bestows good things on us. Think of the provocation; it was sin, and yet pardoned: how many the provocations, yet all pardoned! God is still forgiving, as we are still sinning and repenting. The body finds the melancholy consequences of Adam's offence, it is subject to many infirmities, and the soul also. Christ alone forgives all our sins; it is he alone who heals all our infirmities. And the person who finds his sin cured, has a well-grounded assurance that it is forgiven. When God, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, recovers his people from their decays, and fills them with new life and joy, which is to them an earnest of eternal life and joy, they may then be said to return to the days of their youth, Job 33:25.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/103.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things - The word translated "thy mouth" here is rendered in the Chaldee "thy age;" in the Arabic, the Septuagint, and the Latin Vulgate, "thy desire;" in the Syriac, "thy body;" DeWette renders it, "thy age." So also Tholuck. The Hebrew word - &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;  &#8219;a&#774;d&#305;&#770;y - is rendered "ornaments" in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/33-4.htm">Exodus 33:4-6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-32.htm">Jeremiah 2:32</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/7-20.htm">Ezekiel 7:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-11.htm">Ezekiel 16:11</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/16-17.htm">Ezekiel 16:17</a> (margin,); <a href="/ezekiel/23-40.htm">Ezekiel 23:40</a>; and "mouth" in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a>, as here. These are the only places in which it occurs. Gesenius renders it here "age," and supposes that it stands in contrast with the word "youth" in the other part of the verse. The connection would seem to demand this, though it is difficult to make it out from any usage of the Hebrew word. Professor Alexander renders it "thy soul" - from the supposition that the Hebrew word "ornament" is used as if in reference to the idea that the "soul" is the chief glory or ornament of man. This seems, however, to be a very forced explanation. I confess myself unable to determine the meaning.<p>So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's - Compare <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>. The allusion, to which there is supposed to be a reference here, is explained in the notes at that passage. Whatever may be true in regard to the supposed fact pertaining to the eagle, about its renewing its strength and vigor in old age, the meaning here is simply that the strength of the psalmist in old age became like the strength of the eagle. Sustained by the bounty of God in his old age he became, as it were, young again. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/103.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

The Ancient Versions are at fault. The LXX gives <span class="ital">thy desire</span>; the Targ. <span class="ital">the days of thine old age</span>; the Syr. <span class="ital">thy body</span>; Aq. and Jer. <span class="ital">thy adornment</span>.

But this is improbable, as the soul itself is addressed; and it seems better to suppose that the verb has an unusual construction (but cp. <a href="/psalms/145-16.htm" title="You open your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing.">Psalm 145:16</a>), and to render:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Who adorneth thee to the full with goodliness;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(So that) thy youth is renewed like an eagle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In Israel’s resurrection from the grave of exile each Israelite is as it were endowed with a fresh accession of youthful vigour.

There is no need to suppose an allusion to the fable that the eagle periodically renewed its strength by soaring sunwards and then plunging into the sea. Coverdale’s paraphrase in the P.B.V., “making thee young and lusty as an eagle,” gives the sense rightly.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/103.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things.</span> So Dean Johnson and our Revisers.

Dr. Kay translates, "thy gay heart;" Professor Cheyne, "thy desire."

He has shortened his days, so that he only drags on wearily, and has only a short distance still before him before he is entirely overcome.

The introductory &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (cf. <a href="/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2</a>), which announces a definite moulding of the utterance, serves to give prominence to the petition that follows. In the expression &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; life is conceived of as a line the length of which accords with nature; to die before one's time is a being taken up out of this course, so that the second half of the line is not lived through (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-24.htm">Psalm 55:24</a>, <a href="/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a>). The prayer not to sweep him away before his time, the poet supports not by the eternity of God in itself, but by the work of the rejuvenation of the world and of the restoration of Israel that is to be looked for, which He can and will bring to an accomplishment, because He is the ever-living One. The longing to see this new time is the final ground of the poet's prayer for the prolonging of his life. The confession of God the Creator in <a href="/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26</a> reminds one in its form of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-13.htm">Isaiah 48:13</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/44-24.htm">Psalm 44:24</a>. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a> refers to the two great divisions of the universe. The fact that God will create heaven and earth anew is a revelation that is indicated even in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>, but is first of all expressed more fully and in many ways in the second part of the Book of Isaiah, viz., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-6.htm">Isaiah 51:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/51-16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>. It is clear from the agreement in the figure of the garment (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-6.htm">Isaiah 51:6</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/50-9.htm">Psalm 50:9</a>) and in the expression (&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, perstare, as in <a href="/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>) that the poet has gained this knowledge from the prophet. The expressive &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, Thou art He, i.e., unalterably the same One, is also taken from the mouth of the prophet, <a href="/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-4.htm">Isaiah 46:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-12.htm">Isaiah 48:12</a>; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is a predicate, and denotes the identity (sameness) of Jahve (Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, i. 63). In v. 29 also, in which the prayer for a lengthening of life tapers off to a point, we hear <a href="/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a> re-echoed. And from the fact that in the mind of the poet as of the prophet the post-exilic Jerusalem and the final new Jerusalem upon the new earth under a new heaven blend together, it is evident that not merely in the time of Hezekiah or of Manasseh (assuming that <a href="/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a> are by the old Isaiah), but also even in the second half of the Exile, such a perspectively foreshortened view was possible. When, moreover, the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews at once refers <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26-28</a> to Christ, this is justified by the fact that the God whom the poet confesses as the unchangeable One is Jahve who is to come. </body></html>
