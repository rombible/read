He has revealed himself and his grace to them. By his ways we may understand his precepts, the ways he requires us to walk in; and his promises and purposes. He always has been full of compassion. How unlike are those to God, who take every occasion to chide, and never know when to cease! What would become of us, if God should deal so with us? The Scripture says a great deal of the mercy of God, and we all have experienced it. The father pities his children that are weak in knowledge, and teaches them; pities them when they are froward, and bears with them; pities them when they are sick, and comforts them; pities them when they are fallen, and helps them to rise; pities them when they have offended, and, upon their submission, forgives them; pities them when wronged, and rights them: thus the Lord pities those that fear him. See why he pities. He considers the frailty of our bodies, and the folly of our souls, how little we can do, how little we can bear; in all which his compassion appears.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/103.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment - That is, "justice." He sees that justice is done to the oppressed. He is on their side. His law, his commands, his judicial decisions, his providential interpositions, are in their favor. This does not mean that it will he done at once; or that there will never be any delay; or that they may not suffer even for a long time - for this occurs in fact; but the meaning is, that God has their true interest at heart; that at proper times, and whenever and whereever there are any dealings of his in the case, his acts are in favor of those that are oppressed; and that there will be sooner or later such interpositions in their behalf as shall entirely vindicate their cause.<p>For all that are oppressed - By harsh laws; by unjust governments; by slavery; by unrighteous decisions in courts; by the pride and power of wicked people.

Not only for the Israelites oppressed by the Egyptians, though the psalmist might have them in his view, by what follows; for whom the Lord did justice, by delivering them out of the hands of their oppressors, and by punishing Pharaoh and his people, and bringing down judgments upon them, both in Egypt and at the Red sea; but for all other oppressed ones in common, the poor, the widow, and the fatherless, who are often oppressed by the rich and mighty; the Lord judges their cause, and does them right, and frees them from their oppression; and so all good men who are oppressed by tyrannical princes and cruel persecutors, and all such whom the man of the earth, the man of sin, antichrist, oppresses, <a href="/psalms/10-18.htm">Psalm 10:18</a> and all those who are oppressed by the devil, buffeted by Satan, and bore down with his temptations; the Lord rebukes him in his own time, and delivers his people out of his hands; which is matter of praise and thankfulness: the psalmist, in this verse and the following, passes to the consideration of the good things God did for others, in order to keep up a warm sense of divine goodness upon his heart. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/103.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/103.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

He has shortened his days, so that he only drags on wearily, and has only a short distance still before him before he is entirely overcome. The Chethb &#1499;&#1495;&#1493; (lxx &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;) may be understood of God's irresistible might, as in <a href="/job/23-6.htm">Job 23:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-18.htm">Job 30:18</a>, but in connection with it the designation of the object is felt to be wanting. The introductory &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (cf. <a href="/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2</a>), which announces a definite moulding of the utterance, serves to give prominence to the petition that follows. In the expression &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; life is conceived of as a line the length of which accords with nature; to die before one's time is a being taken up out of this course, so that the second half of the line is not lived through (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-24.htm">Psalm 55:24</a>, <a href="/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a>). The prayer not to sweep him away before his time, the poet supports not by the eternity of God in itself, but by the work of the rejuvenation of the world and of the restoration of Israel that is to be looked for, which He can and will bring to an accomplishment, because He is the ever-living One. The longing to see this new time is the final ground of the poet's prayer for the prolonging of his life. The confession of God the Creator in <a href="/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26</a> reminds one in its form of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-13.htm">Isaiah 48:13</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/44-24.htm">Psalm 44:24</a>. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a> refers to the two great divisions of the universe. The fact that God will create heaven and earth anew is a revelation that is indicated even in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>, but is first of all expressed more fully and in many ways in the second part of the Book of Isaiah, viz., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-6.htm">Isaiah 51:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/51-16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>. It is clear from the agreement in the figure of the garment (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-6.htm">Isaiah 51:6</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/50-9.htm">Psalm 50:9</a>) and in the expression (&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, perstare, as in <a href="/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>) that the poet has gained this knowledge from the prophet. The expressive &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, Thou art He, i.e., unalterably the same One, is also taken from the mouth of the prophet, <a href="/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-4.htm">Isaiah 46:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-12.htm">Isaiah 48:12</a>; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is a predicate, and denotes the identity (sameness) of Jahve (Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, i. 63). In v. 29 also, in which the prayer for a lengthening of life tapers off to a point, we hear <a href="/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a> re-echoed. And from the fact that in the mind of the poet as of the prophet the post-exilic Jerusalem and the final new Jerusalem upon the new earth under a new heaven blend together, it is evident that not merely in the time of Hezekiah or of Manasseh (assuming that <a href="/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a> are by the old Isaiah), but also even in the second half of the Exile, such a perspectively foreshortened view was possible. When, moreover, the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews at once refers <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26-28</a> to Christ, this is justified by the fact that the God whom the poet confesses as the unchangeable One is Jahve who is to come. </body></html>
