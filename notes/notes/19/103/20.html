That exhortation was, however, then addressed by the psalmist to his own soul, and was especially founded on the benefits which he had himself received. The psalm closes also with an exhortation to "bless the Lord," yet on a much wider scale. The psalmist feels that there is not only occasion for him to do it, but that the reason for it extends to the whole universe. The meaning is, that God is worthy of universal praise; and all ranks of beings - all worlds - should join in that praise. Man, feeble, frail, dying, could not come up to the fullness of the praise required. Praise such as was appropriate to God - such as his perfections and works deserved - demanded loftier powers than those of man; the loftiest powers in the universe.<p>Ye his angels - All beings higher than man; beings around and before his throne.<p>That excel in strength - Margin, as in Hebrew, "mighty in strength," and therefore more "able" to offer adequate praise.<p>That do his commandments - Who perfectly obey his law, and who, therefore, can render more acceptable praise than can ever come from human lips.<p>Hearkening unto the voice of his word - Who always listen to his voice; who never are disobedient; and who can, therefore, approach him as holy beings, and more appropriately worship him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/103.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20-22. do his commandments &#8230; word&#8212;or, literally, "so as to hearken," &c., that is, their acts of obedience are prompt, so that they are ever ready to hear, and know, and follow implicitly His declared will (compare De 26:17; Lu 1:19).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/103.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>20 Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.<p>21 Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.<p>22 Bless the Lord, all his works in all places of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul.<p><a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a><p>"Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength." Finding his work of praise growing upon his hands, he calls upon "the firstborn sons of light" to speak the praises of the Lord, as well they may, for as Milton says, they best can tell. Dwelling nearer to that prepared throne than we as yet have leave to climb, they see in nearer vision the glory which we would adore. To them is given an exceeding might of intellect, and voice, and force which they delight to use in sacred services for him; let them now turn all their strength into that solemn song which we would send up to the third heaven. To him who gave angelic strength let all angelic strength be given. They are his angels, and therefore they are not loth to ring out his praises. "That do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word." We are bidden to do these commandments, and alas we fail; let those unfallen spirits, whose bliss it is never to have transgressed, give to the Lord the glory of their holiness. They hearken for yet more commands, obeying as much by reverent listening as by energetic action, and in this they teach us how the heavenly will should evermore be done; yet even for this surpassing excellence let them take no praise, but render all to him who has made and kept them what they are. O that we could hear them chant the high praises of God, as did the shepherds on that greatest of all birth nights - <p>"When such music sweet<p>Their hearts and ears did greet<p>As never was by mortal finger struck;<p>Divinely-warbled voice<p>Answering the stringed noise,<p>As well their souls in blissful rapture took:<p>The air, such pleasure loth to lose,<p>With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close."<p>Our glad heart anticipates the hour when we shall hear them "harping in loud and solemn guise," and all to the sole praise of God.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/103.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Angels; </span> which, though glorious creatures, are but his ministers and messengers, as the word signifies.

For their creation, being made by him; for their preservation, living, moving, and having their being in him; and for their happiness, in which they are continued, owing to their being chosen of God in Christ, and to their confirmation by Christ. These are always employed in the work of blessing and praising the Lord nor are they in the least backward to it, nor remiss it; nor does this address unto them suppose anything of this kind. The design of the psalmist is only to show how great and good the Lord is; that angels, the more excellent order of creatures, are under obligation to him, and are bound to praise him: and his further view is, to stir up himself and others to this work, from such a consideration, that such noble creatures are employed in the same, and who are further described: <p>that excel in strength; or, "are mighty in strength" (e); they are called mighty angels, <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a> an instance of the might and power of an angel see in <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>. These, not having sinned, have lost nothing of their original strength and power, and therefore must greatly excel fallen man; who is become a very weak creature, and unable to do the will and work of God, which angels are, as follows: <p>that do his commandments; or "his word" (f); what he orders to be done: this they do readily and willingly, constantly, perfectly, and completely; see <a href="/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>. <p>Hearkening to the voice of his word; they stand before the Lord, waiting his orders; listening with great attention to what he says, and then readily execute it.
