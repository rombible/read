We should desire our Christian friends, when they have any good work in hand, to call for us, and take us with them. With what readiness should we think of the heavenly Jerusalem! How cheerfully should we bear the cross and welcome death, in hopes of a crown of glory! Jerusalem is called the beautiful city. It was a type of the gospel church, which is compact together in holy love and Christian communion, so that it is all as one city. If all the disciples of Christ were of one mind, and kept the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, their enemies would be deprived of their chief advantages against them. But Satan's maxim always has been, to divide that he may conquer; and few Christians are sufficiently aware of his designs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/122.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For there are set - Margin, Do sit. The Hebrew is, "For there sit thrones for judgment." They are established there; or, That is the appointed place for administering justice.<p>Thrones of judgment - Seats for dispensing justice. The word throne is now commonly appropriated to the seat or chair of a king, but this is not necessarily the meaning here. The word may denote a seat or bench occupied by a judge. The meaning here is, that Jerusalem was the supreme seat of justice; the place where justice was dispensed for the nation. It was at once the religious and the civil capital of the nation.<p>The thrones of the house of David - Of the family of David, who performed the office of magistrates, or who administered justice. The family of David would naturally be employed in such a service as this. This office, Absalom - who had not been appointed to it - earnestly desired, in order that he might secure popularity in his contemplated rebellion.

Jahve is his Keeper, He is his shade upon his right hand (&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; as in <a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a>, and frequently; the construct state instead of an apposition, cf. e.g., Arab. ja&#770;nbu 'l-grb&#305;&#770;yi, the side of the western  equals  the western side), which protecting him and keeping him fresh and cool, covers him from the sun's burning heat. &#1506;&#1500;, as in <a href="/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>, with the idea of an overshadowing that screens and spreads itself out over anything (cf. <a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>).
