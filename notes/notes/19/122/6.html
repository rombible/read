There is first the challenge to the body of pilgrims to give the customary salutation, and then it is taken up in a threefold wish, varied each time. Then follows the reason of this unanimous and hearty prayer: “Ask for the peace of the city of peace; prosperity be to thy lovers, peace within thy walls, prosperity in thy palaces.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/psalms/122.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/122-6.htm" title="Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love you....">Psalm 122:6-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Pray for the peace of Jerusalem — </span>In the prosperity of which both your civil and religious privileges are deeply concerned. <span class="ital">They shall prosper that love thee — </span>Or, <span class="ital">Let them prosper, </span>the future being taken imperatively, as is very frequent.

Thus, “in these concluding verses, the psalmist declares the two motives which induced him to utter his best wishes, and to use his best endeavours for the prosperity of Jerusalem; namely, the love of his brethren, whose happiness was involved in that of their city; and the love of God, who had there fixed the residence of his glory. These motives are ever in force, and ought, surely, to operate with marvellous energy upon our hearts, to stir us up to imitate the pattern now before us, in fervent zeal and unwearied labour for the salvation of men, and the glory of our great Redeemer; both which will then be complete, when the church militant shall become the church triumphant, and the heavenly paradise shall be filled with plants taken from its terrestrial nursery.” — Horne. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/122.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>122:6-9 Those who can do nothing else for the peace of Jerusalem, may pray for it.

Blessed Spirit of peace and love, who didst dwell in the soul of the holy Jesus, descend into his church, and fill those who compose it with his heavenly tempers; cause bitter contentions to cease, and make us to be of one mind. Love of the brethren and love to God, ought to stir us up to seek to be like the Lord Jesus in fervent prayer and unwearied labour, for the salvation of men, and the Divine glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/122.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem - The prosperity, the welfare of Jerusalem - for peace is everywhere the image of prosperity and happiness. Compare <a href="/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>. This is the language which those who were going up to the city - to the house of the Lord - addressed to each other, expressing the joyful feelings of their hearts at their own near approach to the city. It breathes the desire that all would pray for the peace and prosperity of a city so dear to their own souls; where the worship of God was celebrated; where God himself dwelt; where justice was administered: a city of so much importance and so much influence in the land. To us now it inculcates the duty of praying for the church: its peace; its unity; its prosperity; its increase; its influence on our country and on the world at large. It is a prayer that the church may not be divided by schism or heresy; that its members may cherish for each other right feelings; that there may be no jealousies, no envyings, and no jars; that the different branches of the church may regard and treat each other with kindness, with respect, and with mutual recognition; that prosperity may attend them all.<p>The shall prosper that love thee - Or rather, They shall have peace that love thee; or, May they have peace that love thee. The word prosper conveys an idea which is not in the original. The Hebrew word means to be "secure," "tranquil," "at rest," spoken especially of one who enjoys quiet prosperity, <a href="/job/3-26.htm">Job 3:26</a>; <a href="/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>. The essential idea is that of quietness or rest; and the meaning here is, that those who love Zion will have peace; or, that the tendency of that love is to produce peace. See <a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>. The prayer was for "peace;" the thought in connection with that was naturally that those who loved Zion would have peace. It is indeed true, in general, that they who love Zion, or who serve God, will "prosper" (compare the notes at <a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>), but that is not the truth taught here. The idea is that they will have peace: peace with God; peace in their own consciences; peace in the prospect of death and of the future world; peace amidst the storms and tempests of life; peace in death, in the grave, and forever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/122.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7.

This is said to the persons that solicited the psalmist to go into the house of the Lord; to the truly godly among the tribes that went thither to worship; to his brethren and companions, for whose sake he wished well to Zion; to praying souls, who should not be singular and selfish; not only pray for themselves, but for others; for all saints, and for the church of God in general; for Jerusalem, not merely literally considered; though as that was the metropolis of the nation, and many of them the psalmist addresses were inhabitants of it, it became them to seek and pray for the peace of it, their own peace being concerned in it; see <a href="/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>; but for the spiritual and heavenly Jerusalem, the church of God, and for the peace of it; that Christ, the Man, the Peace, the Peacemaker, who then was not come, might come; that the members of it might enjoy spiritual peace in their son is, and might have peace one with another, and be at peace with their enemies; and enjoy the abundance of peace and prosperity, which will be in the latter day; and will lie in freedom from persecution, in a destruction of antichrist and all the the enemies of the church; in the purity of Gospel truths and ordinances, and the spread of them; in numerous conversions of Jews and Gentiles; in the unity of the Lord's people in sentiment, worship, and affection; and in a large increase of spiritual light and holiness: all which should be earnestly prayed for by the well-wishers of the cause of Christ; see <a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a>. There may be an allusion to the name of Jerusalem, which signifies "they shall see peace"; and it should be prayed for that they might. The argument enforcing this duty exhorted to follows: <p>they shall prosper that love thee; that love Jerusalem, the church of God; that love Christ, her King; the saints, her citizens; her laws and ordinances; and the word of the Lord that goes out of her, and is ministered in her: which is shown by an attendance with her on them, and by their prayers for her prosperity and welfare: and such prosper in their outward affairs, as Obededom and his family were blessed for the sake of the ark he took in and took care of; and in their spiritual affairs their souls prosper, as Gaius's did, and as such do who are favoured with the discoveries of the love of God, with an application of pardoning grace and mercy; have a spiritual appetite for the word; when their graces are in lively exercise, their corruptions are subdued, spiritual light and zeal for truth are increased, inward strength is renewed, communion with God is enjoyed, and they are fruitful in every good work. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/122.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/122.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Pray for the peace of Jerusalem</span>] This is probably the right rendering; but the phrase might also be rendered <span class="ital">Inquire for the welfare of J</span>., greet or salute her, the customary salutation being “Is it well (lit. peace) with thee?” or “Peace be unto thee.” Cp. <a href="/jeremiah/15-5.htm" title="For who shall have pity on you, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan you? or who shall go aside to ask how you do?">Jeremiah 15:5</a>. The rendering of the LXX, “Ask now for Jerusalem the things which belong unto peace,” contains the phrase (<span class="greekheb">τὰ εἰς εἰρήνην</span>) used by our Lord as He entered Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-42.htm" title="Saying, If you had known, even you, at least in this your day, the things which belong to your peace! but now they are hid from your eyes.">Luke 19:42</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὰ πρὸς εἰρήνην</span>).

But the prayer for the prosperity of those who love Jerusalem follows naturally on the invitation to them to pray for her welfare. Contrast the anathema on those who hate Zion in <a href="/psalms/129-5.htm" title="Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.">Psalm 129:5</a>.
