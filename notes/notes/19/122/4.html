We should desire our Christian friends, when they have any good work in hand, to call for us, and take us with them. With what readiness should we think of the heavenly Jerusalem! How cheerfully should we bear the cross and welcome death, in hopes of a crown of glory! Jerusalem is called the beautiful city. It was a type of the gospel church, which is compact together in holy love and Christian communion, so that it is all as one city. If all the disciples of Christ were of one mind, and kept the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, their enemies would be deprived of their chief advantages against them.

The twelve tribes of Israel; the males of them went up three times a year to Jerusalem to worship, at the feasts of passover, pentecost, and tabernacles; and was typical of the church of Christ, where the worship of God is carried on, his word preached, and ordinances administered; and whither saints go and attend for their own profit and the glory of God; this is the city of our solemnities, <a href="/isaiah/33-20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>; <p>unto the testimony of Israel; the ark of the testimony a symbol of the divine Presence.

Jahve is his Keeper, He is his shade upon his right hand (&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; as in <a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a>, and frequently; the construct state instead of an apposition, cf. e.g., Arab. ja&#770;nbu 'l-grb&#305;&#770;yi, the side of the western  equals  the western side), which protecting him and keeping him fresh and cool, covers him from the sun's burning heat. &#1506;&#1500;, as in <a href="/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>, with the idea of an overshadowing that screens and spreads itself out over anything (cf. <a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>).

The transferring of the word of the moon is not zeugmatic. Even the moon's rays may become insupportable, may affect the eyes injuriously, and (more particularly in the equatorial regions) produce fatal inflammation of the brain.<p>(Note: Many expositors, nevertheless, understand the destructive influence of the moon meant here of the nightly cold, which is mentioned elsewhere in the same antithesis. <a href="/genesis/31-40.htm">Genesis 31:40</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>. De Sacy observes also: On dit quelquefois d'un grand froid, comme d'un grand chaud, qu'il est brulant. The Arabs also say of snow and of cold as of fire: jah&#803;rik, it burns.)<p>From the hurtful influences of nature that are round about him the promise extends in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7-8</a> in every direction.
