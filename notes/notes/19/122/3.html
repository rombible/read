It is explained to refer either <span class= "ital">to </span>the rebuilding of the city and reuniting of the parts which had been disconnected in the destruction, or, which is far better (see Introduction), is taken as a rustic’s impression on first seeing a compact city after being accustomed to straggling villages. The astonishment of Virgil’s shepherd is aptly compared: “Urbem quam dicunt Romam, Melibæe putavi, Stultus ego, huic nostræ similem.” But a far more satisfactory meaning is suggested by the LXX. They (comp. Symmachus) take the word rendered <span class= "ital">compact </span>as a noun, meaning <span class= "ital">union. </span>The verse then may run: <span class= "ital">Jerusalem, the </span>(<span class= "ital">one</span>)<span class= "ital"> built like a city, union is in it together, i.e.</span>, it is the rallying point of all the tribes.

We should desire our Christian friends, when they have any good work in hand, to call for us, and take us with them. With what readiness should we think of the heavenly Jerusalem! How cheerfully should we bear the cross and welcome death, in hopes of a crown of glory! Jerusalem is called the beautiful city. It was a type of the gospel church, which is compact together in holy love and Christian communion, so that it is all as one city. If all the disciples of Christ were of one mind, and kept the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, their enemies would be deprived of their chief advantages against them. But Satan's maxim always has been, to divide that he may conquer; and few Christians are sufficiently aware of his designs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/122.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together - literally, "joined to itself together;" that is, when one part is, as it were, bound closely to another part; not scattered or separate. The walls are all joined together; and the houses are all united to one another so as to make a compact place. The ground occupied by Jerusalem never could be large, as it was surrounded with valleys, except on the north, and hemmed in with hills, so that, from the necessity of the case, when it became the capital of the nation, it was densely crowded. This, moreover, was usual in ancient cities, when they were made compact for the sake of defense and protection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/122.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-5. compact together&#8212;all parts united, as in David's time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/122.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Partly in its buildings, which are not dispersed, as they are in villages, nor divided into two cities, as it was before, but united and enlarged, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/11-7.htm" title="And David dwelled in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.">1 Chronicles 11:7</a>,8</span>; and principally in its government and religion, which was distinct and opposite, before David took the fort of Zion from the Jebusites. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/122.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together. In David's time the upper and lower city were joined together, the streets regularly built, the houses contiguous, not straggling about, here and there one (c). So the church of God, like that, is built in a good situation, on a rock and hill, where it is firm and visible; like a city full of inhabitants, governed by wholesome laws, under proper officers; a free city, which enjoys many privileges and immunities; a well fortified one, having salvation for walls and bulwarks about it; a royal city, the city of the great King, the city of our God, the name of which is "Jehovahshammah", the Lord is there: and this is "compact together" when its citizens are united in affection to one another; agree in their religious sentiments; join in social worships, and live in subjection to one Head and King, the Lord Jesus Christ. The Jews often speak, and so some of their commentators on this passage, of a Jerusalem above and below, and of the one being made like unto the other: so the Targum, <p>"Jerusalem is built in the firmament as a city, as Jerusalem on earth;'' <p>see <a href="/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>. <p>(c) Hecataeus, an Heathen writer, describes Jerusalem as a strong fortified city, fifty furlongs in circumference; and inhabited by twelve myriads, or a hundred and twenty thousand men.

The exclamation of the pilgrims. Jerusalem that art built up as a city which is compacted together, lit. <span class="ital">joined together for itself</span>. This is generally understood to refer to the restoration of the city: the walls have been rebuilt, the ruined houses repaired, the gaps and vacant spaces filled up; the city once more presents an aspect of unity, continuity, solidity, widely different from the dilapidated condition in which Nehemiah found it (<a href="/nehemiah/2-17.htm" title="Then said I to them, You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.">Nehemiah 2:17</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-4.htm" title="Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built.">Nehemiah 7:4</a>). But the verb is used metaphorically as well as literally (e.g. <a href="/psalms/94-20.htm" title="Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with you, which frames mischief by a law?">Psalm 94:20</a>), and it is possible that the sight of the restored city is to the poet’s eye an emblem of the mutual harmony of its inhabitants or of the unity of the nation. Such a sense is suggested by Coverdale’s beautiful rendering <span class="ital">that is at unity with itself</span>, which seems to be a paraphrase of the Vulg. <span class="ital">cuius participatio eius in idipsum</span>, LXX <span class="greekheb">ἧς ἡ μετοχὴ αὐτῆς ἐπιτοαυτό</span>, ‘whose fellowship is together.’ This rendering however presumes a slightly different reading of the text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Targ. interprets the words of the heavenly Jerusalem—‘Jerusalem which is built in the firmament like a city that is united together upon earth.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/122.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Jerusalem that art builded</span>. The primary reference is probably to the compact shape and look of the ancient city, which, as Josephus says, was "one and entire," with no straggling suburbs, shut in on the north by a wall, and on the three other sides both by walls and by deep, rocky valleys. But the material "compactness" was perhaps taken to symbolize the close internal union of the inhabitants one with another, whereby they were all knit together into one Church and people. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/121.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>That which holds good of "the Keeper of Israel" the poet applies believingly to himself, the individual among God's people, in <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a> after <a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>.
