Let us consider all who seek the glory of the Redeemer, as our brethren and fellow-travellers, without regarding differences which do not affect our eternal welfare. Blessed Spirit of peace and love, who didst dwell in the soul of the holy Jesus, descend into his church, and fill those who compose it with his heavenly tempers; cause bitter contentions to cease, and make us to be of one mind. Love of the brethren and love to God, ought to stir us up to seek to be like the Lord Jesus in fervent prayer and unwearied labour, for the salvation of men, and the Divine glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/122.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For my brethren and companions' sakes - Because they dwell there; or, because they go up there to worship; or, because they love thee, and find their happiness in thee; or, because they are unconverted, and all my hope of their salvation is to be derived from thee - from the church, from the influence of religion.<p>I will now say, Peace be within thee - I will pray for thy peace, for thy prosperity, for the blessing of God upon thee - because their good, their comfort, their hope of salvation, depends on thee - on the influence which shall go out from thee. So the Christian prays that the church may prosper - that the divine blessing may rest upon it - that there may be in it harmony, peace, love, and zeal - that a blessing may attend the preaching of the gospel - not only because he loves it, and seeks his own comfort and edification in it, but that his friends and kindred - his wife, his parents, his children, his neighbors - those whom he loves, and whose salvation he desires, may be saved. This expresses the true feelings of piety all over the world; this is one of the grounds of the strong love which the friends of God have for the church - because they hope and desire that through the church those most dear to their hearts will find salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/122.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8, 9.

So David, though a king, reckoned his meanest subjects as such, who were spiritual men; and for their sakes, through the goodwill, love, and affection he bore to them, he would set praying souls an example, and by it enforce his own exhortation, as follows: <p>I will now say, peace be within thee; now and always put up this petition, and not put it off to longer time; that peace and prosperity may always attend the church of God, as well as the city of Jerusalem, literally considered, and the inhabitants of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/122.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For my <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace <i>be</i> within thee.</span><p>(g) Not only for my own sake but for all the faithful.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/122.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">For my brethren and companions’ sakes</span>] Not, for the sake of the nation in general, though doubtless the welfare of the nation was dependent on the welfare of the metropolis: but for the sake of those dwelling in Jerusalem, to whom he feels himself attached in the bonds of closest fellowship.

Here in comparison with <a href="/psalms/122-2.htm">Psalm 122:2</a> it is a retrospect; for &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; with the participle has for the most part a retrospective signification, <a href="/genesis/39-22.htm">Genesis 39:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-22.htm">Deuteronomy 9:22</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/9-24.htm">Deuteronomy 9:24</a>; <a href="/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>; <a href="/job/1-14.htm">Job 1:14</a>. True, &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; might also signify: they have been standing and still stand (as in <a href="/psalms/10-14.htm">Psalm 10:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>); but then why was it not more briefly expressed by &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/psalms/26-12.htm">Psalm 26:12</a>)? The lxx correctly renders: &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; and &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;. The poet, now again on the journey homewards, or having returned home, calls to mind the joy with which the cry for setting out, "Let us go up to the house of Jahve!" filled him. When he and the other visitors to the feast had reached the goal of their pilgrimage, their feet came to a stand-still, as if spell-bound by the overpowering, glorious sight.<p>(Note: So also Veith in his, in many points, beautiful Lectures on twelve gradual Psalms (Vienna 1863), S. 72, "They arrested their steps, in order to give time to the amazement with which the sight of the Temple, the citadel of the king, and the magnificent city filled them.")<p>Reviving this memory, he exclaims: Jerusalem, O thou who art built up again - true, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; in itself only signifies "to build," but here, where, if there is nothing to the contrary, a closed sense is to be assumed for the line of the verse, and in the midst of songs which reflect the joy and sorrow of the post-exilic restoration period, it obtains the same meaning as in <a href="/psalms/102-17.htm">Psalm 102:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/147-2.htm">Psalm 147:2</a>, and frequently (Gesenius: O Hierosolyma restituta). The parallel member, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3</a>, does not indeed require this sense, but is at least favourable to it. Luther's earlier rendering, "as a city which is compacted together," was happier than his later rendering, "a city where they shall come together," which requires a Niph. or Hithpa. instead of the passive. &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; signifies, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-7.htm">Exodus 28:7</a>, to be joined together, to be united into a whole; and &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493; strengthens the idea of that which is harmoniously, perfectly, and snugly closed up (cf. <a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>). The Kaph of &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is the so-called Kaph veritatis: Jerusalem has risen again out of its ruined and razed condition, the breaches and gaps are done away with (<a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>), it stands there as a closely compacted city, in which house joins on to house. Thus has the poet seen it, and the recollection fills him with rapture.<p>(Note: In the synagogue and church it is become customary to interpret <a href="/psalms/122-3.htm">Psalm 122:3</a> of the parallelism of the heavenly and earthly Jerusalem.) </body></html>
