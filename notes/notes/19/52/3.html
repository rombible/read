The patience and forbearance of God are abused by sinners, to the hardening of their hearts in their wicked ways. But the enemies in vain boast in their mischief, while we have God's mercy to trust in. It will not save us from the guilt of lying, to be able to say, there was some truth in what we said, if we make it appear otherwise than it was. The more there is of craft and contrivance in any wickedness, the more there is of Satan in it. When good men die, they are transplanted from the land of the living on earth, to heaven, the garden of the Lord, where they shall take root for ever; but when wicked men die, they are rooted out, to perish for ever. The believer sees that God will destroy those who make not him their strength.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/52.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou lovest evil more than good - Thou dost prefer to do injury to others, rather than to do them good. In the case referred to, instead of aiding the innocent, the persecuted, and the wronged, he had attempted to reveal the place where he might be found, and where an enraged enemy might have an opportunity of wreaking his vengeance upon him.<p>And lying rather than to speak righteousness - He preferred a lie to the truth; and, when he supposed that his own interest would be subserved by it, he preferred a falsehood that would promote that interest, rather than a simple statement of the truth. The "lying" in this case was that which was "implied" in his being desirous of giving up David, or betraying him to Saul - as if David was a bad man, and as if the suspicions of Saul were wellfounded. He preferred to give his countenance to a falsehood in regard to him, rather than to state the exact truth in reference to his character. His conduct in this was strongly in contrast with that of Ahimelech, who, when arraigned before Saul, declared his belief that David was innocent; his firm conviction that David was true and loyal. "For" that fidelity he lost his life, <a href="/1_samuel/22-14.htm">1 Samuel 22:14</a>. Doeg was willing to lend countenance to the suspicions of Saul, and practically to represent David as a traitor to the king. The word "Selah" here is doubtless a mere musical pause.

The invocation of God by the name Elohim is here made more urgent by the addition of &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;; inasmuch as the prayers for justification and for renewing blend together in the "deliver me." David does not seek to lessen his guilt; he calls it in &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; by its right name, - a word which signifies blood violently shed, and then also a deed of blood and blood-guiltiness (<a href="/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/106-38.htm">Psalm 106:38</a>, and frequently). We have also met with &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; construed with &#1502;&#1503; of the sin in <a href="/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a>. He had given Uriah over to death in order to possess himself of Bathsheba. And the accusation of his conscience spoke not merely of adultery, but also of murder. Nevertheless the consciousness of sin no longer smites him to the earth, Mercy has lifted him up; he prays only that she would complete her work in him, then shall his tongue exultingly praise (&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503; with an accusative of the object, as in <a href="/psalms/59-17.htm">Psalm 59:17</a>) God's righteousness, which, in accordance with the promise, takes the sinner under its protection. But in order to perform what he vowed he would do under such circumstances, he likewise needs grace, and prays, therefore, for a joyous opening of his mouth. In sacrifices God delighteth not (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a>, cf. <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>), otherwise he would bring some (&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, darem, sc. si velles, vid., on <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>); whole-burnt-offerings God doth not desire: the sacrifices that are well-pleasing to Him and most beloved by Him, in comparison with which the flesh and the dead work of the &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; and the &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;) is altogether worthless, are thankfulness (<a href="/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>) out of the fulness of a penitent and lowly heart. There is here, directly at least, no reference to the spiritual antitype of the sin-offering, which is never called &#1494;&#1489;&#1492;. The inward part of a man is said to be broken and crushed when his sinful nature is broken, his ungodly self slain, his impenetrable hardness softened, his haughty vainglorying brought low, - in fine, when he is in himself become as nothing, and when God is everything to him. Of such a spirit and heart, panting after grace or favour, consist the sacrifices that are truly worthy God's acceptance and well-pleasing to Him (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, where such a spirit and such a heart are called God's earthly temple).<p>(Note: The Talmud finds a significance in the plural &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;. Joshua ben Levi (B. Sanhedrin 43b) says: At the time when the temple was standing, whoever brought a burnt-offering received the reward of it, and whoever brought a meat-offering, the reward of it; but the lowly was accounted by the Scriptures as one who offered every kind of sacrifice at once (&#1499;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1499;&#1500; &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1499;&#1493;&#1500;&#1503;).
