David saw troubles coming from God's wrath, and that discouraged him. But if one trouble follow hard after another, if all seem to combine for our ruin, let us remember they are all appointed and overruled by the Lord. David regards the Divine favour as the fountain of all the good he looked for. In the Saviour's name let us hope and pray. One word from him will calm every storm, and turn midnight darkness into the light of noon, the bitterest complaints into joyful praises. Our believing expectation of mercy must quicken our prayers for it. At length, is faith came off conqueror, by encouraging him to trust in the name of the Lord, and to stay himself upon his God. He adds, And my God; this thought enabled him to triumph over all his griefs and fears. Let us never think that the God of our life, and the Rock of our salvation, has forgotten us, if we have made his mercy, truth, and power, our refuge. Thus the psalmist strove against his despondency: at last his faith and hope obtained the victory. Let us learn to check all unbelieving doubts and fears. Apply the promise first to ourselves, and then plead it to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thou art the God of my strength - See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-7.htm">Psalm 28:7</a>, note.<p>Why dost thou cast me off? - As if I were none of thine; as if I were wholly abandoned.

The word rendered "cast off" - &#1494;&#1504;&#1495;  za&#770;nach - is a word which implies strong disgust or loathing: "Why dost thou cast me off as a loathsome or disgusting object?" Compare <a href="/revelation/3-16.htm">Revelation 3:16</a>.

God Himself is indeed dishonoured in him; He will not suffer the trust he has reposed in Him to go unjustified. True, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; seems at the beginning of the line to be tame, but from &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; and &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, the beginning and end of the line, standing in contrast, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; is made emphatic, and it is at the same time clear that &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is not equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; - which Gesenius asserts in his Lexicon, erroneously referring to <a href="/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a>, is a poetical usage of the language; an assertion for which, however, there is as little support as that &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="/numbers/14-43.htm">Numbers 14:43</a> and other passages is equivalent to &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. In all such passages, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a>, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; means "therefore," and the relationship of reason and consequence is reversed. So even here: within him his soul is bowed very low, and on account of this downcast condition he thinks continually of God, from whom he is separated. Even in <a href="/jonah/2-8.htm">Jonah 2:8</a> this thinking upon God does not appear as the cause but as the consequence of pain. The "land of Jordan and of Hermonim" is not necessarily the northern mountain range together with the sources of the Jordan. The land beyond the Jordan is so called in opposition to &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;, the land on this side. According to Dietrich (Abhandlungen, S. 18), &#1495;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is an amplificative plural: the Hermon, as a peak soaring far above all lower summits. John Wilson (Lands of the Bible, ii. 161) refers the plural to its two summits. But the plural serves to denote the whole range of the Antilebanon extending to the south-east, and accordingly to designate the east Jordanic country. It is not for one moment to be supposed that the psalmist calls Hermon even, in comparison with his native Zion, the chosen of God. &#1492;&#1512; &#1502;&#1510;&#1506;&#1512;, i.e., the mountain of littleness: the other member of the antithesis, the majesty of Zion, is wanting, and the &#1502;&#1503; which is repeated before &#1492;&#1512; is also opposed to this. Hitzig, striking out the &#1502; of &#1502;&#1492;&#1512;, makes it an address to Zion: "because I remember thee out of the land of Jordan and of summits of Hermon, thou little mountain;" but, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>, these words are addressed to Elohim. In the vicinity of Mitz&#8219;are, a mountain unknown to us, in the country beyond Jordan, the poet is sojourning; from thence he looks longingly towards the district round about his home, and just as there, in a strange land, the wild waters of the awe-inspiring mountains roar around him, there seems to be a corresponding tumult in his soul. In <a href="/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a> he depicts the natural features of the country round about him - and it may remind one quite as much of the high and magnificent waterfalls of the lake of Muze&#770;r&#305;&#770;b as of the waterfall at the course of the Jordan near Paneas and the waters that dash headlong down the mountains round about - and in <a href="/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a> he says that he feels just as though all these threatening masses of water were following like so many waves of misfortune over his head (Tholuck, Hitzig, and Riehm). Billow follows billow as if called by one another (cf. <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a> concerning the continuous antiphon of the seraphim) at the roar (&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500; as in <a href="/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>) of the cataracts, which in their terrible grandeur proclaim the Creator, God (lxx &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) - all these breaking, sporting waves of God pass over him, who finds himself thus surrounded by the mighty works of nature, but taking no delight in them; and in them all he sees nothing but the mirrored image of the many afflictions which threaten to involve him in utter destruction (cf. the borrowed passage in that mosaic work taken from the Psalms, <a href="/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a>).<p>He, however, calls upon himself in <a href="/psalms/42-9.htm">Psalm 42:9</a> to take courage in the hope that a morning will dawn after this night of affliction (<a href="/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a>), when Jahve, the God of redemption and of the people of redemption, will command His loving-kindness (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>, Amos; 3f.); and when this by day has accomplished its work of deliverance, there follows upon the day of deliverance a night of thanksgiving (<a href="/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>): the joyous excitement, the strong feeling of gratitude, will not suffer him to sleep. The suffix of &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; is the suffix of the object: a hymn in praise of Him, prayer (viz., praiseful prayer, <a href="/habakkuk/3-1.htm">Habakkuk 3:1</a>) to the God of his life (cf. Sir. 23:4), i.e., who is his life, and will not suffer him to come under the dominion of death. Therefore will he say (&#1488;&#1493;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;), in order to bring about by prayer such a day of loving-kindness and such a night of thanksgiving songs, to the God of his rock, i.e., who is his rock (gen. apos.): Why, etc.? Concerning the different accentuation of &#1500;&#1502;&#1492; here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a>, vid., on <a href="/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>). In this instance, where it is not followed by a guttural, it serves as a "variation" Hitzig); but even the retreating of the tone when a guttural follows is not consistently carried out, vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a>, cf. <a href="/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a> (Ew. 243, b). The view of Vaihinger and Hengstenberg is inadmissible, viz., that <a href="/psalms/42-10.htm">Psalm 42:10</a> to <a href="/psalms/42-11.htm">Psalm 42:11</a> are the "prayer," which the psalmist means in <a href="/psalms/42-9.htm">Psalm 42:9</a>; it is the prayerful sigh of the yearning for deliverance, which is intended to form the burthen of that prayer. In some MSS we find the reading &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1495; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1495;; the &#1489;&#1468; is here really synonymous with the &#1499;&#1468;, it is the Beth essentiae (vid., <a href="/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>): after the manner of a crushing (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-27.htm">Ezekiel 21:27</a>, and the verb in <a href="/psalms/62-4.htm">Psalm 62:4</a> of overthrowing a wall) in my bones, i.e., causing me a crunching pain which seethes in my bones, mine oppressors reproach me (&#1495;&#1512;&#1507; with the transfer of the primary meaning carpere, as is also customary in the Latin, to a plucking and stripping one of his good name). The use of &#1489; here differs from its use in <a href="/psalms/42-10.htm">Psalm 42:10</a>; for the reproaching is not added to the crushing as a continuing state, but is itself thus crushing in its operation (vid., <a href="/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>). Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; we have here the easier form of expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1501;; and in the refrain &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, which is also to be restored in <a href="/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>. </body></html>
