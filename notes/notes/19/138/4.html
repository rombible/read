This refers to a time, of which frequent prophetic mention is made in the Scriptures, when kings and rulers shall be converted to the true religion, and when they shall act an important part, by their example and influence, in maintaining and diffusing it. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31-32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/138.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-5. That promise, as an answer to his prayers in distress, revived and strengthened his faith; and, as the basis of other revelations of the Messiah, it will be the occasion of praise by all who hear and receive it (Ps 68:29, 31; Isa 4:3).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/138.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord, when they hear the words of thy mouth.<p>5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: for great is the glory of the Lord.<p><a href="/psalms/138-4.htm">Psalm 138:4</a><p>"All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord, when they hear the words of thy mouth." Kings have usually small care to hear the word of the Lord; but King David feels assured that if they do hear it they will feel its power. A little piety goes a long way in courts; but brighter days are coming, in which rulers will become hearers and worshippers: may the advent of such happy times be hastened. What an assembly Ira "all the kings of the earth!" What a purpose! Gathered to hear the words of Jehovah's mouth. What a preacher! David himself rehearses the words of Jehovah. What praise I when they all in happy union lift up their songs unto the Lord. Kings are as gods below, and they do well when they worship the God above. The way of conversion for kings is the same as for ourselves: faith to them also cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Happy are those who can cause the word of the Lord to penetrate palaces; for the occupants of thrones are usually the last to know the joyful sounds of the gospel. David, the king, cared for kings' souls, and it will be wise for each man to look first after those who are of his own order. He went to his work of testimony with full assurance of success: he meant to speak only the words of Jehovah's mouth, and he felt sure that the kings would hear and praise Jehovah.<p><a href="/psalms/138-5.htm">Psalm 138:5</a><p>"Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord." Here is a double wonder - kings in God's ways, and kings singing there. Let a man once know the ways of Jehovah, and he will find therein abundant reason for song; but the difficulty is to bring the great ones of the earth into ways so little attractive to the carnal mind. Perhaps when the Lord sends us a King David to preach, we shall yet see monarchs converted and hear their voices raised in devout adoration. "For great is the glory of the Lord." This glory shall overshadow all the greatness and glory of all kings: they shall be stirred by a sight of it to obey and adore. O that Jehovah's glory were revealed even now! O that the blind eyes of men could once behold it, then their hearts would be subdued to joyful reverence. David, under a sense of Jehovah's glory, exclaimed, "I will sing" (<a href="/psalms/138-1.htm">Psalm 138:1</a>), and here he represents the kings as doing the same thing. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/138.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

We see from Obadiah's prophecy, which is taken up again by Jeremiah, how shamefully the Edomites, that brother-people related by descent to Israel and yet pre-eminently hostile to it, behaved in connection with the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans as their malignant, rapacious, and inhuman helpers. The repeated imper. Piel &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, from &#1506;&#1512;&#1492; (not imper. Kal from &#1506;&#1512;&#1512;, which would be &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;), ought to have been accented on the ult.; it is, however, in both cases accented on the first syllable, the pausal &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a>, and also &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/nehemiah/8-11.htm">Nehemiah 8:11</a>) giving rise to the same accentuation of the other (in order that two tone-syllables might not come together). The Pasek also stands between the two repeated words in order that they may be duly separated, and secures, moreover, to the guttural initial of the second &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; its distinct pronunciation (cf. <a href="/genesis/26-28.htm">Genesis 26:28</a>; <a href="/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16</a>). It is to be construed: lay bare, lay bare (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a>, cf. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/micah/1-6.htm">Micah 1:6</a>) in it (Beth of the place), of in respect of it (Beth of the object), even to the foundation, i.e., raze it even to the ground, leave not one stone upon another. From the false brethren the imprecation turns to Babylon, the city of the imperial power of the world. The daughter, i.e., the population, of Babylon is addressed as &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;. It certainly seems the most natural to take this epithet as a designation of its doings which cry for vengeance. But it cannot in any case be translated: thou plunderer (Syriac like the Targum: bozuzto; Symmachus &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;), for &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; does not mean to rob and plunder, but to offer violence and to devastate. Therefore: thou devastator; but the word so pointed as we have it before us cannot have this signification: it ought to be &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-7.htm">Jeremiah 3:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-10.htm">Jeremiah 3:10</a>, or &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; (with an unchangeable a&#772;), corresponding to the Syriac active intensive form a&#772;lu&#770;s&#803;o, oppressor, go&#772;du&#770;fo, slanderer, and the Arabic likewise active intensive form Arab. fa&#770;&#8219;u&#770;l, e.g., fa&#770;shu&#770;s, a boaster, and also as an adjective: g&#769;o&#770;z fa&#770;shu&#770;s, empty nuts, cf. &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, a fowler, like na&#770;t&#803;u&#770;r (&#1504;&#1488;&#1496;&#1493;&#1512;), a field-watcher. The form as it stands is part. pass., and signifies &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; (Aquila), vastata (Jerome). It is possible that this may be said in the sense of vastanda, although in this sense of a part. fut. pass. the participles of the Niphal (e.g., <a href="/psalms/22-32.htm">Psalm 22:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/102-19.htm">Psalm 102:19</a>) and of the Pual (<a href="/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>) are more commonly used. It cannot at any rate signify vastata in an historical sense, with reference to the destruction of Babylon by Darius Hystaspes (Hengstenberg); for <a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a> only prays that the retribution may come: it cannot therefore as yet have been executed; but if &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; signified the already devastated one, it must (at least in the main) have been executed already. It might be more readily understood as a prophetical representation of the executed judgment of devastation; but this prophetic rendering coincides with the imprecative: the imagination of the Semite when he utters a curse sees the future as a realized fact. "Didst thou see the smitten one (mad&#803;ru&#770;b)," i.e., he whom God must smite? Thus the Arab inquires for a person who is detested. "Pursue him who is seized (ilh&#803;ak&#803; el&#775;ma'chu&#770;dh)," i.e., him whom God must allow thee to seize! Thy speak thus inasmuch as the imagination at once anticipates the seizure at the same time with the pursuit. Just as here both mad&#803;ru&#770;b and ma'chu&#770;dh are participles of Kasl, so therefore &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; may also have the sense of vastanda (which must be laid waste!). That which is then further desired for Babylon is the requital of that which it has done to Israel, <a href="/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a>. It is the same penal destiny, comprehending the children also, which is predicted against it in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-16.htm">Isaiah 13:16-18</a>, as that which was to be executed by the Medes. The young children (with reference to &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, vid., on <a href="/psalms/8-3.htm">Psalm 8:3</a>) are to be dashed to pieces in order that a new generation may not raise up again the world-wide dominion that has been overthrown, <a href="/isaiah/14-21.htm">Isaiah 14:21</a>. It is zeal for God that puts such harsh words into the mouth of the poet. "That which is Israel's excellency and special good fortune the believing Israelite desires to have bestowed upon the whole world, but for this very reason he desires to see the hostility of the present world of nations against the church of God broken" (Hofmann). On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the "blessed" of this Psalm is not suited to the mouth of the New Testament church. In the Old Testament the church as yet had the form of a nation, and the longing for the revelation of divine righteousness clothed itself accordingly in a warlike garb. </body></html>
