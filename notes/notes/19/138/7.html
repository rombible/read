Divine consolations have enough in them to revive us, even when we walk in the midst of troubles. And God will save his own people that they may be revived by the Holy Spirit, the Giver of life and holiness. If we give to God the glory of his mercy, we may take to ourselves the comfort. This confidence will not do away, but quicken prayer. Whatever good there is in us, it is God works in us both to will and to do.

David "walked in the midst of trouble" during the greater part of his life. When the persecution of Saul was over, he had trouble from foreign enemies (<a href="/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5-12</a>.); when these were subdued, his domestic troubles began (<a href="/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13-19</a>; <a href="/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5</a>:53). God, however, from time to time "gave him a reviving." <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/9-3.htm">Psalm 9:3-6</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-14.htm">Psalm 18:14-17</a>, etc.). What God had so often done for him, David is confident that he will do again. He will break the power of his enemies, and deliver him from their machinations. <span class="cmt_word">And thy right hand</span>. The symbol of strength. <span class="cmt_word">Shall save me;</span> or, "deliver me" (comp. <a href="/psalms/18-35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a>; <a href="/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/63-8.htm">Psalm 63:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/108-6.htm">Psalm 108:6</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/138.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The poet will give thanks to Him, whom he means without mentioning Him by name, for His mercy, i.e., His anticipating, condescending love, and for His truth, i.e., truthfulness and faithfulness, and more definitely for having magnified His promise (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;) above all His Name, i.e., that He has given a promise which infinitely surpasses everything by which He has hitherto established a name and memorial for Himself (&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498;, with o&#772; instead of o&#774;, an anomaly that is noted by the Masora, vid., Baer's Psalterium, p. 133). If the promise by the mouth of Nathan (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>) is meant, then we may compare <a href="/2_samuel/7-21.htm">2 Samuel 7:21</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; are repeated in that promise and its echo coming from the heart of David so frequently, that this &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468; seems like a hint pointing to that history, which is one of the most important crises in the history of salvation. The expression &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; also becomes intelligible from this history. Ewald renders it: "in the presence of God!" which is surely meant to say: in the holy place (De Wette, Olshausen). But "before God will I sing praise to Thee (O God!)" - what a jumble! The lxx renders &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, which is in itself admissible and full of meaning,<p>(Note: Bellarmine: Scio me psallentem tibi ab angelis, qui tibi assistunt, videri et attendi et ideo ita considerate me geram in psallendo, ut qui intelligam, in quo theatro consistam.)<p>but without coherence in the context of the Psalm, and also is to be rejected because it is on the whole very questionable whether the Old Testament language uses &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; thus, without anything further to define it, in the sense of "angels." It might be more readily rendered "in the presence of the gods," viz., of the gods of the peoples (Hengstenberg, Hupfeld, and Hitzig); but in order to be understood of gods which are only seemingly such, it would require some addition. Whereas &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; can without any addition denote the magisterial possessors of the dignity that is the type of the divine, as follows from <a href="/psalms/82-1.htm">Psalm 82:1</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>) in spite of Knobel, Graf, and Hupfeld; and thus, too (cf. &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/psalms/119-46.htm">Psalm 119:46</a>), we understand it here, with Rashi, Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, Falminius, Bucer, Clericus, and others. What is meant are "the great who are in the earth," <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>, with whom David, inasmuch as he became king from being a shepherd, is ranked, and above whom he has been lifted up by the promise of an eternal kingship. Before these earthly "gods" will David praise the God of the promise; they shall hear for their salutary confusion, for their willing rendering of homage, that God hath made him "the highest with respect to the kings of the earth" (<a href="/psalms/89-28.htm">Psalm 89:28</a>). </body></html>
