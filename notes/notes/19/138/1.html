His mind is so taken up with God that he does not mention his name, to him there is no other God, and Jehovah is so perfectly realized and so intimately known, that the Psalmist, in addressing him, no more thinks of mentioning his name than we should do if we were speaking to a father or a friend. He sees God with his mind's eye, and simply addresses him with the pronoun "thee." He is resolved to praise the Lord, and to do it with the whole force of his life, even with his whole heart. He would not submit to act as one under restraint, because of the opinions of others; but in the presence of the opponents of the living God he would be as hearty in worship as if all were friends and would cheerfully unite with him. If others do not praise the Lord, there is all the more reason why we should do so, and should do so with enthusiastic eagerness. We need a broken heart to mourn our own sins, but a whole heart to praise the Lord's perfections. If ever our heart is whole and wholly occupied with one thing, it should be when we are praising the Lord. "Before the gods will I sing praise unto thee." Why should these idols rob Jehovah of his praises? The Psalmist will not for a moment suspend his songs because there are images before him, and their foolish worshippers might not approve of his music. I believe David referred to the false gods of the neighbouring nations, and the deities of the surviving Canaanites. He was not pleased that such gods were set up; but he intended to express at once his contempt of them, and his own absorption in the worship of the living Jehovah by continuing most earnestly to sing wherever he might be. It would be paying these dead idols too much respect to cease singing because they were perched aloft. In these days when new religions are daily excogitated, and new gods are set up, it is well to know how to act. Bitterness is forbidden, and controversy is apt to advertise the heresy; the very best method is to go on personally worshipping the Lord with unvarying zeal, singing with heart and voice his royal praises. Do they deny the Divinity of our Lord? Let us the more fervently adore him. Do they despise the atonement? Let us the more constantly proclaim it. Had half the time spent in councils and controversies been given to praising the Lord, the church would have been far sounder and stronger than she is at this day. The Hallelujah Legion will win the day. Praising and singing are our armour against the idolatries of heresy, our comfort under the depression caused by insolent attacks upon the truth, and our weapons for defending the gospel. Faith when displayed in cheerful courage, has about it a sacred contagion: others learn to believe in the Most High when they see his servant<p>"Calm 'mid the bewildering cry,<p>Confident of victory."<p><a href="/psalms/138-2.htm">Psalm 138:2</a><p>"I will worship toward thy holy temple," or the place of God's dwelling, where the ark abode. He would worship God in God's own way. The Lord had ordained a centre of unity, a place of sacrifice, a house of his indwelling; and David accepted the way of worship enjoined by revelation. Even so, the true-hearted believer of these days must not fall into the will-worship of superstition, or the wild worship of scepticism, but reverently worship as the Lord himself prescribes. The idol gods had their temples; but David averts his glance from them, and looks earnestly to the spot chosen of the Lord for his own sanctuary. We are not only to adore the true God, but to do so in his own appointed way: the Jew looked to the temple, we are to look to Jesus, the living temple of the Godhead. "And praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth." Praise would be the main part of David's worship; the name or character of God the great object of his song; and the special point of his praise the grace and truth which shone so conspicuously in that name. The person of Jesus is the temple of the Godhead, and therein we behold the glory of the Father, "full of grace and truth." It is upon these two points that the name of Jehovah is at this time assailed - his grace and his truth. He is said to be too stern, too terrible, and therefore "modern thought" displaces the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and sets up an effeminate deity of its own making. As for us, we firmly believe that God is love, and that in the summing up of all things it will be seen that hell itself is not inconsistent with the beneficence of Jehovah, but is, indeed, a necessary part of his moral government now that sin has intruded into the universe. True believers hear the thunders of his justice, and yet they do not doubt his lovingkindness. Especially do we delight in God's great love to his own elect, such as he showed to Israel as a race, and more especially to David and his seed when he entered into covenant with him. Concerning this there is abundant room for praise. But not only do men attack the lovingkindness of God, but the truth of God is at this time assailed on all sides; some doubt the truth of the inspired record as to its histories, others challenge the doctrines, many sneer at the prophecies; in fact, the infallible word of the Lord is at this time treated as if it were the writing of imposters, and only worthy to be carped at. The swine are trampling on the pearls at this time, and nothing restrains them; nevertheless, the pearls are pearls still, and shall yet shine about our Monarch's brow. We sing the lovingkindness and truth of the God of the Old Testament, - "the God of the whole earth shall he be called." David before the false gods first sang, then worshipped, and then proclaimed the grace and truth of Jehovah; let us do the same before the idols of the New Theology.<p>"For thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name." The word of promise made to David was in his eyes more glorious than all else that he had seen of the Most High. Revelation excels creation in the clearness, definiteness, and fulness of its teaching. The name of the Lord in nature is not so easily read as in the Scriptures, which are a revelation in human language, specially adapted to the human mind, treating of human need, and of a Saviour who appeared in human nature to redeem humanity. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but the divine word will not pass away, and in this respect especially it has a pre-eminence over every other form of manifestation. Moreover, the Lord lays all the rest of his name under tribute to his word: his wisdom, power, love, and all his other attributes combine to carry out his word. It is his word which creates, sustains, quickens, enlightens, and comforts. As a word of command it is supreme; and in the person of the incarnate Word it is set above all the works of God's hands. The sentence in the text is wonderfully full of meaning. We have collected a vast mass of literature upon it, but space will not allow us to put it all into our notes. Let us adore the Lord who has spoken to us by his word, and by his Son; and in the presence of unbelievers let us both praise his holy name and extol his holy word.<p><a href="/psalms/138-3.htm">Psalm 138:3</a><p>"In the day when I cried thou answeredst me." No proof is so convincing as that of experience. No man doubts the power of prayer after he has received an answer of peace to his supplication. It is the distinguishing mark of the true and living God that he hears the pleadings of his people, and answers them; the gods hear not and answer not, but Jehovah's memorial is - "the God that heareth prayer." There was some special day in which David cried more vehemently than usual; he was weak, wounded, worried, and his heart was wearied; then like a child he "cried," - cried unto his Father. It was a bitter, earnest, eager prayer, as natural and as plaintive as the cry of a babe. The Lord answered it; but what answer can there be to a cry? - to a mere inarticulate wail of grief? Our heavenly Father is able to interpret tears, and cries, and he replies to their inner sense in such a way as fully meets the case. The answer came in the same day as the cry ascended: so speedily does prayer rise to heaven, so quickly does mercy return to earth. The statement of this sentence is one which all believers can make, and as they can substantiate it with many facts, they ought boldly to publish it, for it is greatly to God's glory. Well might the Psalmist say, "I will worship" when he felt bound to say "thou answeredst me." Well might he glory before the idols and their worshippers when he had answers to prayer to look back upon. This also is our defence against modern heresies: we cannot forsake the Lord, for he has heard our prayers.<p>"And strengthenedst me with strength in my soul." This was a true answer to his prayer. If the burden was not removed, yet strength was given wherewith to bear it, and this is an equally effective method of help. It may not be best for us that the trial should come to an end; it may be far more to our advantage that by its pressure we should learn patience. Sweet are the uses of adversity, and our prudent Father in heaven will not deprive us of those benefits. Strength imparted to the soul is an inestimable boon; it means courage, fortitude, assurance, heroism. By his word and Spirit the Lord can make the trembler brave, the sick whole, the weary bright. This soul-might will continue: the man having been strengthened for one emergency remains vigorous for life, and is prepared for all future labours and sufferings; unless, indeed, he throw away his force by unbelief, or pride, or some other sin. When God strengthens, none can weaken. Then is our soul strong indeed when the Lord infuses might into us. <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is a Psalm of thanksgiving to God for those great deliverances which he had granted to David from Saul and other enemies; by the remembrance whereof David encourageth himself to trust in God in all him future difficulties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>David praiseth God for his goodness and truth showed to him, and foretelleth that the kings of this earth shall also praise him, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/138-1.htm" title="I will praise you with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise to you....">Psalm 138:1-6</a></span>, and professeth the fruit of his trusting in God in the midst of troubles, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/138-7.htm" title="Though I walk in the middle of trouble, you will revive me: you shall stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and your right hand shall save me.">Psalm 138:7</a>,8</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The bank of a river, like the seashore, is a favourite place of sojourn of those whom deep grief drives forth from the bustle of men into solitude. The boundary line of the river gives to solitude a safe back; the monotonous splashing of the waves keeps up the dull, melancholy alternation of thoughts and feelings; and at the same time the sight of the cool, fresh water exercises a soothing influence upon the consuming fever within the heart. The rivers of Babylon are here those of the Babylonian empire: not merely the Euphrates with its canals, and the Tigris, but also the Chaboras (Chebar) and Eulaeos ('Ulai), on whose lonesome banks Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>) and Daniel (ch. <a href="/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>) beheld divine visions. The &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is important: there, in a strange land, as captives under the dominion of the power of the world. And &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; is purposely chosen instead of &#1493;: with the sitting down in the solitude of the river's banks weeping immediately came on; when the natural scenery around contrasted so strongly with that of their native land, the remembrance of Zion only forced itself upon them all the more powerfully, and the pain at the isolation from their home would have all the freer course where no hostilely observant eyes were present to suppress it. The willow (&#1510;&#1508;&#1510;&#1508;&#1492;) and viburnum, those trees which are associated with flowing water in hot low-lying districts, are indigenous in the richly watered lowlands of Babylonia. &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;), if one and the same with Arab. grb, is not the willow, least of all the weeping-willow, which is called s&#803;afsa&#770;f mustah&#305;&#770; in Arabic, "the bending-down willow," but the viburnum with dentate leaves, described by Wetzstein on <a href="/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a>. The Talmud even distinguishes between tsaph-tsapha and &#8219;araba, but without our being able to obtain any sure botanic picture from it. The &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, whose branches belong to the constituents of the lulab of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>), is understood of the crack-willow [Salix fragilis], and even in the passage before us is surely not distinguished with such botanical precision but that the gharab and willow together with the weeping-willow (Salix Babylonica) might be comprehended under the word &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;. On these trees of the country abounding in streams the exiles hung their citherns. The time to take delight in music was past, for &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, Sir. 22:6. Joyous songs, as the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; designates them, were ill suited to their situation.<p>In order to understand the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/137-3.htm">Psalm 137:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/137-3.htm">Psalm 137:3</a> and <a href="/psalms/137-4.htm">Psalm 137:4</a> must be taken together. They hung up their citherns; for though their lords called upon them to sing in order that they might divert themselves with their national songs, they did not feel themselves in the mind for singing songs as they once resounded at the divine services of their native land. The lxx, Targum, and Syriac take &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; as a synonym of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, synonymous with &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, and so, in fact, that it signifies not, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, the spoiled and captive one, but the spoiler and he who takes other prisoners. But there is no Aramaic &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500;. It might more readily be referred back to a Poel &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; ( equals  &#1492;&#1514;&#1500;), to disappoint, deride (Hitzig); but the usage of the language does not favour this, and a stronger meaning for the word would be welcome. Either &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, like &#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/102-9.htm">Psalm 102:9</a>, signifies the raving one, i.e., a bloodthirsty man or a tyrant, or from &#1497;&#1500;&#1500;, ejulare, one who causes the cry of woe or a tormentor, - a signification which commends itself in view of the words &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, which are likewise formed with the preformative &#1514;. According to the sense the word ranks itself with an Hiph. &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;, with &#1492;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; and &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;, in a mainly abstract signification (Dietrich, Abhandlungen, S. 160f.). The &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; beside &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; is used as in <a href="/psalms/35-20.htm">Psalm 35:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>, viz., partitively, dividing up the genitival notion of the species: words of songs as being parts or fragments of the national treasury of song, similar to &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; a little further on, on which Rosenmller correctly says: sacrum aliquod carmen ex veteribus illis suis Sionicis. With the expression "song of Zion" alternates in <a href="/psalms/137-4.htm">Psalm 137:4</a> "song of Jahve," which, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-27.htm">2 Chronicles 29:27</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-7.htm">1 Chronicles 25:7</a>, denotes sacred or liturgical songs, that is to say, songs belonging to Psalm poesy (including the Cantica).<p>Before <a href="/psalms/137-4.htm">Psalm 137:4</a> we have to imagine that they answered the request of the Babylonians at that time in the language that follows, or thought thus within themselves when they withdrew themselves from them. The meaning of the interrogatory exclamation is not that the singing of sacred songs in a foreign land (&#1495;&#1493;&#1510;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;) is contrary to the law, for the Psalms continued to be sung even during the Exile, and were also enriched by new ones. But the shir had an end during the Exile, in so far as that it was obliged to retire from publicity into the quiet of the family worship and of the houses of prayer, in order that that which is holy might not be profaned; and since it was not, as at home, accompanied by the trumpets of the priests and the music of the Levites, it became more recitative than singing properly so called, and therefore could not afford any idea of the singing of their native land in connection with the worship of God on Zion. From the striking contrast between the present and the former times the people of the Exile had in fact to come to the knowledge of their sins, in order that they might get back by the way of penitence and earnest longing to that which they had lost Penitence and home-sickness were at that time inseparable; for all those in whom the remembrance of Zion was lost gave themselves over to heathenism and were excluded from the redemption. The poet, translated into the situation of the exiles, and arming himself against the temptation to apostasy and the danger of denying God, therefore says: If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495; has been taken as an address to Jahve: obliviscaris dexterae meae (e.g., Wolfgang Dachstein in his song "An Wasserflssen Babylon"), but it is far from natural that Jerusalem and Jahve should be addressed in one clause. Others take &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; as the subject and &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495; transitively: obliviscatur dextera mea, scil. artem psallendi (Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, Pagninus, Grotius, Hengstenberg, and others); but this ellipsis is arbitrary, and the interpolation of &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; after &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (von Ortenberg, following Olshausen) produces an inelegant cadence. Others again assign a passive sense to &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1495;: oblivioni detur (lxx, Italic, Vulgate, and Luther), or a half-passive sense, in oblivione sit (Jerome); but the thought: let my right hand be forgotten, is awkward and tame. Obliviscatur me (Syriac, Saadia, and the Psalterium Romanum) comes nearer to the true meaning. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495; is to be taken reflexively: obliviscatur sui ipsius, let it forget itself, or its service (Amyraldus, Schultens, Ewald, and Hitzig), which is equivalent to let it refuse or fail, become lame, become benumbed, much the same as we say of the arms of legs that they "go to sleep," and just as the Arabic nasiya signifies both to forget and to become lame (cf. Gesenius, Thesaurus, p. 921b). La Harpe correctly renders: O Jerusalem! si je t'oublie jamais, que ma main oublie aussi le mouvement! Thus there is a correspondence between <a href="/psalms/137-5.htm">Psalm 137:5</a> and <a href="/psalms/137-6.htm">Psalm 137:6</a> : My tongue shall cleave to my palate if I do not remember thee, if I do not raise Jerusalem above the sum of my joy. &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; has the affixed Chirek, with which these later Psalms are so fond of adorning themselves. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is apparently used as in <a href="/psalms/119-160.htm">Psalm 119:160</a> : supra summam (the totality) laetitiae meae, as Coccejus explains, h.e. supra omnem laetitiam meam. But why not then more simply &#1506;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, above the totality? &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; here signifies not &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, but &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;: if I do not place Jerusalem upon the summit of my joy, i.e., my highest joy; therefore, if I do not cause Jerusalem to be my very highest joy. His spiritual joy over the city of God is to soar above all earthly joys. </body></html>
