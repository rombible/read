And if mediation on the glories of creation be so sweet to the soul, what greater glory appears to the enlightened mind, when contemplating the great work of redemption! There alone can a sinner perceive ground of confidence and joy in God.

See the notes at <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>. It is one of the characteristics of true piety that there is a "disposition" to think about God; that the mind is "naturally" drawn to that subject; that it does not turn away from it, when it is suggested; that this fills up the intervals of business in the day-time, and that it occupies the mind when wakeful at night. <a href="/psalms/63-6.htm">Psalm 63:6</a>. It is also a characteristic of true piety that there is "pleasure" in such meditations; happiness in thinking of God. The sinner has no such pleasure. The thought of God is painful to him; he does not desire to have it suggested to him; he turns away from it, and avoids it. Compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/30-11.htm">Isaiah 30:11</a>. It is one of the evidences of true piety when a man "begins" to find pleasure in thinking about God; when the subject, instead of being unpleasant to him, becomes pleasant; when he no longer turns away from it, but is sensible of a desire to cherish the thought of God, and to know more of him.<p>I will be glad in the Lord - That is, I will rejoice that there is such a Being; I will seek my happiness in him as my God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/104.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31-34.

The rich contents of this sixth group flow over and exceed the decastich. With &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (not &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/psalms/92-6.htm">Psalm 92:6</a>) the poet expresses his wonder at the great number of God's works, each one at the same time having its adjustment in accordance with its design, and all, mutually serving one another, co-operating one with another. &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, which signifies both bringing forth and acquiring, has the former meaning here according to the predicate: full of creatures, which bear in themselves the traces of the Name of their Creator (&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;). Beside &#1511;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, however, we also find the reading &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498;, which is adopted by Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer, represented by the versions (lxx, Vulgate, and Jerome), by expositors (Rashi: &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;), by the majority of the MSS (according to Norzi) and old printed copies, which would signify &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, or according to the Latin versions &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (possessione tua, Luther "they possessions"), but is inferior to the plural ktisma'toon &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, as an accusative of the object to &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;. The sea more particularly is a world of moving creatures innumerable (<a href="/psalms/69-35.htm">Psalm 69:35</a>). &#1494;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; does not properly signify this sea, but that sea, yonder sea (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a>; <a href="/joshua/9-13.htm">Joshua 9:13</a>).

It is an old word, which is also Egyptian in the form hani and ana.<p>(Note: Vide Chabas, Le papyrus magique Harris, p. 246, No. 826: HANI (&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;), vaisseau, navire, and the Book of the Dead 1. 10, where hani occurs with the determinative picture of a ship.

In &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27</a>, the range of vision is widened from the creatures of the sea to all the living things of the earth; cf. the borrowed passages <a href="/psalms/145-15.htm">Psalm 145:15</a>., <a href="/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, by an obliteration of the suffix, signifies directly "altogether," and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; (cf. <a href="/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>): when it is time for it. With reference to the change of the subject in the principal and in the infinitival clause, vid., Ew. 338, a. The existence, passing away, and origin of all beings is conditioned by God. His hand provides everything; the turning of His countenance towards them upholds everything; and His breath, the creative breath, animates and renews all things. The spirit of life of every creature is the disposing of the divine Spirit, which hovered over the primordial waters and transformed the chaos into the cosmos. &#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507; in <a href="/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a> is equivalent to &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>, and frequently.
