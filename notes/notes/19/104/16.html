The phrase "the trees of the Lord" means great and magnificent trees - as the expression "mountains of God" means great and lofty mountains - as if they seemed to "approach" God, or as if no appellation would so well describe their nature as that which was derived from the Infinite One.

Or "satiated" (s); that is, with rain; and through it are filled with fruits. This is to be understood not only of the tallest and largest trees; which are therefore called the trees of the Lord, as high mountains are called the mountains of the Lord, <a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a> and so other things excellent in their kind: but of trees of the field and forest; so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions; which are not planted and cultivated by man, as trees in gardens and orchards are; but are more especially under the care and cultivation of the Lord himself, and may design such as were produced by him at the creation. <p>The cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted; a mountain on the borders of Judea, so called from its whiteness, through the snow on it, as the Alps are; and where grew great quantities of large and spreading cedars, which were not of man's, but of the Lord's planting: these were watered and made to grow with the rain of heaven. Rauwolff (t), who was upon this mountain in 1574, says, <p>"though this hill in former ages has been quite covered over with cedars, yet they are so decreased, that I could tell, says he, no more but twenty four, that stood round about in a circle; and two others, the branches whereof are quite decayed with age.'' <p>But Thevenot (u), who has been there since, affirms there are no more nor less than twenty three, great and small; of the largeness, thickness, and height of these trees; see Gill on <a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>. Saints are often compared to trees, which are planted by the Lord in Christ, and in his churches; and particularly to cedars, for their height, strength, and durableness; see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/92-13.htm">Psalm 92:13</a>, and these, through the grace of God, are full of sap and spiritual life, and are filled with the fruits of righteousness, and are often represented as planted and growing by rivers of water; see <a href="/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>. <p>(s) "satiantur", Vatablus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius; so Musculus, Gejerus, Michaelis.

God, the blessed One, being the principal subject of the Psalm, the poet (in <a href="/psalms/104-10.htm">Psalm 104:10</a> and further on) is able to go on in attributive and predicative participles: Who sendeth springs &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, into the wads (not: &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, as brooks). &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, as <a href="/psalms/104-10.htm">Psalm 104:10</a> shows, is here a synonym of &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1492;, and there is no need for saying that, flowing on in the plains, they grow into rivers. The lxx has &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. &#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; is doubly poetic for &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;. God has also provided for all the beasts that roam far from men; and the wild ass, swift as an arrow, difficult to be hunted, and living in troops (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, Arabic fera&#770;, root &#1508;&#1512;, Arab. fr, to move quickly, to whiz, to flee; the wild ass, the onager, Arabic himr el-wahs, whose home is on the steppes), is made prominent by way of example. The phrase "to break the thirst" occurs only here. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-12.htm">Psalm 104:12</a>, refers to the &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which are also still the subject in <a href="/psalms/104-11.htm">Psalm 104:11</a>. The pointing &#1506;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; needlessly creates a hybrid form in addition to &#1506;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (like &#1500;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;) and &#1506;&#1508;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;. From the tangled branches by the springs the poet insensibly reaches the second half of the third day. The vegetable kingdom at the same time reminds him of the rain which, descending out of the upper chambers of the heavens, waters the waterless mountain-tops. Like the Talmud (B. Ta&#8219;an&#305;&#770;th, 10a), by the "fruit of Thy work" (&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; as singular) Hitzig understands the rain; but rain is rather that which fertilizes; and why might not the fruit be meant which God's works (&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498;, plural) here below (<a href="/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>), viz., the vegetable creations, bear, and from which the earth, i.e., its population, is satisfied, inasmuch as vegetable food springs up as much for the beasts as for man? In connection with &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489; the poet is thinking of cultivated plants, more especially wheat; &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;, however, does not signify: for cultivation by man, since, according to Hitzig's correct remonstrance, they do not say &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;, and &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; has not man, but rather God, as its subject, but as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-30.htm">1 Chronicles 26:30</a>, for the service (use) of man. </body></html>
