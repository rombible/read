Just as He makes the clouds serve as a chariot and the sky as a tent, so he employs the winds as messengers and the lightnings as servants.<p>Taken quite alone, the construction and arrangement of the verse favours the interpretation of the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>, Note, <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>This was the traditional Jewish interpretation, and on it were founded various theories of angelic agency.<p>But not only do the exigencies of the context set aside this interpretation, but Hebrew literature offers enough instances to show that the order in which a poet arranged his words was comparatively immaterial. Indeed, Dean Perowne has adduced two instances (<a href="/isaiah/37-26.htm" title="Have you not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that you should be to lay waste defended cities into ruinous heaps.">Isaiah 37:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-18.htm" title="Violence shall no more be heard in your land, wasting nor destruction within your borders; but you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.">Isaiah 60:18</a>) of precisely similar inversion of the natural order of immediate object and predicate.

This interpretation seems most agreeable to the scope of the Psalm and of the context, wherein he is speaking of the visible works of God; and, perhaps, if properly considered, it will not be found to invalidate the argument of the apostle, (<a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>,) who informs us that the words have a reference to immaterial angels: for, when the psalmist says that God maketh the winds, <span class="greekheb">מלאכיו</span>, <span class="ital">malachaiv, his angels, </span>or <span class="ital">messengers, </span>he plainly signifies that the angels are God’s ministers, or servants, no less than the winds. And that is sufficient to justify the apostle’s argument, and to prove the pre-eminence of Christ above the angels, which is the apostle’s design in that place: see on <a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/104.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>104:1-9 Every object we behold calls on us to bless and praise the Lord, who is great.

They are entirely under his command. They are sent by him to do his will; to carry out his designs. This is intended to describe the majesty and the power of God - that he can employ wind and lightning - tempest and storm - to go on errands such as he commands; to fulfill his plans; to do his bidding.

Or the sense is, Who sometimes clotheth his angels with subtile bodies of wind, or air, or of fire, as he sees fit.

This interpretation may seem most agreeable to the scope of the Psalm, and to the context, wherein he is speaking of the evil works of God. The only difficulty is, that this seems to invalidate the allegation and argument of the apostle, who expounds it of the angels, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a></span>. But indeed it doth not; for (to say nothing of other solutions given by other men) when the psalmist saith that God <span class="ital">maketh</span> or useth <span class="ital">the winds as his angels</span>, &c., he plainly signifies that the angels are God’s ministers or servants, no less than the winds; and that is sufficient to justify the apostle’s argument, and to prove the pre-eminency of Christ above the angels; which is the apostle’s design in that place. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/104.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who maketh his angels spirits,.... The angels are spirits, or spiritual substances, yet created ones; and so differ from God, who is a spirit, and from the Holy Spirit of God, who are Creators and not creatures; angels are spirits without bodies, and so differ from the souls or spirits of men, and are immaterial, and so die not; these are made by Christ, by whom all things are made, <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> and so he must be greater and more excellent than they; for which purpose the passage is quoted in <a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>. Some render it, "who maketh his angels as the winds"; to which they may be compared for their invisibility, they being not to be seen, no more than the wind, unless when they assume an external form; and for their penetration through bodies in a very surprising manner; see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/12-6.htm">Acts 12:6</a>, and for their great force and power, being mighty angels, and said to excel in strength, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>, and for their swiftness in obeying the divine commands; so the Targum, <p>"he maketh his messengers, or angels, swift as the wind.'' <p>His ministers a flaming fire; angels are ministers to God, stand before him, behold his face, wait for and listen to his orders, and execute them; they are ministers to Christ, they were so at his incarnation, in his infancy, when in the wilderness and in the garden, at his resurrection and ascension, and will attend him at his second coming; and these are ministers to his people, take the care of them, encamp about them, do many good offices to them in life, and at death carry their souls to Abraham's bosom: these are made a flaming fire, or "as" flaming fire, for their force and power; so the Targum, <p>"his ministers strong as flaming fire;'' <p>and for their swiftness as before; and because of their burning love to God, Christ, and his people, and their flaming zeal for his cause and interest; hence thought by some to be called "seraphim": and because they are sometimes the executioners of God's wrath; and have sometimes appeared in fiery forms, as in forms of horses of fire and chariots of fire, and will descend with Christ in flaming fire at the last day; see <a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>. Some invert the words, both reading and sense, thus, "who maketh the winds his angels, or messengers, and flaming fire his ministers"; so Jarchi, Aben Ezra, and Kimchi; we read of stormy wind fulfilling his word, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>, he sends out his winds at his pleasure to do his errands; as to dry up the waters of the flood, to drive back the waters of the Red sea, and make dry land, to bring quails from thence, and scatter them about the camp of Israel, and in many other instances. So flaming fire was used as his ministers in burning Sodom and Gomorrah; and multitudes of the murmuring Israelites, and the captains with their fifties; but this sense is contrary to the order of the words, and the design of them, and to the apostle's sense of them, <a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a> which is confirmed by the Targum, Septuagint, and all the Oriental versions. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</span><p>(b) As the prophet here shows that all visible powers are ready to serve God: so in He 1:7 the angels also, are obedient to his commandment.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/104.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. The A.V. follows the LXX, which is quoted in <a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>, with the change of <span class="ital">a flaming fire</span> into <span class="ital">a flame of fire</span>. The Greek like the Hebrew is ambiguous, for the word for <span class="ital">angels</span> may mean simply <span class="ital">messengers</span>, and that for <span class="ital">spirits</span> may mean simply <span class="ital">winds</span>. But it is clear that the spiritual nature of angels is not in question here, and that the right rendering is <span class="ital">winds</span>. The construction of the whole verse has however been the subject of much discussion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) If the construction of the A.V. and LXX is retained, and it is the most natural construction of the Heb. words, we may render,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Who maketh his angels winds,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>His ministers a flaming fire,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and the meaning will be that as Jehovah reveals Himself in the works of creation, so He arrays the spiritual agents and ministers who surround Him (<a href="/context/psalms/103-20.htm" title="Bless the LORD, you his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word....">Psalm 103:20-21</a>) with the form of physical phenomena, the wind and the lightning. “Where men at first see only material objects and forms of nature there God is present, fulfilling His will through His servants under the forms of elemental action” (Bp Westcott on <a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>). The Targ., adopting the same construction, paraphrases, “Who makes his messengers swift as winds, his ministers strong as fire,” but this explanation misses the connexion with the preceding verses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) Most commentators however think that the context demands the rendering,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Who maketh winds his messengers,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Flaming fire his ministers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As the clouds are Jehovah’s chariot, so winds and lightnings are His messengers and servants. The great forces of Nature are His agents, employed by Him to do His bidding. Cp. <a href="/psalms/148-8.htm" title="Fire, and hail; snow, and vapors; stormy wind fulfilling his word:">Psalm 148:8</a>. But this rendering is not free from objection on grammatical grounds. The order of the words is decidedly against it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) A third possible rendering is,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Who maketh his messengers of winds,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>His ministers of flaming fire.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jehovah forms His messengers and ministers out of winds and lightnings; He uses these natural agents for the execution of His purposes. This rendering expresses the same sense as (2), though somewhat less directly, and is free from its grammatical difficulty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first rendering however deserves more consideration than it has generally received. It is the most natural rendering, and its connexion with the context, if less obvious than that of (2) and (3), is still real. The general purport of these verses is not to shew “how the various natural agents are appropriated to different uses by the Creator,” but how the Creator is revealed in and through the works of Creation. And as Jehovah is represented in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/psalms/104-20.htm" title="You make darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth....">Psalm 104:20-21</a></span> of Psalms 103, which is so closely related to this Ps., as environed by hosts of angels and ministers, it is suitable to shew here how these angels and ministers find expression in physical phenomena.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the grammatical question see Driver’s <span class="ital">Hebrew Tenses</span>, § 195, <span class="ital">Obs</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who maketh his angels</span> <span class="cmt_word">spirits.</span> Professor Cheyne renders, "Who maketh his messengers of winds;" and so (in substance) Jarchi, Aben.

The difficulty in adopting this rendering is that furnished by the application of the passage in <a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>; but the arguments of Hengstenberg go far to meet that difficulty.

With this thought the poet draws on to the close of his song of praise. The heavens in opposition to the earth, as in <a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>, is the unchangeable realm above the rise and fall of things here below.

In connection with the heavens of glory the poet cannot but call to mind the angels. His call to these to join in the praise of Jahve has its parallel only in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1-11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/148-1.htm">Psalm 148:1-14</a>. It arises from the consciousness of the church on earth that it stands in living like-minded fellowship with the angels of God, and that it possesses a dignity which rises above all created things, even the angels which are appointed to serve it (<a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>). They are called &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-11.htm">Joel 3:11</a>, and in fact &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, as the strong to whom belongs strength unequalled. Their life endowed with heroic strength is spent entirely - an example for mortals - in an obedient execution of the word of God. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is a definition not of the purpose, but of the manner: obediendo (as in <a href="/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a> perficiendo). Hearing the call of His word, they also forthwith put it into execution. the hosts (&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;), as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; shows, are the celestial spirits gathered around the angels of a higher rank (cf. <a href="/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13</a>), the innumerable &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>), for there is a hierarchia caelestis. From the archangels the poet comes to the myriads of the heavenly hosts, and from these to all creatures, that they, wheresoever they may be throughout Jahve's wide domain, may join in the song of praise that is to be struck up; and from this point he comes back to his own soul, which he modestly includes among the creatures mentioned in the third passage. A threefold &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; now corresponds to the threefold &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;; and inasmuch as the poet thus comes back to his own soul, his Psalm also turns back into itself and assumes the form of a converging circle. </body></html>
