And see how those are like to the wild beasts, who wait for the twilight, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness. Does God listen to the language of mere nature, even in ravenous creatures, and shall he not much more interpret favourably the language of grace in his own people, though weak and broken groanings which cannot be uttered? There is the work of every day, which is to be done in its day, which man must apply to every morning, and which he must continue in till evening; it will be time enough to rest when the night comes, in which no man can work. The psalmist wonders at the works of God. The works of art, the more closely they are looked upon, the more rough they appear; the works of nature appear more fine and exact. They are all made in wisdom, for they all answer the end they were designed to serve. Every spring is an emblem of the resurrection, when a new world rises, as it were, out of the ruins of the old one. But man alone lives beyond death. When the Lord takes away his breath, his soul enters on another state, and his body will be raised, either to glory or to misery. May the Lord send forth his Spirit, and new-create our souls to holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/104.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These wait all upon thee - That is, These are all dependent on thee. It does not, of course, mean that they "wait" in the sense that they are conscious of their dependence on God, but that they are "actually" dependent. The original word implies the idea of "expecting" or "hoping," and is so rendered in the Septuagint and Vulgate. They have no other ground of expectation or hope but in thee.<p>That thou mayest give them their meat in due season - Their food at the proper time. That is, They are constantly dependent on thee, that thou mayest give them food from day to day. Perhaps there is also the idea that they do not lay up or hoard anything; or that they cannot anticipate their own needs, but must receive from one day to another all that they want directly from God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/104.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-30. The entire dependence of this immense family on God is set forth. With Him, to kill or make alive is equally easy. To hide His face is to withdraw favor (Ps 13:1).

The moon is mentioned first of all, because the poet wishes to make the picture of the day follow that of the night. He describes it in <a href="/psalms/104-19.htm">Psalm 104:19</a> as the calendarial principal star. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; are points and divisions of time (epochs), and the principal measurer of these for civil and ecclesiastical life is the moon (cf. Sir. 43:7, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;), just as the sun, knowing when he is to set, is the infallible measurer of the day. In <a href="/psalms/104-20.htm">Psalm 104:20</a> the description, which throughout is drawn in the presence of God in His honour, passes over into direct address: jussives (&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;) stand in the hypothetical protasis and in its apodosis (EW. 357, b). It depends upon God's willing only, and it is night, and the wakeful life of the wild beasts begins to be astir. The young lions then roar after their prey, and flagitaturi sunt a Deo cibum suum. The infinitive with Lamed is an elliptical expression of a conjugatio periphrastica (vid., on <a href="/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a>), and becomes a varying expression of the future in general in the later language in approximation to the Aramaic. The roar of the lions and their going forth in quest of prey is an asking of God which He Himself has implanted in their nature. With the rising of the sun the aspect of things becomes very different. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; is feminine here, where the poet drops the personification (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-14</a>).
