And see how those are like to the wild beasts, who wait for the twilight, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness. Does God listen to the language of mere nature, even in ravenous creatures, and shall he not much more interpret favourably the language of grace in his own people, though weak and broken groanings which cannot be uttered? There is the work of every day, which is to be done in its day, which man must apply to every morning, and which he must continue in till evening; it will be time enough to rest when the night comes, in which no man can work. The psalmist wonders at the works of God. The works of art, the more closely they are looked upon, the more rough they appear; the works of nature appear more fine and exact. They are all made in wisdom, for they all answer the end they were designed to serve. Every spring is an emblem of the resurrection, when a new world rises, as it were, out of the ruins of the old one. But man alone lives beyond death. When the Lord takes away his breath, his soul enters on another state, and his body will be raised, either to glory or to misery.

From place to place, from one end of the world to the other, for the sake of merchandise (r); this is one of the four things that were too wonderful for Solomon, "the way of a ship in the midst of the sea", <a href="/proverbs/30-19.htm">Proverbs 30:19</a> though navigation was improved in his times indeed not so much as it is now. The original of ships was doubtless Noah's ark, so that they owe their first draught to God himself. They seem to be an emblem of the church and people of God passing through the sea of this world to the haven of eternal rest. The ship is but a small vessel, and takes up but a small room in comparison of the vast ocean on which it is; and so the church of Christ is but small, a little city, and few men in it, a little flock, a small remnant: a ship is unfixed and unsettled, sometimes here and sometimes there; so the church of Christ is sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another; nor is this world the rest of God's people, nor have they any continuing city here; for, as a ship is tossed with tempests, so are they with the waves of afflictions, the temptations of Satan, and the persecutions of men; and sometimes, like Paul, and the mariners with him, have no sight of sun and stars for many days, of the sun of righteousness, or of the stars, the ministers of the word; when sailing is dangerous it bodes perilous times, through the impure lives of professors, and impious doctrines of false teachers, whereby many suffer shipwreck; yet all the Lord's people get safe ashore, having a good pilot, Christ, to conduct them; and the good anchor of hope, sure and steadfast. <p>There is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein; the Targum adds, <p>"for the righteous at the feast of the house of his habitation.'' <p>Of this creature there is an account in <a href="/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a>. Some take it to be the crocodile, which is both a sea and river fish; the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Ethiopic, and Arabic versions, and so Apollinarius, call it the dragon; it is more generally thought to be the whale; Aben Ezra says it is the name of every great fish; it is a sportive creature, tumbles about in the great sea, and plays with the waters of it, which it tosses up in great quantities; and with the fishes of the sea, which it devours at pleasure; and laughs at the shaking of the spear; and to which mariners throw out their empty casks to play with, when near them, and they in danger by it; see <a href="/job/41-5.htm">Job 41:5</a>. This creature is generally reckoned by the ancients a figure of Satan, it being king over all the children of pride, <a href="/job/41-34.htm">Job 41:34</a> as he is the prince of the power of the air, and god of this world; who has been playing his tricks in it from the beginning of it, not only deceiving our first parents, but all the nations of the world; nor are saints ignorant of his devices. It sometimes describes a tyrannical prince, as the kings of Babylon and of Egypt, <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a> and is a true picture of antichrist, the beast which rose out of the sea; nor is there any like him on earth; see <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>. <p>(r) So Homer calls ships , Iliad. 3. v. 46. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/104.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. The stately ships, which excited the wonder and admiration of the landsman (<a href="/proverbs/30-19.htm" title="The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent on a rock; the way of a ship in the middle of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.">Proverbs 30:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-16.htm" title="And on all the ships of Tarshish, and on all pleasant pictures.">Isaiah 2:16</a>), seem part of the life of the sea, and the mention of them suggests its use as a means of transit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>there is <span class="ital">that leviathan</span>] There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed, either (1) to play therein, or (2) to play with him. Both renderings are grammatically possible. For (1) <a href="/job/40-20.htm" title="Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.">Job 40:20</a> offers a parallel, and for (2) <a href="/job/41-5.htm" title="Will you play with him as with a bird? or will you bind him for your maidens?">Job 41:5</a> (Heb. 40:29). But (1) suits the context best. The thought required is not that the wildest and strongest of God’s creatures are but as it were His tame pets, but that the sea is the playground of the mighty monsters which display His power and goodness as they disport themselves there in the enjoyment of their life. In Job 41 <span class="ital">leviathan</span> means the crocodile, but here the name is evidently used of sea-monsters generally, particularly the great cetaceans, of which there are many, and formerly were probably many more, in the Mediterranean.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There go the ships.</span> These may seem out of place among the works of God.

The moon is mentioned first of all, because the poet wishes to make the picture of the day follow that of the night. He describes it in <a href="/psalms/104-19.htm">Psalm 104:19</a> as the calendarial principal star. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; are points and divisions of time (epochs), and the principal measurer of these for civil and ecclesiastical life is the moon (cf. Sir. 43:7, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;), just as the sun, knowing when he is to set, is the infallible measurer of the day. In <a href="/psalms/104-20.htm">Psalm 104:20</a> the description, which throughout is drawn in the presence of God in His honour, passes over into direct address: jussives (&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;) stand in the hypothetical protasis and in its apodosis (EW. 357, b). It depends upon God's willing only, and it is night, and the wakeful life of the wild beasts begins to be astir. The young lions then roar after their prey, and flagitaturi sunt a Deo cibum suum. The infinitive with Lamed is an elliptical expression of a conjugatio periphrastica (vid., on <a href="/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a>), and becomes a varying expression of the future in general in the later language in approximation to the Aramaic. The roar of the lions and their going forth in quest of prey is an asking of God which He Himself has implanted in their nature. With the rising of the sun the aspect of things becomes very different. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; is feminine here, where the poet drops the personification (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-14</a>). The day which dawns with sunrise is the time for man. Both as to matter and style, <a href="/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a> call to mind <a href="/job/24-5.htm">Job 24:5</a>; <a href="/job/37-8.htm">Job 37:8</a>; <a href="/job/38-40.htm">Job 38:40</a>. </body></html>
