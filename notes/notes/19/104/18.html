The idea is, that nature is full of life. Even the most inaccessible places - the rocks - the high hills - have their inhabitants. Where man cannot climb or dwell, there are abodes of animals which God has made to dwell there, and which find there a refuge - a shelter - a home. On the word used here, and rendered "wild goats," see the notes at <a href="/job/39-1.htm">Job 39:1</a>.

Who have their name in Hebrew (d) from their climbing and ascending them. What we commonly call "a wild goose chase" should be expressed "a wild goat's chase"; for not geese, but goats, are chased; and when they are, they flee to the hills for refuge. Hence they are sometimes called the wild goats of the rocks, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-1.htm">Job 39:1</a>, and sometimes the rocks are called from them the rocks of wild goats, <a href="/1_samuel/24-2.htm">1 Samuel 24:2</a>. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions, render it "for the harts", or deer; and so Apollinarius: but the word is not used of them. <p>And the rocks for the conies; who being a feeble folk, make their houses in them, to protect them from creatures of superior power and strength, <a href="/proverbs/30-26.htm">Proverbs 30:26</a>. Some interpret it of the "hedgehog", as the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions: others of "hares", as the Syriac and Arabic, and so Apollinarius; and others of "mountain mice". Now what the hills and rocks are to the above creatures, a refuge and a habitation for them, that Christ is to those that fly to him for refuge; though weak and feeble, sinful and unworthy, he is their rock, the rock of their refuge, their strong tower, and place of defence. <p>(d) ab Buxtorf.

God, the blessed One, being the principal subject of the Psalm, the poet (in <a href="/psalms/104-10.htm">Psalm 104:10</a> and further on) is able to go on in attributive and predicative participles: Who sendeth springs &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, into the wads (not: &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, as brooks). &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, as <a href="/psalms/104-10.htm">Psalm 104:10</a> shows, is here a synonym of &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1492;, and there is no need for saying that, flowing on in the plains, they grow into rivers. The lxx has &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. &#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; is doubly poetic for &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;. God has also provided for all the beasts that roam far from men; and the wild ass, swift as an arrow, difficult to be hunted, and living in troops (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, Arabic fera&#770;, root &#1508;&#1512;, Arab. fr, to move quickly, to whiz, to flee; the wild ass, the onager, Arabic himr el-wahs, whose home is on the steppes), is made prominent by way of example. The phrase "to break the thirst" occurs only here. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-12.htm">Psalm 104:12</a>, refers to the &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which are also still the subject in <a href="/psalms/104-11.htm">Psalm 104:11</a>. The pointing &#1506;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; needlessly creates a hybrid form in addition to &#1506;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (like &#1500;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;) and &#1506;&#1508;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;. From the tangled branches by the springs the poet insensibly reaches the second half of the third day. The vegetable kingdom at the same time reminds him of the rain which, descending out of the upper chambers of the heavens, waters the waterless mountain-tops. Like the Talmud (B. Ta&#8219;an&#305;&#770;th, 10a), by the "fruit of Thy work" (&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; as singular) Hitzig understands the rain; but rain is rather that which fertilizes; and why might not the fruit be meant which God's works (&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498;, plural) here below (<a href="/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>), viz., the vegetable creations, bear, and from which the earth, i.e., its population, is satisfied, inasmuch as vegetable food springs up as much for the beasts as for man? In connection with &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489; the poet is thinking of cultivated plants, more especially wheat; &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;, however, does not signify: for cultivation by man, since, according to Hitzig's correct remonstrance, they do not say &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;, and &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; has not man, but rather God, as its subject, but as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-30.htm">1 Chronicles 26:30</a>, for the service (use) of man. </body></html>
