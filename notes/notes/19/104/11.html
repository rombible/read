The suffix, referring back to &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, is intended to say that the earth hanging free in space (<a href="/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a>) has its internal supports. Its eternal stability is preserved even amidst the judgment predicted in <a href="/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>., since it comes forth out of it, unremoved from its former station, as a transformed, glorified earth. The deep (&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;) with which God covers it is that primordial mass of water in which it lay first of all as it were in embryo, for it came into being &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; does not refer to &#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; (masc. as in <a href="/job/28-14.htm">Job 28:14</a>), because then &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; would be required, but to &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, and the masculine is to be explained either by attraction) according to the model of <a href="/1_samuel/2-4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4</a>), or by a reversion to the masculine ground-form as the discourse proceeds (cf. the same thing with &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-13.htm">2 Samuel 17:13</a>, &#1510;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/11-6.htm">Exodus 11:6</a>, &#1497;&#1491; <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6</a>, the earth thus overflowed with water was already mountainous; the primal formation of the mountains is therefore just as old as the &#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; mentioned in direct succession to the &#1514;&#1492;&#1493; &#1493;&#1489;&#1492;&#1493;. After this, <a href="/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a> describe the subduing of the primordial waters by raising up the dry land and the confining of these waters in basins surrounded by banks. Terrified by the despotic command of God, they started asunder, and mountains rose aloft, the dry land with its heights and its low grounds appeared. The rendering that the waters, thrown into wild excitement, rose up the mountains and descended again (Hengstenberg), does not harmonize with the fact that they are represented in <a href="/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6</a> as standing above the mountains. Accordingly, too, it is not to be interpreted after <a href="/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a> : they (the waters) rose mountain-high, they sunk down like valleys. The reference of the description to the coming forth of the dry land on the third day of creation requires that &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; should be taken as subject to &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;. But then, too, the &#1489;&#1511;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; are the subject to &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, as Hilary of Poictiers renders it in his Genesis, 5:97, etc.: subsidunt valles, and not the waters as subsiding into the valleys. Hupfeld is correct; <a href="/psalms/104-8.htm">Psalm 104:8</a> is a parenthesis which affirms that, inasmuch as the waters retreating laid the solid land bare, mountains and valleys as such came forth visibly; cf. Ovid, Metam. i.:344: Flumina subsidunt, montes exire videntur. </body></html>
