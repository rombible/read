The psalmist is “describing the motion of the waters in mountains and valleys, when, at God’s command, they filed off from the surface of the earth, into the posts assigned them.” Some interpret the psalmist’s meaning to be, that, in that first division of the waters from the earth, part went upward and became springs in the mountains, but the greatest part went downward to the channels made for them. Thus Dr. Waterland: <span class="ital">They climb the mountains; they fall down on the valleys. </span>The Hebrew, however, may be rendered, (as it is by some, both ancient and later interpreters,) <span class="ital">The mountains ascended; the valleys descended; </span>that is, when the waters were separated, part of the earth appeared to be high, and formed the mountains, and a part to be low, and constituted the valleys or low grounds. So Bishop Patrick: “Immediately the dry land was seen, part of which rose up in lofty hills; and the rest sunk down in lowly valleys, where thou hast cut channels for the waters to run into the main ocean, the place thou hast appointed for them.” But the former sense seems most agreeable to the context, because he speaks of the waters both in the foregoing and following verses. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/104.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>104:1-9 Every object we behold calls on us to bless and praise the Lord, who is great.

The Targum is, <p>"they ascend out of the deep to the mountains;'' <p>that is, the waters, when they went off the earth at the divine orders, steered their course up the mountains, and then went down by the valleys to the place appointed for them; they went over hills and dales, nothing could stop them or retard their course till they came to their proper place; which is another instance of the almighty power of the Son of God. Some render the words, "the mountains ascended, the valleys descended (m)"; and then the meaning is, when the depth of waters were called off the earth, the mountains and valleys appeared, the one seemed to rise up and the other to go down; but the former reading seems best, and emblematically describes the state of God's people in this world, in their passage to their appointed place; who have sometimes mountains of difficulties to go over, and which seem insuperable, and yet they surmount them; sometimes they are upon the mount of heaven by contemplation, and have their hearts and affections above; they mount up with wings as eagles; sometimes they are upon the mount of communion with God, and by his favour their mount stands strong, and they think they shall never be moved; at other times they are down in the valleys, in a low estate and condition; in low frames of soul, in a low exercise of grace, and in the valley of the shadow of death, of afflictive providences in soul or body: and as the waters, thus steering their course under a divine direction, and by an almighty power, at length came unto the place which, the psalmist says, thou hast founded for them, meaning the seas; which the Lord founded and prepared for the reception of them; and which collection of waters in one place he called by that name, <a href="/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>.

For inasmuch as God began the work of creation with the creation of light, He has covered Himself with this created light itself as with a garment. That which once happened in connection with the creation may, as in <a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>, and frequently, be expressed by participles of the present, because the original setting is continued in the preservation of the world; and determinate participles alternate with participles without the article, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24-28</a>, with no other difference than that the former are more predicative and the latter more attributive. With <a href="/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a> the poet comes upon the work of the second day: the creation of the expanse (&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506;) which divides between the waters. God has spread this out (cf. <a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>) like a tent-cloth (<a href="/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>), of such light and of such fine transparent work; &#1504;&#1493;&#1496;&#1492; here rhymes with &#1506;&#1496;&#1492;. In those waters which the "expanse" holds aloft over the earth God lays the beams of His upper chambers (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514;&#1493;, instead of which we find &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>, from &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, ascent, elevation, then an upper story, an upper chamber, which would be more accurately &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; after the Aramaic and Arabic); but not as though the waters were the material for them, they are only the place for them, that is exalted above the earth, and are able to be this because to the Immaterial One even that which is fluid is solid, and that which is dense is transparent. The reservoirs of the upper waters, the clouds, God makes, as the lightning, thunder, and rain indicate, into His chariot (&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;), upon which he rides along in order to make His power felt below upon the earth judicially (<a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>), or in rescuing and blessing men. &#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; (only here) accords in sound with &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, <a href="/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>. For <a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a> also recalls this primary passage, where the wings of the wind take the place of the cloud-chariot. In <a href="/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a> the lxx (<a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>) makes the first substantive into an accusative of the object, and the second into an accusative of the predicate: &#x39f;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;. It is usually translated the reverse say: making the winds into His angels, etc. This rendering is possible so far as the language is concerned (cf. <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a> Chethb, and on the position of the worlds, <a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a> with <a href="/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>), and the plural &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; is explicable in connection with this rendering from the force of the parallelism, and the singular &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; from the fact that this word has no plural. Since, however, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; with two accusatives usually signifies to produce something out of something, so that the second accusative (viz., the accusative of the predicate, which is logically the second, but according to the position of the words may just as well be the first, <a href="/exodus/25-39.htm">Exodus 25:39</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-25.htm">Exodus 30:25</a>, as the second, <a href="/exodus/37-23.htm">Exodus 37:23</a>; <a href="/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-18.htm">2 Chronicles 4:18-22</a>) denotes the materia ex qua, it may with equal right at least be interpreted: Who makes His messengers out of the winds, His servants out of the flaming or consuming (vid., on <a href="/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>) fire (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>, masc.). And this may affirm either that God makes use of wind and fire for special missions (cf. <a href="/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>), or (cf. Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, i. 325f.) that He gives wind and fire to His angels for the purpose of His operations in the world which are effected through their agency, as the materials of their outward manifestation, and as it were of their self-embodiment, <p>(Note: It is a Talmudic view that God really makes the angels out of fire, B. Chagiga, 14a (cf. Koran, xxxviii. 77): Day by day are the angels of the service created out of the stream of fire (&#1504;&#1492;&#1512; &#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;), and sing their song of praise and perish.)<p>as then in <a href="/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a> wind and cherub are both to be associated together in thought as the vehicle of the divine activity in the world, and in <a href="/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a> the angel of Jahve represents the energy of the wind. </body></html>
