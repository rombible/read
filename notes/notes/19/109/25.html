He was troubled in mind. His body was wasted, and almost worn away. But it is better to have leanness in the body, while the soul prospers and is in health, than to have leanness in the soul, while the body is feasted. He was ridiculed and reproached by his enemies. But if God bless us, we need not care who curses us; for how can they curse whom God has not cursed; nay, whom he has blessed? He pleads God's glory, and the honour of his name. Save me, not according to my merit, for I pretend to none, but according to thy-mercy. He concludes with the joy of faith, in assurance that his present conflicts would end in triumphs. Let all that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him. Jesus, unjustly put to death, and now risen again, is an Advocate and Intercessor for his people, ever ready to appear on their behalf against a corrupt world, and the great accuser.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/109.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I became also a reproach unto them - They reproached or reviled me as a bad man.

The verb, and more especially in Niph., is proved to be Hebrew by <a href="/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>. Such an one who without anything else is of a terrified heart, inasmuch as he has been made to feel the wrath of God most keenly, this man has persecuted with a deadly hatred. He had experienced kindness (&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;) in a high degree, but he blotted out of his memory that which he had experienced, not for an instant imagining that he too on his part had to exercise &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;. The Poel &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514; instead of &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; points to the agonizing death (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/28-10.htm">Ezekiel 28:10</a> &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;) to which he exposes God's anointed. The fate of the shedder of blood is not expressed after the manner of a wish in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-16.htm">Psalm 109:16-18</a>, but in the historical form, as being the result that followed of inward necessity from the matter of fact of the course which he had himself determined upon. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; seq. acc. signifies to surprise, suddenly attack any one, as in <a href="/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>. The three figures in <a href="/psalms/109-18.htm">Psalm 109:18</a> are climactic: he has clothed himself in cursing, he has drunk it in like water (<a href="/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>; <a href="/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7</a>), it has penetrated even to the marrow of his bones, like the oily preparations which are rubbed in and penetrate to the bones.n In <a href="/psalms/109-19.htm">Psalm 109:19</a> the emphasis rests upon &#1497;&#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; and upon &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;. The summarizing <a href="/psalms/109-20.htm">Psalm 109:20</a> is the close of a strophe. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, an earned reward, here punishment incurred, is especially frequent in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>, e.g., <a href="/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a>; it also occurs once even in the Tra, <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>. Those who answer the loving acts of the righteous with such malevolence in word and in deed commit a satanic sin for which there is no forgiveness. The curse is the fruit of their own choice and deed.
