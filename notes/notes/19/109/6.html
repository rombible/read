The wish expressed is that the persons indicated may fall into the hands of an unscrupulous judge. If, however, we are to think of the divine judgment, then this clause must be taken as exactly parallel to the next: “Appoint a wicked man against him.” Here the imprecatory part of the psalm begins, and it has been ingeniously argued that the whole of it (<a href="/context/psalms/109-6.htm" title="Set you a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.">Psalm 109:6-20</a>) is a quotation, giving, not the psalmist’s curse on his foes, but theirs on <span class= "ital">him. </span>Such quotations, without any introductory words, are common, and the theory is tenable, but improbable.<p><span class= "bld">Satan.</span>—By no means here a proper name, though the LXX. and Vulg. have <span class= "ital">diabolus. </span>The use of the same word in <a href="/psalms/109-4.htm" title="For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself to prayer.">Psalm 109:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-20.htm" title="Let this be the reward of my adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.">Psalm 109:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-29.htm" title="Let my adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.">Psalm 109:29</a> is decisive on giving it the general meaning, “adversary” (as in margin) here; even though without the article.

If David spoke thus in reference to Doeg or Ahithophel, (see the contents,) it was only as they were types of Judas: at least the Holy Ghost intended it of Judas, and the persecutors of our Lord, as we learn <a href="/acts/1-20.htm" title="For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his position as bishop let another take.">Acts 1:20</a>, of whom this whole paragraph, to the end of <a href="/psalms/109-19.htm" title="Let it be to him as the garment which covers him, and for a girdle with which he is girded continually.">Psalm 109:19</a>, is a prophecy.

Such is the wretched state of the Jews, estranged from God, and in bondage to the devil; such the prayers which, from hardened and malignant hearts, they continually utter for the excision of all Christians, and for the extirpation of that blessed name on which Christians call.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/109.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>109:6-20 The Lord Jesus may speak here as a Judge, denouncing sentence on some of his enemies, to warn others. When men reject the salvation of Christ, even their prayers are numbered among their sins. See what hurries some to shameful deaths, and brings the families and estates of others to ruin; makes them and theirs despicable and hateful, and brings poverty, shame, and misery upon their posterity: it is sin, that mischievous, destructive thing. And what will be the effect of the sentence, Go, ye cursed, upon the bodies and souls of the wicked! How it will affect the senses of the body, and the powers of the soul, with pain, anguish, horror, and despair! Think on these things, sinners, tremble and repent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/109.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Set thou a wicked man over him - This commences the imprecatory part of the psalm, extending to <a href="/psalms/109-20.htm">Psalm 109:20</a>. The first thing that the psalmist asks is, that his foe might be subjected to the evil of having a man placed over him like himself: a man regardless of justice, truth, and right; a man who would respect character and propriety no more than he had himself done. It is, in fact, a prayer that he might be punished "in the line of his offences." It cannot be wrong that a man should be treated as he treats others; and it cannot be in itself wrong to desire that a man should be treated according to his character and deserts, for this is the object of all law, and this is what all magistrates and legislators are endeavoring to secure.<p>And let Satan stand at his right hand - As his counselor and adviser. The language would be properly applicable to one who had been a counselor or adviser to a king in the administration of the government; and the prayer is, that he might know what it was to have such a one as his counselor and adviser. The language used would seem to make it not improbable that David here refers particularly to someone who had occupied this position in reference to himself, and who had betrayed his trust; who had given him crafty and malignant counsel; who had led him into bad measures; who had used his position to promote his own interests at the expense of his master's. David had such counselors, as anyone in authority may have. The prayer, then, would be, that such a man might be punished in his own line; that he might know what it was to have a bad and wicked adviser. The word rendered "Satan" - &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1503;  s&#769;a&#770;t&#803;a&#770;n - is in the margin rendered "adversary." In the Septuagint it is &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  diabolos; in the Vulgate, "diabolus." See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>, for its meaning. The prayer here seems not to be that the devil or Satan might stand near him as his counselor; but that a man - a real adversary - an accuser - one with a malignant heart - one who would make use of his position to accomplish his own purposes, and to betray the interests of his master, might give him counsel, as seems to have been done in the case of David. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/109.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. over him&#8212;one of his enemies prominent in malignity (Ps 55:12).<p>let Satan stand&#8212;as an accuser, whose place was the right hand of the accused (Zec 3:1, 2).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/109.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>6 Set thou a wicked man over him; and let Satan stand at his fight hand.<p>7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned; and let his prayer become sin.<p>8 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.<p>9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.<p>10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.<p>11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.<p>12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him; neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.<p>13 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.<p>14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.<p>15 Let them be before the Lord continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.<p>16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.<p>17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.<p>18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.<p>19 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/109.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A wicked man, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">the wicked</span>; which may be understood either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

It is no doubt true to say, with Tholuck, that "no passion is discernible in the imprecations, dreadful as they are." Clearly the writer is not moved by personal feelings of hostility, but by a spirit of justice, and an intense abhorrence of sin. He delivers a calm judicial sentence. Still, the spirit of Christian love must ever shrink from such utterances, which belong to an earlier and less perfect dispensation (comp. <a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51-56</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set thou a wicked man over him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> judge him (see ver. 7).
