Instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which one might have expected, the expression used here is &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; without any interchange of the mode of writing and of reading it; many printed copies have &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493; here also; Baer, following Norzi, correctly has &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;.
