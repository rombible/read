The hatred of the wicked for the good is a plain fact of history, and quite indisputable. "Words of hatred" are less patent, since they are often restrained from prudential considerations. But sometimes free vent is given to them (see <a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And fought against me without a cause</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/35-7.htm">Psalm 35:7, 19</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-161.htm">Psalm 119:161</a>). Saul's hatred towards David was markedly of this character - un-provoked by either act or word from its object. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/108.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7-14</a> forms this second half. The clause expressing the purpose with &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, as in its original, has the following &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; for its principal clause upon which it depends. Instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which one might have expected, the expression used here is &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; without any interchange of the mode of writing and of reading it; many printed copies have &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493; here also; Baer, following Norzi, correctly has &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;. Instead of &#1493;&#1500;&#1497;...&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>, we here read &#1500;&#1497;...&#1500;&#1497;, which is less soaring. And instead of Cry aloud concerning me, O Philistia do I shout for joy (the triumphant cry of the victor); in accordance with which Hupfeld wishes to take &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497; in the former as infinitive: "over (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;) Philistia is my shouting for joy" (&#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497; instead of &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497;, since the infinitive does not admit of this pausal form of the imperative). For &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512; we have here the more usual form of expression &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;. <a href="/psalms/108-12.htm">Psalm 108:12</a> is weakened by the omission of the &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;). </body></html>
