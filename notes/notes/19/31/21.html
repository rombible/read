All comes to sinners through the wondrous gift of the only-begotten Son of God, to be the atonement for their sins. Let not any yield to unbelief, or think, under discouraging circumstances, that they are cut off from before the eyes of the Lord, and left to the pride of men. Lord, pardon our complaints and fears; increase our faith, patience, love, and gratitude; teach us to rejoice in tribulation and in hope.

It was not ordinary kindness, such as is shown to people every day; it was so uncommon - so far beyond all expectation - so separate from second causes and the agency of man - so marked in its character - as to fill the mind with wonder.<p>In a strong city - Margin, "fenced city." This may mean either that he had thus placed him literally in a strongly fortified city where he was safe from the fear of his enemies; or, that he had interposed in his behalf, and had given him protection as if he had brought him into such a strongly fortified place. Jarchi supposes that the city of "Keilah" <a href="/1_samuel/23-7.htm">1 Samuel 23:7</a> is here intended. But this is improbable. All that the passage necessarily implies is, that God had given him protection as if he had been placed in a strongly fortified town where he would be safe from danger. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. the secret of thy presence&#8212;or, covering of Thy countenance; the protection He thus affords; compare Ps 27:5 for a similar figure; "dwelling" used there for "presence" here.

Or the city of Jerusalem, which was fortified both by nature and art, whither he was brought and placed as king, and enjoyed rest from all his enemies round about him, <a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>. Or this may spiritually design the church of God, which is called a strong city, being built on Christ the Rock, and having salvation for walls and bulwarks, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>, where the Lord displays his banner of love, makes discoveries of his marvellous kindness, and commands his blessing for evermore. Some render it "as in a strong city" (g), and take the sense to be, that he was safe, through the kindness of God showed to him in the salvation of him, as if he was in a fortified city (h), and this was marvellous in his eyes, as every instance of providential goodness is to the people of God; especially his lovingkindness showed in spiritual things, in choosing them in Christ, saving them by him, regenerating them by his Spirit, and taking them into his family; which love is free and sovereign, distinguishing, unchangeable, from everlasting to everlasting; and so wonderful and astonishing; and which was hid in God until revealed; and sometimes the manifestations of it are withdrawn, and then it is showed again, and fresh discoveries of it are made, and effects of it applied, and the blessings of it bestowed, which occasion thankfulness. <p>(g)  "ut in civitate munita", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; Michaelis.

By &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; prominence is given to the subject by way of contrast, as in <a href="/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>. It appears as though Jahve had given him up in His anger; but he confides in Him, and in spite of this appearance, he even confides in Him with the prayer of appropriating faith. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-30.htm">1 Chronicles 29:30</a>) are the appointed events and circumstances, the vicissitudes of human life; like the Arabic 'ida&#770;t (like &#1506;&#1514; from &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;), the appointed rewards and punishments. The times, with whatsoever they bring with them, are in the Lord's hand, every lot is of His appointment or sending. The Vulgate follows the lxx, in manibus tuis sortes meae. The petitions of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-16.htm">Psalm 31:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-17.htm">Psalm 31:17</a>, spring from this consciousness that the almighty and faithful hand of God has mould his life. There are three petitions; the middle one is an echo of the Aaronitish blessing in <a href="/numbers/6-25.htm">Numbers 6:25</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, which gives the ground of his hope that he shall not be put to shame (cf. <a href="/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2</a>), is to be understood like &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>, according to Ges. 126, 3. The expression of the ground for &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, favours the explanation of it not so much as the language of petition (let me not be ashamed) of as hope. The futures which follow might be none the less regarded as optatives, but the order of the words does not require this. And we prefer to take them as expressing hope, so that the three petitions in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-16.htm">Psalm 31:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-17.htm">Psalm 31:17</a>, correspond to the three hopes in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-18.htm">Psalm 31:18</a>, <a href="/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>. He will not be ashamed, but the wicked shall be ashamed and silenced for ever. The form &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>, the plural of the fut. Kal &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, with the doubling of the first radical, which is customary in Aramaic (other examples of which we have in &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;, &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;), not of the fut.

It is only in accordance with the connection, that in this instance &#1504;&#1488;&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>, just like &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, denotes that which is forcibly laid upon them by the judicial intervention of God: all lying lips shall be dumb, i.e., made dumb. &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; prop. that which is unrestrained, free, insolent (cf. Arabic 'a&#770;tik, 'at&#305;&#770;k, unrestrained, free<p>(Note: But these Arabic words do not pass over into the signification "insolent."))<p>is the accusative of the object, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>, and as it is the nominative of the subject in <a href="/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>. </body></html>
