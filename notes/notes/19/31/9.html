Herein he was a type of Christ, who was acquainted with grief. David acknowledged that his afflictions were merited by his own sins, but Christ suffered for ours. David's friends durst not give him any assistance. Let us not think it strange if thus deserted, but make sure of a Friend in heaven who will not fail. God will be sure to order and dispose all for the best, to all those who commit their spirits also into his hand. The time of life is in God's hands, to lengthen or shorten, make bitter or sweet, according to the counsel of his will. The way of man is not in himself, nor in our friend's hands, nor in our enemies' hands, but in God's. In this faith and confidence he prays that the Lord would save him for his mercies's sake, and not for any merit of his own. He prophesies the silencing of those that reproach and speak evil of the people of God. There is a day coming, when the Lord will execute judgment upon them. In the mean time, we should engage ourselves by well-doing, if possible, to silence the ignorance of foolish men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble - The nature and sources of his trouble are specified in the verses following.

As a consequence of this, he says that he was subjected to the reproach of his enemies, and shunned by his neighbors and his acquaintances; that he was forgotten by them like a dead man out of mind; that he was exposed to the slander of others, and that they conspired against his life, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11-13</a>.

Now, the man of God comes to a particular and minute description of his sorrowful case. He unbosoms his heart, lays bare his wounds, and expresses his inward desolation. This first sentence pithily comprehends all that follows, it is the text for his lamenting discourse. Misery moves mercy - no more reasoning is needed. "Have mercy" is the prayer; the argument is as prevalent as it is plain and personal, "I am in trouble." "Mine eye is consumed with grief." Dim and sunken eyes are plain indicators of failing health. Tears draw their salt from our strength, and floods of them are very apt to consume the source from which they spring. God would have us tell him the symptoms of our disease, not for his information, but to show our sense of need. "Yea, my soul and my belly [or body]." Soul and body are so intimately united, that one cannot decline without the other feeling it. We, in these days, are not strangers to the double sinking which David describes; we have been faint with physical suffering, and distracted with mental distress: when two such seas meet, it is well for us that the Pilot at the helm is at home in the midst of the waterfloods, and makes storms to become the triumph of his art.<p><a href="/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a><p>"For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing." 'It had become his daily occupation to mourn; he spent all his days in the dungeon of distress. The sap and essence of his existence was being consumed, as a candle is wasted while it burns. His adversities were shortening his days, and digging for him an early grave. Grief is a sad market to spend all our wealth of life in, but a far more profitable trade may be driven there than in Vanity Fair; it is better to go to the house of mourning than the house of feasting. Black is good wear. The salt of tears is a healthy medicine. Better spend our years in sighing than in sinning. The two members of the sentence before us convey the same idea; but there are no idle words in Scripture, the reduplication is the fitting expression of fervency and importunity. "My strength faileth because of mine iniquity." David sees to the bottom of his sorrow, and detects sin lurking there. It is profitable trouble which leads us to trouble ourselves about our iniquity. Was this the Psalmist's foulest crime which now gnawed at his heart, and devoured his strength? Very probably it was so. Sinful morsels, though sweet in the mouth, turn out to be poison in the bowels: if we wantonly give a portion of our strength to sin, it will by-and-by take the remainder from us. We lose both physical, mental, moral, and spiritual rigour by iniquity. "And my bones are consumed." Weakness penetrated the innermost parts of his system, the firmest parts of his frame felt the general decrepitude. A man is in a piteous plight when he comes to this.<p><a href="/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a><p>"I was a reproach among all mine enemies." They were pleased to have something to throw at me: my mournful estate was music to them, because they maliciously interpreted it to be a judgment from heaven upon me. Reproach is little thought of by those who are not called to endure it, but he who passes under its lash knows how deep it wounds. The best of men may have the bitterest foes, and be subjected to the most cruel taunts. "But especially among my neighbours." Those who are nearest can stab the sharpest. We feel most the slights of those who should have shown us sympathy. Perhaps David's friends feared to be identified with his declining fortunes, and therefore turned against him in order to win the mercy if not the favour of his opponents. Self interest rules the most of men: ties the most sacred are soon snapped by its influence, and actions of the utmost meanness are perpetrated without scruple. "And a fear to mine acquaintance." The more intimate before, the more distant did they become. Our Lord was denied by Peter, betrayed by Judas, and forsaken by all in the hour of his utmost need. All the herd turn against a wounded deer. The milk of human kindness curdles when a despised believer is the victim of slanderous accusations. "They that did see me without fled from me." Afraid to be seen in the company of a man so thoroughly despised, those who once courted his society hastened from him as though he had been infected with the plague. How villainous a thing is slander which can thus make an eminent saint, once the admiration of his people, to become the general butt, the universal aversion of mankind! To what extremities of dishonour may innocence be reduced!<p><a href="/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a><p>"I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind." All David's youthful prowess was now gone from remembrance: he had been the saviour of his country, but his services were buried in oblivion. Men soon forget the deepest obligations; popularity is evanescent to the last degree: he who is in every one's mouth today may be forgotten by all tomorrow. A man had better be dead than be smothered in slander. Of the dead we say nothing but good, but in the Psalmist's case they said nothing but evil. We must not look for the reward of philanthropy this side of heaven, for men pay their best servants but sorry wages, and turn them out of doors when no more is to be got out of them. "I am like a broken vessel," a thing useless, done for, worthless, cast aside, forgotten. Sad condition for a king! Let us see herein the portrait of the King of kings in his humiliation, when he made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant.<p><a href="/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With grief; </span> with continual weeping. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/psalms/6-7.htm" title="My eye is consumed because of grief; it waxes old because of all my enemies.">Psalm 6:7</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My soul; </span> my sorrows are not counterfeit or slight, but inward and hearty; my mind is oppressed, my heart is ready to sink under my burden. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My belly, </span> i.e. my bowels contained in my belly; which are the seat of the affections, and fountains of support and nourishment to the whole body.

The psalmist follows up his prayer for mercy by an exposition of his need of mercy. He is in trouble, in sore trouble - "hard pressed," as Hengstenberg translates - distressed both in mind and body. <span class="cmt_word">Mine eye is consumed with grief</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>, where the expression is almost identical). The grief intended is "that produced by provocation or spiteful treatment" (Kay). It causes him to weep so much that his eye is well-nigh "consumed" or "eaten away." Yea, my soul and my belly. Some explain this as meaning simply "my soul and my body" (Hengstenberg, Alexander, Revised Version); but others regard the "belly" as denoting "the very centre of physical life and of the emotions" (comp. <a href="/job/32-19.htm">Job 32:19</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 31:2-9) The poet begins with the prayer for deliverance, based upon the trust which Jahve, to whom he surrenders himself, cannot possibly disappoint; and rejoices beforehand in the protection which he assumes will, without any doubt, be granted. Out of his confident security in God (&#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;) springs the prayer: may it never come to this with me, that I am put to confusion by the disappointment of my hope. This prayer in the form of intense desire is followed by prayers in the direct form of supplication. The supplicatory &#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497; is based upon God's righteousness, which cannot refrain from repaying conduct consistent with the order of redemption, though after prolonged trial, with the longed for tokens of deliverance. In the second paragraph, the prayer is moulded in accordance with the circumstances of him who is chased by Saul hither and thither among the mountains and in the desert, homeless and defenceless. In the expression &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494;, &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; is genit. appositionis: a rock of defence (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; from &#1506;&#1494;&#1494;, as in <a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>), or rather: of refuge (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494;  equals  Arab. m&#8219;a&#770;d, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, &#1506;&#1493;&#1494;  equals  Arab.

Moreover &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, Arab. 'a&#770;d, like &#1495;&#1505;&#1492;, of which it is the parallel word in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a>, means to hide one's self anywhere (Piel and Hiph., Hebrew &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1494;, according to the Kamus, Zamachshari and Neshwn: to hide any one, e.g., Koran 3:31); hence Arab. 'a&#770;&#8219;d, a plant that grows among bushes (be&#770;n esh-sho&#770;k according to the Kamus) or in the crevices of the rocks (fi-l-hazn according to Neshwn) and is thus inaccessible to the herds; Arab. 'wwad, gazelles that are invisible, i.e., keep hidden, for seven days after giving birth, also used of pieces of flesh of which part is hidden among the bones; Arab. 'u&#770;dat, an amulet with which a man covers himself (protegit), and so forth. - Wetzstein.<p>Consequently &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; (formed like Arab. m&#8219;a&#770;d, according to Neshwn equivalent to Arab. ma'wad) is prop. a place in which to hide one's self, synonymous with &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;, Arab. mla&#770;d, malja&#8219;, and the like. True, the two substantives from &#1506;&#1494;&#1494; and &#1506;&#1493;&#1494; meet in their meanings like praesidium and asylum, and according to passages like <a href="/jeremiah/16-19.htm">Jeremiah 16:19</a> appear to be blended in the genius of the language, but they are radically distinct.)<p>a rock-castle, i.e., a castle upon a rock, would be called &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, reversing the order of the words. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-3.htm">Psalm 71:3</a>, a rock of habitation, i.e., of safe sojourn, fully warrants this interpretation. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, prop. specula, signifies a mountain height or the summit of a mountain; a house on the mountain height is one that is situated on some high mountain top and affords a safe asylum (vid., on <a href="/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a>). The thought "show me Thy salvation, for Thou art my Saviour," underlies the connection expressed by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4</a> and <a href="/psalms/31-5.htm">Psalm 31:5</a>. Lster considers it to be illogical, but it is the logic of every believing prayer. The poet prays that God would become to him, actu reflexo, that which to the actus directus of his faith He is even now. The futures in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/31-5.htm">Psalm 31:5</a> express hopes which necessarily arise out of that which Jahve is to the poet. The interchangeable notions &#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;, with which we are familiar from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-6</a>, stand side by side, in order to give urgency to the utterance of the longing for God's gentle and safe guidance. Instead of translating it "out of the net, which etc.," according to the accents (cf. <a href="/psalms/10-2.htm">Psalm 10:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a>) it should be rendered "out of the net there," so that &#1496;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; is a relative clause without the relative.<p>Into the hand of this God, who is and will be all this to him, he commends his spirit; he gives it over into His hand as a trust or deposit (&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;); for whatsoever is deposited there is safely kept, and freed from all danger and all distress. The word used is not &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, which Theodotion substitutes when he renders it &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; but &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;; and this is used designedly. The language of the prayer lays hold of life at its root, as springing directly from God and as also living in the believer from God and in God; and this life it places under His protection, who is the true life of all spirit-life (<a href="/isaiah/38-16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>) and of all life. It is the language of prayer with which the dying Christ breathed forth His life, <a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>. The period of David's persecution by Saul is the most prolific in types of the Passion; and this language of prayer, which proceeded from the furnace of affliction through which David at that time passed, denotes, in the mouth of Christ a crisis in the history of redemption in which the Old Testament receives its fulfilment. Like David, He commends His spirit to God; but not, that He may not die, but that dying He may not die, i.e., that He may receive back again His spirit-corporeal life, which is hidden in the hand of God, in imperishable power and glory. That which is so ardently desired and hoped for is regarded by him, who thus in faith commends himself to God, as having already taken place, "Thou hast redeemed me, Jahve, God of truth." The perfect &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; is not used here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2</a>, of that which is past, but of that which is already as good as past; it is not precative (Ew. 223, b), but, like the perfects in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-8.htm">Psalm 31:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-9.htm">Psalm 31:9</a>, an expression of believing anticipation of redemption. It is the praet. confidentiae which is closely related to the praet. prophet.; for the spirit of faith, like the spirit of the prophets, speaks of the future with historic certainty. In the notion of &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; it is impossible to exclude the reference to false gods which is contained in &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">2 Chronicles 15:3</a>, since, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>, "vain illusions" are used as an antithesis. &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, ever since <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, has become a favourite name for idols, and more particularly in Jeremiah (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1-9</a> :19). On the other hand, according to the context, it may also not differ very greatly from &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; since the idea of God as a depositary or trustee still influences the thought, and &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; and &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; are used interchangeably in other passages as personal attributes. We may say that &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; is being that lasts and verifies itself, and &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; is sentiment that lasts and verifies itself. Therefore &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; is the God, who as the true God, maintains the truth of His revelation, and more especially of His promises, by a living authority or rule.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>, David appeals to his entire and simple surrender to this true and faithful God: hateful to him are those, who worship vain images, whilst he, on the other hand, cleaves to Jahve. It is the false gods, which are called &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, as beings without being, which are of no service to their worshippers and only disappoint their expectations. Probably (as in <a href="/psalms/5-6.htm">Psalm 5:6</a>) it is to be read &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514; with the lxx, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions (Hitzig, Ewald, Olshausen, and others). In the text before us, which gives us no corrective Ker as in <a href="/2_samuel/14-21.htm">2 Samuel 14:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/4-5.htm">Ruth 4:5</a>, &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; is not an antithesis to the preceding clause, but to the member of that clause which immediately precedes it. In Jonah's psalm, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>, this is expressed by &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;; in the present instance the Kal is used in the signification observare, colere, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-10.htm">Hosea 4:10</a>, and even in <a href="/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18</a>. In the waiting of service is included, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a>, the waiting of trust. The word &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; which denotes the fiducia fidei is usually construed with &#1489;&#1468; of adhering to, or &#1506;&#1500; of resting upon; but here it is combined with &#1488;&#1500; of hanging on. The cohortatives in <a href="/psalms/31-8.htm">Psalm 31:8</a> express intentions. Olshausen and Hitzig translate them as optatives: may I be able to rejoice; but this, as a continuation of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>, seems less appropriate. Certain that he will be heard, he determines to manifest thankful joy for Jahve's mercy, that (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; as in <a href="/genesis/34-27.htm">Genesis 34:27</a>) He has regarded (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;, <a href="/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a>) his affliction, that He has known and exerted Himself about his soul's distresses. The construction &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;, in the presence of <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-33.htm">Genesis 19:33</a>, <a href="/genesis/19-35.htm">Genesis 19:35</a>; <a href="/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/35-15.htm">Job 35:15</a>, cannot be doubted (Hupfeld); it is more significant than the expression "to know of anything;" &#1489;&#1468; is like &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; in &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; used of the perception or comprehensive knowledge, which grasps an object and takes possession of it, or makes itself master of it. &#1492;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-9.htm">Psalm 31:9</a>, &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, as in <a href="/1_samuel/23-11.htm">1 Samuel 23:11</a> (in the mouth of David) is so to abandon, that the hand of another closes upon that which is abandoned to it, i.e., has it completely in its power. &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-20.htm">Psalm 18:20</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/26-12.htm">Psalm 26:12</a>. The language is David's, in which the language of the Tra, and more especially of Deuteronomy (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-16.htm">Deuteronomy 23:16</a>), is re-echoed. </body></html>
