What a striking picture is in ver. 35,36, of many a prosperous enemy of God! But God remarkably blights the projects of the prosperous wicked, especially persecutors. None are perfect in themselves, but believers are so in Christ Jesus. If all the saint's days continue dark and cloudy, his dying day may prove comfortable, and his sun set bright; or, if it should set under a cloud, yet his future state will be everlasting peace. The salvation of the righteous will be the Lord's doing. He will help them to do their duties, to bear their burdens; help them to bear their troubles well, and get good by them, and, in due time, will deliver them out of their troubles. Let sinners then depart from evil, and do good; repent of and forsake sin, and trust in the mercy of God through Jesus Christ. Let them take his yoke upon them, and learn of him, that they may dwell for evermore in heaven. Let us mark the closing scenes of different characters, and always depend on God's mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the transgressors - Sinners; violators of the law of God.<p>Shall be destroyed together - The word "together" here - &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;  yacheda&#770;h - means properly "a union of them;" then, together - either:<p>(a) in one place, <a href="/genesis/13-6.htm">Genesis 13:6</a> - or<p>(b) at one time, <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>; or<p>(c) all as one, <a href="/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a> - or<p>(d) mutually with one another, as when men strive together, <a href="/deuteronomy/25-11.htm">Deuteronomy 25:11</a>.<p>The idea here is, that one would be destroyed as well as another; that there would be no exception; that they would go to the same ruin.
