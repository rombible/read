It is a great sin for those that are able, to deny the payment of just debts; it is a great misery not to be able to pay them. He that is truly merciful, will be ever merciful. We must leave our sins; learn to do well, and cleave to it. This is true religion. The blessing of God is the spring, sweetness, and security of all earthly enjoyments. And if we are sure of this, we are sure not to want any thing good for us in this world. By his grace and Holy Spirit, he directs the thoughts, affections, and designs of good men. By his providence he overrules events, so as to make their way plain. He does not always show them his way for a distance, but leads them step by step, as children are led. God will keep them from being ruined by their falls, either into sin or into trouble, though such as fall into sin will be sorely hurt. Few, if any, have known the consistent believer, or his children, reduced to abject, friendless want. God forsakes not his saints in affliction; and in heaven only the righteous shall dwell for ever; that will be their everlasting habitation. A good man may fall into the hands of a messenger of Satan, and be sorely buffeted, but God will not leave him in his enemy's hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Depart from evil, and do good - This is the sum of all that is said in the psalm; the great lesson inculcated and enforced by all these references to the effects of good and evil conduct. All these results - all that people experience themselves, and all the effects of their conduct on their posterity, enforce the great practical lesson that we should do good and avoid evil. These results of conduct are among the means which God employs to induce men to do right, and to abstain from what is wrong.<p>And dwell for evermore - That is, dwell in the land: meaning (in accordance with the general drift of the psalm) that righteousness will be connected with length of days and with prosperity; that its effects will be permanent on a family, descending from one generation to another.

We must not envy the doers of evil, but depart altogether from their spirit and example. As Lot left Sodom without casting a look behind, so must we leave sin. No truce or parley is to he held with sin, we must turn away from it without hesitation, and set ourselves practically to work in the oposite direction. He who neglects to do good will soon fall into evil. "And dwell for evermore." Obtain an abiding and quiet inheritance. Short-lived are the gains and pleasures of evil, but eternal are the rewards of grace.<p><a href="/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a><p>"For the Lord loveth judgment." The awarding of honour to whom honour is due is God's delight, especially when the upright man has been traduced by his fellow men. It must be a divine pleasure to right wrongs, and to defeat the machinations, of the unjust. The great Arbiter of human destinies is sure to deal out righteous measure both to rich and poor, to good and evil, for such judgment is his delight. "And forsaketh not his saints." This would not be right, and, therefore, shall never be done. God is as faithful to the objects of his love as he is just towards all mankind. "They are preserved for ever." By covenant engagements their security is fixed, and by suretyship fulfilments that safety is accomplished; come what may, the saints are preserved in Christ Jesus, and because he lives, they shall live also. A king will not lose his jewels, nor will Jehovah lose his people. As the manna in the golden pot, which else had melted, was preserved in the ark of the covenant beneath the mercy-seat, so shall the faithful be preserved in the covenant by the power of Jesus their propitiation. "But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off." Like the house of Jeroboam and Ahab, of which not a dog was left. Honour and wealth ill-gotten seldom reach the third generation; the curse grows ripe before many years have passed, and falls upon the evil house. Among the legacies of wicked men the surest entail is a judgment on their family.<p><a href="/psalms/37-29.htm">Psalm 37:29</a><p>"The righteous shall inherit the land." As heirs with Jesus Christ, the Canaan above, which is the antitype of "the land," shall be theirs with all covenant blessing. "And dwell therein for ever." Tenures differ, but none can match the holding which believers have of heaven. Paradise is theirs for ever by inheritance, and they shall live for ever to enjoy it. Who would not be a saint on such terms? Who would fret concerning the fleeting treasures of the godless? <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Having therefore these glorious promises and privileges, let no man do any evil or unjust thing to enrich or secure himself, nor abstain from pious and charitable actions for fear of undoing himself by them; but let every man live in the conscionable discharge of all his duties to God and men, committing himself and all his affairs to God’s fatherly care and providence, and confidently expecting his blessing thereupon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Dwell, </span> i.e. <span class="ital">thou shalt dwell</span>, as before, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/37-3.htm" title="Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shall you dwell in the land, and truly you shall be fed.">Psalm 37:3</a></span>, to wit, in the land, as is expressed, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/37-3.htm" title="Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shall you dwell in the land, and truly you shall be fed.">Psalm 37:3</a></span>, and afterwards in heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For evermore; </span> either properly; or for a long time, of which that word is oft used. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/37.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Depart from evil, and do good,....

The verses are wrongly divided. It is evident from the regular structure of the Psalm that the last two lines of <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/37-28.htm" title="For the LORD loves judgment, and forsakes not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.">Psalm 37:28</a></span> together with <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/37-29.htm" title="The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.">Psalm 37:29</a></span> should form a stanza commencing with the letter <span class="ital">Ayin</span>. If the Massoretic text is sound, the <span class="ital">Ayin</span> is represented by the second letter of the word <span class="ital">l’ôlâm</span>, ‘for ever’,—the prefixed preposition <span class="ital">l</span> being disregarded, as is the prefixed <span class="ital">and</span> in <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/37-39.htm" title="But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.">Psalm 37:39</a></span>. But a comparison of the LXX makes it all but certain that the first word of the verse has been lost, and a further corruption taken place in consequence[14]; and that the original reading was:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[14] The LXX reads thus: <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα φυλαχθήσονται</span>• <span class="greekheb">ἄνομοι δὲ ἐκδιωχθήσονται</span> (<span class="greekheb">א</span> B <span class="greekheb">ἄμωμοι ἐκδικηθήσονται</span>), <span class="greekheb">καὶ σπέρμα ἀσεβων ἐξολοθρευθήσεται</span>, ‘They shall be preserved for ever; but the lawless shall be driven out (<span class="greekheb">א</span> B, the perfect shall be avenged), and the seed of the ungodly shall be destroyed.’ The reading of the Sinaitic and Vatican MSS. appears to be a correction or corruption, and must be abandoned in favour of that found in (apparently) all other MSS., and supported by the Vulg., <span class="ital">iniusti punientur</span>. We have then the words <span class="greekheb">ἄνομοι δὲ ἐκδιωχθήσονται</span>, <span class="ital">but the lawless shall be driven out</span>, in addition to a rendering of the Massoretic text. These words might represent an original <span class="greekheb">עַוָּלִים נִשְׁמְדוּ</span> If the original reading (written defectively) was <span class="greekheb">עולם לעלם נשמדו</span> <span class="ital">the unrighteous are destroyed for ever</span>, the process of corruption is easily intelligible. <span class="greekheb">עולם</span> was omitted, either accidentally, from its resemblance to <span class="greekheb">לעלם</span>, or because the transcriber did not recognise a somewhat rare word, and supposed it to be an erroneous repetition. When once it had disappeared, the change of <span class="greekheb">נשמִדו</span> (<span class="ital">destroyed</span>) into <span class="greekheb">נשמִרו</span> (<span class="ital">preserved</span>) followed as a matter of course, ‘his saints’ in the preceding line being the only possible subject. The word <span class="greekheb">עַוָּלִים</span> does not occur elsewhere in the Psalter, but is found four times in the Book of Job, with which this Psalm is so closely connected. Cp. too the substantive <span class="greekheb">עַוְלָה</span> in <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/37-1.htm" title="Fret not yourself because of evildoers, neither be you envious against the workers of iniquity.">Psalm 37:1</a></span>. A case like this, in which the acrostic structure of the Psalm demands a correction for which the LXX supplies clear evidence, is a convincing argument for the temperate employment of the LXX for the correction of the Massoretic Text. This or some similar correction is adopted by most editors.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The unrighteous are destroyed for ever,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the seed of the wicked is cut off.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With this reading a full stop must of course be placed after <span class="ital">saints</span>, and the couplet forms the antithesis to <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/37-29.htm" title="The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.">Psalm 37:29</a></span>. The perfect tenses, as in <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/37-20.htm" title="But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.">Psalm 37:20</a></span> <span class="ital">c</span>, express the Psalmist’s conviction of the certainty of the event. Cp. <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/37-38.htm" title="But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.">Psalm 37:38</a></span>.
