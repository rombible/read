It is a great sin for those that are able, to deny the payment of just debts; it is a great misery not to be able to pay them. He that is truly merciful, will be ever merciful. We must leave our sins; learn to do well, and cleave to it. This is true religion. The blessing of God is the spring, sweetness, and security of all earthly enjoyments. And if we are sure of this, we are sure not to want any thing good for us in this world. By his grace and Holy Spirit, he directs the thoughts, affections, and designs of good men. By his providence he overrules events, so as to make their way plain. He does not always show them his way for a distance, but leads them step by step, as children are led. God will keep them from being ruined by their falls, either into sin or into trouble, though such as fall into sin will be sorely hurt. Few, if any, have known the consistent believer, or his children, reduced to abject, friendless want. God forsakes not his saints in affliction; and in heaven only the righteous shall dwell for ever; that will be their everlasting habitation. A good man may fall into the hands of a messenger of Satan, and be sorely buffeted, but God will not leave him in his enemy's hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord - Margin, "established." The word rendered "ordered" means to stand erect; to set up; to found; to adjust, fit, direct. The idea here is, that all which pertains to the journey of a good man through life is directed, ordered, fitted, or arranged by the Lord. That is, his course of life is under the divine guidance and control. The word "good" has been supplied here by our translators, and there is nothing corresponding to it in the original. It is simply there, "the steps of man are ordered," etc. Yet there can be no doubt that a good or pious man is particularly referred to, for the connection demands this interpretation. The word "steps" here means his course of life; the way in which he goes.<p>And he delighteth in his way - In his course of life; and, therefore, he blesses him. The general idea is that he is the object of the divine favor, and is under the care of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23, 24. steps&#8212;way, or, "course of life"; as ordered by God, failures will not be permanent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of a good man, </span> or, <span class="ital">of that man</span>, to wit, the righteous or blessed man, expressed <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/37-21.htm" title="The wicked borrows, and pays not again: but the righteous shows mercy, and gives.">Psalm 37:21</a>,22</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ordered, </span><span class="ital"> or directed</span>, or <span class="ital">disposed</span>, i.e. so governed as to attain the end and happy issue at which he aims.
