It is a great sin for those that are able, to deny the payment of just debts; it is a great misery not to be able to pay them. He that is truly merciful, will be ever merciful. We must leave our sins; learn to do well, and cleave to it. This is true religion. The blessing of God is the spring, sweetness, and security of all earthly enjoyments. And if we are sure of this, we are sure not to want any thing good for us in this world. By his grace and Holy Spirit, he directs the thoughts, affections, and designs of good men. By his providence he overrules events, so as to make their way plain. He does not always show them his way for a distance, but leads them step by step, as children are led. God will keep them from being ruined by their falls, either into sin or into trouble, though such as fall into sin will be sorely hurt. Few, if any, have known the consistent believer, or his children, reduced to abject, friendless want. God forsakes not his saints in affliction; and in heaven only the righteous shall dwell for ever; that will be their everlasting habitation. A good man may fall into the hands of a messenger of Satan, and be sorely buffeted, but God will not leave him in his enemy's hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though he fall - That is, though he is sometimes disappointed; though he is not always successful; though he may be unfortunate - yet this will not be final ruin. The word here does not refer to his falling into "sin," but into misfortune, disappointment, reverses, calamities. The image is that of a man who is walking along on a journey, but who stumbles, or fails to the earth - a representation of one who is not always successful, but who finds disappointment spring up in his path.<p>He shall not be utterly cast down - The word used here - &#1496;&#1493;&#1500;  t&#803;u&#770;l - means to "throw down at full length, to prostrate;" then, "to cast out, to throw away." Compare <a href="/isaiah/22-17.htm">Isaiah 22:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-13.htm">Jeremiah 16:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-26.htm">Jeremiah 22:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5</a>, <a href="/jonah/1-15.htm">Jonah 1:15</a>. Here it means that he would not be "utterly" and "finally" prostrated; he would not fall so that he could not rise again. The calamity would be temporary, and there would be ultimate prosperity.<p>For the Lord upholdeth him with his hand - It is by no power of his own that he is recovered, but it is because, even when he falls, he is held up by an invisible hand. God will not suffer him to sink to utter ruin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23, 24. steps&#8212;way, or, "course of life"; as ordered by God, failures will not be permanent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Fall; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.
