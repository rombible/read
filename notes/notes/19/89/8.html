But how little of this appears in our congregations, and how much cause have we to humble ourselves on this account! That almighty power which smote Egypt, will scatter the enemies of the church, while all who trust in God's mercy will rejoice in his name; for mercy and truth direct all he does.

God, commanding the armies of heaven; leading forth the stars; controlling all forces - all powers.<p>Who is a strong Lord like unto thee? - The original word here rendered "Lord" is &#1497;&#1492;  Ya&#770;hh, or Jah. This is one of the few places where that word occurs, except in the compounding of words. It is an abbreviation of the name Yahweh, and has the same signification. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/68-4.htm">Psalm 68:4</a>. The meaning is, that there was no one who in respect to power could be compared with Yahweh.<p>Or to thy faithfulness round about thee? - Rather, "thy faithfulness is round about thee." That is, It attends thee at all times; it is always with thee; it is a part of thy very nature. To all round about thee, thou art faithful; wherever God is - and he is everywhere - there is faithfulness. He never changes; and people and angels may always trust in him. The psalmist then proceeds to illustrate the greatness of his power, and of his faithfulness, in the works of creation. The design of these illustrations, doubtless, is to keep before the mind the idea of the divine faithfulness as shown in the works of nature, and then to apply this to the covenant which had been made with David. The idea is, that he who is so faithful in nature will be the same in grace; that he who had shown such unchangeableness in the works of creation might be expected to show the like in respect to the promises which he had made. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/89.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-14. To illustrate His power and faithfulness examples are cited from history. His control of the sea (the most mighty and unstable object in nature), and of Egypt (Ps 87:4), the first great foe of Israel (subjected to utter helplessness from pride and insolence), are specimens. At the same time, the whole frame of nature founded and sustained by Him, Tabor and Hermon for "east and west," and "north and south," together representing the whole world, declare the same truth as to His attributes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/89.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Who is a strong Lord like unto thee?</span> who is equal to thee in power, or, as it follows, in faithfulness? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To thy faithfulness round about thee, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">and thy faithfulness is round about thee</span>, like a girdle adorning and encompassing thee.

The latter occurs six times (vers. 1, 2, 5, 8, 24, 33), and "faithful" in ver. 37. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/89.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The poet, who, as one soon observes, is a &#1495;&#1499;&#1501; (for the very beginning of the Psalm is remarkable and ingenious), begins with the confession of the inviolability of the mercies promised to the house of David, i.e., of the &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; &#1491;&#1493;&#1491; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>.<p>(Note: The Vulgate renders: Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo. The second Sunday after Easter takes its name from this rendering.)<p>God's faithful love towards the house of David, a love faithful to His promises, will he sing without ceasing, and make it known with his mouth, i.e., audibly and publicly (cf. <a href="/job/19-16.htm">Job 19:16</a>), to the distant posterity. Instead of &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;, we find here, and also in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22</a>, &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; with a not merely slightly closed syllable. The Lamed of &#1500;&#1491;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1512; is, according to <a href="/psalms/103-7.htm">Psalm 103:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/145-12.htm">Psalm 145:12</a>, the datival Lamed. With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (lxx, Jerome, contrary to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;) the poet bases his resolve upon his conviction. &#1504;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492; means not so much to be upheld in building, as to be in the course of continuous building (e.g., <a href="/job/22-23.htm">Job 22:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/3-15.htm">Malachi 3:15</a>, of an increasingly prosperous condition). Loving-kindness is for ever (accusative of duration) in the course of continuous building, viz., upon the unshakeable foundation of the promise of grace, inasmuch as it is fulfilled in accordance therewith. It is a building with a most solid foundation, which will not only not fall into ruins, but, adding one stone of fulfilment upon another, will rise ever higher and higher. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; then stands first as casus absol., and &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>, a pronoun having a backward reference to it. In the heavens, which are exalted above the rise and fall of things here below, God establishes His faithfulness, so that it stands fast as the sun above the earth, although the condition of things here below seems sometimes to contradict it (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>). Now follow in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-4.htm">Psalm 89:4-5</a> the direct words of God, the sum of the promises given to David and to his seed in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, at which the poet arrives more naturally in <a href="/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20</a>. Here they are strikingly devoid of connection. It is the special substance of the promises that is associated in thought with the "loving-kindness" and "truth" of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>, which is expanded as it were appositionally therein. Hence also &#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; and &#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; correspond to one another. David's seed, by virtue of divine faithfulness, has an eternally sure existence; Jahve builds up David's throne "into generation and generation," inasmuch as He causes it to rise ever fresh and vigorous, never as that which is growing old and feeble. </body></html>
