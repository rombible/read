David after his anointing, was persecuted, but none could gain advantage against him. Yet all this was a faint shadow of the Redeemer's sufferings, deliverance, glory, and authority, in whom alone these predictions and promises are fully brought to pass. He is the mighty God. This is the Redeemer appointed for us, who alone is able to complete the work of our salvation. Let us seek an interest in these blessings, by the witness of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. As the Lord corrected the posterity of David for their transgressions, so his people shall be corrected for their sins. Yet it is but a rod, not a sword; it is to correct, not to destroy. It is a rod in the hand of God, who is wise, and knows what he does; gracious, and will do what is best. It is a rod which they shall never feel, but when there is need. As the sun and moon remain in heaven, whatever changes there seem to be in them, and again appear in due season; so the covenant of grace made in Christ, whatever alteration seems to come to it, should not be questioned.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His seed also will I make to endure for ever - That is, His posterity shall occupy the throne:<p>(a) this would have been true of his descendants, if they had been faithful to God, and had not revolted from him;<p>(b) it is true of him who is the successor of David in his spiritual kingdom, the Lord Jesus, the Messiah.

Not a race of kings from David, which ended at the Babylonish captivity; not the natural seed of David, not the Messiah himself, who sprung from him, but the Messiah's spiritual seed, which were given him by the Father, adopted through him, regenerated by his Spirit and grace, begotten through his Gospel, and the ministry of it, and born again in his church, and to whom he stands in the relation of the everlasting Father, <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>. The "enduring" of these "for ever" may denote the final perseverance of particular believers; which may be concluded from the relation of Christ, as an everlasting Father to them, who therefore must continue as his children; from his affection to them, from which there can be no separation; from their security in and by him, being in his hand, and in his heart; from their adoption, which is never revoked, being sons they are no more servants; from their regeneration of incorruptible seed; and from the nature of faith, which can never be lost: they that trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion, which endures for ever, <a href="/psalms/125-1.htm">Psalm 125:1</a> or it may be expressive of the duration of the church of Christ in general, throughout all periods of time, notwithstanding the malice and opposition of men and devils against it; see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>, <p>and his throne as the days of heaven; a phrase signifying a great length of time, <a href="/deuteronomy/11-21.htm">Deuteronomy 11:21</a> yea, invariable constancy and duration, <a href="/jeremiah/31-25.htm">Jeremiah 31:25</a> and indeed the throne of Christ is for ever and ever, and will be when the present earth and heavens are fled away, <a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>.

Nor does the promise, however, sound so definite and boundless here as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>, but it is indefinite and universal, without any need for our asking what rivers are intended by &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; (in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>, of a giving and taking possession. With &#1488;&#1507;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (with retreated tone, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-63.htm">Psalm 119:63</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-125.htm">Psalm 119:125</a>) God tells with what He will answer David's filial love. Him who is the latest-born among the sons of Jesse, God makes the first-born (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512; from &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;, to be early, opp. &#1500;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, to be late, vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1-13</a> :21), and therefore the most favoured of the "sons of the Most High," <a href="/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>. And as, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>, Israel is to be high (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;) above all nations of the earth, so David, Israel's king, in whom Israel's national glory realizes itself, is made as the high one (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;) with respect to the kings, i.e., above the kings, of the earth. In the person of David his seed is included; and it is that position of honour which, after having been only prelusively realized in David and Solomon, must go on being fulfilled in his seed exactly as the promise runs. The covenant with David is, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29</a>, one that shall stand for ever. David is therefore, as <a href="/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30</a> affirms, eternal in his seed; God will make David's seed and throne &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;, into eternal, i.e., into such as will abide for ever, like the days of heaven, everlasting. This description of eternal duration is, as also in Sir. 45:15, Bar. 1:11, Taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/11-21.htm">Deuteronomy 11:21</a>; the whole of <a href="/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30</a> is a poetic reproduction of <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>. </body></html>
