But this may seem an uncouth and incongruous description of the east and west, partly because the north and the south here mentioned are not those parts of the land of Canaan, but of the world with respect to it; and therefore the east and west should in reason have been so too; and partly because these places were not so situated in Canaan, for Tabor was not in the west part of Canaan, but rather in the middle space between the sea and Jordan; and Hermon was not so much on the east as on the north, being indeed the northern border of the land without Jordan. Or, secondly, The several parts of the land of Canaan, both within Jordan, where Mount Tabor is; and without it, where Hermon lies.

This mountain, according to Mr. Maundrell (a), stands by itself in the plain of Esdraelon, about 1200 to 1800 yards within the plain; it has a plain area at top, most fertile and delicious, of an oval figure, extended about six hundred yards in breadth, and twice that in length; this area is enclosed with trees on all parts, except towards the south, in which there are in several places cisterns of good water. It is generally thought to be the mountain Christ was transfigured upon before his disciples; and if so, it might then be said to rejoice in his name, when he appeared in so glorious a form upon it; Moses and Elias talking with him, and a voice from the excellent Glory declaring him his beloved Son; and especially the disciples rejoiced in his name there and then, who could say, It is good for us to be here, <a href="/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1</a>.

And &#1493;&#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; attaches itself to this jubilant Sela. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-6.htm">Psalm 89:6-19</a> there follows a hymnic description of the exalted majesty of God, more especially of His omnipotence and faithfulness, because the value of the promise is measured by the character of the person who promises. The God of the promise is He who is praised by the heavens and the holy ones above. His way of acting is &#1508;&#1500;&#1488;, of a transcendent, paradoxical, wondrous order, and as such the heavens praise it; it is praised (&#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;, according to Ges. 137, 3) in the assembly of the holy ones, i.e., of the spirits in the other world, the angels (as in <a href="/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>), for He is peerlessly exalted above the heavens and the angels. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;, poetic singular instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; (vid., supra on <a href="/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>), which is in itself already poetical; and &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;, not, as e.g., in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>, in the signification to co-ordinate, but in the medial sense: to rank with, be equal to.

The question "Who is as Thou?" takes its origin from <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>. &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1503; is not the construct form, but the principal form, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491;, &#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; ,&#1497;&#1491;, and is a Syriasm; for the verbal stem Syr. hs&#803;an is native to the Aramaic, in which Syr. has&#803;&#305;&#772;na&#772;'  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;. In &#1497;&#1492;&#1468;, what God is is reduced to the briefest possible expression (vid., <a href="/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>). In the words, "Thy faithfulness compasseth Thee round about," the primary thought of the poet again breaks through. Such a God it is who has the faithfulness with which He fulfils all His promises, and the promises given to the house of David also, as His constant surrounding. His glory would only strike one with terror; but the faithfulness which encompasses Him softens the sunlike brilliancy of His glory, and awakens trust in so majestic a Ruler. </body></html>
