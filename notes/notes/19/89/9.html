And to praise the Lord, is to acknowledge him to be such a one that there is none like him. Surely then we should feel and express reverence when we worship God. But how little of this appears in our congregations, and how much cause have we to humble ourselves on this account! That almighty power which smote Egypt, will scatter the enemies of the church, while all who trust in God's mercy will rejoice in his name; for mercy and truth direct all he does.

That is, when the sea is raging and boisterous; when it seems as if everything would be swept away before it, thou hast absolute control over it. There is, perhaps, no more impressive exhibition of divine power than the control which God has over the raging waves of the ocean: and yet this was the power which Jesus exercised over the raging sea of Galilee - showing that he had the power of God. <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39-41</a>.<p>When the waves thereof arise - In the lifting up of the waves; when they seem to raise themselves up in defiance.<p>Thou stillest them - At thy pleasure.

So in the troubles of life - the storms - the waves of affliction; they rise as high as God permits, and no higher; when he commands they subside, and leave the mind as calm as the smooth sea when not a breath of wind moves over its surface, or makes a ripple on its placid bosom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/89.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-14.

His control of the sea (the most mighty and unstable object in nature), and of Egypt (Ps 87:4), the first great foe of Israel (subjected to utter helplessness from pride and insolence), are specimens. At the same time, the whole frame of nature founded and sustained by Him, Tabor and Hermon for "east and west," and "north and south," together representing the whole world, declare the same truth as to His attributes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/89.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Giving commands and setting bounds to its waves when they are most impetuous and unruly. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/89.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou rulest the raging of the sea,....

The second Sunday after Easter takes its name from this rendering.)<p>God's faithful love towards the house of David, a love faithful to His promises, will he sing without ceasing, and make it known with his mouth, i.e., audibly and publicly (cf. <a href="/job/19-16.htm">Job 19:16</a>), to the distant posterity. Instead of &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;, we find here, and also in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22</a>, &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497; with a not merely slightly closed syllable. The Lamed of &#1500;&#1491;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1512; is, according to <a href="/psalms/103-7.htm">Psalm 103:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/145-12.htm">Psalm 145:12</a>, the datival Lamed. With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (lxx, Jerome, contrary to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;) the poet bases his resolve upon his conviction. &#1504;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492; means not so much to be upheld in building, as to be in the course of continuous building (e.g., <a href="/job/22-23.htm">Job 22:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/3-15.htm">Malachi 3:15</a>, of an increasingly prosperous condition). Loving-kindness is for ever (accusative of duration) in the course of continuous building, viz., upon the unshakeable foundation of the promise of grace, inasmuch as it is fulfilled in accordance therewith. It is a building with a most solid foundation, which will not only not fall into ruins, but, adding one stone of fulfilment upon another, will rise ever higher and higher. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; then stands first as casus absol., and &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>, a pronoun having a backward reference to it. In the heavens, which are exalted above the rise and fall of things here below, God establishes His faithfulness, so that it stands fast as the sun above the earth, although the condition of things here below seems sometimes to contradict it (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>). Now follow in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-4.htm">Psalm 89:4-5</a> the direct words of God, the sum of the promises given to David and to his seed in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, at which the poet arrives more naturally in <a href="/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20</a>. Here they are strikingly devoid of connection. It is the special substance of the promises that is associated in thought with the "loving-kindness" and "truth" of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>, which is expanded as it were appositionally therein. Hence also &#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; and &#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; correspond to one another. David's seed, by virtue of divine faithfulness, has an eternally sure existence; Jahve builds up David's throne "into generation and generation," inasmuch as He causes it to rise ever fresh and vigorous, never as that which is growing old and feeble. </body></html>
