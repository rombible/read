David after his anointing, was persecuted, but none could gain advantage against him. Yet all this was a faint shadow of the Redeemer's sufferings, deliverance, glory, and authority, in whom alone these predictions and promises are fully brought to pass. He is the mighty God. This is the Redeemer appointed for us, who alone is able to complete the work of our salvation. Let us seek an interest in these blessings, by the witness of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. As the Lord corrected the posterity of David for their transgressions, so his people shall be corrected for their sins. Yet it is but a rod, not a sword; it is to correct, not to destroy. It is a rod in the hand of God, who is wise, and knows what he does; gracious, and will do what is best. It is a rod which they shall never feel, but when there is need. As the sun and moon remain in heaven, whatever changes there seem to be in them, and again appear in due season; so the covenant of grace made in Christ, whatever alteration seems to come to it, should not be questioned.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then thou spakest in vision - Or, by a vision. See this word explained in the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>. The meaning is, that God had spoken this by means of visions, or by communications made to his people by the prophets. This "vision" was especially made known to Nathan, and through him to David. See <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-4.htm">2 Samuel 7:4-17</a>. The substance of what is here said is found in that passage in Samuel. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-17.htm">2 Samuel 7:17</a>, it is expressly called a "vision."<p>To thy holy one - The vision was addressed particularly to David, but was made through him to the people of Israel. The ancient versions render this in the plural, as referring to the people of Israel. The Hebrew is in the singular number.<p>I have laid help upon one that is mighty - I have so endowed him that he shall be the protector and defender of my people. He is qualified for the office entrusted to him, and in his hands the interests of the nation will be safe. This was not expressly said in the vision; but this was the substance of what was said. See <a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>.<p>I have exalted one chosen out of the people - One not of exalted rank; one not descended from kings and conquerors; but one that had grown up among the people; one called from the ranks of common life; one chosen from among those engaged in humble occupations.

Samuel the prophet, that holy man of God, to whom the Lord spoke in vision, or by a spirit of prophecy, concerning David, the choice and exaltation of him to the kingdom, and his unction for it, <a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>. The Vulgate Latin version reads it "to thy Holy Ones": and so the Targum, with which agree the Septuagint and Arabic versions, which render it "thy sons"; and the Syriac version "his righteous ones", and so takes in Nathan also, to whom the Lord spake in a vision, by night, concerning the settlement and perpetuity of the kingdom in David's family, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-4.htm">2 Samuel 7:4</a>, &amp;c. Aben Ezra interprets it of the singers, Heman, Ethan, and others; and Jarchi of Gad and Nathan: but the whole is rather to be understood of David's son, the Messiah; and it may be rendered "concerning thy Holy One" (i) as he is called, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, concerning whom in vision, that is, in prophecy, see <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>. The Lord said, by the mouth of his holy prophets, from the beginning of the world, the following things: <p>and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; this "mighty" One is the Messiah, the mighty God, the mighty Man, the mighty Mediator and Redeemer; who was mighty to save to the uttermost, and was every way fit for and equal to the work of a Redeemer; for which reason the Lord "laid help" upon him, not for himself; for this is not to be understood of help promised or given him as man and Mediator: this is after spoken of, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-21.htm">Psalm 89:21</a>, but for others; and so the Targum adds, "for my people": laying it on him is no other than ordering or enjoining him, to which he agreed, to help his people out of that miserable condition they were fallen into, through Adam's transgression, and their own sins, out of which they could not help themselves: the work assigned to Christ, and devolved on him in council and covenant, was to help them out of this estate by price and power; and to help them on in their way to heaven, through all difficulties, trials, and temptations; and to help them to heaven itself, and introduce them there: and being thus laid upon him, according to his Father's will and purpose, and with his own consent, it was found in him, and exercised by him, <a href="/hosea/13-9.htm">Hosea 13:9</a>. <p>I have exalted one chosen out of the people; the same as before, the Messiah, God's elect, his chosen One, <a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a> "chosen" to be the head of the church, to be the Mediator between God and man, and to be the Saviour and Redeemer of lost sinners; to be the foundation and corner stone in the spiritual building, and to be the Judge of quick and dead: and he was "chosen out of the people"; out of the vast number of the individuals of human nature God determined to create, there was a certain number which he selected for himself, for his own glory, and to be eternally happy with him; and out of these he singled one "individuum" of human nature, to be united to the eternal Word, the second Person in the Trinity; and which may be truly said to be the "chiefest among", or, as the Septuagint version has it, "chosen out of ten thousand", Sol 5:10, this the Lord "exalted" to the grace of union to the Son of God, whereby it became higher than angels and men, and to have a more excellent name than either of them, it bearing the name of him to whom it is united, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>, and he has exalted him to the offices of Prophet, Priest, and King, for which he is <p>anointed above his fellows; and he has also, having done his work, highly exalted him at his right hand; angels, principalities, and powers, being subject to him. <p>(i) "de pio tuo", Cocceius; "de sancto tuo", Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/89.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then thou spakest in vision to <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon <i>one that is</i> <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> mighty; I have exalted <i>one</i> chosen out of the people.</span><p>(q) To Samuel and to others, to assure that David was the chosen one.<p>(r) Whom I have both chosen and given strength to execute his office, as in Ps 89:21.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/89.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">Then</span>] On the well-known occasion already referred to in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/psalms/89-3.htm" title="I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn to David my servant,...">Psalm 89:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">in vision</span>] See <a href="/2_samuel/7-17.htm" title="According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.">2 Samuel 7:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to thy holy one</span>] Nathan, or more probably David, as the principal recipient of the message.

Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1506;, Hitzig pleasantly enough reads &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;; but &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488; is also possible so far as language is concerned, either as an infinitive  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1488;, <a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a> (instead of &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;), or as an infinitival noun, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;, loftiness, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-6.htm">Job 20:6</a>, with a likewise rejected Nun. The formation of the clause favours our taking it as a verb: when its waves rise, Thou stillest them. From the natural sea the poet comes to the sea of the peoples; and in the doings of God at the Red Sea a miraculous subjugation of both seas took place at one and the same time. It is clear from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13-17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, that Egypt is to be understood by Rahab in this passage as in <a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>. The word signifies first of all impetuosity, violence, then a monster, like "the wild beast of the reed," <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a>, i.e., the leviathan or the dragon. &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; is conjugated after the manner of the Lamed He verbs, as in <a href="/psalms/44-20.htm">Psalm 44:20</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1500; is to be understood as describing the event or issue (vid., <a href="/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a>): so that in its fall the proudly defiant kingdom is like one fatally smitten. Thereupon in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-12.htm">Psalm 89:12-15</a> again follows in the same co-ordination first the praise of God drawn from nature, then from history. Jahve's are the heavens and the earth. He is the Creator, and for that very reason the absolute owner, of both. The north and the right hand, i.e., the south, represent the earth in its entire compass from one region of the heavens to the other. Tabor on this side of the Jordan represents the west (cf. <a href="/hosea/5-1.htm">Hosea 5:1</a>), and Hermon opposite the east of the Holy Land. Both exult by reason of the name of God; by their fresh, cheerful look they give the impression of joy at the glorious revelation of the divine creative might manifest in themselves. In <a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a> the praise again enters upon the province of history. "An arm with (&#1506;&#1501;) heroic strength," says the poet, inasmuch as he distinguishes between the attribute inherent in God and the medium of its manifestation in history. His throne has as its &#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, i.e., its immovable foundation (<a href="/proverbs/16-12.htm">Proverbs 16:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-5.htm">Proverbs 25:5</a>), righteousness of action and right, by which all action is regulated, and which is unceasingly realized by means of the action. And mercy and truth wait upon Him. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is not; to go before any one (&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="/psalms/85-14.htm">Psalm 85:14</a>), but anticipatingly to present one's self to any one, <a href="/psalms/88-14.htm">Psalm 88:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/95-2.htm">Psalm 95:2</a>; <a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6</a>. Mercy and truth, these two genii of sacred history (<a href="/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>), stand before His face like waiting servants watching upon His nod. </body></html>
