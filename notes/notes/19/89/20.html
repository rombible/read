David after his anointing, was persecuted, but none could gain advantage against him. Yet all this was a faint shadow of the Redeemer's sufferings, deliverance, glory, and authority, in whom alone these predictions and promises are fully brought to pass. He is the mighty God. This is the Redeemer appointed for us, who alone is able to complete the work of our salvation. Let us seek an interest in these blessings, by the witness of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. As the Lord corrected the posterity of David for their transgressions, so his people shall be corrected for their sins. Yet it is but a rod, not a sword; it is to correct, not to destroy. It is a rod in the hand of God, who is wise, and knows what he does; gracious, and will do what is best. It is a rod which they shall never feel, but when there is need. As the sun and moon remain in heaven, whatever changes there seem to be in them, and again appear in due season; so the covenant of grace made in Christ, whatever alteration seems to come to it, should not be questioned.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have found David my servant - That is, I found him among the sheepfolds; in humble life. I saw there one who was qualified for the high office of being the ruler of the nation, and I designated, or set him apart, for that office. The idea is, that there was in him a precious qualification for this work, and that God had seen this, and, in accordance with this, had summoned him to his service.<p>With my holy oil have I anointed him - By the hand of Samuel. <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>.

He who rules the raging of the sea, also rules the raging of the sea of the peoples, <a href="/psalms/65-8.htm">Psalm 65:8</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, a proud rising, here of the sea, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a>.

The formation of the clause favours our taking it as a verb: when its waves rise, Thou stillest them. From the natural sea the poet comes to the sea of the peoples; and in the doings of God at the Red Sea a miraculous subjugation of both seas took place at one and the same time. It is clear from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13-17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, that Egypt is to be understood by Rahab in this passage as in <a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>. The word signifies first of all impetuosity, violence, then a monster, like "the wild beast of the reed," <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a>, i.e., the leviathan or the dragon. &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; is conjugated after the manner of the Lamed He verbs, as in <a href="/psalms/44-20.htm">Psalm 44:20</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1500; is to be understood as describing the event or issue (vid., <a href="/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a>): so that in its fall the proudly defiant kingdom is like one fatally smitten. Thereupon in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-12.htm">Psalm 89:12-15</a> again follows in the same co-ordination first the praise of God drawn from nature, then from history. Jahve's are the heavens and the earth. He is the Creator, and for that very reason the absolute owner, of both. The north and the right hand, i.e., the south, represent the earth in its entire compass from one region of the heavens to the other. Tabor on this side of the Jordan represents the west (cf. <a href="/hosea/5-1.htm">Hosea 5:1</a>), and Hermon opposite the east of the Holy Land. Both exult by reason of the name of God; by their fresh, cheerful look they give the impression of joy at the glorious revelation of the divine creative might manifest in themselves. In <a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a> the praise again enters upon the province of history. "An arm with (&#1506;&#1501;) heroic strength," says the poet, inasmuch as he distinguishes between the attribute inherent in God and the medium of its manifestation in history. His throne has as its &#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, i.e., its immovable foundation (<a href="/proverbs/16-12.htm">Proverbs 16:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-5.htm">Proverbs 25:5</a>), righteousness of action and right, by which all action is regulated, and which is unceasingly realized by means of the action. And mercy and truth wait upon Him. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is not; to go before any one (&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="/psalms/85-14.htm">Psalm 85:14</a>), but anticipatingly to present one's self to any one, <a href="/psalms/88-14.htm">Psalm 88:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/95-2.htm">Psalm 95:2</a>; <a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6</a>. Mercy and truth, these two genii of sacred history (<a href="/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>), stand before His face like waiting servants watching upon His nod. </body></html>
