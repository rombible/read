David after his anointing, was persecuted, but none could gain advantage against him. Yet all this was a faint shadow of the Redeemer's sufferings, deliverance, glory, and authority, in whom alone these predictions and promises are fully brought to pass. He is the mighty God. This is the Redeemer appointed for us, who alone is able to complete the work of our salvation. Let us seek an interest in these blessings, by the witness of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. As the Lord corrected the posterity of David for their transgressions, so his people shall be corrected for their sins. Yet it is but a rod, not a sword; it is to correct, not to destroy. It is a rod in the hand of God, who is wise, and knows what he does; gracious, and will do what is best. It is a rod which they shall never feel, but when there is need. As the sun and moon remain in heaven, whatever changes there seem to be in them, and again appear in due season; so the covenant of grace made in Christ, whatever alteration seems to come to it, should not be questioned.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His seed shall endure forever ... - His posterity.

Because God has placed the house of David in a filial relationship to Himself, He will chastise the apostate members as a father chastises his son; cf. <a href="/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13</a>. In <a href="/1_chronicles/17-13.htm">1 Chronicles 17:13</a> the chronicler omits the words of <a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a> which there provide against perverted action (&#1492;&#1506;&#1493;&#1493;&#1514;) on the part of the seed of David; our Psalm proves their originality. But even if, as history shows, this means of chastisement should be ineffectual in the case of individuals, the house of David as such will nevertheless remain ever in a state of favour with Him. In <a href="/psalms/89-34.htm">Psalm 89:34</a> &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; corresponds to &#1493;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="/2_samuel/7-15.htm">2 Samuel 7:15</a> (lxx, Targum): the fut. Hiph. of &#1508;&#1512;&#1512; is otherwise always &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;; the conjecture &#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512; is therefore natural, yet even the lxx translators (&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;) had &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; before them. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468; as in <a href="/psalms/44-18.htm">Psalm 44:18</a>. The covenant with David is sacred with God: He will not profane it (&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, to loose the bonds of sanctity). He will fulfil what has gone forth from His lips, i.e., His vow, according to <a href="/deuteronomy/23-24.htm">Deuteronomy 23:24</a> [23], cf. <a href="/numbers/30-3.htm">Numbers 30:3</a> [2]. One thing hath He sworn to David; not: once  equals  once for all (lxx), for what is introduced by <a href="/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>) and follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-37.htm">Psalm 89:37</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-38.htm">Psalm 89:38</a>, is in reality one thing (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a>, two). He hath sworn it per sanctitatem suam. Thus, and not in sanctuario meo, &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; in this passage and <a href="/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a> (cf. on <a href="/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>) is to be rendered, for elsewhere the expression is &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, <a href="/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-26.htm">Jeremiah 44:26</a>, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;, <a href="/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>. It is true we do not read any set form of oath in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17.htm">1 Chronicles 17</a>, but just as Isaiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/54-9.htm">Isaiah 54:9</a>, takes the divine promise in <a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a> as an oath, so the promise so earnestly and most solemnly pledged to David may be accounted by Psalm-poesy (here and in <a href="/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11</a>), which reproduces the historical matter of fact, as a promise attested with an oath. With &#1488;&#1501; in <a href="/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a> God asserts that He will not disappoint David in reference to this one thing, viz., the perpetuity of his throne. This shall stand for ever as the sun and moon; for these, though they may one day undergo a change (<a href="/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a>), shall nevertheless never be destroyed. In the presence of <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a> it looks as if <a href="/psalms/89-38.htm">Psalm 89:38</a> ought to be rendered: and as the witness in the clouds shall it (David's throne) be faithful (perpetual). By the witness in the clouds one would then have to understand the rainbow as the celestial memorial and sign of an everlasting covenant. Thus Luther, Geier, Schmid, and others. But neither this rendering, nor the more natural one, "and as the perpetual, faithful witness in the clouds," is admissible in connection with the absence of the &#1499;&#1468; of comparison. Accordingly Hengstenberg, following the example of Jewish expositors, renders: "and the witness in the clouds is perpetual," viz., the moon, so that the continuance of the Davidic line would be associated with the moon, just as the continuance of the condemned earth is with the rainbow. But in what sense would the moon have the name, without example elsewhere, of witness? Just as the Book of Job was the key to the conclusion of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a>, so it is the key to this ambiguous verse of the Psalm before us. It has to be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm">Job 16:19</a>, where Job says: "Behold in heaven is my witness, and my surety in the heights." Jahve, the &#1488;&#1500; &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1503; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>), seals His sworn promise with the words, "and the witness in the sky (ethereal heights) is faithful" (cf. concerning this Waw in connection with asseverations, Ew. 340, c). Hengstenberg's objection, that Jahve cannot be called His own witness, is disposed of by the fact that &#1506;&#1491; frequently signifies the person who testifies anything concerning himself; in this sense, in fact, the whole Tra is called &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492; (the testimony of Jahve). </body></html>
