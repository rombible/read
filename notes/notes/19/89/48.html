When the great Anointed One, Christ himself, was upon the cross, God seemed to have cast him off, yet did not make void his covenant, for that was established for ever. The honour of the house of David was lost. Thrones and crowns are often laid in the dust; but there is a crown of glory reserved for Christ's spiritual seed, which fadeth not away. From all this complaint learn what work sin makes with families, noble families, with families in which religion has appeared. They plead with God for mercy. God's unchangeableness and faithfulness assure us that He will not cast off those whom he has chosen and covenanted with. They were reproached for serving him. The scoffers of the latter days, in like manner, reproach the footsteps of the Messiah when they ask, Where is the promise of his coming? 2Pe 3:3,4. The records of the Lord's dealings with the family of David, show us his dealings with his church, and with believers. Their afflictions and distresses may be grievous, but he will not finally cast them off. Self-deceivers abuse this doctrine, and others by a careless walk bring themselves into darkness and distress; yet let the true believer rely on it for encouragement in the path of duty, and in bearing the cross. The psalm ends with praise, even after this sad complaint. Those who give God thanks for what he has done, may give him thanks for what he will do. God will follow those with his mercies, who follow him with praises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? - Shall not die - to see death being an expression often used to denote death itself. Death is represented as a real object, now invisible, but which will make itself visible to us when we die. The meaning here is, "All men are mortal; this universal law must apply to kings as well as to other men; in a short time he to whom these promises pertain will pass away from the earth; and the promises made to him cannot then be fulfilled."<p>Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? - His life.

His crown is sacred as being the insignia of a God-bestowed office. God has therefore made the sacred thing vile by casting it to the ground (&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-17.htm">Psalm 74:17</a>, to cast profaningly to the ground). The primary passage to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-41.htm">Psalm 89:41-42</a>, is <a href="/psalms/80-13.htm">Psalm 80:13</a>. "His hedges" are all the boundary and protecting fences which the land of the king has; and &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; "the fortresses" of his land (in both instances without &#1499;&#1500;, because matters have not yet come to such a pass).<p>(Note: In the list of the nations and cities conquered by King Sheshonk I are found even cities of the tribe of Issachar, e.g., Shen-ma-an, Sunem; vid., Brugsch, Reiseberichte, S. 141-145, and Blau as referred to above.)<p>In &#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; the notions of the king and of the land blend together. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; are the hordes of the peoples passing through the land. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; are the neighbouring peoples that are otherwise liable to pay tribute to the house of David, who sought to take every possible advantage of that weakening of the Davidic kingdom. In <a href="/psalms/89-44.htm">Psalm 89:44</a> we are neither to translate "rock of his sword" (Hengstenberg), nor "O rock" (Olshausen). &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; does not merely signify rupes, but also from another root (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, Arab. s&#803;a&#770;r, originally of the grating or shrill noise produced by pressing and squeezing, then more particularly to cut or cut off with pressure, with a sharply set knife or the like) a knife or a blade (cf. English knife, and German kneifen, to nip): God has decreed it that the edge or blade of the sword of the king has been turned back by the enemy, that he has not been able to maintain his ground in battle (&#1492;&#1511;&#1502;&#1514;&#1493; with e&#772; instead of &#305;&#770;, as also when the tone is not moved forward, <a href="/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a>).

A noun &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;  equals  &#1502;&#1496;&#1492;&#1512; with Dag. dirimens, <p>(Note: The view of Pinsker (Einleitung, S. 69), that this Dag. is not a sign of the doubling of the letter, but a diacritic point (that preceded the invention of the system of vowel-points), which indicated that the respective letter was to be pronounced with a Chateph vowel (e.g., mit&#803;o&#774;har), is incorrect. The doubling Dag. renders the Sheb audible, and having once become audible it readily receives this or that colouring according to the nature of its consonant and of the neighbouring vowel.)<p>like &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>, &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512; <a href="/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a> (Abulwald, Aben-Ezra, Parchon, Kimchi, and others), in itself improbable in the signification required here, is not found either in post-biblical or in biblical Hebrew. &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;, like &#1510;&#1492;&#1512;, signifies first of all not purity, but brilliancy. Still the form &#1496;&#1492;&#1512; does not lie at the basis of it in this instance; for the reading found here just happens not to be &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;, but &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;; and the reading adopted by Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer, as also by Nissel and others, so far as form is concerned is not distinct from it, viz., &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493; (mit&#803;to&#774;haro), the character of the Sheb being determined by the analogy of the  following (cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;,   <a href="/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a>), which presupposes the principal form &#1496;&#1492;&#1512; (Bttcher, 386, cf. supra, 2:31, note). The personal tenor of <a href="/psalms/89-46.htm">Psalm 89:46</a> requires that it should be referred to the then reigning Davidic king, but not as dying before his time (Olshausen), but as becoming prematurely old by reason of the sorrowful experiences of his reign. The larger half of the kingdom has been wrested from him; Egypt and the neighbouring nations also threaten the half that remains to him; and instead of the kingly robe, shame completely covers him. </body></html>
