David after his anointing, was persecuted, but none could gain advantage against him. Yet all this was a faint shadow of the Redeemer's sufferings, deliverance, glory, and authority, in whom alone these predictions and promises are fully brought to pass. He is the mighty God. This is the Redeemer appointed for us, who alone is able to complete the work of our salvation. Let us seek an interest in these blessings, by the witness of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. As the Lord corrected the posterity of David for their transgressions, so his people shall be corrected for their sins. Yet it is but a rod, not a sword; it is to correct, not to destroy. It is a rod in the hand of God, who is wise, and knows what he does; gracious, and will do what is best. It is a rod which they shall never feel, but when there is need. As the sun and moon remain in heaven, whatever changes there seem to be in them, and again appear in due season; so the covenant of grace made in Christ, whatever alteration seems to come to it, should not be questioned.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will beat down his foes before his face - I will crush them, or destroy them: showing that the power of doing this was not his own, but was the power of God exerted in his behalf.<p>And plague them that hate him - His enemies.

Blessed, then, is the people that walks in the light of His countenance. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; of a self-assured, stately walk. The words &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; are the statement of the ground of the blessing interwoven into the blessing itself: such a people has abundant cause and matter for exultation (cf. <a href="/psalms/84-5.htm">Psalm 84:5</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is the festive sound of joy of the mouth (<a href="/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a>), and of trumpets or sackbuts (<a href="/psalms/27-6.htm">Psalm 27:6</a>). This confirmation of the blessing is expanded in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-17.htm">Psalm 89:17-19</a>. Jahve's &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, i.e., revelation or manifestation, becomes to them a ground and object of unceasing joy; by His &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, i.e., the rigour with which He binds Himself to the relationship He has entered upon with His people and maintains it, they are exalted above abjectness and insecurity. He is &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;, the ornament of their strength, i.e., their strength which really becomes an ornament to them. In <a href="/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a> the poet declares Israel to be this happy people. Pinsker's conjecture, &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1501; (following the Targum), destroys the transition to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a>, which is formed by <a href="/psalms/89-18.htm">Psalm 89:18</a>. The plural reading of Kimchi and of older editions (e.g., Bomberg's), &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, is incompatible with the figure; but it is immaterial whether we read &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; with the Chethb (Targum, Jerome), or with the Ker (lxx, Syriac) &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;.<p>(Note: Zur Geschichte des Karaismus, pp. &#1511;&#1508;&#1488; and &#1511;&#1508;&#1489;, according to which, reversely, in <a href="/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a> &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is to be read instead of &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1501;, and <a href="/isaiah/33-2.htm">Isaiah 33:2</a> &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1501;, <a href="/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a> &#1514;&#1513;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1514;&#1513;&#1502;&#1512;&#1501;, <a href="/micah/7-19.htm">Micah 7:19</a> &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514;&#1501;, <a href="/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a> &#1514;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1514;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1501;, <a href="/proverbs/25-27.htm">Proverbs 25:27</a> &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1501; (the limiting of our honour brings honour, - an unlikely interpretation of the &#1495;&#1511;&#1512;).)<p>&#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a> are parallel designations of the human king of Israel; &#1502;&#1490;&#1503; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/47-10.htm">Psalm 47:10</a>, but not in <a href="/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a>. For we are not compelled, with a total disregard of the limits to the possibilities of style (Ew. 310, a), to render <a href="/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a>: and the Holy One of Israel, (as to Him, He) is our King (Hitzig), since we do not bring down the Psalm beyond the time of the kings. Israel's shield, Israel's king, the poet says in the holy defiant confidence of faith, is Jahve's, belongs to the Holy One of Israel, i.e., he stands as His own possession under the protection of Jahve, the Holy One, who has taken Israel to Himself for a possession; it is therefore impossible that the Davidic throne should become a prey to any worldly power. </body></html>
