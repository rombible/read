And to praise the Lord, is to acknowledge him to be such a one that there is none like him. Surely then we should feel and express reverence when we worship God. But how little of this appears in our congregations, and how much cause have we to humble ourselves on this account! That almighty power which smote Egypt, will scatter the enemies of the church, while all who trust in God's mercy will rejoice in his name; for mercy and truth direct all he does.

The Hebrew word - &#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;  ma&#770;ko&#770;n - means properly a place where one stands; then, a foundation or basis. The idea here is, that the throne of God is founded on justice and right judgment; it is this which supports it; his administration is maintained because it is right. This supposes that there is such a thing as right or justice in itself considered, or in the nature of things, and independently of the will of God; that the divine administration will be conformed to that, and will be firm because it is thus conformed to it. Even omnipotent power could not maintain permanently a throne founded on injustice and wrong. Such an administration would sooner or later make its own destruction sure.<p>Mercy, and truth shall go before thy face - literally, anticipate thy face; that is, thy goings. Wherever thou dost go, wherever thou dost manifest thyself, there will be mercy and faithfulness. Thy march through the world will be attended with kindness and fidelity. So certain is this, that his coming will, as it were, be anticipated by truth and goodness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/89.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. rejoice in thy name&#8212;praise Thy perfections by their very existence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/89.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Justice and judgment, </span> i.e. just judgment, or justice in judging, as <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm" title="But let him that glories glory in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD which exercise loving kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 9:24</a> 22:3</span>.

And &#1493;&#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; attaches itself to this jubilant Sela. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-6.htm">Psalm 89:6-19</a> there follows a hymnic description of the exalted majesty of God, more especially of His omnipotence and faithfulness, because the value of the promise is measured by the character of the person who promises. The God of the promise is He who is praised by the heavens and the holy ones above. His way of acting is &#1508;&#1500;&#1488;, of a transcendent, paradoxical, wondrous order, and as such the heavens praise it; it is praised (&#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;, according to Ges. 137, 3) in the assembly of the holy ones, i.e., of the spirits in the other world, the angels (as in <a href="/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>), for He is peerlessly exalted above the heavens and the angels. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;, poetic singular instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; (vid., supra on <a href="/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>), which is in itself already poetical; and &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;, not, as e.g., in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>, in the signification to co-ordinate, but in the medial sense: to rank with, be equal to. Concerning &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, vid., on <a href="/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>.

In <a href="/psalms/89-9.htm">Psalm 89:9</a> He is apostrophized with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; as being the One exalted above the heavens and the angels. The question "Who is as Thou?" takes its origin from <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>. &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1503; is not the construct form, but the principal form, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491;, &#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; ,&#1497;&#1491;, and is a Syriasm; for the verbal stem Syr. hs&#803;an is native to the Aramaic, in which Syr. has&#803;&#305;&#772;na&#772;'  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;. In &#1497;&#1492;&#1468;, what God is is reduced to the briefest possible expression (vid., <a href="/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>). In the words, "Thy faithfulness compasseth Thee round about," the primary thought of the poet again breaks through. Such a God it is who has the faithfulness with which He fulfils all His promises, and the promises given to the house of David also, as His constant surrounding. His glory would only strike one with terror; but the faithfulness which encompasses Him softens the sunlike brilliancy of His glory, and awakens trust in so majestic a Ruler. </body></html>
