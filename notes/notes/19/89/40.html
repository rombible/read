When the great Anointed One, Christ himself, was upon the cross, God seemed to have cast him off, yet did not make void his covenant, for that was established for ever. The honour of the house of David was lost. Thrones and crowns are often laid in the dust; but there is a crown of glory reserved for Christ's spiritual seed, which fadeth not away. From all this complaint learn what work sin makes with families, noble families, with families in which religion has appeared. They plead with God for mercy. God's unchangeableness and faithfulness assure us that He will not cast off those whom he has chosen and covenanted with. They were reproached for serving him. The scoffers of the latter days, in like manner, reproach the footsteps of the Messiah when they ask, Where is the promise of his coming? 2Pe 3:3,4. The records of the Lord's dealings with the family of David, show us his dealings with his church, and with believers. Their afflictions and distresses may be grievous, but he will not finally cast them off. Self-deceivers abuse this doctrine, and others by a careless walk bring themselves into darkness and distress; yet let the true believer rely on it for encouragement in the path of duty, and in bearing the cross. The psalm ends with praise, even after this sad complaint. Those who give God thanks for what he has done, may give him thanks for what he will do. God will follow those with his mercies, who follow him with praises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/89.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast broken down all his hedges - His walls or defenses; all that he relied on for safety.<p>Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin - His towers, fortifications; defenses.

A famous church was raised at Jerusalem, quickly after the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, which seemed to be well filled, fenced, and protected; but on a sudden a violent persecution arose, and the members of it were made havoc of, and the ministers of the word were scattered abroad, and which was the breaking down of the hedges; and what was done to the church was taken by Christ as done to himself, as it is here spoken of him; see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>, and this might seem contrary to the word and oath of God, that his seed should endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29</a>, when the first Christian church was used in this manner; but that providence was overruled, for the spread of the Gospel, and the interest of Christ, in other parts; see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4</a>, and so no objection to what is before said: <p>thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin; the same as before, the church of Christ, which seemed to be so well built and fortified; see <a href="/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/89.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/89.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">40</span>.

Because God has placed the house of David in a filial relationship to Himself, He will chastise the apostate members as a father chastises his son; cf. <a href="/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13</a>. In <a href="/1_chronicles/17-13.htm">1 Chronicles 17:13</a> the chronicler omits the words of <a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a> which there provide against perverted action (&#1492;&#1506;&#1493;&#1493;&#1514;) on the part of the seed of David; our Psalm proves their originality. But even if, as history shows, this means of chastisement should be ineffectual in the case of individuals, the house of David as such will nevertheless remain ever in a state of favour with Him.

The covenant with David is sacred with God: He will not profane it (&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, to loose the bonds of sanctity). He will fulfil what has gone forth from His lips, i.e., His vow, according to <a href="/deuteronomy/23-24.htm">Deuteronomy 23:24</a> [23], cf. <a href="/numbers/30-3.htm">Numbers 30:3</a> [2]. One thing hath He sworn to David; not: once  equals  once for all (lxx), for what is introduced by <a href="/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>) and follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-37.htm">Psalm 89:37</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-38.htm">Psalm 89:38</a>, is in reality one thing (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a>, two). He hath sworn it per sanctitatem suam. Thus, and not in sanctuario meo, &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; in this passage and <a href="/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a> (cf. on <a href="/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>) is to be rendered, for elsewhere the expression is &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, <a href="/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-26.htm">Jeremiah 44:26</a>, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;, <a href="/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>. It is true we do not read any set form of oath in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17.htm">1 Chronicles 17</a>, but just as Isaiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/54-9.htm">Isaiah 54:9</a>, takes the divine promise in <a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a> as an oath, so the promise so earnestly and most solemnly pledged to David may be accounted by Psalm-poesy (here and in <a href="/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11</a>), which reproduces the historical matter of fact, as a promise attested with an oath. With &#1488;&#1501; in <a href="/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a> God asserts that He will not disappoint David in reference to this one thing, viz., the perpetuity of his throne. This shall stand for ever as the sun and moon; for these, though they may one day undergo a change (<a href="/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a>), shall nevertheless never be destroyed. In the presence of <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a> it looks as if <a href="/psalms/89-38.htm">Psalm 89:38</a> ought to be rendered: and as the witness in the clouds shall it (David's throne) be faithful (perpetual). By the witness in the clouds one would then have to understand the rainbow as the celestial memorial and sign of an everlasting covenant. Thus Luther, Geier, Schmid, and others. But neither this rendering, nor the more natural one, "and as the perpetual, faithful witness in the clouds," is admissible in connection with the absence of the &#1499;&#1468; of comparison. Accordingly Hengstenberg, following the example of Jewish expositors, renders: "and the witness in the clouds is perpetual," viz., the moon, so that the continuance of the Davidic line would be associated with the moon, just as the continuance of the condemned earth is with the rainbow. But in what sense would the moon have the name, without example elsewhere, of witness? Just as the Book of Job was the key to the conclusion of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a>, so it is the key to this ambiguous verse of the Psalm before us. It has to be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm">Job 16:19</a>, where Job says: "Behold in heaven is my witness, and my surety in the heights." Jahve, the &#1488;&#1500; &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1503; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>), seals His sworn promise with the words, "and the witness in the sky (ethereal heights) is faithful" (cf. concerning this Waw in connection with asseverations, Ew. 340, c). Hengstenberg's objection, that Jahve cannot be called His own witness, is disposed of by the fact that &#1506;&#1491; frequently signifies the person who testifies anything concerning himself; in this sense, in fact, the whole Tra is called &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492; (the testimony of Jahve). </body></html>
