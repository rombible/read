In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-6.htm">Psalm 89:6-19</a> there follows a hymnic description of the exalted majesty of God, more especially of His omnipotence and faithfulness, because the value of the promise is measured by the character of the person who promises. The God of the promise is He who is praised by the heavens and the holy ones above. His way of acting is &#1508;&#1500;&#1488;, of a transcendent, paradoxical, wondrous order, and as such the heavens praise it; it is praised (&#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;, according to Ges. 137, 3) in the assembly of the holy ones, i.e., of the spirits in the other world, the angels (as in <a href="/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>), for He is peerlessly exalted above the heavens and the angels. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;, poetic singular instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; (vid., supra on <a href="/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>), which is in itself already poetical; and &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;, not, as e.g., in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>, in the signification to co-ordinate, but in the medial sense: to rank with, be equal to.

The question "Who is as Thou?" takes its origin from <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>. &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1503; is not the construct form, but the principal form, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491;, &#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; ,&#1497;&#1491;, and is a Syriasm; for the verbal stem Syr. hs&#803;an is native to the Aramaic, in which Syr. has&#803;&#305;&#772;na&#772;'  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;. In &#1497;&#1492;&#1468;, what God is is reduced to the briefest possible expression (vid., <a href="/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>). In the words, "Thy faithfulness compasseth Thee round about," the primary thought of the poet again breaks through. Such a God it is who has the faithfulness with which He fulfils all His promises, and the promises given to the house of David also, as His constant surrounding. His glory would only strike one with terror; but the faithfulness which encompasses Him softens the sunlike brilliancy of His glory, and awakens trust in so majestic a Ruler. </body></html>
