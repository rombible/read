Observe here, reader, as it is a great blessing to be taught of God from our youth, from our childhood to know the Holy Scriptures, and the important truths revealed, the privileges exhibited, and the duties inculcated therein; so those that have been favoured and received good in this way, when they were young, must be doing good when they are grown up, and must continue to communicate what they have received.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/71.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>71:14-24 The psalmist declares that the righteousness of Christ, and the great salvation obtained thereby, shall be the chosen subject of his discourse. Not on a sabbath only, but on every day of the week, of the year, of his life. Not merely at stated returns of solemn devotion, but on every occasion, all the day long. Why will he always dwell on this? Because he knew not the numbers thereof. It is impossible to measure the value or the fulness of these blessings. The righteousness is unspeakable, the salvation everlasting. God will not cast off his grey-headed servants when no longer capable of labouring as they have done. The Lord often strengthens his people in their souls, when nature is sinking into decay. And it is a debt which the old disciples of Christ owe to succeeding generations, to leave behind them a solemn testimony to the advantage of religion, and the truth of God's promises; and especially to the everlasting righteousness of the Redeemer. Assured of deliverance and victory, let us spend our days, while waiting the approach of death, in praising the Holy One of Israel with all our powers. And while speaking of his righteousness, and singing his praises, we shall rise above fears and infirmities, and have earnests of the joys of heaven. The work of redemption ought, above all God's works, to be spoken of by us in our praises. The Lamb that was slain, and has redeemed us to God, is worthy of all blessing and praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/71.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O God, thou hast taught me from my youth - See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-5.htm">Psalm 71:5-6</a>.

It was comfortable to the Psalmist to remember that from his earliest days he had been the Lord's disciple. None are too young to be taught of God, and they make the most proficient scholars who begin betimes. "And hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works." He had leaned to tell what he knew, he was a pupil teacher; he continued still learning and declaring, and did not renounce his first master; this, also, was his comfort, but it is one which those who have been seduced from the school of the gospel, into the various colleges of philosophy and scepticism, will not be able to enjoy. A sacred conservatism is much needed in these days, when men are giving up old lights for new. We mean both to learn and to teach the wonders of redeeming love, till we can discover something nobler or more soul-satisfying; for this reason we hope that our greyheads will be found in the same road as we have trodden, even from our beardless youth.<p><a href="/psalms/71-18.htm">Psalm 71:18</a><p>"Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not." There is something touching in the sight of hair whitened with the snows of many a winter: the old and faithful soldier receives consideration from his king, the venerable servant is beloved by his master. When our infirmities multiply, we may, with confidence, expect enlarged privileges in the world of grace, to make up for our narrowing range in the field of nature. Nothing shall make God forsake those who have not forsaken him. Our fear is lest he should do so; but his promise kisses that fear into silence. "Until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation." He desired to continue his testimony and complete it; he had respect to the young men and little children about him, and knowing the vast importance of training them in the fear of God, he longed to make them all acquainted with the power of God to support his people, that they also might be led to walk by faith. He had leaned on the almighty arm, and could speak experimentally of its all-Sufficiency, and longed to do so ere life came to a close. "And thy power to every one that is to come." He would leave a record for unborn ages to read. He thought the Lord's power to be so worthy of praise, that he would make the ages ring With it till time should be no more. For this cause believers live, and they should take care to labour zealously for the accomplishment of this their most proper and necessary work. Blessed are they who begin in youth to proclaim the name of the Lord, and cease not until their last hour brings their last word for their divine Master. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/71.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Taught me; </span> partly by thy word and Spirit, convincing and assuring me; and partly by my own experience <span class="ital">of thy righteousness</span> last mentioned, the wondrous effects whereof I have received and declared from time to time, as it here follows. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/71.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O God, thou hast taught me from my youth,.... The corruption of human nature; the weakness and impotence of it, to everything that is spiritually good; and the need of continual strength and grace from Christ, to go to him for righteousness and strength, life and salvation, and to walk by faith on him; the doctrine of justification by the righteousness of Christ, and the insufficiency of his own; the will, ways, and worship of God; and all the duties of religion, prayer, praise, &amp;c. and whoever were the instruments, or whatever were the means, of teaching David these things, he ascribes it to God. Whether his parents, or the priests and Levites, taught him the sacrifices and ordinances of the law, it was the Lord that blessed instructions to him; and that taught him by providences and precepts, and by his Holy Spirit. And a wonderful blessing it is to be taught of God, and not of men, things relating both to doctrine and practice; and it is an addition to it to be taught these things early, as David was from his youth; and therefore the Lord was so soon the object of his faith and trust, <a href="/psalms/71-5.htm">Psalm 71:5</a>; and, as Timothy, from a child, was acquainted with the holy Scriptures, and the things contained in them, which are able to make wise unto salvation, <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>; <p>and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works: not only of nature and providence, but of grace; the treasuring up of all grace, and the blessings of it in Christ; the work of redemption by him; the work of regeneration and conversion by his Spirit; and the perseverance of the saints by his grace and strength; which are all wonderful and amazing. And as the psalmist saw his interest in these things, and had an experience of them, he declared them to others for their encouragement, and to the glory of all the three Persons; see <a href="/psalms/66-16.htm">Psalm 66:16</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/71.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/71.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">thou hast taught me</span> &c.] He has been a life-long disciple in the school of God.

It is his God, however, to whom, as hitherto so also in time to come, he will look to be thus wonderfully preserved: &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494;, as in <a href="/2_samuel/22-33.htm">2 Samuel 22:33</a>. &#1506;&#1494; is a genitive, and the suffix is thrown back (vid., supra, p 171) in order that what God is to, and does for, the poet may be brought forward more clearly and independently [lit. unalloyed]. <a href="/psalms/71-8.htm">Psalm 71:8</a> tells us what it is that he firmly expects on the ground of what he possesses in God. And on this very ground arises the prayer of <a href="/psalms/71-9.htm">Psalm 71:9</a> also: Cast me not away (viz., from Thy presence, <a href="/psalms/51-13.htm">Psalm 51:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>, and frequently) in the time (&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;, as in <a href="/genesis/8-11.htm">Genesis 8:11</a>) of old age - he is therefore already an old man (&#1494;&#1511;&#1503;), though only just at the beginning of the &#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;. He supplicates favour for the present and for the time still to come: now that my vital powers are failing, forsake me not! Thus he prays because he, who has been often wondrously delivered, is even now threatened by foes. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-11.htm">Psalm 71:11</a>, introduced by means of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-10.htm">Psalm 71:10</a>, tells us what their thoughts of him are, and what they purpose doing. &#1500;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-10.htm">Psalm 71:10</a>, does not belong to &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;, as it dies not in <a href="/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a> also, and elsewhere. The &#1500; is that of relation or of reference, as in <a href="/psalms/41-6.htm">Psalm 41:6</a>. The unnecessary &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; betrays a poet of the later period; cf. <a href="/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-82.htm">Psalm 119:82</a> (where it was less superfluous), and on the contrary, <a href="/psalms/83-5.htm">Psalm 83:5</a>. The later poet also reveals himself in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-12.htm">Psalm 71:12</a>, which is an echo of very similar prayers of David in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>, <a href="/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a> (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-14.htm">Psalm 40:14</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/70-2.htm">Psalm 70:2</a>), <a href="/psalms/35-22.htm">Psalm 35:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/38-22.htm">Psalm 38:22</a>.

In place of &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; the Ker substitutes &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, which is the form exclusively found elsewhere. </body></html>
