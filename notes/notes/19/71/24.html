Not on a sabbath only, but on every day of the week, of the year, of his life. Not merely at stated returns of solemn devotion, but on every occasion, all the day long. Why will he always dwell on this? Because he knew not the numbers thereof. It is impossible to measure the value or the fulness of these blessings. The righteousness is unspeakable, the salvation everlasting. God will not cast off his grey-headed servants when no longer capable of labouring as they have done. The Lord often strengthens his people in their souls, when nature is sinking into decay. And it is a debt which the old disciples of Christ owe to succeeding generations, to leave behind them a solemn testimony to the advantage of religion, and the truth of God's promises; and especially to the everlasting righteousness of the Redeemer. Assured of deliverance and victory, let us spend our days, while waiting the approach of death, in praising the Holy One of Israel with all our powers. And while speaking of his righteousness, and singing his praises, we shall rise above fears and infirmities, and have earnests of the joys of heaven. The work of redemption ought, above all God's works, to be spoken of by us in our praises. The Lamb that was slain, and has redeemed us to God, is worthy of all blessing and praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/71.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness - Thy righteous character; the truthfulness, the goodness, the fidelity which thou hast manifested in delivering me. The word rendered "talk" means properly to meditate; then, to think aloud, to talk to oneself; and the idea may be, that his mind would be so full of the subject that he would give utterance to his thoughts in audible expressions when alone. It denotes fullness of heart, and language naturally flowing out from a full soul.<p>All the day long - Continually. This shall occupy my mind at all times. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>.<p>For they are confounded ... - That is, they are put to confusion; they are disappointed in their hopes; they are defeated in their plans. The psalmist sees this to be so certain that he speaks of it as if it were already done. The Psalms often conclude in this way. They begin in trouble, they end in joy; they begin in darkness, they end in light; they begin with a desponding mind, they end with a triumphant spirit; they begin with prayer, they end in praise.

This is the fate that the poet desires for his deadly foes. In prospect of this he patiently composes himself, <a href="/psalms/71-14.htm">Psalm 71:14</a> (cf. 31:25); and when righteous retribution appears, he will find new matter and ground and motive for the praise of God in addition to all such occasion as he has hitherto had. The late origin of the Psalm betrays itself again here; for instead of the praet. Hiph. &#1492;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; (which is found only in the Books of Kings and in Ecclesiastes), the older language made use of the praet. Ka.

He will tell those things which cannot be so reckoned up; he will come with the mighty deeds of the Lord Jahve, and with praise acknowledge His righteousness, Him alone. Since &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, like the New Testament &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, usually signifies the proofs of the divine &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; (e.g., <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>), the Beth is the Beth of accompaniment, as e.g., in <a href="/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-13.htm">Psalm 66:13</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;, vernire cum, is like Arab. j'a&#770;' b (ata&#770;), equivalent to afferre, he will bring the proofs of the divine power, this rich material, with him.

The poet is already old (&#1494;&#1511;&#1503;), and is drawing ever nearer to &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;, silvery, hoary old age (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/12-2.htm">1 Samuel 12:2</a>). May God, then, in this stage of life also to which he has attained, preserve him in life and in His favour, until (&#1506;&#1491;  equals  &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as in <a href="/psalms/132-5.htm">Psalm 132:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/38-11.htm">Genesis 38:11</a>, and frequently) he shall have declared His arm, i.e., His mighty interposition in human history, to posterity (&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;), and to all who shall come (supply &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;), i.e., the whole of the future generation, His strength, i.e., the impossibility of thwarting His purposes.
