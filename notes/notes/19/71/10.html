With this petition every true believer may come boldly to the throne of grace. The gracious care of Divine providence in our birth and infancy, should engage us to early piety. He that was our Help from our birth, ought to be our Hope from our youth. Let none expect ease or comfort from the world. Those who love the Lord, often are hated and persecuted; men wondered at for their principles and conduct; but the Lord has been their strong refuge.

The first of these two strophes (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-1.htm">Psalm 71:1-3</a>) is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2-4</a>, the second (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-4.htm">Psalm 71:4-6</a>, with the exception of <a href="/psalms/71-4.htm">Psalm 71:4</a> and <a href="/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>) from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-10.htm">Psalm 22:10-11</a>; both, however, in comparison with <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/70-1.htm">Psalm 70:1-5</a> exhibit the far more encroaching variations of a poet who reproduces the language of others with a freer hand. Olshausen wishes to read &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-3.htm">Psalm 71:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/91-9.htm">Psalm 91:9</a>, instead of &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;, which he holds to be an error in writing. But this old Mosaic, Deuteronomial word (vid., on <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>) - cf. the post-biblical oath &#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; (by the Temple!) - is unassailable. Jahve, who is called a rock of refuge in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3</a>, is here called a rock of habitation, i.e., a high rock that cannot be stormed or scaled, which affords a safe abode; and this figure is pursued still further with a bold remodelling of the text of <a href="/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3</a> : &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, constantly to go into, i.e., which I can constantly, and therefore always, as often as it is needful, betake myself for refuge. The additional &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is certainly not equivalent to &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;; it would more likely be equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1510;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;; but probably it is an independent clause: Thou hast (in fact) commanded, i.e., unalterably determined (<a href="/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-29.htm">Psalm 68:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>), to show me salvation, for my rock, etc. To the words &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1510;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514; corresponds the expression &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3</a>, which the lxx renders &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, whereas instead of the former three words it has &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, and seems to have read &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, cf. <a href="/daniel/11-15.htm">Daniel 11:15</a> (Hitzig). In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-5.htm">Psalm 71:5</a>, Thou art my hope reminds one of the divine name &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; in <a href="/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-7.htm">Jeremiah 50:7</a> (cf. &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; used of Christ in <a href="/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). &#1504;&#1505;&#1502;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is not less beautiful than &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/22-11.htm">Psalm 22:11</a>.

It is impracticable to define the meaning of this &#1490;&#1493;&#1494;&#1497; according to &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492;, Arab. jz', retribuere (prop. to cut up, distribute), because &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; is the representative of this Aramaeo-Arabic verb in the Hebrew. Still less, however, can it be derived from &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, transire, the participle of which, if it would admit of a transitive meaning  equals  &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497; (Targum), ought to be &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1497;. The verb &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492;, in accordance with its radical signification of abscindere (root &#1490;&#1494;, synon. &#1511;&#1509;, &#1511;&#1491;, &#1511;&#1496;, and the like), denotes in this instance the separating of the child from the womb of the mother, the retrospect going back from youth to childhood, and even to his birth. The lxx &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2; (&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) is an erroneous reading for &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;, as is clear from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-10.htm">Psalm 22:10</a>, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;, <a href="/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9</a> (cf. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;, <a href="/psalms/69-13.htm">Psalm 69:13</a>), is at the bottom of the expression in <a href="/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>.
