With this petition every true believer may come boldly to the throne of grace. The gracious care of Divine providence in our birth and infancy, should engage us to early piety. He that was our Help from our birth, ought to be our Hope from our youth. Let none expect ease or comfort from the world. Those who love the Lord, often are hated and persecuted; men wondered at for their principles and conduct; but the Lord has been their strong refuge. The faithful servants of God may be assured that he will not cast them off in old age, nor forsake them when their strength fails.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/71.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Deliver me in thy righteousness - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/31-1.htm">Psalm 31:1</a>.
