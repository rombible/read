Not on a sabbath only, but on every day of the week, of the year, of his life. Not merely at stated returns of solemn devotion, but on every occasion, all the day long. Why will he always dwell on this? Because he knew not the numbers thereof. It is impossible to measure the value or the fulness of these blessings. The righteousness is unspeakable, the salvation everlasting. God will not cast off his grey-headed servants when no longer capable of labouring as they have done. The Lord often strengthens his people in their souls, when nature is sinking into decay. And it is a debt which the old disciples of Christ owe to succeeding generations, to leave behind them a solemn testimony to the advantage of religion, and the truth of God's promises; and especially to the everlasting righteousness of the Redeemer. Assured of deliverance and victory, let us spend our days, while waiting the approach of death, in praising the Holy One of Israel with all our powers. And while speaking of his righteousness, and singing his praises, we shall rise above fears and infirmities, and have earnests of the joys of heaven. The work of redemption ought, above all God's works, to be spoken of by us in our praises. The Lamb that was slain, and has redeemed us to God, is worthy of all blessing and praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/71.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will go in the strength of the Lord God - In my future journey through life; in my trials; in my duties; in my conflicts; in my temptations. Admonished in the past of my own weakness, and remembering how often God has interposed, I will hereafter lean only on his arm, and not trust to my own strength. But thus leaning on his arm, I "will" go confidently to meet the duties and the trials of life. If one has the strength of God to lean on, or can use that strength "as if" it were his own, there is no duty which he may not discharge; no trial which he may not bear. The Hebrew here is, "I will come with the mighty deeds (more literally, "strengths") of the Lord God." The word is used to denote the "mighty acts" of Yahweh, in <a href="/deuteronomy/3-24.htm">Deuteronomy 3:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-2.htm">Psalm 106:2</a>; <a href="/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>. DeWette proposes to render this, "I will go in the mighty deeds of Yahweh;" that is, I will sing of his mighty deeds. Rosenmuller explains it, "I will go into the temple to celebrate his praise there;" that is, I will bring the remembrance of his mighty acts there as the foundation of praise. So Professor Alexander explains it. It seems to me, however, that our translation has expressed the true idea, that he would go in the strength of God; that he would rely on no other; that he would make mention of no other. Old age, trials, difficulties, arduous duties, were before him; and in all these he would rely on no other strength but that of the Almighty.<p>I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only - Of thy just and holy character. I will allude to nothing else; I will rely on nothing else as the foundation of my hope, and as my encouragement in the duties and trials of life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/71.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. in the strength&#8212;or, relying on it.<p>thy righteousness&#8212;or, faithful performance of promises to the pious (Ps 7:17; 31:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/71.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I will not sit down in despair, but <span class="ital">I will go on</span> or proceed in my business courageously and cheerfully, in making necessary provisions for my own defence; relying only upon thy strength, and not upon my own military preparations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Make mention; </span> partly to praise and celebrate it, and partly to support and comfort myself with the remembrance of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of thy righteousness; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Go on praising him, as he had determined to do in the preceding verses; not in his own strength, knowing that his heart was not always disposed aright or prepared and fit for such service; and that though the daily continuance of favours required constant praise, yet he needed always the aids of divine grace to raise his affection and song: or "I will go into the strengths of the Lord God" (d); the power of God is expressed in the plural number, to show the greatness of it, which is as a garrison to the believer; see <a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>; a strong hold, a strong tower, a strong habitation, as in <a href="/psalms/71-3.htm">Psalm 71:3</a>; into which he goes by faith, and is there safe, in all times of distress and danger: or the sense is, that he would go into the house of God, the temple and sanctuary, and in his strength perform the duties of public worship there; and it may include all religious actions, private and public, and every, spiritual undertaking; which ought to be attempted and performed, not in our own strength, but in the strength of the Lord: man is become, through sin, a weak and impotent creature; though he is very hard to be brought to a sense and acknowledgment of his weakness; true believers are sensible of it, and own it; and such, knowing that there is a sufficiency of strength in Christ for them, look and go to him for it; to do otherwise, to attempt to do anything in our own strength, betrays our weakness, folly, and vanity, and is dangerous, attended with bad consequences, and never succeeds well: the Apostle Peter is an instance of this, <a href="/matthew/26-33.htm">Matthew 26:33</a>; <p>I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only; and that before the Lord himself: not his own righteousness, which he knew would not justify him in his sight, nor render him acceptable to him; nor furnish out a plea or argument why he should receive any favour from him; and therefore resolves not to mention it; but the righteousness of Christ, which is the righteousness of God, which he approves of, accepts, and imputes. This is a pure, perfect, and spotless righteousness, which God is well pleased with; honours his law, satisfies his justice, and so justifies in his sight; and renders person and service acceptable to him; and therefore with great pleasure and boldness, may be mentioned unto as it should be to Christ himself also; by ascribing it to him, as the author of it; by expressing a desire to be found in it; to have faith of interest in it, and joy on account of it; and by owning him openly and freely as the Lord our righteousness: and we should make mention of it to others, in praise of it; extolling it as the righteousness of God, and not a creature; and so sufficient to justify many, even all the seed of Israel; as the best robe of righteousness, better than the best of man's, better than Adam's in innocence, or than the angels' in heaven; as a law honouring and justice satisfying one, and as an everlasting one. And we should put ourselves in mind of it, and, by repeated acts of faith, put it on as our justifying righteousness; since much of our joy, peace, and comfort, depend upon it. And this, and this only, is to be made mention of; it is only in the Lord that there is righteousness: as there is salvation in him, and in no other, so there is righteousness in him, and in no other; wherefore no other is to be mentioned along with it: justification is not partly by Christ's righteousness, and partly by our own; but only by his, and through faith in it; see <a href="/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32</a>. <p>(d) "in fortitudines", Montanus; "in potentias", V.

It is his God, however, to whom, as hitherto so also in time to come, he will look to be thus wonderfully preserved: &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494;, as in <a href="/2_samuel/22-33.htm">2 Samuel 22:33</a>. &#1506;&#1494; is a genitive, and the suffix is thrown back (vid., supra, p 171) in order that what God is to, and does for, the poet may be brought forward more clearly and independently [lit. unalloyed]. <a href="/psalms/71-8.htm">Psalm 71:8</a> tells us what it is that he firmly expects on the ground of what he possesses in God. And on this very ground arises the prayer of <a href="/psalms/71-9.htm">Psalm 71:9</a> also: Cast me not away (viz., from Thy presence, <a href="/psalms/51-13.htm">Psalm 51:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>, and frequently) in the time (&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;, as in <a href="/genesis/8-11.htm">Genesis 8:11</a>) of old age - he is therefore already an old man (&#1494;&#1511;&#1503;), though only just at the beginning of the &#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;. He supplicates favour for the present and for the time still to come: now that my vital powers are failing, forsake me not! Thus he prays because he, who has been often wondrously delivered, is even now threatened by foes. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-11.htm">Psalm 71:11</a>, introduced by means of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-10.htm">Psalm 71:10</a>, tells us what their thoughts of him are, and what they purpose doing. &#1500;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-10.htm">Psalm 71:10</a>, does not belong to &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;, as it dies not in <a href="/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a> also, and elsewhere. The &#1500; is that of relation or of reference, as in <a href="/psalms/41-6.htm">Psalm 41:6</a>. The unnecessary &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; betrays a poet of the later period; cf. <a href="/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-82.htm">Psalm 119:82</a> (where it was less superfluous), and on the contrary, <a href="/psalms/83-5.htm">Psalm 83:5</a>. The later poet also reveals himself in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-12.htm">Psalm 71:12</a>, which is an echo of very similar prayers of David in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>, <a href="/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a> (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-14.htm">Psalm 40:14</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/70-2.htm">Psalm 70:2</a>), <a href="/psalms/35-22.htm">Psalm 35:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/38-22.htm">Psalm 38:22</a>.

In place of &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; the Ker substitutes &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, which is the form exclusively found elsewhere. </body></html>
