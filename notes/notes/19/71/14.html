Not on a sabbath only, but on every day of the week, of the year, of his life. Not merely at stated returns of solemn devotion, but on every occasion, all the day long. Why will he always dwell on this? Because he knew not the numbers thereof. It is impossible to measure the value or the fulness of these blessings. The righteousness is unspeakable, the salvation everlasting. God will not cast off his grey-headed servants when no longer capable of labouring as they have done. The Lord often strengthens his people in their souls, when nature is sinking into decay. And it is a debt which the old disciples of Christ owe to succeeding generations, to leave behind them a solemn testimony to the advantage of religion, and the truth of God's promises; and especially to the everlasting righteousness of the Redeemer. Assured of deliverance and victory, let us spend our days, while waiting the approach of death, in praising the Holy One of Israel with all our powers. And while speaking of his righteousness, and singing his praises, we shall rise above fears and infirmities, and have earnests of the joys of heaven. The work of redemption ought, above all God's works, to be spoken of by us in our praises. The Lamb that was slain, and has redeemed us to God, is worthy of all blessing and praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/71.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But I will hope continually - I will always cherish hope; I will not give up to despair. I will trust in God whatever may be the number, the power, and the confidence of my enemies. None of these things shall make me despair, for as long as I have a God, I have every ground for hope. No man should despair who has God for his Friend. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>, <a href="/psalms/42-11.htm">Psalm 42:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/43-5.htm">Psalm 43:5</a>.<p>And will yet praise thee more and more - literally, "I will add upon all thy praise." That is, I will accumulate it; I will increase it. He saw abundant cause in the past for praising God; he had such confidence in him, and he felt such an assurance that he would interpose in his behalf, that he did not doubt that in the future dealings of God with him, he would have every reason to "add" to that praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/71.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14-16.

"But I will hope continually." When I cannot rejoice in what I have, I will look forward to what shall be mine, and will still rejoice. Hope will live on a bare common, and Sing on a branch laden down with snow. No date and no place are unsuitable for hope. Hell alone excepted, hope is a dweller in all regions. We may always hope, for we always have grounds for it: we will always hope, for it is a never-failing consolation. "And will yet praise thee more and more." He was not slack in thanksgiving; in fact, no man was ever more diligent in it; yet he was not content with all his former praises, but vowed to become more and more a grateful worshipper. When good things are both continual and progressive with us, we are on the right tack. We ought to be misers in doing good; and our motto should be "more and more." While we do not disdain to "rest and be thankful," we cannot settle down into resting in our thankfulness. "Superior," cries the eagle, as he mounts towards the sun: higher and yet higher is also our aims, as we soar aloft in duty and devotion. It is our continual hope that we shall be able more and more to magnify the Lord.<p><a href="/psalms/71-15.htm">Psalm 71:15</a><p>"My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day." We are to bear testimony as experience enables us, and not withhold from others that which we have tasted and handled. The faithfulness of God in saving us, in delivering us out of the hand of our enemies, and in fulfilling his promises, is to be everywhere proclaimed by those who have proved it in their own history. How gloriously conspicuous is righteousness in the divine plan of redemption! It should be the theme of constant discourse. The devil rages against the substitutionary sacrifice, and errorists of every form make this the main point of their attack; be it ours, therefore, to love the doctrine, and to spread its glad tidings on every side, and at all times. Mouths are never so usefully employed as in recounting the righteousness of God revealed in the salvation of believers in Jesus. The preacher who should be confined to this one theme would never need seek another: it is the medulla theologiae, the very pith and marrow of revealed truth. Has our reader been silent upon this choice subject? Let us, then, press him to tell abroad what he enjoys within: he does not well who keeps such glad tidings to himself. "For I know not the numbers thereof" He knew the sweetness of it, the sureness, the glory, and the truth of it; but as to the full reckoning of its plentitude, variety, and sufficiency, he felt he could not reach to the height of the great argument. Lord, where I cannot count I will believe, and when a truth surpasses numeration I will take to admiration. When David spoke of his enemies, he said they were more in number than the hairs of his head; he had, therefore, some idea of their number, and found a figure suitable to set it out; but, in the case of the Lord's covenant mercies, he declares, "I know not the number," and does not venture upon any sort of comparison. To creatures belong number and limit, to God and his grace there is neither. We may, therefore, continue to tell out his great salvation all day long, for the theme is utterly inexhaustible.<p><a href="/psalms/71-16.htm">Psalm 71:16</a><p>"I will go in the strength of the Lord God." Our translators give us a good sense, but not the sense in this place, which is on this wise, "I will come with the mighty deeds of the Lord Jehovah." He would enter into those deeds by admiring study, and then, wherever he went, he would continue to rehearse them. He should ever be a welcome guest who can tell us of the mighty acts of the Lord, and help us to put our trust in him. The authorised version may be used by us as a resolve in all our exertions and endeavors. In our own strength we must fall; but, when we hear the voice which saith, "Go in this thy might," we may advance without fear. Though hell itself were in the way, the believer would pursue the path of duty, crying, "I will go in the strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only." Man's righteousness is not fit to be mentioned - filthy rags are best hidden; neither is there any righteousness under heaven, or in heaven, comparable to the divine. As God himself fills all space, and is, therefore, the only God, leaving no room for another, so God's righteousness, in Christ Jesus, fills the believer's soul, and he counts all other things but dross and dung "that he may win Christ, and be found in him, not having his own righteousness which is of the law, but the righteousness which is of God by faith." What would be the use of speaking upon any other righteousness to a dying man? and all are dying men. Let those who will cry up man's natural innocence, the dignity Of the race, the purity of philosophers, the loveliness of untutored savages, the power of sacraments, and the infallibility of pontiffs; this is the true believer's immovable resolve, "I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only." For ever dedicated to thee, my Lord, be this poor, unworthy tongue, whose glory it shall be to glorify thee. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/71.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> For which I know thou wilt yet give me abundant occasion. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/71.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But I will hope continually,.... For deliverance and salvation from present outward troubles, for; more grace here and glory hereafter: it is the excellency of the grace of hope to be exercised in times of affliction and distress, and with Abraham to believe in hope against hope; and then it is that this grace is eminently and remarkably useful: it is an anchor to the soul when in distress, which keeps it firm and steadfast; and an helmet, which covers the head in the day of battle; in the exercise of which the believer glories in tribulation: it is an abiding grace, and should be continually exercised by those that have it, which is to abound in it; but this must be through the power of the Holy Ghost, <a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <p>and will yet praise thee more and more; or "will add to all thy praise" (b); to former praises and thanksgivings, fresh ones, as his mercies were renewed to him, and he was daily loaded with benefits. <p>(b)    "omnibus laudibus tuis adjiciam", Tigurine version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/71.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/71.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.

He will spend the whole day in telling of God's righteousness and salvation (ver. 15). The mighty acts of the Lord shall form his theme, together with the righteousness of God, and of none other (ver. 16). As God has enabled him to declare his praise in the past (ver. 17), so he trusts to be still upheld and enabled to proclaim the same to the new generation (ver. 18). God's righteousness is "very high," and there is none like him (ver. 19). When he. brings men into trouble, it is only to "turn again and comfort them" (vers. 20, 21). In conclusion, the writer promises that his hymns of praise  shall not only be said, but sung, and accompanied with the melody of music (ver. 22).

It is his God, however, to whom, as hitherto so also in time to come, he will look to be thus wonderfully preserved: &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494;, as in <a href="/2_samuel/22-33.htm">2 Samuel 22:33</a>. &#1506;&#1494; is a genitive, and the suffix is thrown back (vid., supra, p 171) in order that what God is to, and does for, the poet may be brought forward more clearly and independently [lit. unalloyed]. <a href="/psalms/71-8.htm">Psalm 71:8</a> tells us what it is that he firmly expects on the ground of what he possesses in God. And on this very ground arises the prayer of <a href="/psalms/71-9.htm">Psalm 71:9</a> also: Cast me not away (viz., from Thy presence, <a href="/psalms/51-13.htm">Psalm 51:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>, and frequently) in the time (&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;, as in <a href="/genesis/8-11.htm">Genesis 8:11</a>) of old age - he is therefore already an old man (&#1494;&#1511;&#1503;), though only just at the beginning of the &#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;. He supplicates favour for the present and for the time still to come: now that my vital powers are failing, forsake me not! Thus he prays because he, who has been often wondrously delivered, is even now threatened by foes. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-11.htm">Psalm 71:11</a>, introduced by means of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-10.htm">Psalm 71:10</a>, tells us what their thoughts of him are, and what they purpose doing. &#1500;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-10.htm">Psalm 71:10</a>, does not belong to &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;, as it dies not in <a href="/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a> also, and elsewhere. The &#1500; is that of relation or of reference, as in <a href="/psalms/41-6.htm">Psalm 41:6</a>. The unnecessary &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; betrays a poet of the later period; cf. <a href="/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-82.htm">Psalm 119:82</a> (where it was less superfluous), and on the contrary, <a href="/psalms/83-5.htm">Psalm 83:5</a>. The later poet also reveals himself in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-12.htm">Psalm 71:12</a>, which is an echo of very similar prayers of David in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>, <a href="/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a> (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-14.htm">Psalm 40:14</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/70-2.htm">Psalm 70:2</a>), <a href="/psalms/35-22.htm">Psalm 35:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/38-22.htm">Psalm 38:22</a>. The Davidic style is to be discerned here throughout in other points also. In place of &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; the Ker substitutes &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, which is the form exclusively found elsewhere. </body></html>
