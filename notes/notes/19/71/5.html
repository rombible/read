With this petition every true believer may come boldly to the throne of grace. The gracious care of Divine providence in our birth and infancy, should engage us to early piety. He that was our Help from our birth, ought to be our Hope from our youth. Let none expect ease or comfort from the world. Those who love the Lord, often are hated and persecuted; men wondered at for their principles and conduct; but the Lord has been their strong refuge. The faithful servants of God may be assured that he will not cast them off in old age, nor forsake them when their strength fails.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/71.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thou art my hope, O Lord God - The ground of my hope and my expectation is in thee.<p>(1) I have no other help; no other defense; but<p>(2) I "have" confidence; on thee I "do" rely.<p>Thou art my trust from my youth - From my earliest years. The meaning is, that he had always trusted in God, and had always found him a helper. All that he was, and all that he possessed, he owed to God; and he felt now that God had been his protector from his earliest years. Perhaps it could not be shown certainly from this expression that he meant to say he had "actually trusted" in God from his youth, for the "language" means no more than that God had actually protected him, and holden him up, and had continually interposed to save and keep him. As God had always been his Protector, so he felt that he might come to Him now, and put his trust in Him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/71.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. trust&#8212;place of trust.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/71.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>5 For thou art my hope, O Lord God: thou art my trust from my youth.<p>6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.<p>7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.<p>8 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.<p><a href="/psalms/71-5.htm">Psalm 71:5</a><p>"For thou art my hope, O Lord God." God who gives us grace to hope in him, will assuredly fulfil our hope, and, therefore, we may plead it in prayer. His name is "Jehovah, the hope of Israel" (<a href="/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>); and, as he cannot be a false or falling hope, we may expect to see our confidence justified. "Thou art my trust from my youth." David had proved his faith by notable exploits when he was a youth and ruddy; it was to him a cheering recollection, and he felt persuaded that the God of his youth would not forsake him in his age. They are highly favoured who can like David, Samuel, Josiah, Timothy, and others say, "Thou art my trust from my youth."<p><a href="/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a><p>"By thee have I been holden up Item the womb." Before he was able to understand the power which preserved him, he was sustained by it. God knows us before we know anything. The elect of old lay in the bosom of God before they were laid on their mothers' bosoms; and when their infantile weakness had no feet strong enough to carry it, the Lord upheld it. We do well to reflect upon divine goodness to us in childhood, for it is full of food for gratitude. "Thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels." Even before conscious life, the care of God is over his chosen. Birth is a mystery of mercy, and God is with both mother and babe. If marriages are registered in heaven we may be sure that births are also. Holy women do well to bless God for his mercy to them in nature's perilous hour; but every one who is born of woman has equal cause for thankfulness. She, whose life is preserved, should render thanks, and so should he whose life is given. "My praise shall be continually of thee." Where goodness has been unceasingly received, praise should unceasingly be offered. God is the circle where praise should begin, continue, and endlessly revolve, since in him we live, and move, and have our being.<p><a href="/psalms/71-7.htm">Psalm 71:7</a><p>"I am as a wonder unto many." "To thousand eyes a mark and gaze am I." The saints are men wondered at; often their dark side is gloomy even to amazement, while their bright side is glorious even to astonishment. The believer is a riddle, an enigma puzzling the unspiritual; he is a monster warring with those delights of the flesh, which are the all in all of other men; he is a prodigy, unaccountable to the judgments of ungodly men; a wonder gazed at, feared, and, by-and-by, contemptuously derided. Few understand us, many are surprised at us. "But thou art my strong refuge." Here is the answer to our riddle. If we are strong, it is in God; if we are safe, our refuge shelters us; if we are calm, our soul hath found her stay in God. When faith is understood, and the grounds of her confidence seen, the believer is no longer a wonder; but the marvel is that so much unbelief remains among the sons of men.<p><a href="/psalms/71-8.htm">Psalm 71:8</a><p>"Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day." What a blessed mouthful! A man never grows nauseated though the flavour of it be all day in his mouth. God's bread is always in our mouths, so should his praise be. He fills us with good; let us be also filled with gratitude. This would leave no room for murmuring or backbiting; therefore, may we well join with holy David in this sacred wish. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/71.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/71.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thou art my hope, O Lord God,....
