Not on a sabbath only, but on every day of the week, of the year, of his life. Not merely at stated returns of solemn devotion, but on every occasion, all the day long. Why will he always dwell on this? Because he knew not the numbers thereof. It is impossible to measure the value or the fulness of these blessings. The righteousness is unspeakable, the salvation everlasting. God will not cast off his grey-headed servants when no longer capable of labouring as they have done. The Lord often strengthens his people in their souls, when nature is sinking into decay. And it is a debt which the old disciples of Christ owe to succeeding generations, to leave behind them a solemn testimony to the advantage of religion, and the truth of God's promises; and especially to the everlasting righteousness of the Redeemer. Assured of deliverance and victory, let us spend our days, while waiting the approach of death, in praising the Holy One of Israel with all our powers. And while speaking of his righteousness, and singing his praises, we shall rise above fears and infirmities, and have earnests of the joys of heaven. The work of redemption ought, above all God's works, to be spoken of by us in our praises. The Lamb that was slain, and has redeemed us to God, is worthy of all blessing and praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/71.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5</a>. The purpose of the psalmist is to exalt that righteousness as much as possible, and he, therefore, compares it with that which is high - the heavens - the highest thing of all. The literal rendering would be, "even to the high," or the height; that is, to the highest place. The passage is designed to express his confidence in God, in the infirmities and troubles which he must expect to come upon him with advancing years.<p>Who hast done great things - In his work of creation; in his providence; in his manifested mercy toward his people. He had done things so great as to show that he could protect those who put their trust in him.<p>O God, who is like unto thee! - Who can be compared to thee!

Very sublime, unsearchable, exalted, and glorious is the holy character of God, and his way of making men righteous. His plan of righteousness uplifts men from the gates of hell to the mansions of heaven. It is a high-doctrine gospel, gives a high experience, leads to high practice, and ends in high felicity. "Who hast done great things." The exploits of others are mere child's play compared with thine, and are not worthy to be mentioned in the same age. Creation, providence, redemption, are all unique, and nothing can compare with them. "O God, who is like unto thee." As thy works are so transcendent, so art thou. Thou art without compeer, or even second; and such are thy works, and such, especially, thy plan of justifying sinners by the righteousness which thou hast provided. Adoration is a fit frame of mind, for the believer. When he draws near to: God, he enters into a region where everything is surpassingly sublime; miracles of love abound on every hand, and marvels of mingled justice and grace. A traveller among the high Alps often feels overwhelmed with awe, amid their amazing sublimities; much more is this the case when we survey the heights and depths of the mercy and holiness of the Lord. "O God, who is like unto thee."<p><a href="/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a><p>"Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shall quicken me again." Here is faith's inference from the infinite greatness of the Lord. He has been strong to Smite; he will be also strong to save. He has shown me many heavy and severe trials, and he will also show me many and precious mercies. He has almost killed me, he will speedily revive me; and though I have been almost dead and buried, he will give me a resurrection, and "bring me up again from the depths of the earth." However low the Lord may permit us to sink, he will fix a limit to the descent,: and in due time will bring us up again. Even when we are laid low in the tomb, the mercy is that we can go no lower, but shall retrace our steps and mount to better lands; and all this, because the Lord is ever mighty to save. A little God would fail us, but not Jehovah the Omnipotent. It is safe to lean on him, since he bears up the pillars both of heaven and earth.<p><a href="/psalms/71-21.htm">Psalm 71:21</a><p>"Thou shalt increase my greatness." As a king, David grew in influence and power. God did great things for him, and by him, and this is all the greatness believers want. May we have faith in God, such as these words evince. "And comfort me on every side." As we were surrounded with afflictions, so shall we be environed with consolations. From above, and from all around, light Shall come to dispel our former gloom; the change shall be great, indeed, when the Lord returns, to comfort us. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/71.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Very high, </span> i.e. most eminent and evident, as high things are. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/71.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high,....

This is the fate that the poet desires for his deadly foes. In prospect of this he patiently composes himself, <a href="/psalms/71-14.htm">Psalm 71:14</a> (cf. 31:25); and when righteous retribution appears, he will find new matter and ground and motive for the praise of God in addition to all such occasion as he has hitherto had.

He will tell those things which cannot be so reckoned up; he will come with the mighty deeds of the Lord Jahve, and with praise acknowledge His righteousness, Him alone. Since &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, like the New Testament &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, usually signifies the proofs of the divine &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; (e.g., <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>), the Beth is the Beth of accompaniment, as e.g., in <a href="/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-13.htm">Psalm 66:13</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;, vernire cum, is like Arab. j'a&#770;' b (ata&#770;), equivalent to afferre, he will bring the proofs of the divine power, this rich material, with him.
