He who exalted the once suffering Redeemer, will appear for all his people: the roaring lion shall not destroy their souls, any more than he could that of Christ, their Surety. They trust their souls in his hands, they are one with him by faith, are precious in his sight, and shall be rescued from destruction, that they may give thanks in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness - That is, I will praise thee as a righteous God.<p>And of thy praise - Of that which is a ground or reason for praise.
