This is a fruit of the old enmity in the seed of the serpent against the Seed of the woman. David in his afflictions, Christ in his sufferings, the church under persecution, and the Christian in the hour temptation, all beseech the Almighty to appear in their behalf, and to vindicate their cause. We are apt to justify uneasiness at the injuries men do us, by our never having given them cause to use us so ill; but this should make us easy, for then we may the more expect that God will plead our cause. David prayed to God to manifest himself in his trial. Let me have inward comfort under all outward troubles, to support my soul. If God, by his Spirit, witness to our spirits that he is our salvation, we need desire no more to make us happy. If God is our Friend, no matter who is our enemy. By the Spirit of prophecy, David foretells the just judgments of God that would come upon his enemies for their great wickedness. These are predictions, they look forward, and show the doom of the enemies of Christ and his kingdom. We must not desire or pray for the ruin of any enemies, except our lusts and the evil spirits that would compass our destruction. A traveller benighted in a bad road, is an expressive emblem of a sinner walking in the slippery and dangerous ways of temptation. But David having committed his cause to God, did not doubt of his own deliverance. The bones are the strongest parts of the body. The psalmist here proposes to serve and glorify God with all his strength. If such language may be applied to outward salvation, how much more will it apply to heavenly things in Christ Jesus!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Draw out also the spear - The word here rendered "draw out" means properly to pour out; to empty; and it is applied to the act of emptying sacks, <a href="/genesis/42-35.htm">Genesis 42:35</a>; to emptying bottles, <a href="/jeremiah/48-12.htm">Jeremiah 48:12</a>; to drawing a sword from a sheath, <a href="/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>. It is applied to a "spear" either as drawing it out of the place where it was kept, or as stretching it out for the purposes of attack. The former probably is the meaning, and the idea is, that David prayed God to "arm himself" - as a warrior does - in order to defend him. The spear was a common weapon in ancient warfare. It was sometimes so short that it could be brandished as a sword in the hand, or hurled at an enemy, <a href="/1_samuel/18-11.htm">1 Samuel 18:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-33.htm">1 Samuel 20:33</a>; but it was usually made as long as it could be to be handled conveniently. The spear was a weapon of "attack." The parts of armor referred to in <a href="/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a> were designed for defense. The idea of the psalmist is that of a warrior prepared alike for attack or defense.<p>And stop the way against them that persecute me - The words "the way" are not in the original. The word rendered "stop" - &#1505;&#1490;&#1512;  sa&#770;gar - means properly to shut, to close, as a door or gate, <a href="/job/3-10.htm">Job 3:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-6.htm">Genesis 19:6</a>, <a href="/genesis/19-10.htm">Genesis 19:10</a>. The idea here, according to the usage of the word, is, Shut or close up the way against those that persecute me. So Gesenius renders it. Grotius, Michaelis, DeWette, and others, however, regard the word as a noun, signifying the same as the Greek - &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  sagaris - a two-edged sword, such as was used by the Scythians, Persians, and Amazons. Herod. vii. 64. See Rosenmuller in loc. It is not so rendered, however, in any of the ancient versions. The Septuagint render it: "And shut up against those that persecute me;" the Vulgate, "Pre-occupy against those that persecute me;" the Aramaic has: "Shut up against those that persecute me." The correct idea probably is that which is given in the common version. The psalmist prays that God would go forth to meet his enemies; that he would arrest and check them in their march; that he would hedge up their way, and that he would thus prevent them from attacking him.<p>Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation - Say to "me," I will save you. That is, Give me some assurance that thou wilt interpose, and that thou wilt guard me from my enemies. Man only wants this assurance to be calm in respect to any danger. When God says to us that he will be our salvation; that he will protect us; that he will deliver us from sin, from danger, from hell, the mind may and will be perfectly calm. To a believer he gives this assurance; to all he is willing to give it. The whole plan of salvation is arranged with a view to furnish such an assurance, and to give a pledge to the soul that God "will" save. Death loses its terrors then; the redeemed man moves on calmly - for in all the future - in all worlds - he has nothing now to fear. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. fight against&#8212;literally, "devour my devourers."<p>stop the way against&#8212;literally, "shut up" (the way), to meet or oppose, &c.<p>I &#8230; thy salvation&#8212;who saves thee.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The spear; </span> thy offensive weapons.

The words may be rendered, "draw out the spear and sword, to meet those that persecute me" (p); for is a noun, and signifies a sword shut up in its scabbard; from whence "sagaris" comes, which is kind of a sword; <p>say unto my soul, I am thy salvation; Christ is the salvation of his people; he is the only person appointed, provided, promised, and sent to be the Saviour; and he is the alone author of salvation it is wrought out by him, and it is in him, and in him only; and therefore he is called their salvation, and the salvation of God: and they are interested in the salvation which is in him; it was designed, prepared, and wrought out for them, and for them only; and is applied unto them by the Spirit, and they shall perfectly enjoy it to all eternity: find yet sometimes they are at a loss about their interest in it, and desire might be made known unto them, which was the case of the psalmist here; they, as he, see their necessity it, and that there is no comfort nor safety without it they are wonderfully delighted with the excellency of it, that it is so great in itself, so suitable to them, so complete and perfect, and of an everlasting duration yet, what through the hidings of God's face, the temptations of Satan, the greatness of their sins, and the prevalence of unbelief, they cannot tell how to believe their interest in it; yet most earnestly desire the Lord would show it to them, and assure them of it; which favour, when granted, is by the witnessings of the Spirit to their spirits, that they are the children of God, and the redeemed of the Lamb: and this is said particularly to them; it is not a discovery of salvation by Christ in general; that they have before; but it is a saying to their souls, that it is theirs; and when this is spoken bathe to the soul by the Spirit of God, it is effectual; and removes unbelief at once, and fills with joy unspeakable and full of glory. <p>(p) So Grotius, Amama, Ainsworth, and some in Mollerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Draw out also the spear, and stop <i>the way</i> against them that persecute me: say unto my <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> soul, I <i>am</i> thy salvation.</span><p>(c) Assure me against these temptations, that you are the author of my salvation.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Draw out also the spear</span>; rather, <span class="accented">bring out also the spear</span>, since spears were not, so far as is known, kept in sheaths, like swords (<a href="/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a>), but only laid up in an armoury. <span class="cmt_word">And stop the way against them that persecute me.</span> So Jarchi, Rosenmuller, Hitzig, Kay, Professor Alexander, Hengstenberg, and our Revisers; but a large number of critics regard <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5e8;</span> - the word translated "stop the way" - as really the name of a weapon, the Hebrew equivalent of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which was probably the battle-axe. (So Vitringa, Michaelis, Bishop Horsley, Cheyne, Mr. Aglen, and the 'Speaker's Commentary.') The passage will then read, "Bring out also the spear and the battle-axe against them that persecute me," which is certainly a better parallel to "Take hold of shield and buckler," than "Bring out the spear, and stop the way."

Deliverance from the immediate danger is not all that is meant; but rather support and saving help in all dangers and in all troubles. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 34:17-22) The poet now recommends the fear of God, to which he has given a brief direction, by setting forth its reward in contrast with the punishment of the ungodly. The prepositions &#1488;&#1500; and &#1489;&#1468;, in <a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>, are a well considered interchange of expression: the former, of gracious inclination (<a href="/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>), the latter, of hostile intention or determining, as in <a href="/job/7-8.htm">Job 7:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11</a>, after the phrase in <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a>. The evil doers are overwhelmed by the power of destruction that proceeds from the countenance of Jahve, which is opposed to them, until there is not the slightest trace of their earthly existence left. The subjects to <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a> are not, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-17.htm">Psalm 107:17-19</a>, the &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506; (evil doers), since the indispensable characteristic of penitence is in this instance wanting, but the &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; (the righteous). Probably the &#1508; strophe stood originally before the &#1506; strophe, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2.htm">Lamentations 2-4</a> the &#1508; precedes the &#1506; (Hitzig). In connection with the present sequence of the thoughts, the structure of <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a> is just like <a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a> : Clamant et Dominus audit  equals  si qui (quicunque) clamant. What is meant is the cry out of the depth of a soul that despairs of itself. Such crying meets with a hearing with God, and in its realisation, an answer that bears its own credentials. "The broken in heart" are those in whom the egotistical, i.e., self-loving life, which encircles its own personality, is broken at the very root; "the crushed or contrite (&#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;, with a changeable a&#772;, after the form &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; from &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;) in spirit" are those whom grievous experiences, leading to penitence, of the false eminence to which their proud self-consciousness has raised them, have subdued and thoroughly humbled. To all such Jahve is nigh, He preserves them from despair, He is ready to raise up in them a new life upon the ruins of the old and to cover or conceal their infinitive deficiency; and, they, on their part, being capable of receiving, and desirous of, salvation, He makes them partakers of His salvation. It is true these afflictions come upon the righteous, but Jahve rescues him out of them all, &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1503; (the same enallage generis as in <a href="/ruth/1-19.htm">Ruth 1:19</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11</a>). He is under the most special providence, "He keepeth all his bones, not one of them (ne unum quidem) is broken" - a pictorial exemplification of the thought that God does not suffer the righteous to come to the extremity, that He does not suffer him to be severed from His almighty protecting love, nor to become the sport of the oppressors. Nevertheless we call to mind the literal fulfilment which these words of the psalmist received in the Crucified One; for the Old Testament prophecy, which is quoted in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/19-33.htm">John 19:33-37</a>, may be just as well referred to our Psalm as to <a href="/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a>. Not only the Paschal lamb, but in a comparative sense even every affliction of the righteous, is a type. Not only is the essence of the symbolism of the worship of the sanctuary realised in Jesus Christ, not only is the history of Israel and of David repeated in Him, not only does human suffering attain in connection with Him its utmost intensity, but all the promises given to the righteous are fulfilled in Him &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;; because He is the righteous One in the most absolute sense, the Holy One of God in a sense altogether unique (<a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>, <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>; <a href="/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a>). - The righteous is always preserved from extreme peril, whereas evil (&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;) slays (&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514; stronger than &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;) the ungodly: evil, which he loved and cherished, becomes the executioner's power, beneath which he falls. And they that hate the righteous must pay the penalty. Of the meanings to incur guilt, to feel one's self guilty, and to undergo punishment as being guilty, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; (vid., on <a href="/1_samuel/14-13.htm">1 Samuel 14:13</a>) has the last in this instance. </body></html>
