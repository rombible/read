The suffix, which refers to the enemies as the authors of the destructions (<a href="/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>), shows that it is not to be rendered "from their destroyers" (Hitzig). If God continues thus to look on instead of acting, then the destructions, which are passing over David's soul, will utterly destroy it. Hence the prayer: lead it back, bring that back, which is already well night borne away to destruction. On &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492; vid., <a href="/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>.
