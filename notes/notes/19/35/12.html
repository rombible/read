For the good David did in killing Goliath, and slaying his ten thousands of the Philistines, and thereby saving his king and country, Saul and his courtiers envied him, and sought to slay him: so our Lord Jesus Christ, for all the good he did to the Jews, by healing their bodies of diseases, and preaching the Gospel to them for the benefit of their souls, was rewarded with reproaches and persecutions, and at last with the shameful death of the cross; and in like manner are his people used; but this is an evil that shall not go unpunished; see <a href="/proverbs/17-13.htm">Proverbs 17:13</a>.

On the figure on <a href="/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a> cf. <a href="/psalms/83-14.htm">Psalm 83:14</a>. The clauses respecting the Angel of Jahve, <a href="/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-6.htm">Psalm 35:6</a>, are circumstantial clauses, viz., clauses defining the manner. &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; (giving, viz., them, the push that shall cause their downfall, equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501; or &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;, <a href="/psalms/68-28.htm">Psalm 68:28</a>) is closely connected with the figure in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-6.htm">Psalm 35:6</a>, and &#1512;&#1491;&#1508;&#1501;, with the figure in <a href="/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a>; consequently it seems as though the original position of these two clauses respecting the Angel of Jahve had been disturbed; just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, the &#1506; strophe and the &#1508; strophe have changed their original places. It is the Angel, who took off Pharaoh's chariot wheels so that they drave them heavily (<a href="/exodus/14-25.htm">Exodus 14:25</a>) that is intended here. The fact that this Angel is concerned here, where the point at issue is whether the kingship of the promise shall be destroyed at its very beginning or not, harmonises with the appearing of the &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1492; at all critical junctures in the course of the history of redemption. &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, loca passim lubrica, is an intensive form of expression for &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; rof noisserp, <a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18</a>.
