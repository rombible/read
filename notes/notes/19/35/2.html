This is a fruit of the old enmity in the seed of the serpent against the Seed of the woman. David in his afflictions, Christ in his sufferings, the church under persecution, and the Christian in the hour temptation, all beseech the Almighty to appear in their behalf, and to vindicate their cause. We are apt to justify uneasiness at the injuries men do us, by our never having given them cause to use us so ill; but this should make us easy, for then we may the more expect that God will plead our cause. David prayed to God to manifest himself in his trial. Let me have inward comfort under all outward troubles, to support my soul. If God, by his Spirit, witness to our spirits that he is our salvation, we need desire no more to make us happy. If God is our Friend, no matter who is our enemy. By the Spirit of prophecy, David foretells the just judgments of God that would come upon his enemies for their great wickedness. These are predictions, they look forward, and show the doom of the enemies of Christ and his kingdom. We must not desire or pray for the ruin of any enemies, except our lusts and the evil spirits that would compass our destruction. A traveller benighted in a bad road, is an expressive emblem of a sinner walking in the slippery and dangerous ways of temptation. But David having committed his cause to God, did not doubt of his own deliverance. The bones are the strongest parts of the body. The psalmist here proposes to serve and glorify God with all his strength. If such language may be applied to outward salvation, how much more will it apply to heavenly things in Christ Jesus!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Take hold of shield and buckler - That is, Arm thyself as if for the contest.

The imprecations of the first part including a brief notice of their conduct, the fuller exposition of their hypocrisy and malice in the second, and the earnest prayer for deliverance from their scornful triumph in the last, are each closed (Ps 35:9, 10, 18, 27, 28) with promises of praise for the desired relief, in which his friends will unite.

The prepositions &#1488;&#1500; and &#1489;&#1468;, in <a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>, are a well considered interchange of expression: the former, of gracious inclination (<a href="/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>), the latter, of hostile intention or determining, as in <a href="/job/7-8.htm">Job 7:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11</a>, after the phrase in <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a>. The evil doers are overwhelmed by the power of destruction that proceeds from the countenance of Jahve, which is opposed to them, until there is not the slightest trace of their earthly existence left. The subjects to <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a> are not, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-17.htm">Psalm 107:17-19</a>, the &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506; (evil doers), since the indispensable characteristic of penitence is in this instance wanting, but the &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; (the righteous). Probably the &#1508; strophe stood originally before the &#1506; strophe, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2.htm">Lamentations 2-4</a> the &#1508; precedes the &#1506; (Hitzig). In connection with the present sequence of the thoughts, the structure of <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a> is just like <a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a> : Clamant et Dominus audit  equals  si qui (quicunque) clamant. What is meant is the cry out of the depth of a soul that despairs of itself. Such crying meets with a hearing with God, and in its realisation, an answer that bears its own credentials. "The broken in heart" are those in whom the egotistical, i.e., self-loving life, which encircles its own personality, is broken at the very root; "the crushed or contrite (&#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;, with a changeable a&#772;, after the form &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; from &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;) in spirit" are those whom grievous experiences, leading to penitence, of the false eminence to which their proud self-consciousness has raised them, have subdued and thoroughly humbled. To all such Jahve is nigh, He preserves them from despair, He is ready to raise up in them a new life upon the ruins of the old and to cover or conceal their infinitive deficiency; and, they, on their part, being capable of receiving, and desirous of, salvation, He makes them partakers of His salvation. It is true these afflictions come upon the righteous, but Jahve rescues him out of them all, &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1503; (the same enallage generis as in <a href="/ruth/1-19.htm">Ruth 1:19</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11</a>). He is under the most special providence, "He keepeth all his bones, not one of them (ne unum quidem) is broken" - a pictorial exemplification of the thought that God does not suffer the righteous to come to the extremity, that He does not suffer him to be severed from His almighty protecting love, nor to become the sport of the oppressors. Nevertheless we call to mind the literal fulfilment which these words of the psalmist received in the Crucified One; for the Old Testament prophecy, which is quoted in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/19-33.htm">John 19:33-37</a>, may be just as well referred to our Psalm as to <a href="/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a>. Not only the Paschal lamb, but in a comparative sense even every affliction of the righteous, is a type. Not only is the essence of the symbolism of the worship of the sanctuary realised in Jesus Christ, not only is the history of Israel and of David repeated in Him, not only does human suffering attain in connection with Him its utmost intensity, but all the promises given to the righteous are fulfilled in Him &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;; because He is the righteous One in the most absolute sense, the Holy One of God in a sense altogether unique (<a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>, <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>; <a href="/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a>). - The righteous is always preserved from extreme peril, whereas evil (&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;) slays (&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514; stronger than &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;) the ungodly: evil, which he loved and cherished, becomes the executioner's power, beneath which he falls. And they that hate the righteous must pay the penalty. Of the meanings to incur guilt, to feel one's self guilty, and to undergo punishment as being guilty, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; (vid., on <a href="/1_samuel/14-13.htm">1 Samuel 14:13</a>) has the last in this instance. </body></html>
