And as he complains, every thing that was done to, or respecting him, was done with a design to insnare and destroy him. Yet, in the midst of all, he knew he was under the eye and guardian care of his all-wise and almighty Friend: in him he trusted, and this was his support and comfort.

We are apt to show our troubles too much to ourselves, poring upon them, which does us no service; whereas, by showing them to God, we might cast the cares upon him who careth for us, and thereby ease ourselves. Nor should we allow any complaint to ourselves or others, which we cannot make to God. When our spirits are overwhelmed by distress, and filled with discouragement; when we see snares laid for us on every side, while we walk in his way, we may reflect with comfort that the Lord knoweth our path. Those who in sincerity take the Lord for their God, find him all-sufficient, as a Refuge, and as a Portion: every thing else is a refuge of lies, and a portion of no value. In this situation David prayed earnestly to God. We may apply it spiritually; the souls of believers are often straitened by doubts and fears. And it is then their duty and interest to beg of God to set them at liberty, that they may run the way of his commandments. Thus the Lord delivered David from his powerful persecutors, and dealt bountifully with him. Thus he raised the crucified Redeemer to the throne of glory, and made him Head over all things for his church. Thus the convinced sinner cries for help, and is brought to praise the Lord in the company of his redeemed people; and thus all believers will at length be delivered from this evil world, from sin and death, and praise their Saviour for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/142.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When my spirit was overwhelmed within me - Luther renders this, "When my spirit was in distress." The Hebrew word rendered "overwhelmed" means, in Kal, to cover as with a garment; then, to be covered as with darkness, trouble, sorrow; and then, to languish, to faint, to be feeble: <a href="/psalms/77-3.htm">Psalm 77:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/107-5.htm">Psalm 107:5</a>. The idea here is, that, in his troubles, he had no vigor, no life, no spirit. He did not see how he could escape from his troubles, and he had no heart to make an effort.<p>Then thou knewest my path - Thou didst see all. Thou didst see the way that I was treading, and all its darkness and dangers, implying here that God had made it an object to mark his course; to see what egress there might be - what way to escape from the danger. It was in no sense concealed from God, and no danger of the way was hidden from him. It is much for us to feel when we are in danger or difficulty that God knows it all, and that nothing can be hidden from him.<p>In the way wherein I walked - In my path; the path that I was treading.<p>Have they privily laid a snare for me - They treated me as a man would treat his neighbor, who should spread a snare, or set a trap, for him in the path which he knew he must take. The word rendered "have privily laid" means to hide, to conceal. It was so concealed that I could not perceive it. They did it unknown to me. I neither knew that it was laid, nor where it was laid. They meant to spring it upon me at a moment when I was not aware, and when I should be taken by surprise. It was not open and manly warfare; it was stealth, cunning, trick, art. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/142.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. thou knewest &#8230; path&#8212;The appeal is indicative of conscious innocence; knowest it to be right, and that my affliction is owing to the snares of enemies, and is not deserved (compare Ps 42:4; 61:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/142.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou knewest, </span> to wit, practically, so as to direct me to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My path; </span> what paths I should choose whereby I might escape Saul, when I fled hither and thither in deserts, and mountains, and woods; and which way I should get out of his hands when he and all his men were at the cave’s mouth, which passed my skill. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Wherein I walked; </span> wherein I used to walk, or they supposed that I would walk. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/142.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,.... Ready to sink and faint under the present affliction, being attended with the hidings of God's face, and with unbelieving frames; which is sometimes the case of God's people, and with which they are as it were covered and overwhelmed, as well as with a sense of sin, and with shame and sorrow for it; see <a href="/psalms/61-2.htm">Psalm 61:2</a>; <p>then thou knewest my path: the eyes of the Lord are upon all men, and he knows their goings, none of them are hid from him; and he sees and approves of the way, of the life and conversation of his people in general; and particularly observes what way they take under affliction, which is to apply to him for help and deliverance, <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>. R.

David, thoroughly conscious of his sins against God and of his imperfection as a monarch, says, in opposition to the abuse which he is now suffering, that he would gladly accept any friendly reproof: "let a righteous man smite in kindness and reprove me - head-oil (i.e., oil upon the head, to which such reproof is likened) shall my head not refuse." So we render it, following the accents, and not as Hupfeld, Kurtz, and Hitzig do: "if a righteous man smites me, it is love; if he reproves me, an anointing of the head is it unto me;" in connection with which the designation of the subject with &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; would be twice wanting, which is more than is admissible. &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; stands here as an abstract substantive: the righteous man, whoever he may be, in antithesis, namely, to the rebels and to the people who have joined them. Amyraldus, Maurer, and Hengstenberg understand it of God; but it only occurs of God as an attribute, and never as a direct appellation. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>, is equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, cum benignitate  equals  benigne. What is meant is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>, what Paul (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>) styles &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#836;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. and &#1492;&#1500;&#1501;, tundere, is used of the strokes of earnest but well-meant reproof, which is called "the blows of a friend" in <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>. Such reproof shall be to him as head-oil (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>), which his head does not despise. &#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, written defectively for &#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;, like &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>, &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;, <a href="/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a> and frequently; &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488; (root &#1504;&#1488;, Arab. n', with the nasal n, which also expresses the negation in the Indo-Germanic languages) here signifies to deny, as in <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10</a> to bring to nought, to destroy. On the other hand, the lxx renders &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, which is also followed by the Syriac and Jerome, perhaps after the Arabic nawiya, to become or to be fat, which is, however, altogether foreign to the Aramaic, and is, moreover, only used of fatness of the body, and in fact of camels. The meaning of the figure is this: well-meant reproof shall be acceptable and spiritually useful to him. The confirmation &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; follows, which is enigmatical both in meaning and expression. This &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; is the cipher of a whole clause, and the following &#1493; is related to this &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; as the Waw that introduces the apodosis, not to &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>, since no progression and connection is discernible if &#1499;&#1497; is taken as a subordinating quia. We interpret thus: for it is still so (the matter still stands thus), that my prayer is against their wickednesses; i.e., that I use no weapon but that of prayer against these, therefore let me always be in that spiritual state of mind which is alive to well-meant reproof. Mendelssohn's rendering is similar: I still pray, whilst they practise infamy. On &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1493; cf. <a href="/zechariah/8-20.htm">Zechariah 8:20</a> &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (vid., Khler), and <a href="/proverbs/24-27.htm">Proverbs 24:27</a> &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; &#1493;. He who has prayed God in <a href="/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a> to set a watch upon his mouth is dumb in the presence of those who now have dominion, and seeks to keep himself clear of their sinful doings, whereas he willingly allows himself to be chastened by the righteous; and the more silent he is towards the world (see <a href="/amos/5-13.htm">Amos 5:13</a>), the more constant is he in his intercourse with God. But there will come a time when those who now behave as lords shall fall a prey to the revenge of the people who have been misled by them; and on the other hand, the confession of the salvation, and of the order of the salvation, of God, that has hitherto been put to silence, will again be able to make itself freely heard, and find a ready hearing.<p>As <a href="/psalms/141-6.htm">Psalm 141:6</a> says, the new rulers fall a prey to the indignation of the people and are thrown down the precipices, whilst the people, having again come to their right mind, obey the words of David and find them pleasant and beneficial (vid., <a href="/proverbs/15-26.htm">Proverbs 15:26</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>). &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468; is to be explained according to <a href="/2_kings/9-33.htm">2 Kings 9:33</a>.

We here discern the hope of a resurrection, if not directly, at least (cf. Oehler in Herzog's Real-Encyclopdie, concluding volume, S. 422) as am emblem of victory in spite of having succumbed. That which authorizes this interpretation lies in the figure of the husbandman, and in the conditional clause (<a href="/psalms/141-8.htm">Psalm 141:8</a>), which leads to the true point of the comparison; for as a complaint concerning a defeat that had been suffered: "so are our bones scattered for the mouth of the grave (in order to be swallowed up by it)," <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/141-7.htm">Psalm 141:7</a>, would be alien and isolated with respect to what precedes and what follows. </body></html>
