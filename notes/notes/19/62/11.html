We must so trust in him at all times, as not at any time to put that trust in ourselves, or in any creature, which is to be put in him only. Trust in him to guide us when in doubt, to protect us when in danger, to supply us when in want, to strengthen us for every good word and work. We must lay out wants and our wishes before him, and then patiently submit our wills to his: this is pouring out our hearts. God is a refuge for all, even for as many as will take shelter in him. The psalmist warns against trusting in men. The multitude, those of low degree, are changeable as the wind. The rich and noble seem to have much in their power, and lavish promises; but those that depend on them, are disappointed. Weighed in the balance of Scripture, all that man can do to make us happy is lighter than vanity itself. It is hard to have riches, and not to trust in them if they increase, though by lawful and honest means; but we must take heed, lest we set our affections unduly upon them. A smiling world is the most likely to draw the heart from God, on whom alone it should be set. The consistent believer receives all from God as a trust; and he seeks to use it to his glory, as a steward who must render an account. God hath spoken as it were once for all, that power belongs to him alone. He can punish and destroy. Mercy also belongs to him; and his recompensing the imperfect services of those that believe in him, blotting out their transgressions for the Redeemer's sake, is a proof of abundant mercy, and encourages us to trust in him. Let us trust in his mercy and grace, and abound in his work, expecting mercies from him alone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/62.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this - This repetition, or this declaration that he had heard the thing repeated, is designed to give emphasis to what was said, or to call attention to it as particularly worthy of notice. See the notes at <a href="/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14</a>. Compare <a href="/job/40-5.htm">Job 40:5</a>. The sentiment here is particularly important, or is deserving of special attention, because, as the psalmist had shown, all other resources fail, and confidence is to be placed in nothing else for that which man so much needs; neither in people, whether of low degree or high <a href="/psalms/62-9.htm">Psalm 62:9</a>; not in oppressive acts - acts of mere power; not in plunder; not in wealth, however acquired, <a href="/psalms/62-10.htm">Psalm 62:10</a>.<p>That power belongeth unto God - Margin, strength. The idea is, that the strength which man needs - the ability to defend and to save him - is to be found in God. All else may fail, but the power of God will not fail.

One word of his is more to be confided in, and depended on, than all the men and things in the world. The meaning is not that God hath only spoke once; he has spoke often; he spoke all things out of nothing in creation; he spoke all the words of the law at Mount Sinai; he spoke by the prophets under the Old Testament dispensation, and by his Son in the last days, and still by the ministers of the Gospel: but the sense is, that what God has once spoken stands; it is irreversible and immutable; it is firm, sure, and unalterable; he does not repent, he cannot lie, nor will he alter the thing that is gone out of his lips; and therefore his word is to be trusted to, when men of high degree are a lie; <p>twice have I heard this; that is, many times, as Kimchi explains it: the Targum refers this, and the preceding clause, to the delivery of the law: <p>"one law God spake, and twice we heard it from the mouth of Moses the great scribe;'' <p>but the meaning is, that the psalmist had heard of two things, and was well assured of the truth of them, and which were the foundation of his trust and confidence; one is mentioned in this verse and the other in <a href="/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a>; the first is, <p>that power belongeth unto God; great power, even almighty power, as appears from the creation of all things out of nothing, the preservation of them in their beings, the government of the world, the redemption of his people by Christ, the work of grace upon their hearts by his Spirit, the perseverance of the saints, their deliverance from their enemies, and the destruction of them. The ancient Cabalists (n) among the Jews have endeavoured, from this passage, to establish a Trinity in unity, they speak of <p>"three superior "Sephirot", or numbers; and of them it is said, "God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this": once and twice, lo, the three superior numbers, of whom it is said, one, one, one, three ones; and this is the meaning of "God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this; this" in it makes them one.'' <p>(n) Tikkune Zohar, Correct. 38. fol. 82. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/62.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">God hath spoken <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> once; twice have I heard this; that power <i>belongeth</i> unto God.</span><p>(i) He has plainly born witness to his power, so that no one needs to doubt it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/62.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11, 12</span>.

The poet again takes up the emotional affirmations of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-3.htm">Psalm 62:3</a>, and, firm and defiant in faith, opposes them to his masked enemies. Here what he says to his soul is very similar to what he said of his soul in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>, inasmuch as he makes his own soul objective and exalts himself above her; and it is just in this that the secret of personality consists. He here admonishes her to that silence which in <a href="/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a> he has already acknowledged as her own; because all spiritual existence as being living remains itself unchanged only by means of a perpetual "becoming" (mittelst steten Werdens), of continuous, self-conscious renovation. The "hope" in <a href="/psalms/62-6.htm">Psalm 62:6</a> is intended to be understood according to that which forms its substance, which here is nothing more nor less than salvation, <a href="/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>. That for which he who resigns himself to God hopes, comes from God; it cannot therfore fail him, for God the Almighty One and plenteous in mercy is surety for it. David renounces all help in himself, all personal avenging of his own honour - his salvation and his honour are &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (vid., on <a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>). The rock of his strength, i.e., his strong defence, his refuge, is &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;; it is where Elohim is, Elohim is it in person (&#1489;&#1468; as in <a href="/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>). By &#1506;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-9.htm">Psalm 62:9</a>, the king addresses those who have reamined faithful to him, whose feeble faith he has had to chide and sustain in other instances also in the Psalms belonging to this period. The address does not suit the whole people, who had become for the most part drawn into the apostasy. Moreover it would then have been &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; (my people). &#1506;&#1501; frequently signifies the people belonging to the retinue of a prince (<a href="/judges/3-18.htm">Judges 3:18</a>), or in the service of any person of rank (<a href="/1_kings/19-21.htm">1 Kings 19:21</a>), or belonging to any union of society whatever (<a href="/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42</a>.). David thus names those who cleave to him; and the fact that he cannot say "my people" just shows that the people as a body had become alienated from him. But those who have remained to him of the people are not therefore to despair; but they are to pour out before God, who will know how to protect both them and their king, whatever may lie heavily upon their heart. </body></html>
