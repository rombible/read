See the ground and reason of this dependence. By his grace he has supported me, and by his providence delivered me. He only can be my Rock and my salvation; creatures are nothing without him, therefore I will look above them to him. Trusting in God, the heart is fixed. If God be for us, we need not fear what man can do against us. David having put his confidence in God, foresees the overthrow of his enemies. We have found it good to wait upon the Lord, and should charge our souls to have such constant dependence upon him, as may make us always easy. If God will save my soul, I may well leave every thing else to his disposal, knowing all shall turn to my salvation. And as David's faith in God advances to an unshaken stedfastness, so his joy in God improves into a holy triumph. Meditation and prayer are blessed means of strengthening faith and hope.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/62.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He only is my rock ... - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>.<p>I shall not be greatly moved - The word greatly here, or much - "I shall not be much moved," implies that he did not anticipate perfect security from danger or calamity; he did not suppose that he would escape all disaster or trouble, but he felt that no great evil would befall him, that his most important interests were safe, and that he would be ultimately secure. He would be restored to his home and his throne, and would be favored with future peace and tranquility. None of us can hope wholly to escape calamity in this life. It is enough if we can be assured that our great interests will be ultimately secured; that we shall be safe at last in the heavenly world. Having that confidence the soul may be, and should be, calm; and we need little apprehend what will occur in this world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/62.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

It is the feeling of homelessness and of separation from the abode of God by reason of which the distance, in itself so insignificant (just as was the case with the exiles later on), became to him immeasurably great. For he still continually needed God's helpful intervention; the enveloping, the veiling, the faintness of his heart still continues (&#1506;&#1496;&#1507;, Arab. &#8219;tf, according to its radical signification: to bend and lay anything round so that it lies or draws over something else and covers it, here of a self-enveloping); a rock of difficulties still ever lies before him which is too high for his natural strength, for his human ability, therefore insurmountable. But he is of good courage: God will lead him up with a sure step, so that, removed from all danger, he will have rocky ground under his feet. He is of good courage, for God has already proved Himself to be a place of refuge to him, to be a strong tower, defying all attack, which enclosed him, the persecuted one, so that the enemy can gain no advantage over him (cf. <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>). He is already on the way towards his own country, and in fact his most dearly loved and proper home: he will or he has to (in accordance with the will of God) dwell (cf. the cohortative in <a href="/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-21.htm">Jeremiah 4:21</a>) in God's tabernacle (vid., on <a href="/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1</a>) throughout aeons (an utterance which reminds one of the synchronous <a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>). With &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is combined the idea of the divine protection (cf. Arabic g&#769;a&#770;r ollah, the charge or proteg of God, and Beduinic g&#769;aur, the protecting hearth; g&#769;awir, according to its form  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;, one who flees for refuge to the hearth). A bold figure of this protection follows: he has to, or will trust, i.e., find refuge, beneath the protection of God's wings. During the time the tabernacle was still being moved from place to place we hear no such mention of dwelling in God's tabernacle or house. It was David who coined this expression for loving fellowship with the God of revelation, simultaneously with his preparation of a settled dwelling-place for the sacred Ark. In the Psalms that belong to the time of his persecution by Saul such an expression is not yet to be found; for in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>, when it is desired that Doeg may have the opposite of an eternal dwelling-place, it is not the sacred tent that is meant. We see also from its second part that this <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1-8</a> does not belong to the time of Saul; for David does not speak here as one who has drawn very near to his kingly office (cf. <a href="/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>), but as one who is entering upon a new stage in it. </body></html>
