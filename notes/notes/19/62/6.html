See the ground and reason of this dependence. By his grace he has supported me, and by his providence delivered me. He only can be my Rock and my salvation; creatures are nothing without him, therefore I will look above them to him. Trusting in God, the heart is fixed. If God be for us, we need not fear what man can do against us. David having put his confidence in God, foresees the overthrow of his enemies. We have found it good to wait upon the Lord, and should charge our souls to have such constant dependence upon him, as may make us always easy. If God will save my soul, I may well leave every thing else to his disposal, knowing all shall turn to my salvation. And as David's faith in God advances to an unshaken stedfastness, so his joy in God improves into a holy triumph. Meditation and prayer are blessed means of strengthening faith and hope.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/62.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He only is my rock ... - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>. The only difference between this verse and <a href="/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a> is, that in this verse the word "greatly" is omitted. The psalmist declares here in the most absolute manner, that he shall not be "moved" at all. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>, he said that he would not be "greatly moved;" his mind would not be much or materially disturbed. The language here indicates more entire confidence - more certain conviction - showing that the slight apprehension or fear which existed in the beginning of the psalm, had been wholly dissipated, and that his mind had become perfectly calm. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/62.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. not be moved&#8212;not at all; his confidence has increased.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/62.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/62.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He only is my rock and my salvation,....

Identical with ver. 2, except in the omission of the single word "greatly." The psalmist's confidence has increased. He feels now that, whatever his enemies may attempt, he will not be shaken at all. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/61.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second part begins with a confirmation of the gracious purpose of God expressed in <a href="/psalms/61-5.htm">Psalm 61:5</a>. David believes that he shall experience what he gives expression to in <a href="/psalms/61-5.htm">Psalm 61:5</a>; for God has already practically shown him that neither his life nor his kingship shall come to an end yet; He has answered the prayers of His chosen one, that, blended with vows, resulted from the lowly, God-resigned spirit which finds expression in <a href="/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a>., and He has given or delivered up to him the land which is his by inheritance, when threatened by the rebels as robbers, - the land to which those who fear the covenant God have a just claim. It is clear enough that the receivers are "those who fear the name of Jahve;" the genitive relation describes the &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; as belonging to them in opposition to those who had usurped it. Or does &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; here perhaps mean the same as &#1488;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; in <a href="/psalms/21-3.htm">Psalm 21:3</a>? Certainly not. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1500; is a customary phrase, the meaning of which, "to give anything to any one as his inheritance or as his own property," is to be retained (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). God has acknowledged David's cause; the land of Israel is again wrested from those to whom it does not belong; and now begins a new era in the reign of its rightful king. In view of this the king prays, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/61-7.htm">Psalm 61:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a>, that God would add another goodly portion to the duration of his life. The words sound like intercession, but the praying one is the same person as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/61-2.htm">Psalm 61:2-5</a>. The expression &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1488; (the King Messiah) of the Targum shows to whom the church referred the word "king" after the extinction of the Davidic dynasty. The exalted tone of the wish expressed in <a href="/psalms/61-7.htm">Psalm 61:7</a> (cf. <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>) favours this without absolutely requiring it (cf. &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/61-5.htm">Psalm 61:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/21-5.htm">Psalm 21:5</a>, and the royal salutation, <a href="/1_kings/1-31.htm">1 Kings 1:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-4.htm">Daniel 2:4</a>, and frequently). There ought (as also e.g., in <a href="/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>) not to be any question whether &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; in <a href="/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a> signifies "to sit enthroned," or "to sit"  equals  "to abide;" when the person spoken of is a king it means "to remain enthroned," for with him a being settled down and continuous enthronement are coincident. &#1502;&#1503; in <a href="/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a> is imperat. apoc. for &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; (after the form &#1492;&#1505;, &#1504;&#1505;, &#1510;&#1493;). The poet prays God to appoint mercy and truth as guardian angels to the king (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-12.htm">Psalm 40:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-28.htm">Proverbs 20:28</a>, where out of pause it is &#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;; cf. on the other hand <a href="/psalms/78-7.htm">Psalm 78:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-2.htm">Proverbs 5:2</a>). Since the poet himself is the king for whom he prays, the transition to the first person in v. 9 is perfectly natural. &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; signifies, as it always does, so or thus  equals  in accordance therewith, corresponding to the fulfilment of these my petitions, thankfully responding to it. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497; is the infinitive of the aim or purpose. Singing praise and accompanying it with music, he will make his whole life one continuous paying of vows. </body></html>
