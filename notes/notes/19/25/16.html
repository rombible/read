It is good thus to hope, and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. And if God turns to us, no matter who turns from us. He pleads his own integrity. Though guilty before God, yet, as to his enemies, he had the testimony of conscience that he had done them no wrong. God would, at length, give Israel rest from all their enemies round about. In heaven, God's Israel will be perfectly redeemed from all troubles. Blessed Saviour, thou hast graciously taught us that without thee we can do nothing. Do thou teach us how to pray, how to appear before thee in the way which thou shalt choose, and how to lift up our whole hearts and desires after thee, for thou art the Lord our righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Turn thee unto me - Rather, the Hebrew means: "look upon me." The idea, however, is that the face of God was, as it were, turned in another direction, or that He was not attentive to him; and he prays that He would turn and behold him; that He would see him in his trouble.<p>And have mercy upon me - The psalmist seems to have felt that if God would look upon him he would pity him. He would see his case to be so sad that He would show him compassion - as, when we see an object of distress, "the eye affects the heart."<p>For I am desolate - The word here rendered "desolate" - &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1491;  ya&#770;ch&#305;&#770;yd - means properly "one alone, only;" and then, one who "is alone," or who is solitary, forsaken, wretched. There is no deeper sadness that ever comes over the mind than the idea that we are alone in the world; that we do not have a friend; that no one cares for us; that no one is concerned about anything that might happen to us; that no one would care if we were to die; that no one would shed a tear over our grave.<p>And afflicted - In what way we do not know. David, however, was very often in circumstances when he could use this language. The other parts of the psalm show that the "affliction" to which he here refers was that which arose from the recollection of the sins of his early life, and from the designs and purposes of his enemies. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-19. A series of earnest appeals for aid because God had seemed to desert him (compare Ps 13:1; 17:13, &c.), his sins oppressed him, his enemies had enlarged his troubles and were multiplied, increasing in hate and violence (Ps 9:8; 18:48).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/25.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.<p>17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.<p>18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.<p>19 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.<p>20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.<p>21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.<p>22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.<p><a href="/psalms/25-16.htm">Psalm 25:16</a><p>His own eyes were fixed upon God, but he feared that the Lord had averted his face from him in anger. Oftentimes unbelief suggests that God has turned his back upon us. If we know that we turn to God we need not fear that he will turn from us, but may boldly cry, "Turn thee unto me." The ground of quarrel is always in ourselves, and when that is removed there is nothing to prevent our full enjoyment of communion with God. "Have mercy upon me." Saints still must stand upon the footing of mercy; notwithstanding all their experience they cannot get beyond the publican's prayer, "Have mercy upon me." "For I am desolate and afflicted." He was lonely and bowed down. Jesus was in the days of his flesh in just such a condition; none could enter into the secret depths of his sorrows, he trod the winepress alone, and hence he is able to succour in the fullest sense those who tread the solitary path.<p>"Christ leads me through no darker rooms<p>Than he went through before;<p>He that into God's kingdom comes,<p>Must enter by this door."<p><a href="/psalms/25-17.htm">Psalm 25:17</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Turn thee unto me; </span> turn thy face and favour to me, O thou who now hast turned thy back upon me, and forsaken me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I am desolate; </span> destitute of all other hopes and succours; persecuted by mine enemies, and forsaken by the most of my friends; as he was in Absalom’s rebellion. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me,....
