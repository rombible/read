It is certain that none who, by a believing attendance, wait on God, and, by a believing hope, wait for him, shall be ashamed of it. The most advanced believer both needs and desires to be taught of God. If we sincerely desire to know our duty, with resolution to do it, we may be sure that God will direct us in it. The psalmist is earnest for the pardon of his sins. When God pardons sin, he is said to remember it no more, which denotes full remission. It is God's goodness, and not ours, his mercy, and not our merit, that must be our plea for the pardon of sin, and all the good we need. This plea we must rely upon, feeling our own unworthiness, and satisfied of the riches of God's mercy and grace. How boundless is that mercy which covers for ever the sins and follies of a youth spent without God and without hope! Blessed be the Lord, the blood of the great Sacrifice can wash away every stain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O my God, I trust in thee - This is the first thought - a feeling that he had true confidence in God, and that in all the duties of life, in all his trials, and in all his hopes for the future, his reliance was on God alone.<p>Let me not be ashamed - That is, let me never be so forsaken by thee as to have occasion for shame that I have thus trusted in thee. The prayer is not that he might never be ashamed to avow and confess his trust in God, but that he might "find" God to be such a helper and friend that he might never be ashamed on account of the trust which he had put in Him, as if it had been a false reliance; that he might not be disappointed, and made to feel that he had done a foolish thing in confiding in One who was not able to help him. See the word explained in the notes at <a href="/job/6-20.htm">Job 6:20</a>.

He prayed that he might not be vanquished by his foes, and that it might not appear that he had trusted in a Being who was unable to defend him. Applied now to us, the prayer would imply a desire that we may not be so overcome by our spiritual foes as to bring dishonor on ourselves and on the cause which we profess to love; that we may not be held up to the world as those who are unable to maintain the warfare of faith, and exposed to scorn as those who are unfaithful to their trust; that we may not be so forsaken, so left to trial without consolation, so given over to sadness, melancholy, or despair, as to leave the world to say that reliance on God is vain, and that there is no advantage in being his friends. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. not be ashamed&#8212;by disappointment of hopes of relief.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ashamed, </span> i.e. disappointed of my hope, which will be reproachful to me, not without reflection upon thee, of whose power and faithfulness I have made my boast. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O my God, I trust in thee,....

A Talmudic teacher, B. Berachoth 35a, infers from this passage the duty of prayer before meat: He who eats without giving thanks is like one who lays hands upon &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (the sacred things of God); the right to eat is only obtained by prayer.)<p>For He, &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, is the owner of the world, because its Creator. He has founded it upon seas, i.e., the ocean and its streams, &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; (<a href="/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a>); for the waters existed before the dry land, and this has been cast up out of them at God's word, so that consequently the solid land, - which indeed also conceals in its interior a &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>), - rising above the surface of the sea, has the waters, as it were, for its foundation (<a href="/psalms/136-6.htm">Psalm 136:6</a>), although it would more readily sink down into them than keep itself above them, if it were not in itself upheld by the creative power of God. Hereupon arises the question, who may ascend the mountain of Jahve, and stand above in His holy place? The futures have a potential signification: who can have courage to do it? what, therefore, must he be, whom Jahve receives into His fellowship, and with whose worship He is well-pleased? Answer: he must be one innocent in his actions and pure in mind, one who does not lift up his soul to that which is vain (&#1500;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, according to the Masora with Waw minusculum).

The Ker &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is old and acknowledged by the oldest authorities.<p>(Note: The reading &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is adopted by Saadia (in Enumoth ii., where &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;), Juda ha-Levi (Cuzari iii. 27), Abulwalid (Rikma p. 180), Rashi, Kimchi, the Sohar, the Codices (and among others by that of the year 1294) and most editions (among which, the Complutensis has &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; in the text). Nor does Aben-Ezra, whom Norzi has misunderstood, by any means reverse the relation of the Chethb and Ker; to him &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is the Ker, and he explains it as a metaphor (an anthropomorphism): &#1493;&#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1497; &#1491;&#1493;&#1498; &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;. Elias Levita is the only one who rejects the Ker &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;; but he does so though misunderstanding a Masora (vid., Baer's Psalterium p. 130) and not without admitting Masoretic testimony in favour of it (&#1493;&#1499;&#1503; &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1495;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;). He is the only textual critic who rejects it. For Jacob b. Chajim is merely astonished that &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is not to be found in the Masoreth register of words written with Waw and to be read with Jod. And even Norzi does not reject this Ker, which he is obliged to admit has greatly preponderating testimony in its favour, and he would only too gladly get rid of it.)<p>Even the lxx Cod. Alex. translates: &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; whereas Cod. Vat. (Eus., Apollin., Theodor., et al.): &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. Critically it is just as intangible, as it is exegetically incomprehensible; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; might then be equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>, an explanation, however, which does not seem possible even from <a href="/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>. We let this Ker&#1502; alone to its undisturbed critical rights. But that the poet did actually write thus, is incredible.<p>In <a href="/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a> (just as at the close of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1-5</a>), in continued predicates, we are told the character of the man, who is worthy of this privilege, to whom the question in <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a> refers. Such an one shall bear away, or acquire (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, as e.g., <a href="/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>) blessing from Jahve and righteousness from the God of his salvation (<a href="/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-9.htm">Psalm 27:9</a>). Righteousness, i.e., conformity to God and that which is well-pleasing to God, appears here as a gift, and in this sense it is used interchangeably with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-9.htm">Psalm 132:9</a>, <a href="/psalms/132-16.htm">Psalm 132:16</a>). It is the righteousness of God after which the righteous, but not the self-righteous, man hungers and thirsts; that moral perfection which is the likeness of God restored to him and at the same time brought about by his own endeavours; it is the being changed, or transfigured, into the image of the Holy One Himself. With <a href="/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a> the answer to the question of <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a> is at an end; <a href="/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a> adds that those thus qualified, who may accordingly expect to receive God's gifts of salvation, are the true church of Jahve, the Israel of God. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (lit., a revolution, Arabic dahr, root &#1491;&#1512;, to turn, revolve) is used here, as in <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-15.htm">Psalm 73:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a>, of a collective whole, whose bond of union is not contemporaneousness, but similarity of disposition; and it is an alliteration with the &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; (Chethb &#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1493;, without the Jod plur.) which follows. &#1502;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; is a second genitive depending on &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, as in <a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>. Here at the close the predication passes into the form of invocation (Thy face). And &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; is a summarising predicate: in short, these are Jacob, not merely after the flesh, but after the spirit, and thus in truth (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>, cf. <a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>). By interpolating &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, as is done in the lxx and Peshto, and adopted by Ewald, Olshausen, Hupfeld, and Bttcher, the nerve, as it were, of the assertion is cut through. The predicate, which has been expressed in different ways, is concentrated intelligibly enough in the one word &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, towards which it all along tends. And here the music becomes forte. The first part of this double Psalm dies away amidst the playing of the instruments of the Levitical priests; for the Ark was brought in &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a> (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>) is to be read. </body></html>
