It is certain that none who, by a believing attendance, wait on God, and, by a believing hope, wait for him, shall be ashamed of it. The most advanced believer both needs and desires to be taught of God. If we sincerely desire to know our duty, with resolution to do it, we may be sure that God will direct us in it. The psalmist is earnest for the pardon of his sins. When God pardons sin, he is said to remember it no more, which denotes full remission. It is God's goodness, and not ours, his mercy, and not our merit, that must be our plea for the pardon of sin, and all the good we need. This plea we must rely upon, feeling our own unworthiness, and satisfied of the riches of God's mercy and grace. How boundless is that mercy which covers for ever the sins and follies of a youth spent without God and without hope! Blessed be the Lord, the blood of the great Sacrifice can wash away every stain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed - To "wait on the Lord" is an expression denoting true piety, as indicating our dependence on him, and as implying that we look to Him for the command that is to regulate our conduct and for the grace needful to protect and save us. Compare <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>. See also <a href="/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-1.htm">Psalm 40:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>. This petition is indicative of the wish of the pious heart that none who profess to serve God may ever be put to shame; that they may never be overcome by sin; that they may never fall under the power of temptation; that they may not fail of eternal salvation.<p>Let them be ashamed which transgress without cause - This does not imply that any sinners transgress otherwise than without cause, or that they have any good reason for sinning; but it brings into view a prominent thought in regard to sin, that it is without cause. If the wicked had any good reason for their course of life - if they were compelled to do wrong - if the temptations under which they act were so powerful that they could not resist them - if they were not voluntary in their transgressions - then true benevolence would demand of us the prayer that they might not be confounded or put to shame. However, since none of these circumstances occur in the case of the sinner, there is no lack of benevolence in praying that all the workers of evil may be put to confusion; that is, that they may not triumph in an evil course, but that their plans may be defeated, and that they may be arrested in their career. There is no benevolence in desiring the triumph of wickedness; there is no lack of benevolence in praying that all the plans of wicked men may be confounded, and all the purposes of evil be frustrated. True benevolence requires us to pray that all their plans may be arrested, and that the sinner may not be successful in his career. A person may be certain that he is acting out the principles of benevolence when he endeavors to prevent the consummation of the plans and the desires of the wicked. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

David not only prays for himself, but for other saints, as it becomes the people of God to do; for them they waited on the Lord in public worship, attended his house and ordinances, and waited on him for the discoveries of his love, the enjoyment of his voracious presence, and were looking for his salvation, for the Messiah; for those the psalmist prays, that they might not be ashamed of their expectation and hope, by the delay of those things, or the denial them; <p>let them be ashamed which transgress without cause; or "act treacherously without cause" (w); as David's subjects did, who were risen up in rebellion against him, and acted the perfidious part, contrary to their allegiance, and without any just reason, they not being ruled with rigour, and oppressed; but were guided and governed by him according to the laws of God, in the integrity of his heart, and by the skilfulness of his hands; he being a king that reigned in righteousness, and a prince that decreed judgment: and such are those who are now risen up against our rightful sovereign King George (x), a parcel of perfidious treacherous wretches; some of them who were in the last rebellion, and obtained his father's pardon; others that have partook yearly of his royal bounty, for the instruction of their children; and all have enjoyed the blessings of his mild and gentle government; and therefore are without cause his enemies: and for such we should pray, as David did for his enemies, that they might be ashamed; that they may fail in their attempts and designs, and be brought to deserved punishment; see <a href="/psalms/7-4.htm">Psalm 7:4</a>; or "let transgressors be ashamed", and be empty (y); in a state of emptiness and want; lose their wealth, honour, and credit. <p>(w) "qui perfide agunt", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Michaelis; so Amama &amp; Ainsworth.

These are called &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, doors of eternity (not "of the world" as Luther renders it contrary to the Old Testament usage of the language) either as doors which pious faith hopes will last for ever, as Hupfeld and Hitzig explain it, understanding them, in opposition to the inscription of the Psalm, to be the gates of Solomon's Temple; or, what seems to us much more appropriate in the mouth of those who are now standing before the gates, as the portals dating back into the hoary ages of the past (&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; as e.g., in <a href="/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>), the time of the Jebusites, and even of Melchizedek, though which the King of Glory, whose whole being and acts is glory, is now about to enter. It is the gates of the citadel of Zion, to which the cry is addressed, to expand themselves in a manner worthy of the Lord who is about to enter, for whom they are too low and too strait. Rejoicing at the great honour, thus conferred upon them, they are to raise their heads (<a href="/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a>), i.e., lift up their portals (lintels); the doors of antiquity are to open high and wide.<p>(Note: On the Munach instead of Metheg in &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, vid., Baer's Accentsystem vii. 2.)<p>Then the question echoes back to the festal procession from Zion's gates which are wont only to admit mighty lords: who, then (&#1494;&#1492; giving vividness to the question, Ges. 122, 2), is this King of Glory; and they describe Him more minutely: it is the Hero-god, by whom Israel has wrested this Zion from the Jebusites with the sword, and by whom he has always been victorious in time past. The adjectival climactic form &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; (like &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, with &#305;&#774; instead of the a&#774; in &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, &#1511;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;) is only found in one other passage, viz., <a href="/isaiah/43-17.htm">Isaiah 43:17</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; refers back to <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>. Thus then shall the gates raise their heads and the ancient doors lift themselves, i.e., open high and wide; and this is expressed here by Kal instead of Niph. (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; to lift one's self up, rise, as in <a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>), according to the well-known order in which recurring verses and refrain-like repetitions move gently onwards. The gates of Zion ask once more, yet now no longer hesitatingly, but in order to hear more in praise of the great King. It is now the enquiry seeking fuller information; and the heaping up of the pronouns (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>; <a href="/esther/7-5.htm">Esther 7:5</a>) expresses its urgency (quis tandem, ecquisnam). The answer runs, "Jahve Tsebaoth, He is the King of Glory (now making His entry)." &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492; is the proper name of Jahve as King, which had become His customary name in the time of the kings of Israel. &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is a genitive governed by &#1492; and, while it is otherwise found only in reference to human hosts, in this combination it gains, of itself, the reference to the angels and the stars, which are called &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493; in <a href="/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2</a> : Jahve's hosts consisting of celestial heroes, <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>, and of stars standing on the plain of the havens as it were in battle array, <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a> -a reference for which experiences and utterances like those recorded in <a href="/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>., <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-20.htm">Judges 5:20</a>, have prepared the way. It is, therefore, the Ruler commanding innumerable and invincible super-terrestrial powers, who desires admission. The gates are silent and open wide; and Jahve, sitting enthroned above the Cherubim of the sacred Ark, enters into Zion. </body></html>
