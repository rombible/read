If the world be nothing but vanity, may God deliver us from having or seeking our portion in it. When creature-confidences fail, it is our comfort that we have a God to go to, a God to trust in. We may see a good God doing all, and ordering all events concerning us; and a good man, for that reason, says nothing against it. He desires the pardoning of his sin, and the preventing of his shame. We must both watch and pray against sin. When under the correcting hand of the Lord, we must look to God himself for relief, not to any other. Our ways and our doings bring us into trouble, and we are beaten with a rod of our own making. What a poor thing is beauty! and what fools are those that are proud of it, when it will certainly, and may quickly, be consumed! The body of man is as a garment to the soul. In this garment sin has lodged a moth, which wears away, first the beauty, then the strength, and finally the substance of its parts. Whoever has watched the progress of a lingering distemper, or the work of time alone, in the human frame, will feel at once the force of this comparison, and that, surely every man is vanity. Afflictions are sent to stir up prayer. If they have that effect, we may hope that God will hear our prayer. The believer expects weariness and ill treatment on his way to heaven; but he shall not stay here long : walking with God by faith, he goes forward on his journey, not diverted from his course, nor cast down by the difficulties he meets. How blessed it is to sit loose from things here below, that while going home to our Father's house, we may use the world as not abusing it! May we always look for that city, whose Builder and Maker is God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Deliver me from all my transgressions - Recognising, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3-5</a>, his sins as the source of all his troubles and sorrows. If his transgressions were forgiven, he felt assured that his trouble would be removed. His first petition, therefore, is, that his sins might be pardoned, with the implied conscious assurance that then it would be consistent and proper for God to remove his calamity, and deliver him from the evils which had come upon him.<p>Make me not the reproach of the foolish - Of the wicked; of those who are foolish, because they are wicked. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>. The prayer here is, that God would not suffer him to become an object of reproach to wicked and foolish men; that is, as the passage implies, that God would not so continue to treat him as if he were a sinner as to justify to themselves their reproaches of him as a wicked man. In other words, he prays that God would forgive his sin, and would withdraw his hand of affliction, so that even the wicked might see that he was not angry with him, but that he was an object of the divine favor. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/39.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-10.

The Psalmist prays to be delivered not merely from his present afflictions but from the power of the sins which he recognises as the cause of them. Sin gets hold of its victim and brings him into punishment.

The approach to God quickens in every God-fearing man the sense of sin and the longing for pardon. So the psalmist has no sooner thrown himself upon God as his one Hope, than the thought of his sin occurs to him - the sin which has brought upon him all his misery; and his first prayer is to be "delivered" from it. <span class="cmt_word">Make me not the reproach of the foolish</span>. So long as his afflictions continued, the psalmist would be an object of scorn to the fool and the un  =   godly. He prays, therefore, secondly, that the punishment of his sin may cease. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/39.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 39:2-4) The poet relates how he has resolved to bear his own affliction silently in the face of the prosperity of the ungodly, but that his smart was so overpowering that he was compelled involuntarily to break his silence by loud complaint. The resolve follows the introductory &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in cohortatives. He meant to take heed to his ways, i.e., his manner of thought and action, in all their extent, lest he should sin with his tongue, viz., by any murmuring complaint concerning his own misfortune, when he saw the prosperity of the ungodly. He was resolved to keep (i.e., cause invariably to press) a bridling (cf. on the form, <a href="/genesis/30-37.htm">Genesis 30:37</a>), or a bridle (capistrum), upon his mouth, so long as he should see the ungodly continuing and sinning in the fulness of his strength, instead of his speedy ruin which one ought to expect. Then he was struck dumb &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, in silence, i.e., as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-26.htm">Lamentations 3:26</a>, in resigned submission, he was silent &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, turned away from (vid., <a href="/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8</a>, and frequently) prosperity, i.e., from that in which he saw the evil-doer rejoicing; he sought to silence for ever the perplexing contradiction between this prosperity and the righteousness of God. But this self-imposed silence gave intensity to the repressed pain, and this was thereby &#1504;&#1506;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;, stirred up, excited, aroused; the inward heat became, in consequence of restrained complaint, all the more intense (<a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>): "and while I was musing a fire was kindled," i.e., the thoughts and emotions rubbing against one another produced a blazing fire, viz., of irrepressible vexation, and the end of it was: "I spake with my tongue," unable any longer to keep in my pain. What now follows is not what was said by the poet when in this condition. On the contrary, he turns away from his purpose, which has been proved to be impracticable, to God Himself with the prayer that He would teach him calm submission. </body></html>
