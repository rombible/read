One particularly, in whom David had reposed great confidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think it strange, if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Have not we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while on earth, give heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed on earth and in heaven render to their God and Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All that hate me whisper together against me - They talk the matter over where they suppose that no one can hear; they endeavonr to collect and arrange all that can be said against me; they place all that they can say or think as individuals, all that they have separately known or suspected, into "common stock," and make use of it against me. There is a conspiracy against me - a purpose to do me all the evil that they can. This shows that, in the apprehension of the sufferer, the one who came to see for himself <a href="/psalms/41-6.htm">Psalm 41:6</a> came as one of a company - as one deputed or delegated to find some new occasion for a charge against him, and that he had not to suffer under the single malignity of one, but under the combined malignity of many.<p>Against me do they devise my hurt - Margin, as in Hebrew: "evil to me." That is, they devise some report, the truth of which they endeavor to confirm by something that they may observe in my sickness which will be injurious to me, and which will prove to the world that I am a bad man - a man by whose death the world would be benefited. The slanderous report on which they seemed to agree is mentioned in the following verse - that he was suffering under a disease which was directly and manifestly the result of a sinful life, and that it must be fatal. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7, 8.

To show sympathising attention, thoughtful consideration towards such an one (&#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-13.htm">Nehemiah 8:13</a>, cf. &#1506;&#1500; <a href="/proverbs/17-20.htm">Proverbs 17:20</a>) has many promises. The verb &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which elsewhere even means to call to life again (<a href="/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a>), in this instance side by side with preserving, viz., from destruction, has the signification of preserving life or prolonging life (as in <a href="/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>). The Pual &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; signifies to be made happy (<a href="/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>), but also declaratively: to be pronounced happy (<a href="/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>); here, on account of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; that stands with it, it is the latter. The Chethb &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; sets forth as an independent promise that which the Ker &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; joins on to what has gone before as a consequence. &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/41-3.htm">Psalm 41:3</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a> and frequently), expresses a negative with full sympathy in the utterance. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; as in <a href="/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>. The supporting in <a href="/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a> is a keeping erect, which stops or arrests the man who is sinking down into death and the grave. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; ( equals  davj, similar form to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;, &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;, but wanting in the syllable before the tone) means sickness. If <a href="/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a> is understood of the supporting of the head after the manner of one who waits upon the sick (cf. Sol 2:6), then <a href="/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a> must, with Mendelssohn and others, be understood of the making of the couch or bed. But what then is neat by the word &#1500;&#1498;? &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489; is a sick-bed in <a href="/exodus/21-18.htm">Exodus 21:18</a> in the sense of being bedridden; and &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468; (cf. <a href="/psalms/30-12.htm">Psalm 30:12</a>) is a changing of it into convalescence. By &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493; is not meant the constant lying down of such an one, but the affliction that casts him down, in all its extent. This Jahve turns or changes, so often as such an one is taken ill (&#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, at his falling sick, parallel with &#1491;&#1493;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; &#1491;&#1493;&#1497; htiw). He gives a complete turn to the "sick-bed" towards recovery, so that not a vestige of the sickness remains behind. </body></html>
