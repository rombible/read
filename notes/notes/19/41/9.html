One particularly, in whom David had reposed great confidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think it strange, if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Have not we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while on earth, give heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed on earth and in heaven render to their God and Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, mine own familiar friend - Margin, as in Hebrew: "the man of my peace." The man with whom I was at peace; who had no cause of alienation from me; with whom I was associated in the most peaceful and friendly relations.<p>In whom I trusted - He whom I made my confidential friend, and on whom I supposed I could rely in the time of trouble.<p>Which did eat of my bread - This may either denote one who was supported by him as one of his family, or else one who partook of his hospitality. In the former case, if that is the meaning, he bad a right to expect that, as a matter of gratitude, such an one would stand by him, and not be found among his enemies. In the latter case, if that is the meaning, he had a right to expect that one who had shared his hospitality would not be found among his foes.<p>Hath lifted up his heel against me - Margin, as in Hebrew: "magnified." So the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate. Lather renders this, "hath trodden me under his feet." The figure here is taken from a horse that turns and kicks him that had fed him. This passage is applied <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a> to Judas, with the statement, in regard to him, that what he had done was done "that the Scripture might be fulfilled:" see the notes at that passage. It is not necessary to suppose that the Saviour meant to say that the passage in the psalm had original and exclusive reference to Judas; the phrase employed by the Saviour, "that the Scripture might be fulfilled," may have been used by him in that large sense in which these words are often used as denoting, either:<p>(a) that the language found in the Scriptures, and applicable originally to another case, "would properly express the idea," or describe the fact; or<p>(b) that the case referred to was one of a class; or that, as it was accomplished in the case of David, so in a similar sense it was accomplished in the case of the Saviour.<p>In other words, Judas was regarded as belonging to the same class as the individual to whom the psalm refers. He was one to whom the language of the psalm was applicable; and the Saviour endured the same kind of suffering which the person did who is referred to in the psalm. Thus the language of the Scriptures, applicable to all such cases, received a complete fulfillment in Him. It is remarkable that, in the reference to Judas, the Saviour quotes only a part of the verse: "He that eateth bread with me." He omits, apparently from design, the former part of the verse in the psalm, "mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted," as if he would not even seem to convey the idea that he ever regarded Judas as his intimate friend, or as if he had ever really "trusted" him. He conveys the idea that Judas had partaken largely of his favors, but not that He himself was ever really a stranger to the baseness of his heart, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/6-64.htm">John 6:64</a>, <a href="/john/6-70.htm">John 6:70</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. mine &#8230; friend&#8212;literally, "the man of my peace."<p>eat &#8230; bread&#8212;who depended on me or was well treated by me.<p>hath lifted up heel&#8212;in scornful violence. As David and his fortunes typified Christ and His (compare [586]Introduction), so these words expressed the treatment he received, and also that of his Son and Lord; hence, though not distinctly prophetical, our Saviour (Joh 13:18) applies them to Judas, "that the Scripture may be fulfilled." This last phrase has a wide use in the New Testament, and is not restricted to denote special prophecies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Mine own familiar friend; </span> he means either Ahithophel, or some other perfidious counsellor or courtier, who was a type of Judas, to whom therefore it is applied, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a></span>, as David was a type of Christ in being thus betrayed.

To show sympathising attention, thoughtful consideration towards such an one (&#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-13.htm">Nehemiah 8:13</a>, cf. &#1506;&#1500; <a href="/proverbs/17-20.htm">Proverbs 17:20</a>) has many promises. The verb &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which elsewhere even means to call to life again (<a href="/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a>), in this instance side by side with preserving, viz., from destruction, has the signification of preserving life or prolonging life (as in <a href="/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>). The Pual &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; signifies to be made happy (<a href="/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>), but also declaratively: to be pronounced happy (<a href="/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>); here, on account of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; that stands with it, it is the latter. The Chethb &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; sets forth as an independent promise that which the Ker &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; joins on to what has gone before as a consequence. &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/41-3.htm">Psalm 41:3</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a> and frequently), expresses a negative with full sympathy in the utterance. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; as in <a href="/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>.

If <a href="/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a> is understood of the supporting of the head after the manner of one who waits upon the sick (cf. Sol 2:6), then <a href="/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a> must, with Mendelssohn and others, be understood of the making of the couch or bed. But what then is neat by the word &#1500;&#1498;? &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489; is a sick-bed in <a href="/exodus/21-18.htm">Exodus 21:18</a> in the sense of being bedridden; and &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468; (cf. <a href="/psalms/30-12.htm">Psalm 30:12</a>) is a changing of it into convalescence. By &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493; is not meant the constant lying down of such an one, but the affliction that casts him down, in all its extent. This Jahve turns or changes, so often as such an one is taken ill (&#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, at his falling sick, parallel with &#1491;&#1493;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; &#1491;&#1493;&#1497; htiw).
