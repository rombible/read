One particularly, in whom David had reposed great confidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think it strange, if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Have not we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while on earth, give heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed on earth and in heaven render to their God and Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel - That is, Let the Lord God of Israel be praised, honored, adored. The language is an expression of desire that all honor, all happiness, might be His. It is a recognition of God as the source of the mercies referred to, and an expression of the feeling that he is entitled to universal praise. The word Israel here refers to the people of God as descended from Jacob or Israel.<p>From everlasting, and to everlasting - Through eternity, or eternal ages, - from all past duration to all future duration. The expression "from everlasting to everlasting," would embrace eternity; and the idea is that God is deserving of eternal praise.<p>Amen, and amen - The word "amen" means properly surely, certainly, truly, and is a word expressive of solemn affirmation, or of the desire of the mind that this should be so. Its repetition is emphatic, expressing strong assent to what is said as certainly true, or as eminently the wish of the mind. This benediction marks the close of one of the five books into which the Psalms are commonly divided.

A similar doxology occurs at the end of <a href="/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72, 89</a>, and Psalms 106, not (apparently) as part of the psalm to which it is attached, but as a mark of pause and separation.
