The expression may mean, as in LXX. and Vulg., “a lawless speech,” so the Chaldee, “a perverse word.” Syriac, “a word of iniquity,” or “a physical evil,” as in Authorised Version, or “a moral evil.” The verse is difficult, not only from this ambiguity, but also from that of the verb, which, according to the derivation we take, may mean “cleave” or “pour forth.” Modern scholars prefer the latter, understanding the image as taken from the process of casting metal. <span class= "ital">An incurable wound is poured out </span>(<span class= "ital">welded</span>)<span class= "ital"> upon him. </span>(Comp. “molten,” <a href="/1_kings/7-24.htm" title="And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.">1Kings 7:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-30.htm" title="And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supports: under the laver were supports molten, at the side of every addition.">1Kings 7:30</a>.)

The reproach wherewith they had loaded him, they hoped, would cleave so fast to him, that his name would perish with him, and they should gain their point. Or, their meaning was, The disease, wherewith he is now afflicted, will certainly make an end of him; for it is the punishment of some great, enormous crime, which he will not repent of, and which proves him, however he has appeared, a son of Belial. <span class="ital">And now he lieth, he will rise up no more </span>— Seeing God has begun to punish him, he will continue so to do till he destroy him, and then we shall be rid of him, and divide the spoil of his preferments. <span class="ital">Yea, mine own familiar friend — </span>Probably he means Ahithophel, who had been his bosom friend, and prime minister of state; in whom <span class="ital">he </span>had <span class="ital">trusted, </span>as one inviolably firm to him, and on whose advice he had relied much, in dealing with his enemies: <span class="ital">which did eat of my bread</span> — With whom he had been very intimate, and whom he had taken to sit at the table with him; nay, whom he had maintained and given a livelihood to, and so obliged both in gratitude and interest to adhere to him; <span class="ital">hath lifted up his heel against me — </span>A phrase implying injury joined with insolence and contempt; taken from an unruly horse, which kicks at him that owns and feeds it.

Although these words were literally fulfilled in David, yet the Holy Ghost, who dictated them, looked further in them, even to Christ and Judas, in whom they received a further and fuller accomplishment; and to whom, therefore, they are applied, <a href="/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/41.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>41:5-13 We complain, and justly, of the want of sincerity, and that there is scarcely any true friendship to be found among men; but the former days were no better. One particularly, in whom David had reposed great confidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think it strange, if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Have not we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while on earth, give heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed on earth and in heaven render to their God and Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An evil disease - Margin, "a thing of Belial." The Hebrew is literally "a word of Belial." This has been very variously understood and interpreted. The Septuagint renders it: &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  logon paranomon - wicked word; "a wicked determination" (Thompson); that is, they formed a wicked purpose against him, to wit, by saying that he was now confined to his bed, and could not rise again. The Latin Vulgate renders it in a similar manner: Verbum iniquitum constituerunt adversum me. Luther: "They have formed a wicked device (Bubenstuck) against me;" they behave in a knavish or wicked manner. DeWette, "Destruction (Verderben) or punishnnent (Strafe) is poured upon him." The term rendered "disease" means properly "word" or "thing;" and Prof. Alexander renders it, "A word of Belial is poured upon him." The word rendered "evil, Belial," means literally "without use" - &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1500;  bel&#305;&#770;ya&#8219;al - from &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;  bel&#305;&#770;y, "not or without," and &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;  ya&#8219;al, "use or profit."<p>Then it means worthlessness, wickedness, destruction; and hence, in connection with man, denotes one who is wicked, worthless, abandoned. It is difficult to determine its meaning here. The connection <a href="/psalms/41-3.htm">Psalm 41:3</a> would seem to suggest the idea adopted by our translators; the words themselves would seem rather to convey the idea of some reproach, or harsh saying - some vain, wicked, malicious words that were uttered against him. That there was disease in the case, and that the psalm was composed in view of it, and of the treatment which the author experienced from those who had been his professed friends when suffering under it, seems to me to be manifest from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/41-1.htm">Psalm 41:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/41-3.htm">Psalm 41:3-4</a>, <a href="/psalms/41-8.htm">Psalm 41:8</a>; but it is probable that the reference in this expression is not to the disease, but to the words or the conduct of his calumniators. It is evident from the pronoun him - the third person - that this refers, as our translators have indicated by the words they say to something that they said in regard to him; something which they affirmed as the result of their observations on his condition, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/41-6.htm">Psalm 41:6-7</a>. The true idea, therefore, I think is this: "They say - that is, those who came to see me said - A 'word of evil' - "a sentence of evil or destruction" - is poured upon him. He is suffering under such a 'word of destruction;' or, such a word (that is, sentence) as will involve his destruction, by way of punishment for his sins; therefore all is over with him, and he must die. He can hope to rise no more." This would express the idea that they regarded his death as certain, for he seemed to be under a sentence which made that sure.<p>Cleaveth fast unto him - Or rather, "is poured upon him." The word used here - &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;  tsu&#770;q - means:<p>(1) to be narrow, straitened, compressed; and then<p>(2) to pour out - as metal is poured out <a href="//biblehub.com/job/28-2.htm">Job 28:2</a>, or as words are poured out in prayer <a href="/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>.<p>Here it would seem to mean that such a sentence was poured upon him, or that he had become submerged or swallowed up under it. It was like the pouring out of a torrent on him, overwhelming him with floods of water, so that he could not hope to escape, or to rise again.<p>And now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more - There is no hope for him; no prospect that he will ever get up again. They felt that they might indulge their remarks, therefore, freely, as he would not be able to take revenge on them, and their expectations and hopes were about to be accomplished by his death. Compare <a href="/psalms/41-5.htm">Psalm 41:5</a>. As a part of his sufferings, all this was aggravated by the fact that they regarded those sufferings as full proof of his guilt; that he could not reply to their accusations; and that be was about to die under that imputation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The "thing of Belial" here intended may, perhaps, be the disease from which David was suffering, but is more probably some disgraceful charge or infamous calumny which had been circulated concerning him, and was now crushing him down.

To show sympathising attention, thoughtful consideration towards such an one (&#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-13.htm">Nehemiah 8:13</a>, cf. &#1506;&#1500; <a href="/proverbs/17-20.htm">Proverbs 17:20</a>) has many promises. The verb &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which elsewhere even means to call to life again (<a href="/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a>), in this instance side by side with preserving, viz., from destruction, has the signification of preserving life or prolonging life (as in <a href="/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>). The Pual &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; signifies to be made happy (<a href="/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>), but also declaratively: to be pronounced happy (<a href="/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>); here, on account of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; that stands with it, it is the latter. The Chethb &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; sets forth as an independent promise that which the Ker &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; joins on to what has gone before as a consequence. &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/41-3.htm">Psalm 41:3</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a> and frequently), expresses a negative with full sympathy in the utterance. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; as in <a href="/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>.

Sol 2:6), then <a href="/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a> must, with Mendelssohn and others, be understood of the making of the couch or bed. But what then is neat by the word &#1500;&#1498;? &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489; is a sick-bed in <a href="/exodus/21-18.htm">Exodus 21:18</a> in the sense of being bedridden; and &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468; (cf. <a href="/psalms/30-12.htm">Psalm 30:12</a>) is a changing of it into convalescence.
