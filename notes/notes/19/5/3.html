The word “offering” should be supplied, instead of “prayer.” Henry Vaughan’s fine hymn—<p>“When first thine eyes unveil, give thy soul leave<p>To do the like”—<p>was probably suggested by this verse.<p><span class= "bld">Look up.</span>—The Hebrew is from the root which forms “Mizpeh,” or “watch-tower.” The psalmist looks up for the answer to his prayer as the seer on his tower (<a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm" title="I will stand on my watch, and set me on the tower, and will watch to see what he will say to me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.">Habakkuk 2:1</a>) looked up for his inspiration.

Such he has always been, and he is still as ready to hear prayer as ever. The most encouraging principle of prayer, and the most powerful plea in prayer, is, to look upon him as our King and our God. David also prays to a sin-hating God. sin is folly, and sinners are the greatest of all fools; fools of their own making. Wicked people hate God; justly are they hated of him, and this will be their endless misery and ruin. Let us learn the importance of truth and sincerity, in all the affairs of life. Liars and murderers resemble the devil, and are his children, therefore it may well be expected that God should abhor them. These were the characters of David's enemies; and such as these are still the enemies of Christ and his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord - The voice of prayer. Compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>. Probably he refers here to a general habit of praying in the morning, though he makes a particular reference to his circumstances at that time. Compare <a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>. The psalmist felt, doubtless, that while it was a general duty and privilege to call upon God with the return of each morning, there was a special reason for it in the circumstances in which he then was. See the introduction to the psalm. He was then surrounded by enemies, and was in danger, and it was only in God that he could hope for protection even for a single day. The propriety of looking to God in the morning by prayer commends itself to any reflecting mind. Who knows what a day may bring forth? Who knows what temptations may await him? Who can protect himself from the dangers which may encompass him? Who can enable us to discharge the duties which are incumbent on us every day? Feeble, helpless, sinful, prone to err, in a world of temptation, and surrounded by dangers alike when we see them and when we do not, there is an obvious fitness in looking to God each morning for his guidance and protection; and the resolution of the psalmist here should be the firm purpose of every man.<p>In the morning - Regularly; each morning.<p>Will I direct my prayer unto thee - Margin, as in Hebrew, "set in order." The word used here - &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;  &#8219;a&#770;rak - means properly to place in a row, to put in order, to arrange, e. g., to place wood upon the altar <a href="/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7</a>; to arrange the showbread on the table <a href="/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>, <a href="/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a>. There is, not improbably, an allusion to these customs in the use of the word here; and the meaning may be, that his prayer would be a regularly arranged service before God. It would be a kind of morning sacrifice, and it would be arranged and performed with a suitable regard to the nature of the service - the fact that it was rendered to the great God. There would be a devout regard to propriety - a serious and solemn attention to the duties involved in the act as the worship of a holy God. Prayer should not be rash; it should not be performend negligently or with a light spirit; it should engage the profound thought of the soul, and it should be performed with the same serious regard to time and to propriety which was demanded in the solemn and carefully prescribed rites of the ancient temple-service.<p>And will look up - The word used here - &#1510;&#1508;&#1492;  tsa&#770;pha&#770;h - means, properly, to look about, to view from a distance. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-5.htm">Isaiah 21:5</a>, it refers to a tower which has a wide prospect. Compare Sol 7:4. The idea here is properly that he would watch, narrowly and carefully (as one does who is stationed on a tower), for some token of divine favor - for some answer to his prayer - for some divine interposition - for some intimation of the divine will. This is, perhaps, equivalent to the Saviour's repeated command to "watch and pray." The notion of looking "up" is not necessarily in the word used here, but it indicates the state of mind where there is deep and careful solicitude as to the answer to prayer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. direct&#8212;literally, "set in order," as the showbread was placed or set in order (Ex 40:23).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/5.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.<p>Observe, this is not so much a prayer as a resolution, "'My voice shalt thou hear,' I will not be dumb, I will not be silent, I will not withhold my speech, I will cry to thee, for the fire that dwells within compels me to pray." We can sooner die than live without prayer. None of God's children are possessed with a dumb devil.<p>"In the morning." This is the fittest time for intercourse with God. An hour in the morning is worth two in the evening. While the dew is on the grass, let grace drop upon the soul. Let us give to God the mornings of our days and the morning of our lives. Prayer should be the key of the day and the lock of the night. Devotion should be both the morning star and the evening star.<p>If we merely read our English version, and want an explanation of these two sentences, we find it in the figure of an archer, "I will direct my prayer unto thee, "I will put my prayer upon the bow, I will direct it towards heaven, and then when I have shot up my arrow, 1 will look up to see where it has gone. But the Hebrew has a still fuller meaning than this - "I will direct my prayer." It is the word that is used for the laying in order of the wood and the pieces of the victim upon the altar, and it is used also for the putting of the shewbread upon the table. It means just this: "I will arrange my prayer before thee;" I will lay it out upon the altar in the morning, just as the priest lays out the morning sacrifice. I will arrange my prayer; or, as old Master Trapp has it, "I will marshal up my prayers, "I will put them in order, call up all my powers, and bid them stand in their proper places, that I may pray with all my might, and pray acceptably.<p>"And will look up," or, as the Hebrew might better be translated, "'I will look out,' I will look out for the answer; after I have prayed, I will expect that the blessing shall come." It is a word that is used in another place where we read of those who watched for the morning. So will I watch for thine answer, O my Lord! I will spread out my prayer like the victim on the altar, and I will look up, and expect to receive the answer by fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice.<p>Two questions are suggested by the last part of this verse. Do we not miss very much of the sweetness and efficacy of prayer by a want of careful meditation before it, and of hopeful expectation after it? We too often rush into the presence of God without forethought or humility. We are live men who present themselves before a king without a petition, and what wonder is it that we often miss the end of prayer? We should be careful to keep the stream of meditation always running; for this is the water to drive the mill of prayer. It is idle to pull up the flood-gates of a dry brook, and then hope to see the wheel revolve. Prayer without fervency is like hunting with a dead dog, and prayer without preparation is hawking with a blind falcon. Prayer is the work of the Holy Spirit, but he works by means. God made man, but he used the dust of the earth as a material: the Holy Ghost is the author of prayer, but he employs the thoughts of a fervent soul as the gold with which to fashion the vessel. Let not our prayers and praises be the flashes of a hot and hasty brain, but the steady burning of a well-kindled fire.<p>But, furthermore, do we not forget to watch the result of our supplications? We are like the ostrich, which lays her eggs and looks not for her young. We sow the seed, and are too idle to seek a harvest. How can we expect the Lord to open the windows of his grace, and pour us out a blessing, if we will not open the windows of expectation and look up for the promised favour? Let holy preparation link hands with patient expectation, and we shall have far larger answers to our prayers. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the morning; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

These words may be considered either as expressing the confidence of the psalmist, that the Lord would hear and answer him, and that in the morning, every morning, as soon and as often as he prayed; or that he would hear him early, quickly, speedily, seasonably, and at the best time; or else as declaring what he would do in consequence of his resolution to pray to the Lord in <a href="/psalms/5-2.htm">Psalm 5:2</a>; he would pray to him every morning: the morning is a proper time for prayer, both to return thanks to God for refreshing sleep and rest, for preservation from dangers by fire, by thieves and murderers, and for renewed mercies in the morning; as also to pray to God to keep from evil and dangers the day following; to give daily food, and to succeed in business and the employments of life; and for a continuation of every mercy, temporal and spiritual. God should be served and sought in the first place; and so to do looks as if God was with his people, and they with him, when they awake in the morning. The Targum and Arabic version consider the words as a petition, and render them, "Hear (d) in the morning, O Lord, my voice", or "my petition"; and so bear the same sense as the other petitions; <p>in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee; or "set it in order" (e): not so much respecting the order of words, the method of prayer, which is sometimes very broken and confused, and yet regarded by God; but in allusion either to the shewbread, placed in order on the table, which was typical of Christ's continual intercession for his people, <a href="/exodus/40-4.htm">Exodus 40:4</a>; or to the offering of incense and other sacrifices, which when offered were put in order upon the altar; and to which prayer is compared, <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>. Or the words may be rendered, "I will stand before thee in the morning", as the Arabic version; or, "I will present unto thee", as the Septuagint; that is, myself; see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>, <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>; though the supplement, "my prayer", seems to be a good one; and so the words are supplied by the Jewish commentators (f); <p>and will look up; or "out" (g) as out of a watch tower, <a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>; to see if help is coming, and for an answer of prayer: the phrase is expressive of hope, expectation, faith, and confidence, that an answer would be returned; and therefore the psalmist determines to look upwards to heaven, whither he directed his prayer, and from whence the answer must come; and to look out from his watch tower, where he was waiting for it, and to continue patiently expecting it till he had it: and the ground of his confidence were the nature and perfections of God, particularly his purity and holiness, as appears from <a href="/psalms/5-4.htm">Psalm 5:4</a>. <p>(d) "audi", Vatablus, Gejerus.

The appointment of daily morning and evening sacrifice (<a href="/numbers/28-4.htm">Numbers 28:4</a>) pointed out morn and eve as times especially appropriate for prayer. A natural instinct suggested the same idea (<a href="/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>). In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee. The repetition adds force to the implied injunction (comp. <a href="/psalms/130-6.htm">Psalm 130:6</a>). The word translated "direct my prayer" means "arrange" or "set in order," as the priests did the altar before a sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7, 8, 12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-4.htm">Numbers 28:4</a>). Prayer is viewed as a sort of sacrificial act. And will look up; or, <span class="accented">look out</span> - keep on the watch - in expectation of my prayer being granted (see the Revised Version). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 4:5-6) The address is continued: they are to repent and cleave to Jahve instead of allowing themselves to be carried away by arrogance and discontent. The lxx has rendered it correctly: &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; (cf. <a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a>): if ye will be angry beware of sinning, viz., backbiting and rebellion (cf. the similar paratactic combinations <a href="/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-18.htm">Joshua 6:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>). In connection with the rendering contremiscite we feel to miss any expression of that before which they are to tremble (viz., the sure punishment which God decrees). He warns his adversaries against blind passion, and counsels them to quiet converse with their own hearts, and solitary meditation, in order that they may not imperil their own salvation. To commune with one's own heart, without the addition of the object, is equivalent to to think alone by one's self, and the bed or resting-place, without requiring to be understood literally, points to a condition of mind that is favourable to quiet contemplation. The heart is the seat of the conscience, and the Spirit of God (as Hamann, Werke i. 98, observes on this subject) disguises itself as our own voice that we may see His exhortation, His counsel, and His wisdom well up out of our own stony heart. The second imper. continues the first: and cease, prop. be still (&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; from the sound of the closed mouth checking the discourse), i.e., come to your right mind by self-examination, cease your tumult-a warning coming with the semblance of command by reason of the consciousness of innocence on his part; and this impression has to be rendered here by the striking in of the music. The dehortation passes over into exhortation in <a href="/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>. Of course the sacrifices were continued in the sanctuary while David, with his faithful followers, was a fugitive from Jerusalem. Referring to this, David cries out to the Absolomites: offer &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1470;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;. Here at least these are not offerings consisting of actions which are in accordance with the will of God, instead of slaughtered animals, but sacrifices offered with a right mind, conformed to the will of God, instead of the hypocritical mind with which they consecrate their evil doings and think to flatter God. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-21.htm">Psalm 51:21</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a> also, "the sacrifices of righteousness" are real sacrifices, not merely symbols of moral acts. Not less full of meaning is the exhortation &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; is construed with &#1488;&#1500; as in <a href="/psalms/31-7.htm">Psalm 31:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/56-4.htm">Psalm 56:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/86-2.htm">Psalm 86:2</a>, combining with the notion of trusting that of drawing near to, hanging on, attaching one's self to any one. The Arabic word bt&#803;h&#803;, expandere, has preserved the primary notion of the word, a notion which, as in the synon. Arab. bst&#803;, when referred to the effect which is produced on the heart, countenance and whole nature of the man by a joyous cheerful state of mind, passes over to the notion of this state of mind itself, so that &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; (like the Arab. inbasat&#803;a to be cheerful, fearless, bold, lit., expanded [cf. &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>]  equals  unstraitened) consequently signifies to be courageous, confident. They are to renounce the self-trust which blinds them in their opposition to the king who is deprived of all human assistance. If they will trustingly submit themselves to God, then at the same time the murmuring and rancorous discontent, from which the rebellion has sprung, will be stilled. Thus far the address to the rebellious magnates goes. </body></html>
