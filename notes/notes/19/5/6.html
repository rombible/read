Such he has always been, and he is still as ready to hear prayer as ever. The most encouraging principle of prayer, and the most powerful plea in prayer, is, to look upon him as our King and our God. David also prays to a sin-hating God. sin is folly, and sinners are the greatest of all fools; fools of their own making. Wicked people hate God; justly are they hated of him, and this will be their endless misery and ruin. Let us learn the importance of truth and sincerity, in all the affairs of life. Liars and murderers resemble the devil, and are his children, therefore it may well be expected that God should abhor them. These were the characters of David's enemies; and such as these are still the enemies of Christ and his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt destroy - Thou wilt bring to ruin; thou wilt cause to perish; that is, cause to perish as the wicked are caused to perish, by being punished. The idea is that God could not approve their cause; could not favor them; could not give them prosperity, and that they must be overthrown and punished. As in the previous verses, so here, David refers to this as a general characteristic of God, but with an implied reference to his enemies.<p>Them that speak leasing - Lies; the word "leasing" being the old Saxon word to denote falsehood. See <a href="/psalms/4-2.htm">Psalm 4:2</a>. It is not found elsewhere in our common version. The allusion here is to his enemies, and the idea is that they were false and treacherous; a description which will well apply to them on the supposition that this refers to the rebellion of Absalom. See the introduction to the psalm.<p>The Lord will abhor - Will hate; will hold in abomination. That is, he will show his abhorrence by punishing such as are here referred to.<p>The bloody and deceitful man - The man of blood and fraud; the man who sheds blood, and is guilty of treachery and fraud. Margin, "man of bloods and deceit." The "man of bloods," - "the plural form being commonly used where there is reference to blood-guiltiness or murder." - "Prof. Alexander." See <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-14.htm">Psalm 51:14</a>. The idea seems to be that of shedding "much" blood. The reference here, as before, is to a general characteristic of the Divine Mind, with a special reference to the character of David's enemies, as being distinguished for fraud and blood-guiltiness. On the supposition (see introduction) that this refers to the rebellion of Absalom, there can be no difficulty in seeing the propriety of the application. It was on these grounds that the psalmist directed his prayer to God. He was confident that his was a righteous cause; he was as sure that his enemies were engaged in a wicked cause; and he felt, therefore, that "he" might go before God and seek his interposition, with the assurance that all his attributes, as a righteous and holy God, would be enlisted in his favor. God has "no" attribute which can take part with a sinner, or on which a sinner can rely; the righteous can appeal to "every" attribute in the divine nature as a ground of confidence and hope. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. leasing&#8212;a lie.<p>the bloody &#8230; man&#8212;literally, "man of blood"&#8212;murderer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Leasing; </span> or, <span class="ital">lies</span>; that make it their business to raise and scatter calumnies and reproaches concerning me; as many did. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The bloody and deceitful man; </span> those who design mischief against me or my friends raider a pretence of kindness; of whom he oft speaks. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou shall destroy them that speak leasing,.... Or "a lie" (i); whether in matters of religion; as false doctrines, errors, and heresies, are lies; and so all that deny the deity, sonship, and Messiahship of Christ, are liars; and the followers of the man of sin speak lies in hypocrisy: or in common conversation; such are like to Satan, and are abominable in the sight of God; and he will destroy them, either with a temporal destruction, with bodily diseases, as Gehazi was smitten with a leprosy; and with corporeal death, as Ananias and Sapphira; or with eternal destruction, the destruction of body and soul in hell; for all liars have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone; <p>the Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man; or "the man of blood and deceit" (k); that thirsts after blood; who sheds innocent blood, as the Targum paraphrases it. He showed his resentment against Cain, the first of this sort, in a way that was intolerable to him. He very early established a law, requiring that he who shed man's blood, by man should his blood be shed; and he will give the whore of Rome, who has been drunk with the blood of his saints, blood to drink, because she is worthy. And all such who flatter with their tongue, and speak with a double heart, and lie in wait to deceive their neighbour, whether in things temporal or spiritual, are the objects of his abhorrence and indignation; see <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>. Now David's enemies being such sort of persons, foolish wicked men, proud and haughty, workers of iniquity, liars, bloody and deceitful men, men that God had an abhorrence of, he therefore hoped and was confident that God would hear his prayers against them, and for himself. <p>(i) "mendacium", V.

David's adversaries were cunning, treacherous, and quite regardless of truth (see <a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-7.htm">2 Samuel 15:7-9</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>, etc.).

The hymn closes as it began with a three line verse. &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (lit., in its unions  equals  collectively, Olshausen, 135, c, like &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; altogether, &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; at the right time) is by no means unemphatic; nor is it so in <a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a> where it means "all together, without exception." With synonymous verbs it denotes the combination of that which they imply, as <a href="/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a>. It is similar in <a href="/psalms/141-10.htm">Psalm 141:10</a> where it expresses the coincidence of the fall of his enemies and the escape of the persecuted one. So here: he wishes to go to sleep and also at once he falls asleep (&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; in a likewise cohortative sense  equals  &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;). His God makes him to dwell in seclusion free of care. &#1500;&#1489;&#1512;&#1491; is a first definition of condition, and &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; a second. The former is not, after <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-12.htm">Deuteronomy 32:12</a>, equivalent to &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498;, an addition which would be without any implied antithesis and consequently meaningless. One must therefore, as is indeed required by the situation, understand &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1491; according to <a href="/numbers/23-9.htm">Numbers 23:9</a>; <a href="/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-31.htm">Jeremiah 49:31</a>. He needs no guards for he is guarded round about by Jahve and kept in safety. The seclusion, &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1491;, in which he is, is security, &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, because Jahve is near him. Under what a many phases and how sweetly the nature of faith is expressed in this and the foregoing Psalm: his righteousness, exaltation, joy, peace, contentment in God! And how delicately conceived is the rhythm! In the last line the evening hymn itself sinks to rest. The iambics with which it closes are like the last strains of a lullaby which die away softly and as though falling asleep themselves. Dante is right when he says in his Convito, that the sweetness of the music had harmony of the Hebrew Psalter is lost in the Greek and Latin translations. </body></html>
