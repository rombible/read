Let us learn to pray, not for ourselves only, but for others; grace be with all that love Christ in sincerity. The Divine blessing comes down upon us through Jesus Christ, the righteous or just One, as of old it did upon Israel through David, whom God protected, and placed upon the throne.

They are false and treacherous, and I can, therefore, only appeal to thee. It is easy to see the propriety of this statement, and of those which follow, on the supposition that this refers to the rebellion of Absalom. Absalom had gone to Hebron on a false pretence <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-7.htm">2 Samuel 15:7-10</a>, and every act of his in this whole transaction had been treacherous and false.<p>Their inward part - Not only their external conduct, but their hearts, their principles, their motives. This was fairly to be inferred from their conduct. The object of the psalmist is to show that they were wholly depraved in all that properly constitutes character or that entered into moral conduct.<p>Their throat is an open sepulchre - That is, as the grave is open to receive its victim, so is their throat open to devour or swallow up the peace and happiness of others. The main idea is that they are false, treacherous, not to be confided in, slanderous. This passage, with the following, is employed by the apostle Paul to demonstrate the universal depravity of man. See the notes at <a href="/romans/3-13.htm">Romans 3:13</a>.<p>They flatter with their tongue - He had referred to the "inward part," or the "heart," and to the "throat" as being depraved and evil; he now refers to another member of the body as being equally depraved - the "tongue." Instead of being employed to utter truth, and to give expression to the real feelings of the heart, it was employed to flatter others, with a view to lead them astray, or to make use of them for base and selfish purposes. The propriety of this representation as applicable to Absalom and his coadjutors no one can fail to see (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-6</a>). It is also to an eminent degree the characteristic of the wicked in general. On this, also, see the notes at <a href="/romans/3-13.htm">Romans 3:13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Note that remarkable figure, "Their throat is an open sepulchre," a sepulchre full of loathsomeness, of miasma, of pestilence and death. But, worse than that, it is an open sepulchre, with all its evil gases issuing forth, to spread death and destruction all around. So, with the throat of the wicked, it would be a great mercy if it could always be closed. If we could seal in continual silence the mouth of the wicked it would be like a sepulchre shut up, and would not produce much mischief. But "their throat is an open sepulchre," consequently all the wickedness of their heart exhales, and comes forth. How dangerous is an open sepulchre; men in their journeys might easily stumble therein, and find themselves among the dead. Ah! take heed of the wicked man, for there is nothing that he will not say to ruin you; he will long to destroy your character, and bury you in the hideous sepulchre of his own wicked throat. One sweet thought here, however. At the resurrection there will be a resurrection not only of bodies, but characters. This should be a great comfort to a man who has been abused and slandered. "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun." The world may think you vile, and bury your character; but if you have been upright, in the day when the graves shall give up their dead, tills open sepulchre of the sinner's throat shall be compelled to give up your heavenly character, and you shall come forth and be honoured in the sight of men. "They flatter with their tongue." Or, as we might read it, "They have an oily tongue, a smooth tongue." A smooth tongue is a great evil; many have been bewitched by it. There be many human ant-eaters that with their long tongues covered with oily words entice and entrap the unwary and make their gain thereby. When the wolf licks the lamb, he is preparing to wet his teeth in its blood. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They speak one thing, and mean another, and under a pretence of kindness they seek my destruction; which makes it difficult for me to know how I should carry myself to them; wherein therefore I have begged thy direction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Their throat; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

In the mouth of the ungodly, as the Chaldee paraphrase; in the mouth of every one of them, as Aben Ezra interprets it: that is, in the mouth of every wicked, bloody, and deceitful man; of everyone of David's enemies, as Saul, or the conspirators with Absalom his son. There was no steadfastness in them; nothing right, sure, or firm said by them; nothing that could be depended upon; there was "no truth" in them, as the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions render it. And as this was true of David's, so of Christ's enemies; of Herod, and of the Herodians, and of the Scribes and Pharisees; see <a href="/matthew/2-8.htm">Matthew 2:8</a>; and of the enemies of Christ's Gospel; of all false teachers, who speak not the word faithfully; tell dreams, use the hidden things of dishonesty, walk in craftiness, handle the word of God deceitfully, and speak lies in hypocrisy: there is no certainty in them, nor is any thing they say to be trusted to. And this is the character of wicked men in common: they are an assembly of treacherous men; there is none upright among them; nor is any confidence to be placed in them: the people of God are in danger of being imposed upon and misled by them to their hurt; and therefore the psalmist prays, that the Lord would lead him in his righteousness; <p>their inward part is very wickedness; their heart, which is desperately wicked, exceeding sinful; not only wicked, and very wicked, but wickedness itself. This is the root and fountain of all wickedness, and the reason why there is no faithfulness in their mouth: the word (m) is sometimes rendered, "their inward thought", <a href="/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>; which is the inmost of man, the nearest to him; and which, and even the imagination of it, is evil, and that continually: the word (n) translated "wickedness" signifies woes, calamities, and mischiefs; and such the wicked hearts of men are full of, and are continually devising against the people of God, and his righteous cause. And this is the just character of ungodly men, even though they may profess to know God, have a form of godliness, and be outwardly righteous before men; as these were David was concerned with; <p>their throat is an open sepulchre; or as one, as the Targum paraphrases it; to which the throat of wicked men may be compared for its voracity and insatiableness; the grave being one of those three or four things, which never has enough or is satisfied. And this is true of the throat, whether it be considered as an instrument of speech, and throws out devouring words to the prejudice of the characters and reputations of others; or as an instrument of swallowing meat and drink, and where the pleasure of appetite is; and so may be expressive of the eager desire of the wicked after sin, who drink up iniquity like water; and of their delight in it, and their fulness of it, and yet still greedy, insatiable, and not to be satisfied: and their throat may be compared to an open grave for the nauseous stench it emits; corrupt communication, filthiness, and foolish talking, proceeding out of it; and horrible oaths, curses, imprecations, and blasphemies, being belched out through it; and for the danger which is by it, since into it men may fall unawares; and so the evil communications of wicked men corrupt good manners, and do great mischief to those who fall into company with them; <p>they flatter with their tongue; or, "make it smooth" (o); use oily expressions, soft language: or, "part" or "divide" (p) their tongue; are double tongued and double hearted; and so deceive persons, as the apostle interprets it in <a href="/romans/3-13.htm">Romans 3:13</a>. They flatter God himself, drawing nigh to him in an hypocritical way; they flatter men, their neighbours, and impose upon them; they flatter princes, and such parasitic people were about David. And such are false teachers, who prophesy smooth things, and with good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple; or, which account there is great reason to pray to be led and directed by the Lord. <p>(m) , Sept.

The denominative &#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; (like audire  equals  aus, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3c2; dare) belongs more to poetry than prose. &#1492;&#1490;&#1497;&#1490; (like &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;) or &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512; (like &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512;) occurs only in two Psalms &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;, viz., here and <a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>. It is derived from &#1492;&#1490;&#1490;  equals  &#1492;&#1490;&#1492; (vid., <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>) and signifies that which is spoken meditatively, here praying in rapt devotion. Beginning thus the prayer gradually rises to a vox clamoris. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;, to be distinguished from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; (inf. Pi.) <a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>, is one word with the Aram. &#1510;&#1493;&#1495;, Aethiop. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (to call).

The invocation &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, when it is a king who utters it, is all the more significant. David, and in general the theocratic king, is only the representative of the Invisible One, whom he with all Israel adores as his King. Prayer to Him is his first work as he begins the day. In the morning, &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; (as in <a href="/psalms/65-8.htm">Psalm 65:8</a> for &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;, <a href="/psalms/88-13.htm">Psalm 88:13</a>), shalt Thou hear my cry, is equivalent to my cry which goes forth with the early morn. Hupfeld considers the mention of the morning as only a "poetical expression" and when getting rid of the meaning prima luce, he also gets rid of the beautiful and obvious reference to the daily sacrifice. The verb &#1506;&#1512;&#1498; is the word used of laying the wood in order for the sacrifice, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7</a>, and the pieces of the sacrifice, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8</a>, <a href="/leviticus/1-12.htm">Leviticus 1:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>, of putting the sacred lamps in order, <a href="/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-3.htm">Leviticus 24:3</a>., and of setting the shew-bread in order, <a href="/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a>. The laying of the wood in order for the morning offering of a lamb (<a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a> [<a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12</a>], cf. <a href="/numbers/28-4.htm">Numbers 28:4</a>) was one of the first duties of the priest, as soon as the day began to dawn; the lamb was slain before sun-rise and when the sun appeared above the horizon laid piece by piece upon the altar. The morning prayer is compared to this morning sacrifice. This is in its way also a sacrifice. The object which David has in his mind in connection with &#1488;&#1506;&#1512;&#1498; is &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;. As the priests, with the early morning, lay the wood and pieces of the sacrifices of the Tam&#305;&#770;d upon the altar, so he brings his prayer before God as a spiritual sacrifice and looks out for an answer (&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; speculari as in <a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>), perhaps as the priest looks out for fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice, or looks to the smoke to see that it rises up straight towards heaven. </body></html>
