The mercy of God should ever be the foundation both of our hope and of our joy, in every thing wherein we have to do with him. Let us learn to pray, not for ourselves only, but for others; grace be with all that love Christ in sincerity. The Divine blessing comes down upon us through Jesus Christ, the righteous or just One, as of old it did upon Israel through David, whom God protected, and placed upon the throne.

Such a ground of appeal is always proper when we are in danger or in trouble from the injustice of others, for we may always ask of God to interpose, and to cause that which is right to be done.<p>Because of mine enemies - On account of my enemies, or in respect to them; that is, that they may not triumph, but that I may be vindicated and may be delivered from them.<p>Make thy way straight before my face - The way in which thou wouldst have me to walk.

It is safe and pleasant walking when God leads the way. "In thy righteousness," not in my righteousness, for that is imperfect, but in thine, for thou art righteousness itself. "Make thy way," not my way, "straight before my face." Brethren, when we have learned to give up our own way, and long to walk in God's way, it is a happy sign of grace; and it is no small mercy to see the way of God with clear vision straight before our face.

Not in mine, but thine; in the righteousness of God, which is revealed in the Gospel, from faith to faith, and is imputed by God, and received by faith; in this righteousness the psalmist desired to be led into the house of God, and appear before him; nor is there any other righteousness in which man can stand before God and worship. Or else the sense is, that God would lead him in the way of righteousness, in his righteous statutes, judgments, and ordinances; in which way the Lord does lead his people, <a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>. Or that he would lead him for his righteousness' sake; because of his faithfulness to his promises, that he would direct, uphold, and never leave nor forsake him. David was very sensible that the way of man is not in himself, and that he could not direct his own steps; and therefore desired to be guided by the Lord, and to be led by the right hand of his righteousness, and to be upheld by it in his ways: <p>because of mine enemies; or, "those that observe me" (l) that lie in wait and watch for my halting, as Jeremiah's enemies did; and would rejoice at my fall, and insult me, and blaspheme thy name; therefore lead, guide, and uphold me; <p>make thy way straight before my face; thy way of providence, thy way of grace, thy way of worship and duty; let it appear plain and manifest, that I may know in which way I should walk; and let all obstructions be removed out of the way, that I may walk straight on, without any difficulty or hinderance.

The thoughts are simple but the language is carefully chosen. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is the plur. of &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;), one of the words peculiar to the poetic prophetical style. The denominative &#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; (like audire  equals  aus, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3c2; dare) belongs more to poetry than prose. &#1492;&#1490;&#1497;&#1490; (like &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;) or &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512; (like &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512;) occurs only in two Psalms &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;, viz., here and <a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>. It is derived from &#1492;&#1490;&#1490;  equals  &#1492;&#1490;&#1492; (vid., <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>) and signifies that which is spoken meditatively, here praying in rapt devotion. Beginning thus the prayer gradually rises to a vox clamoris. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;, to be distinguished from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; (inf. Pi.) <a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>, is one word with the Aram. &#1510;&#1493;&#1495;, Aethiop. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (to call). On &#1492;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; used of intent listening, vid., <a href="/psalms/10-17.htm">Psalm 10:17</a>. The invocation &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, when it is a king who utters it, is all the more significant. David, and in general the theocratic king, is only the representative of the Invisible One, whom he with all Israel adores as his King. Prayer to Him is his first work as he begins the day. In the morning, &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; (as in <a href="/psalms/65-8.htm">Psalm 65:8</a> for &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;, <a href="/psalms/88-13.htm">Psalm 88:13</a>), shalt Thou hear my cry, is equivalent to my cry which goes forth with the early morn. Hupfeld considers the mention of the morning as only a "poetical expression" and when getting rid of the meaning prima luce, he also gets rid of the beautiful and obvious reference to the daily sacrifice. The verb &#1506;&#1512;&#1498; is the word used of laying the wood in order for the sacrifice, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7</a>, and the pieces of the sacrifice, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8</a>, <a href="/leviticus/1-12.htm">Leviticus 1:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>, of putting the sacred lamps in order, <a href="/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-3.htm">Leviticus 24:3</a>., and of setting the shew-bread in order, <a href="/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a>. The laying of the wood in order for the morning offering of a lamb (<a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a> [<a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12</a>], cf. <a href="/numbers/28-4.htm">Numbers 28:4</a>) was one of the first duties of the priest, as soon as the day began to dawn; the lamb was slain before sun-rise and when the sun appeared above the horizon laid piece by piece upon the altar. The morning prayer is compared to this morning sacrifice. This is in its way also a sacrifice. The object which David has in his mind in connection with &#1488;&#1506;&#1512;&#1498; is &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;. As the priests, with the early morning, lay the wood and pieces of the sacrifices of the Tam&#305;&#770;d upon the altar, so he brings his prayer before God as a spiritual sacrifice and looks out for an answer (&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; speculari as in <a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>), perhaps as the priest looks out for fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice, or looks to the smoke to see that it rises up straight towards heaven. </body></html>
