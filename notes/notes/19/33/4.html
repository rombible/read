Thankful praise is the breath and language of holy joy. Religious songs are proper expressions of thankful praise. Every endowment we possess, should be employed with all our skill and earnestness in God's service. His promises are all wise and good. His word is right, and therefore we are only in the right when we agree with it. His works are all done in truth. He is the righteous Lord, therefore loveth righteousness. What a pity it is that this earth, which is so full of the proofs and instances of God's goodness, should be so empty of his praises; and that of the multitudes who live upon his bounty, there are so few who live to his glory! What the Lord does, he does to purpose; it stands fast. He overrules all the counsels of men, and makes them serve his counsels; even that is fulfilled, which to us is most surprising, the eternal counsel of God, nor can any thing prevent its coming to pass.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the word of the Lord is right - The command; the law; the promise of God. Whatever he "says" is right; or, is true. It is worthy of universal belief; and should, therefore, be a reason for praise. The fact that God says a thing is the highest proof that it is true.<p>And all his works are done in truth - Or rather, "in faithfulness." That is, All that he does is executed faithfully. He does all that he promises, and all that he does is such as to claim universal confidence. Whatever he does is, from the very fact that He does it, worthy of the confidence of all his creatures. None, however they may be affected by what he does, have any reason to doubt that it is perfectly right. God is the only Being of whom we have any knowledge, concerning whom we can feel this certain assurance. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-9.

His ordinances both natural, moral, and spiritual, are right, and especially his incarnate Word, who is the Lord our righteousness. Whatever God has ordained must be good, and just, and excellent. There are no anomalies in God's universe, except what sin has made; his word of command made all things good. When we look at his word of promise, and remember its faithfulness, what reasons have we for joy and thankfulness! "And all his works are done in truth." His work is the outflow of his word, and it is true to it. He neither doth nor saith anything ill; in deed and speech he agrees with himself and the purest truth. There is no lie in God's word, and no sham in his works; in creation, providence, and revelation, unalloyed truth abounds. To act truth as well as to utter it is divine, let not children of God ever yield their principles in practice any more than in heart. What a God we serve! The more we know of him, the more our better natures approve his surpassing excellence; even his afflicting works are according to his truthful word.<p>"Why should I complain of want or distress,<p>Affliction or pain? he told me no less;<p>The heirs of salvation, I know from his word,<p>Through much tribulation must follow their Lord."<p>God writes with a pen that never blots, speaks with a tongue that never slips, acts with a hand which never fails. Bless his name.<p><a href="/psalms/33-5.htm">Psalm 33:5</a><p>"He loveth righteousness and judgment." The theory and the practice of right he intensely loves. He doth not only approve the true and the just, but his inmost soul delights therein. The character of God is a sea, every drop of which should become a wellhead of praise for his people. The righteousness of Jesus is peculiarly dear to the Father, and for its sake he takes pleasure in those to whom it is imputed. Sin, on the other hand, is infinitely abhorrent to the Lord, and woe unto those who die in it; if he sees no righteousness in them, he will deal righteously with them, and judgment stern and final will be the result. "The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord." Come hither, astronomers, geologists, naturalists, botanists, chemists, miners, yea, all of you who study the works of God, for all your truthful stories confirm this declaration. From the midge in the sunbeam to leviathan in the ocean all creatures own the bounty of the Creator. Even the pathless desert blazes with some undiscovered mercy, and the caverns of ocean conceal the treasures of love. Earth might have been as full of terror as of grace, but instead thereof it teems and overflows with kindness. He who cannot see it, and yet lives in it as the fish lives in the water, deserves to die. If earth be full of mercy, what must heaven be where goodness concentrates its beams? <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> All God’s counsels and commands, either contained in the Scriptures, or given forth in his providence, for the government of the world, are wise, and just, and good, without deceit or defect: and all his works of providence agree with his word, and are no other than the accomplishment of his promises or threatenings, or other declarations of his mind and will in his word, although sometimes for a season they may seem contrary to it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the word of the Lord is right,....

We cannot imagine it otherwise, for God would contradict his own nature, if he ordained by a positive law anything contrary to that rule.

All God's working (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span>), all his dealings with his creatures have truth and equity and faithfulness for their basis.

In this case the person addressed must be the poet, who, however, has already attained the knowledge here treated of. It is he himself who now directly adopts the tone of the teacher (cf. <a href="/psalms/34-12.htm">Psalm 34:12</a>). That which David, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a>, promises to do, he here takes in hand, viz., the instruction of sinners in the way of salvation. It is unnecessary to read &#1488;&#1497;&#1506;&#1510;&#1498; instead of &#1488;&#1497;&#1506;&#1510;&#1492;, as Olshausen does; the suffix of &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; and &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498; (for &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498;) avails also for this third verb, to which &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, equivalent to &#1513;&#1474;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (fixing my eye upon thee, i.e., with sympathising love taking an interest in thee), stands in the relation of a subordinate relative clause. The lxx renders it by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, so that it takes &#1497;&#1506;&#1509;, in accordance with its radical signification firmare, as the regens of &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (I will fix my eye steadfastly upon thee); but for this there is no support in the general usage of the language. The accents give a still different rendering; they apparently make &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; an accus. adverb. (Since &#1488;&#1506;&#1510;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; is transformed from &#1488;&#1497;&#1506;&#1510;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;: I will counsel thee with mine eye; but in every other instance, &#1497;&#1506;&#1509; &#1506;&#1500; means only a hostile determination against any one, e.g., <a href="/isaiah/7-5.htm">Isaiah 7:5</a>. The form of address, without changing its object, passes over, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a>, into the plural and the expression becomes harsh in perfect keeping with the perverted character which it describes. The sense is on the whole clear: not constrained, but willing obedience is becoming to man, in distinction from an irrational animal which must be led by a bridle drawn through its mouth. The asyndeton clause: like a horse, a mule (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491; as an animal that is isolated and does not pair; cf. Arab. fard, alone of its kind, single, unlike, the opposite of which is Arab. zawj, a pair, equal number), has nothing remarkable about it, cf. <a href="/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>. But it is not clear what &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493; is intended to mean. We might take it in its usual signification "ornament," and render "with bit and bridle, its ornament," and perhaps at once recognise therein an allusion to the senseless servility of the animal, viz., that its ornament is also the means by which it is kept in check, unless &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;, ornament, is perhaps directly equivalent to "harness." Still the rendering of the lxx is to be respected: in camo et fraeno - as Jerome reproduces it - maxilas eorum constringere qui non approximant ad te. If &#1506;&#1491;&#1497; means jaw, mouth or check, then &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493; &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; is equivalent to ora eorum obturanda sunt (Ges. 132, rem. 1), which the lxx expressed by &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, constringe, or following the Cod. Alex., &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), constringes. Like Ewald and Hitzig (on <a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>), we may compare with &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;, the cheek, the Arabic chadd, which, being connected with &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, a furrow, signifies properly the furrow of the face, i.e., the indented part running downwards from the inner corners of the eyes to both sides of the nose, but then by synecdoche the cheek. If `dyw refers to the mouth or jaws, then it looks as if &#1489;&#1468;&#1500; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; must be translated: in order that they may not come too near thee, viz., to hurt thee (Targ., Syriac, Rashi, etc.); but this rendering does not produce any point of comparison corresponding to the context of this Psalm. Therefore, it is rather to be rendered: otherwise there is no coming near to thee. This interpretation takes the emphasis of the &#1489;&#1500; into account, and assumes that, according to a usage of the language that is without further support, one might, for instance, say: &#1489;&#1468;&#1500; &#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, "I will never go thither." In <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/23-17.htm">Proverbs 23:17</a>, &#1489;&#1500; also includes within itself the verb to be. So here: by no means an approaching to thee, i.e., there is, if thou dost not bridle them, no approaching or coming near to thee. These words are not addressed to God, but to man, who is obliged to use harsh and forcible means in taming animals, and can only thus keep them under his control and near to him. In the antitype, it is the sinner, who will not come to God, although God only is his help, and who, as David has learned by experience, must first of all endure inward torture, before he comes to a right state of mind. This agonising life of the guilty conscience which the ungodly man leads, is contrasted in <a href="/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10</a> with the mercy which encompasses on all sides him, who trusts in God. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, in accordance with the treatment of this adjective as if it were a numeral (vid., <a href="/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a>), is an attributive or adjective placed before its noun. The final clause might be rendered: mercy encompasses him; but the Poel and <a href="/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a> favour the rendering: with mercy doth He encompass him. </body></html>
