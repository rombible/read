Thankful praise is the breath and language of holy joy. Religious songs are proper expressions of thankful praise. Every endowment we possess, should be employed with all our skill and earnestness in God's service. His promises are all wise and good. His word is right, and therefore we are only in the right when we agree with it. His works are all done in truth. He is the righteous Lord, therefore loveth righteousness. What a pity it is that this earth, which is so full of the proofs and instances of God's goodness, should be so empty of his praises; and that of the multitudes who live upon his bounty, there are so few who live to his glory! What the Lord does, he does to purpose; it stands fast. He overrules all the counsels of men, and makes them serve his counsels; even that is fulfilled, which to us is most surprising, the eternal counsel of God, nor can any thing prevent its coming to pass.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Praise the Lord with harp - For a description of the "harp," see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>.<p>Sing unto him with the psaltery - For the meaning of this word, also, see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>, where the word is rendered "viol."<p>And an instrument of ten strings - The word "and" is supplied here by the translators as if, in this place, a third instrument was referred to, distinct from the harp and the psaltery.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a>, however, the two words are separately used as denoting different instruments. The "lyre" or psaltery was probably not always made with the same number of strings, and it would seem that the one that was made of "ten" strings had something special about it as an instrument of uncommon sweetness or power. Hence, it is particularly designated here; and the idea is that the instruments of especial power and sweetness should be on this occasion employed in the service of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 33<p>Ps 33:1-22.

The harp obtains mention here for the first time in the Psalms. Reference, however, had been made to it previously in Genesis, Job, and the First Book of Samuel. There is reason to believe that the instrument, as known to the Hebrews, was a simple one, consisting of a nearly triangular framework of wood, crossed by seven strings. The Egyptians were acquainted from early times with a very much more elaborate instrument  - harps which stood six feet high upon a broad base of their own, and had as many as twenty-two strings (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 521). The harp was regarded by the Hebrews as peculiarly fitted for sacred music (see <a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1, 3, 6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings</span>; rather, <span class="accented">sing unto him with the lute of ten strings.</span> One instrument only is here mentioned - a lute or psaltery (<span class="accented">nebel</span>), having ten strings (comp. <a href="/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/144-9.htm">Psalm 144:9</a>). The <span class="accented">nebel</span> was an instrument differing from the harp chiefly in the arrangement of the strings. It was  used in the temple service, as appears from <a href="/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6, 28</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1, 6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25</a>, etc. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For this mercy, which is provided for every sinner who repents and confesses his sin, let then, every &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;, who longs for &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, turn in prayer to Jahve &#1500;&#1506;&#1514; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, at the time (<a href="/psalms/21-10.htm">Psalm 21:10</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-22.htm">1 Chronicles 12:22</a>; cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, <a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>) when He, and His mercy, is to be found (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a> with <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;).

The restrictive meaning of &#1512;&#1511; here, as is frequently the case (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>; <a href="/judges/14-16.htm">Judges 14:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/91-8.htm">Psalm 91:8</a>), has passed over to the affirmative: certo quum, etc. Inundation or flooding is an exemplificative description of the divine judgment (cf. <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>); <a href="/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a> is a brief form of expressing the promise which is expanded in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91</a>.
