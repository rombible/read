The scope of it is to convince us of our sins. God, by the psalmist, here shows us how bad we are, and proves this by his own certain knowledge. He speaks terror to persecutors, the worst of sinners. He speaks encouragement to God's persecuted people. How comes it that men are so bad? Because there is no fear of God before their eyes. Men's bad practices flow from their bad principles; if they profess to know God, yet in works, because in thoughts, they deny him. See the folly of sin; he is a fool, in the account of God, whose judgment we are sure is right, that harbours such corrupt thoughts. And see the fruit of sin; to what it brings men, when their hearts are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. See also the faith of the saints, and their hope and power as to the cure of this great evil. There will come a Saviour, a great salvation, a salvation from sin. God will save his church from its enemies. He will save all believers from their own sins, that they may not be led captive by them, which will be everlasting joy to them. From this work the Redeemer had his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins, Mt 1:21.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/53.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Every one of them is gone back - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>. The only variation here in the two psalms is in the substitution of the word - &#1505;&#1490;  sa&#770;g, for &#1505;&#1493;&#1512; su&#770;r - words almost identical in form and in sense. The only difference in meaning is, that the former word - the word used here - means "to draw back," or "to go back;" the other, the word used in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a>, means "to go off, to turn aside." Each of them indicates a departure from God; a departure equally fatal and equally guilty, whether people turn "back" from following him, or turn "aside" to something else. Both of these forms of apostasy occur with lamentable frequency. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/53.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 53<p>Ps 53:1-6.

The &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; is not, as one might suppose, the holy tent or tabernacle, that he has desecrated by making it the lurking-place of the betrayer (<a href="/1_samuel/21-7.htm">1 Samuel 21:7</a>), which would have been expressed by &#1502;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;, but his own dwelling. God will pull him, the lofty and imperious one, down (&#1504;&#1514;&#1509;, like a tower perhaps, <a href="/judges/8-9.htm">Judges 8:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/26-9.htm">Ezekiel 26:9</a>) from his position of honour and his prosperity, and drag him forth out of his habitation, much as one rakes a coal from the hearth (&#1495;&#1514;&#1492; Biblical and Talmudic in this sense), and tear him out of this his home (&#1504;&#1505;&#1495;, cf. &#1504;&#1514;&#1511;, <a href="/job/18-14.htm">Job 18:14</a>) and remove him far away (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>), because he has betrayed the homeless fugitive; and will root him out of the land of the living, because he has destroyed the priests of God (<a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>). It then proceeds in <a href="/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a> very much like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-5.htm">Psalm 40:5</a>, just as the figure of the razor also coincides with Psalms belonging to exactly the same period (<a href="/psalms/51-8.htm">Psalm 51:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>, cf. &#1500;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>). The excitement and indignant anger against one's foes which expresses itself in the rhythm and the choice of words, has been already recognised by us since <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a> as a characteristic of these Psalms. The hope which David, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>, attaches to God's judicial interposition is the same as e.g., in <a href="/psalms/64-10.htm">Psalm 64:10</a>. The righteous will be strengthened in the fear of God (for the play of sounds cf. <a href="/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>) and laugh at him whom God has overthrown, saying: Behold there the man, etc. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/58-11.htm">Psalm 58:11</a>, the laughing is joy at the ultimate breaking through of justice long hidden and not discerned; for even the moral teaching of the Old Testament (<a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a>) reprobates the low malignant joy that glories at the overthrow of one's enemy. By &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; the former trust in mammon on the part of the man who is overtaken by punishment is set forth as a consequence of his refusal to put trust in God, in Him who is the true &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494;  equals  Arab. m&#8219;a&#770;d&#817;, hiding-place or place of protection (vid., on 31;3, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-39.htm">Psalm 37:39</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/17-7.htm">Psalm 17:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-33.htm">Psalm 22:33</a>). &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; is here the passion for earthly things which rushes at and falls upon them (animo fertur). </body></html>
