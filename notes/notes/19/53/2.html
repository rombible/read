The scope of it is to convince us of our sins. God, by the psalmist, here shows us how bad we are, and proves this by his own certain knowledge. He speaks terror to persecutors, the worst of sinners. He speaks encouragement to God's persecuted people. How comes it that men are so bad? Because there is no fear of God before their eyes. Men's bad practices flow from their bad principles; if they profess to know God, yet in works, because in thoughts, they deny him. See the folly of sin; he is a fool, in the account of God, whose judgment we are sure is right, that harbours such corrupt thoughts. And see the fruit of sin; to what it brings men, when their hearts are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. See also the faith of the saints, and their hope and power as to the cure of this great evil. There will come a Saviour, a great salvation, a salvation from sin. God will save his church from its enemies. He will save all believers from their own sins, that they may not be led captive by them, which will be everlasting joy to them. From this work the Redeemer had his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins, Mt 1:21.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/53.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God looked down from heaven ... - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2</a>. The only change which occurs in this verse is the substitution of the word &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'Elohiym, rendered "God," for "Yahweh," rendered Lord, in <a href="/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2</a>. The same change occurs also in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/14-6.htm">Psalm 14:6</a>. It is to be observed, also, that the word "Yahweh" does not occur in this psalm, but that the term used is uniformly. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'Elohiym, God. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a> both terms are found - the word &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'Elohiym three times <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>, and the word &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;  Yahweh four times, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-6.htm">Psalm 14:6-7</a>. It is impossible to account for this change. There is nothing in it, however, to indicate anything in regard to the authorship of the psalm or to the time when it was written, for both these words are frequently used by David elsewhere. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/53.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 53<p>Ps 53:1-6.

For a while God as it were overlooked the growing corruption. At length He ‘looked down’ (<a href="/context/psalms/33-13.htm" title="The LORD looks from heaven; he beholds all the sons of men....">Psalm 33:13-14</a>). So in the yet simpler language of the Pentateuch He is said to have ‘come down to see’ the wickedness of Babel and Sodom (<a href="/genesis/11-5.htm" title="And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.">Genesis 11:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-21.htm" title="I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know.">Genesis 18:21</a>; and note the use of ‘look down’ in the latter narrative though in a different connexion, <a href="/psalms/18-16.htm" title="He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.">Psalm 18:16</a>). Were not these typical examples of human corruption in the Psalmist’s mind? God (in <a href="/psalms/14-2.htm" title="The LORD looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.">Psalm 14:2</a> Jehovah) looked down … to see if there were any that did understand (or <span class="ital">deal wisely</span>, R.V. marg., for the verb often includes the idea of right action), that did seek after God. Cp. <a href="/psalms/9-10.htm" title="And they that know your name will put their trust in you: for you, LORD, have not forsaken them that seek you.">Psalm 9:10</a>. The use of <span class="ital">God</span>, not <span class="ital">Jehovah</span>, in Psalms 14 as well as here, is significant. It is of mankind in general, not of Israel, that the Psalmist is speaking. God made Himself known through the voice of conscience and in the works of creation, but men would not follow the light of conscience or read the book of nature. See <a href="/acts/14-17.htm" title="Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.">Acts 14:17</a>; <a href="/acts/17-27.htm" title="That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:">Acts 17:27</a>; and especially <a href="/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19</a> ff.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/52.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The announcement of the divine retribution begins with &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; as in <a href="/isaiah/66-4.htm">Isaiah 66:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-43.htm">Ezekiel 16:43</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-9.htm">Malachi 2:9</a>. The &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; is not, as one might suppose, the holy tent or tabernacle, that he has desecrated by making it the lurking-place of the betrayer (<a href="/1_samuel/21-7.htm">1 Samuel 21:7</a>), which would have been expressed by &#1502;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;, but his own dwelling. God will pull him, the lofty and imperious one, down (&#1504;&#1514;&#1509;, like a tower perhaps, <a href="/judges/8-9.htm">Judges 8:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/26-9.htm">Ezekiel 26:9</a>) from his position of honour and his prosperity, and drag him forth out of his habitation, much as one rakes a coal from the hearth (&#1495;&#1514;&#1492; Biblical and Talmudic in this sense), and tear him out of this his home (&#1504;&#1505;&#1495;, cf. &#1504;&#1514;&#1511;, <a href="/job/18-14.htm">Job 18:14</a>) and remove him far away (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>), because he has betrayed the homeless fugitive; and will root him out of the land of the living, because he has destroyed the priests of God (<a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>). It then proceeds in <a href="/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a> very much like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-5.htm">Psalm 40:5</a>, just as the figure of the razor also coincides with Psalms belonging to exactly the same period (<a href="/psalms/51-8.htm">Psalm 51:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>, cf. &#1500;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>). The excitement and indignant anger against one's foes which expresses itself in the rhythm and the choice of words, has been already recognised by us since <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a> as a characteristic of these Psalms. The hope which David, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>, attaches to God's judicial interposition is the same as e.g., in <a href="/psalms/64-10.htm">Psalm 64:10</a>. The righteous will be strengthened in the fear of God (for the play of sounds cf. <a href="/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>) and laugh at him whom God has overthrown, saying: Behold there the man, etc. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/58-11.htm">Psalm 58:11</a>, the laughing is joy at the ultimate breaking through of justice long hidden and not discerned; for even the moral teaching of the Old Testament (<a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a>) reprobates the low malignant joy that glories at the overthrow of one's enemy. By &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; the former trust in mammon on the part of the man who is overtaken by punishment is set forth as a consequence of his refusal to put trust in God, in Him who is the true &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494;  equals  Arab. m&#8219;a&#770;d&#817;, hiding-place or place of protection (vid., on 31;3, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-39.htm">Psalm 37:39</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/17-7.htm">Psalm 17:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-33.htm">Psalm 22:33</a>). &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; is here the passion for earthly things which rushes at and falls upon them (animo fertur). </body></html>
