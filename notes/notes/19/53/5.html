The scope of it is to convince us of our sins. God, by the psalmist, here shows us how bad we are, and proves this by his own certain knowledge. He speaks terror to persecutors, the worst of sinners. He speaks encouragement to God's persecuted people. How comes it that men are so bad? Because there is no fear of God before their eyes. Men's bad practices flow from their bad principles; if they profess to know God, yet in works, because in thoughts, they deny him. See the folly of sin; he is a fool, in the account of God, whose judgment we are sure is right, that harbours such corrupt thoughts. And see the fruit of sin; to what it brings men, when their hearts are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. See also the faith of the saints, and their hope and power as to the cure of this great evil. There will come a Saviour, a great salvation, a salvation from sin. God will save his church from its enemies. He will save all believers from their own sins, that they may not be led captive by them, which will be everlasting joy to them. From this work the Redeemer had his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins, Mt 1:21.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/53.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There were they in great fear ... - Margin, as in Hebrew, "they feared a fear." For the general meaning of the verse, see the notes at <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>. There is, however, an important change introduced here - the most important in the psalm. The general sentiment of two verses <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5-6</a> in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a> is here compressed into one, and yet with such an important change as to show that it was by design, and apparently to adapt it to some new circumstance. The solution of this would seem to be that the original form <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a> was suited to some occasion then present to the mind of the writer, and that some new event occurred to which the general sentiment in the psalm might be easily applied (or which would express that as well as could be done by an entirely new composition), but that, in order to adapt it to this new purpose, it would be proper to insert some expression more particularly referring to the event.<p>The principal of these additions is found in the verse before us. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5-6</a>, the language is, "There were they in great fear, for God is in the generation of the righteous; ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his refuge." In the psalm before us, the language is, "There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them." "Where no fear was." The reference here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>, is to the fear or consternation of the people of God on account of the designs and efforts of the wicked. They were apprehensive of being overthrown by the wicked. The design of the psalmist in both cases is to show that there was no occasion for that fear. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>, he shows it by saying that "God is in the congregation of the righteous." In the psalm before us fie says expressly that there was no ground for that fear - "where no fear was," - and he adds, as a reason, that God had "scattered the bones" of them "that encamped against" them. That is, though there seemed to be occasion for fear - though those enemies were formidable in numbers and in power - yet God was their friend, and he had now showed them that they had no real occasion for alarm by dispersing those foes.<p>For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee - Of the besieger. This, as already intimated, would seem to have been introduced in order to adapt the psalm to the particular circumstances of the occasion when it was revised. From this clause, as well as others, it appears probable that the particular occasion contemplated in the revision of the psalm was an attack on Jerusalem, or a siege of the city - an attack which had been repelled, or a siege which the enemy had been compelled to raise. That is, they had been overthrown, and their bones had been scattered, unburied, on the ground. The whole language of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a>, thus modified, would be well suited to such an occurrence. The general description of atheism and wickedness in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a> would be appropriate in reference to such an attempt on the city - for those who made the attack might well be represented as practically saying that there was no God; as being corrupt and abominable; as bent on iniquity; as polluted and defiled; and as attempting to eat up the people of God as they eat bread; and as those who did not call upon God. The verse before us would describe them as discomfited, and as being scattered in slaughtered heaps upon the earth.<p>Thou hast put them to shame - That is, they had been put to shame by being overthrown; by being unsuccessful in their attempt. The word "thou" here must be understood as referring to God.<p>Because God hath despised them - He has wholly disapproved their character, and he has "despised "their attempts; that is, he has shown that they were not formidable or to be feared. They were efforts which might be looked on with contempt, and he had evinced this by showing how easily they could be overthrown. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/53.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

They were seized with a supernaturally inspired terror, where there was no natural cause for panic. Cp. <a href="/1_samuel/14-15.htm" title="And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.">1 Samuel 14:15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm" title="For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.">2 Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-7.htm" title="Behold, I will send a blast on him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.">2 Kings 19:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm" title="And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.">2 Kings 19:35</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for God hath scattered</span> &c.] The bones of Israel’s enemies lie bleaching on the plain, where their bodies were left unburied (<a href="/ezekiel/6-5.htm" title="And I will lay the dead carcasses of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.">Ezekiel 6:5</a>). This cannot be an anticipation of some further defeat. It must rather be an allusion to some historic event; and it at once suggests the annihilation of Sennacherib’s great army. Probably the text was intentionally altered in this recension in order to introduce a reference to the most famous example in later times of the discomfiture of worldly arrogance venturing to measure its strength with Jehovah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>against <span class="ital">thee</span>] The people of God are addressed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou hast put</span> them <span class="ital">to shame</span>] Cp. <a href="/2_kings/19-20.htm" title="Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, That which you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.">2 Kings 19:20</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath despised them</span>] R.V. <span class="ital">rejected them</span>, as the word is often rendered elsewhere.

This clause takes the place of the following in <a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>.: "For God is in the generation of the righteous" - a very considerable change, which must certainly have been intentional. On the second occasion whereto the psalm was made applicable, there must have been a very great catastrophe - some vast slaughter of an enemy who had been at open war with Israel. Sennacherib is suggested (Canon Cook). Thou hast put them to shams, because God hath despised them. The clause in <a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>. which this replaces runs as follows: "Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his Refuge."

If this be attained, then he will for ever give thanks and further wait on the Name, i.e., the self-attestation, of God, which is so gracious and kind, he will give thanks and "wait" in the presence of all the saints. This "waiting," &#1493;&#1488;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, is open to suspicion, since what he intends to do in the presence of the saints must be something that is audible or visible to them. Also "hoping in the name of God" is, it is true, not an unbiblical notional combination (<a href="/isaiah/36-8.htm">Isaiah 36:8</a>); but in connection with &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; &#1499;&#1497; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; which follows, one more readily looks for a verb expressing a thankful and laudatory proclamation (cf. <a href="/psalms/54-8.htm">Psalm 54:8</a>).

The whole church (<a href="/psalms/22-23.htm">Psalm 22:23</a>., <a href="/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a>.) shall be witness of his thankfulness to God, and of his proclamation of the proofs which God Himself has given of His love and favour. </body></html>
