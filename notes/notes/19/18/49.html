It seems almost too magnificent a thought in David, that he could draw the surrounding nations within the circle of the religion as he had drawn them within the dominion of Israel. Nor is it likely that an individual would use such an expression. Israel as a nation might praise God “among the nations.” Therefore this verse is adduced as an argument by those who assign a later date to the psalm. But perhaps we are only to think of the nations as brought (see <a href="/psalms/18-44.htm" title="As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves to me.">Psalm 18:44</a>) an <span class= "ital">unwilling </span>audience of the praises which the conqueror raises to his God for the strength that had subdued them.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:32, and the following verses, are the gifts of God to the spiritual warrior, whereby he is prepared for the contest, after the example of his victorious Leader. Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore. Amen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore will I give thanks unto thee - Margin, confess. The Hebrew word - &#1497;&#1491;&#1492;  ya&#770;da&#770;h - in the form used here, means properly to profess, to confess, to acknowledge; then especially to acknowledge or recognize blessings and favors; in other words, to give thanks, to praise. The idea here is that he would make a public acknowledgment of those blessings which he had received; or that he would cause the remembrance of them to be celebrated among the nations.<p>Among the heathen - Among the nations. See the note at <a href="/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a>. The meaning here is, that he would cause these blessings to be remembered by making a record of them in this song of praise; a song that would be used not only in his own age and in his own country, but also among other nations, and in other times. He would do all in his power to make the knowledge of these favors, and these proofs of the existence of the true God, known abroad and transmitted to other times. The apostle Paul uses this language <a href="/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9</a> as expressing properly the fact that the knowledge of God was to be communicated to the "Gentiles:" "As it is written, For this cause will I confess to thee among the Gentiles." The word "heathen" or nations, in the passage before us, corresponds precisely with the meaning of the word Gentiles; and Paul has used the language of the psalm legitimately and properly as showing that it was a doctrine of the Old Testament that the truths of religion were not to be confined to the Jews, but were to be made known to other nations.<p>And sing praises unto thy name - Unto thee; the name often being used to denote the person. The meaning is, that he would cause the praises of God to be celebrated among foreign or pagan nations, as the result of what God had done for him. Far, probably, very far beyond what David anticipated when he penned this psalm, this has been done. The psalm itself has been chanted by million who were not in existence, and in lands of which the psalmist had no knowledge; and, connected as it has been with the other psalms in Christian worship, it has contributed in an eminent degree to extend the praises of God far in the earth, and to transmit the knowledge of him to generations as they succeeded one another. What David anticipated is, moreover, as yet only in the progress of fulfillment. Millions not yet born will make use of the psalm, as million have done before, as the medium of praise to God; and down to the most distant times this sacred song, in connection with the others in the Book of Psalms, will contribute to make God known in the earth, and to secure for him the praises of mankind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>49, 50. Paul (Ro 15:9) quotes from this doxology to show that under the Old Testament economy, others than the Jews were regarded as subjects of that spiritual government of which David was head, and in which character his deliverances and victories were typical of the more illustrious triumphs of David's greater Son. The language of Ps 18:50 justifies this view in its distinct allusion to the great promise (compare 2Sa 7:12). In all David's successes he saw the pledges of a fulfilment of that promise, and he mourned in all his adversities, not only in view of his personal suffering, but because he saw in them evidences of danger to the great interests which were committed to his keeping. It is in these aspects of his character that we are led properly to appreciate the importance attached to his sorrows and sufferings, his joys and successes.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Among the heathen; </span> or, among the Gentiles or nations; i.e. either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

With respect to the &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; and the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497; which follows, &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; &#1506;&#1501; can only be understood of the conflicts among his own people, in which David was involved by the persecution of Saul and the rebellions of Absolom and Sheba the son of Bichri; and from which Jahve delivered him, in order to preserve him for his calling of world-wide dominion in accordance with the promise. We therefore interpret the passage according to &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>, and &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1501; in <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>; whereas the following &#1506;&#1501; comes to have a foreign application by reason of the attributive clause &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (Ges. 123, 3). The Niph. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; in <a href="/psalms/18-45.htm">Psalm 18:45</a> is the reflexive of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, to obey (e.g., <a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>), and is therefore to be rendered: show themselves obedient ( equals  Ithpa. in <a href="/daniel/7-27.htm">Daniel 7:27</a>). &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1488;&#1494;&#1503; implies more than that they obeyed at the word; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; means information, rumour, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1488;&#1494;&#1503; is the opposite of personal observation (<a href="/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>), it is therefore to be rendered: they submitted even at the tidings of my victories; and <a href="/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9</a>. is an example of this. &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; to lie, disown, feign, and flatter, is sued here, as it is frequently, of the extorted humility which the vanquished show towards the conqueror. <a href="/psalms/18-46.htm">Psalm 18:46</a> completes the picture of the reason of the sons of a foreign country "putting a good face on a bad game." They faded away, i.e., they became weak and faint-hearted (<a href="/exodus/18-18.htm">Exodus 18:18</a>), incapable of holding out against or breaking through any siege by David, and trembled, surrendering at discretion, out of their close places, i.e., out of their strongholds behind which they had shut themselves in (cf. <a href="/psalms/142-8.htm">Psalm 142:8</a>). The signification of being alarmed, which in this instance, being found in combination with a local &#1502;&#1503;, is confined to the sense of terrified flight, is secured to the verb &#1495;&#1512;&#1490; by the Arabic h&#803;arija (root h&#803;r, of audible pressure, crowding, and the like) to be pressed, crowded, tight, or narrow, to get in a strait, and the Targumic &#1495;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; &#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488;  equals  &#1488;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514;&#1488; &#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488; (vid., the Targums on <a href="/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>). Arab. h&#803;jl, to limp, halt, which is compared by Hitzig, is far removed as to the sound; and the most natural, but colourless Arab. chrj, to go out of (according to its radical meaning - cf. Arab. chrq, chr&#8219;, etc. - : to break forth, erumpere), cannot be supported in Hebrew or Aramaic. The &#1497;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; found in the borrowed passage in Micah, <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/7-17.htm">Micah 7:17</a>, favours our rendering. </body></html>
