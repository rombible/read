The reader will observe that this verse contains a continued chain of metaphors, and is a sublime paraphrase on the first commandment, declaring that Jehovah, the God of Israel, alone, was the foundation of his confidence, and the author of his security and happiness: by whom he had been supported under his troubles, and delivered out of them; whose protection had secured him, and whose power had broken and scattered his enemies; by whose mercy and truth he was now set up on high above them all. <span class="ital">I will call — </span>Or, <span class="ital">I did call, and was saved. </span>For the future tense is commonly used for that which is past.

Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will love thee, O Lord - This verse is not found in the song in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>. It appears to have been added after the first composition of the psalm, either by David as expressive of his ardent love for the Lord in view of his merciful interpositions in his behalf, and on the most careful and most mature review of those mercies, or by the collector of the Psalms when they were adapted to purposes of public worship, as a proper commencement of the psalm - expressive of the feeling which the general tenor of the psalm was fitted to inspire. It is impossible now to determine by whom it was added; but no one can doubt that it is a proper commencement of a psalm that is designed to recount so many mercies. It is the feeling which all should have when they recall the goodness of God to them in their past lives.<p>My strength - The source of my strength, or from whom all my strength is derived. So <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>, "The Lord is the strength of my life." <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-8.htm">Psalm 28:8</a>, "he is the saving strength of his anointed."

"The servant of the Lord," which in the Hebrew precedes "David," is a significant part of the title (and not a mere epithet of David), denoting the inspired character of the song, as the production of one entrusted with the execution of God's will. He was not favored by God because he served Him, but served Him because selected and appointed by God in His sovereign mercy. After a general expression of praise and confidence in God for the future, David gives a sublimely poetical description of God's deliverance, which he characterizes as an illustration of God's justice to the innocent and His righteous government. His own prowess and success are celebrated as the results of divine aid, and, confident of its continuance, he closes in terms of triumphant praise. 2Sa 22:1-51 is a copy of this Psalm, with a few unimportant variations recorded there as a part of the history, and repeated here as part of a collection designed for permanent use.<p>1. I will love thee&#8212;with most tender affection.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/18.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 I will love thee, O Lord, my strength.<p>2 The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.<p>3 I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from mine enemies.<p><a href="/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1</a><p>"I will love thee, O Lord." With strong, hearty affection will I cling to thee; as a child to its parent, or a spouse to her husband. The word is intensely forcible, the love is of the deepest kind. "I will love heartily, with my inmost bowels." Here is a fixed resolution to abide in the nearest and most intimate union with the Most High. Our triune God deserves the warmest love of all our hearts. Father, Son and Spirit have each a claim upon our love. The solemn purpose never to cease loving naturally springs from present fervour of affection. It is wrong to make rash resolutions, but this when made in the strength of God is most wise and fitting. "My strength." Our God is the strength of our life, our graces, our works, our hopes, our conflicts, our victories. This verse is not found in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22</a>, and is a most precious addition, placed above all and after all to form the pinnacle of the temple, the apex of the pyramid. Love is still the crowning grace.<p><a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a><p>"The Lord is my rock and my fortress." Dwelling among the crags and mountain fastnesses of Judea, David had escaped the malice of Saul, and here he compares his God to such a place of concealment and security. Believers are often hidden in their God from the strife of tongues and the fury of the storm of trouble. The clefts of the Rock of Ages are safe abodes. "My deliverer," interposing in my hour of peril. When almost captured the Lord's people are rescued from the hand of the mighty by him who is mightier still. This title of "deliverer" has many sermons in it, and is well worthy of the study of all experienced saints. "My God;" this is all good things in one. There is a boundless wealth in this expression; it means, my perpetual, unchanging, infinite, eternal good. He who can say truly "my God," may well add, "my heaven, my all." "My strength;" this word is really "my rock," in the sense of strength and immobility. My sure, unchanging, eternal confidence and support. Thus the word rock occurs twice, but it is no tautology, for the first time it is a rock for concealment, but here a rock for firmness and immutability. "In whom I will trust." Faith must be exercised, or the preciousness of God is not truly known; and God must be the object of faith, or faith is mere presumption. "My buckler, warding off the blows of my enemy, shielding me from arrow or sword. The Lord furnishes his warriors with weapons both offensive and defensive. Our armoury is completely stored so that none need go to battle unarmed. "The horn of my salvation," enabling me to push down my foes, and to triumph over them with holy exultation. "My high tower," a citadel high planted on a rocky eminence beyond the reach of my enemies, from the heights of which I look down upon their fury without alarm, and survey a wide landscape of mercy reaching even unto the goodly land beyond Jordan. Here are many words, but none too many; we might profitably examine each one of them had we leisure, but summing up the whole, we may conclude with Calvin, that David here equips the faithful from head to foot.<p><a href="/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a><p>In this verse the happy poet resolves to invoke the Lord in joyful song, believing that in all future conflicts his God would deal as well with him as in the past. It is well to pray to God as to one who deserves to be praised, for then we plead in a happy and confident manner. If I feel that I can and do bless the Lord for all his past goodness, I am bold to ask great things of him. That word So has much in it. To be saved singing is to be saved indeed. Many are saved mourning and doubting; but David had such faith that he could fight singing, and win the battle with a song still upon his lips. How happy a thing to receive fresh mercy with a heart already sensible of mercy enjoyed, and to anticipate new trials with a confidence based upon past experiences of divine love!<p>"No fearing or doubting with Christ on our side,<p>We hope to die shouting, 'The Lord will provide.'" <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm, with some few and small variations, is written <span class="bld">2 Samuel 22</span>.

These words are not in twenty second chapter of Second Samuel: the psalm there begins with <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. The psalmist here expresses his love to the Lord, and his continuance in it; that Jehovah the Father was, is, and ever will be the object of Christ's love, is certain; and which has appeared by his readiness in the council and covenant of grace to do his will; by his coming down from heaven to earth for that purpose; by his delight in it, it being his meat and drink to do it; and by his sufferings and death, which were in compliance with, and obedience to it, <a href="/john/14-31.htm">John 14:31</a>; and as in David, so in all regenerate ones, there is love to God; Jehovah is loved by them in all his persons; Jehovah the Father is loved, and to be loved, for the perfections of his nature, because of the works of his hands, of creation and providence; and particularly because of his works of special grace and goodness, and especially because of his love wherewith he has loved his people, <a href="/1_john/4-19.htm">1 John 4:19</a>. Jehovah the Son is loved, and to be loved, above all creatures and things whatever, sincerely and heartily, fervently and constantly; because of the loveliness of his person, the love of his heart, and his works of grace and redemption; all of him is lovely; and he is to be loved, and is loved, in his person, offices, relations, people, word, and ordinances: Jehovah the Spirit is loved, and to be loved, because of his person and perfections, and operations of grace; as a sanctifier, comforter, the spirit of adoption, the earnest and pledge of eternal glory. The word here used signifies the most intimate, tender, and affectionate love; it often designs mercy and bowels of mercy; so Aben Ezra interprets it of seeking mercy of God: the reasons are as follow in this verse and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, because "the Lord is my strength"; so he was to Christ as man, who as such was the man of his right hand, the Son of Man, whom he made strong for himself, to do his work, and for his glory, <a href="/psalms/80-17.htm">Psalm 80:17</a>; he promised to strengthen him, and he did, <a href="/psalms/89-21.htm">Psalm 89:21</a>; and so he is the strength of all his saints, even Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit; he is the strength of their hearts both in life and at death; he is the strength of their graces, who strengthens that which he has wrought for them, and in them; he strengthens them to do their duty, to bear the cross, and every affliction, and against every enemy of their souls; and this renders him very lovely and amiable to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">I will love thee</span>] Fervently do I love thee, a word occurring nowhere else in this form, and denoting tender and intimate affection.

But &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493; can be the accusative of the member, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, for "it is true the step is not a member" (Hitz.), but since "step" and "foot" are interchangeable notions, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>, the &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8; &#787; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is applicable to the former, and as, e.g., Homer says, Iliad vii. 355: &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, the Hebrew poet can also say: they have encompassed us (and in fact) our steps, each of our steps (so that we cannot go forwards or backwards with our feet). The Ker &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; gets rid of the change in number which we have with the Chethb &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;; the latter, however, is admissible according to parallels like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5</a>, and corresponds to David's position, who is hunted by Saul and at the present time driven into a strait at the head of a small company of faithful followers. Their eyes - he goes on to say in <a href="/psalms/17-11.htm">Psalm 17:11</a> - have they set to fell, viz., us, who are encompassed, to the earth, i.e., so that we shall be cast to the ground. &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; is transitive, as in <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-4.htm">Psalm 62:4</a>, in the transitively applied sense of <a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/37-31.htm">Psalm 37:31</a>): to incline to fall (whereas in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-19.htm">Psalm 44:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-7.htm">Job 31:7</a>, it means to turn away from); and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (without any need fore the conjecture &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1495;) expresses the final issue, instead of &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>. By the expression &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; one is prominently singled out from the host of the enemy, viz., its chief, the words being: his likeness is as a lion, according to the peculiarity of the poetical style, of changing verbal into substantival clauses, instead of &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;. Since in Old Testament Hebrew, as also in Syriac and Arabic, &#1499; is only a preposition, not a connective conjunction, it cannot be rendered: as a lion longs to prey, but: as a lion that is greedy or hungry (cf. Arab. ksf, used of sinking away, decline, obscuring or eclipsing, growing pale, and Arab. chsf, more especially of enfeebling, hunger, distinct from &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507;  equals  Arab. ks&#774;f, to peel off, make bare) to ravin. In the parallel member of the verse the participle alternates with the attributive clause. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; is (according to Meier) the young lion as being covered with thicker hair. </body></html>
