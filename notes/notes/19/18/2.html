Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord is my rock - The idea in this expression, and in the subsequent parts of the description, is that he owed his safety entirely to God. He had been unto him as a rock, a tower, a buckler, etc. - that is, he had derived from God the protection which a rock, a tower, a citadel, a buckler furnished to those who depended on them, or which they were designed to secure. The word "rock" here has reference to the fact that in times of danger a lofty rock would be sought as a place of safety, or that men would fly to it to escape from their enemies. Such rocks abound in Palestine; and by the fact that they are elevated and difficult of access, or by the fact that those who fled to them could find shelter behind their projecting crags, or by the fact that they could find security in their deep and dark caverns, they became places of refuge in times of danger; and protection was often found there when it could not be found in the plains below. Compare <a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/61-2.htm">Psalm 61:2</a>. Also, Josephus, Ant., b. xiv., ch. xv.<p>And my fortress - He has been to me as a fortress. The word fortress means a place of defense, a place so strengthened that an enemy could not approach it, or where one would be safe. Such fortresses were often constructed on the rocks or on hills, where those who fled there would be doubly safe. Compare <a href="/job/39-28.htm">Job 39:28</a>. See also the notes at <a href="/isaiah/33-16.htm">Isaiah 33:16</a>.<p>And my deliverer - Delivering or rescuing me from my enemies.<p>My God - Who hast been to me a God; that is, in whom I have found all that is implied in the idea of "God" - a Protector, Helper, Friend, Father, Saviour. The notion or idea of a "God" is different from all other ideas, and David had found, as the Christian now does, all that is implied in that idea, in Yahweh, the living God.<p>My strength - Margin, "My rock" So the Hebrew, although the Hebrew word is different from that which is used in the former part of the verse. Both words denote that God was a refuge or protection, as a rock or crag is to one in danger (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37</a>), though the exact difference between the words may not be obvious.<p>In whom I will trust - That is, I have found him to be such a refuge that I could trust in him, and in view of the past I will confide in him always.<p>My buckler - The word used here is the same which occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>, where it is translated "shield." See the notes at that verse.<p>And the horn of my salvation - The "horn" is to animals the means of their defense. Their strength lies in the horn. Hence, the word is used here, as elsewhere, to represent that to which we owe our protection and defense in danger; and the idea here is, that God was to the psalmist what the horn is to animals, the means of his defense. Compare <a href="/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4-5</a>, <a href="/psalms/75-10.htm">Psalm 75:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/148-14.htm">Psalm 148:14</a>.<p>And my high tower - He is to me what a high tower is to one who is in danger. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>, "The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe." The word used here occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>, where it is rendered "refuge." (Margin, "A high place.") See the notes at that verse. Such towers were erected on mountains, on rocks, or on the walls of a city, and were regarded as safe places mainly because they were inaccessible. So the old castles in Europe - as that at Heidelberg, and generally those along the Rhine - were built on lofty places, and in such positions as not to be easily accessible. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2, 3.

These various epithets show the fulness of safety in Jehovah, the various ways he has to deliver his people from their enemies, and secure them from danger; and the psalmist beholding and claiming his interest in him under all these characters, rendered him exceeding lovely and delightful to him; and each of them contain a reason why he loved him, and why, in the strength of grace, he determined to love him.

Their heart is called fat, adeps, not as though &#1495;&#1500;&#1489; could in itself be equivalent to &#1500;&#1489;, more especially as both words are radically distinct (&#1495;&#1500;&#1489; from the root &#1500;&#1489;, &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;; &#1500;&#1489; from the root &#1500;&#1489;, &#1500;&#1507; to envelope: that which is enveloped, the kernel, the inside), but (without any need for von Ortenberg's conjecture &#1495;&#1500;&#1489; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; &#1505;&#1490;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; "they close their heart with fat") because it is, as it were, entirely fat (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-70.htm">Psalm 119:70</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/73-7.htm">Psalm 73:7</a>), and because it is inaccessible to any feeling of compassion, and in general incapable of the nobler emotions. To shut up the fat  equals  the heart (cf. &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>), is equivalent to: to fortify one's self wilfully in indifference to sympathy, tender feeling, and all noble feelings (cf. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1489;  equals  to harden, <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>). The construction of &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493; (which agrees in sound with &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="/job/15-27.htm">Job 15:27</a>) is just the same as that of &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>. On the other hand, &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (after the form &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; and written plene) is neither such an accusative of the means or instrument, nor the second accusative, beside the accusative of the object, of that by which the object is surrounded, that is usually found with verbs of surrounding (e.g., <a href="/psalms/5-13.htm">Psalm 5:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a>); for "they have surrounded me (us) with our step" is unintelligible. But &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493; can be the accusative of the member, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, for "it is true the step is not a member" (Hitz.), but since "step" and "foot" are interchangeable notions, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>, the &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8; &#787; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is applicable to the former, and as, e.g., Homer says, Iliad vii. 355: &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, the Hebrew poet can also say: they have encompassed us (and in fact) our steps, each of our steps (so that we cannot go forwards or backwards with our feet). The Ker &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; gets rid of the change in number which we have with the Chethb &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;; the latter, however, is admissible according to parallels like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5</a>, and corresponds to David's position, who is hunted by Saul and at the present time driven into a strait at the head of a small company of faithful followers. Their eyes - he goes on to say in <a href="/psalms/17-11.htm">Psalm 17:11</a> - have they set to fell, viz., us, who are encompassed, to the earth, i.e., so that we shall be cast to the ground. &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; is transitive, as in <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-4.htm">Psalm 62:4</a>, in the transitively applied sense of <a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/37-31.htm">Psalm 37:31</a>): to incline to fall (whereas in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-19.htm">Psalm 44:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-7.htm">Job 31:7</a>, it means to turn away from); and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (without any need fore the conjecture &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1495;) expresses the final issue, instead of &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>. By the expression &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; one is prominently singled out from the host of the enemy, viz., its chief, the words being: his likeness is as a lion, according to the peculiarity of the poetical style, of changing verbal into substantival clauses, instead of &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;. Since in Old Testament Hebrew, as also in Syriac and Arabic, &#1499; is only a preposition, not a connective conjunction, it cannot be rendered: as a lion longs to prey, but: as a lion that is greedy or hungry (cf. Arab. ksf, used of sinking away, decline, obscuring or eclipsing, growing pale, and Arab. chsf, more especially of enfeebling, hunger, distinct from &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507;  equals  Arab. ks&#774;f, to peel off, make bare) to ravin. In the parallel member of the verse the participle alternates with the attributive clause. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; is (according to Meier) the young lion as being covered with thicker hair. </body></html>
