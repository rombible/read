Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore.

That is, foreigners. The word rendered fade away - &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;  na&#770;be&#770;l - means properly to wilt, wither, fall away, as applicable to flowers, leaves, or plants, <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-30.htm">Isaiah 1:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>. Here it means that those foreign nations would diminish in numbers and in power, until they should wholly disappear. The idea is, that all his foes would vanish, and that he and his kingdom would be left in peace.<p>And be afraid out of their close places - The word rendered be afraid means to tremble - as those do who are in fear. The word rendered close places means places that are shut up or enclosed, as fortified cities or fortresses. The reference is to their places of retreat, towns, castles, fortresses. The meaning is, that they would find such places to be no security, and would tremble out of them; that is, they would flee out of them in consternation and alarm. The general thought is that of ultimate complete security for himself and his kingdom, or entire deliverance from all his enemies. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>44. submit, &c.&#8212;(compare Margin)&#8212;that is, show a forced subjection.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shall fade away, </span> i.e. shall wither and decay in their hopes and strength. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Be afraid, </span> i.e. shall come trembling; one verb being put for two, as <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/22-21.htm" title="Save me from the lion's mouth: for you have heard me from the horns of the unicorns.">Psalm 22:21</a></span>, <span class="ital">thou hast heard me</span>, i.e. having delivered me; and <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/42-1.htm" title="As the hart pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul after you, O God.">Psalm 42:1</a></span>, <span class="ital">panteth</span>, i.e. panting hasteneth; and in many other places. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Out of their close places; </span> out of their strong holds, where they shall lurk and keep themselves for fear of me, and whence they dare not stir without trembling.

According to the Hebrew syntax the whole of this passage is a retrospect. The imperfect signification of the futures in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-38.htm">Psalm 18:38</a>, <a href="/psalms/18-39.htm">Psalm 18:39</a> is made clear from the aorist which appears in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-40.htm">Psalm 18:40</a>, and from the perfects and futures in what follows it. The strophe begins with an echo of <a href="/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a> (cf. supra <a href="/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>). The poet calls his opponents &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a>, <a href="/psalms/44-6.htm">Psalm 44:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-23.htm">Psalm 74:23</a>, cf. &#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20</a>, inasmuch as &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; by itself has the sense of rising up in hostility and consequently one can say &#1511;&#1502;&#1497; instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;   <a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>).<p>(Note: In the language of the Beduins ko&#770;m is war, feud, and ko&#770;ma&#772;n&#305;&#770; (denominative from ko&#772;m) my enemy (hostis); ko&#772;m also has the signification of a collective of ko&#772;ma&#772;n&#305;&#770;, and one can equally well say: entum waija&#770;na&#770; ko&#770;m, you and we are enemies, and: be&#770;na&#770;tna&#770; ko&#770;m, there is war between us.)<p>The frequent use of this phrase (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/36-13.htm">Psalm 36:13</a>, <a href="/lamentations/1-14.htm">Lamentations 1:14</a>) shows that &#1511;&#1493;&#1501; in <a href="/psalms/18-39.htm">Psalm 18:39</a> does not mean "to stand (resist)," but "to rise (again)." The phrase &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1506;&#1512;&#1507;, however, which in other passages has those fleeing as its subject (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-6.htm">2 Chronicles 29:6</a>), is here differently applied: Thou gavest, or madest me mine enemies a back, i.e., those who turn back, as in <a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>.
