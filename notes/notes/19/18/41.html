Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore. Amen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They cried - They cried out for help, for mercy, for life. In modern language, "they begged for quarter." They acknowledged that they were vanquished, and entreated that their lives might be spared.<p>But there was none to save them - To preserve their lives. No help appeared from their own countrymen; they found no mercy in me or my followers; and God did not interpose to deliver them.<p>Even unto the Lord - As a last resort. People appeal to everything else for help before they will appeal to God; often when they come to Him it is by constraint, and not willingly; if the danger should leave them, they would cease to call upon Him. Hence, since there is no real sincerity in their calling upon God - no real regard for his honor or his commands - their cries are not heard, and they perish. The course of things with a sinner, however, is often such that, despairing of salvation in any other way, and seeing that this is the only true way, he comes with a heart broken, contrite, penitent, and then God never turns away from the cry. No sinner, though as a last resort, who comes to God in real sincerity, will ever be rejected.<p>But he answered them not - He did not put forth his power to save them from my sword; to keep them alive when they were thus vanquished. Had they cried unto him to save their souls, he would undoubtedly have done it; but their cry was for life - for the divine help to save them from the sword of the conqueror. There might have been many reasons why God should not interpose to save them from the regular consequences of valor when they had been in the wrong and had begun the war; but there would have been no reason why he should not interpose if they had called upon him to save them from their sins. There may be many reasons why God should not save sinners from the temporal judgments due to their sins - the intemperate from the diseases, the poverty, and the wretchedness consequent on that vice - or the licentious from the woes and sorrows caused by such a course of life; but there is no reason, in any case, why God should not save from the eternal consequences of sin, if the sinner cries sincerely and earnestly for mercy.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40. given me the necks&#8212;literally, "backs of the necks"; made them retreat (Ex 23:27; Jos 7:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He speaks of his Israelitish enemies, who in their distresses prayed to God for help against him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They cried, but there was none to save them,....

But it seems better to explain, with Hengstenberg and the 'Speaker's Commentary,' that the heathen did sometimes, as a last resort, pray to a foreign god, whom they seemed to find by experience to be more powerful than their own (see <a href="/jonah/1-14.htm">Jonah 1:14</a>). Jehovah was known by name, as the God of the Israelites, to the surrounding nations. Mesha mentions him upon the Moabite Stone; and Sennacherib declared, by the mouth of Rabshakeh, "Am I come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it? The Lord (Jehovah) said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it" (<a href="/2_kings/18-25.htm">2 Kings 18:25</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:36-37) Yet it is not the brazen bow in itself that makes him victorious, but the helpful strength of his God. "Shield of Thy salvation" is that consisting of Thy salvation. &#1502;&#1490;&#1503; has an unchangeable , as it has always. The salvation of Jahve covered him as a shield, from which every stroke of the foe rebounded; the right hand of Jahve supported him that his hands might not become feeble in the conflict. In its ultimate cause it is the divine &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;, to which he must trace back his greatness, i.e., God's lowliness, by virtue of which His eyes look down upon that which is on the earth (<a href="/psalms/113-6.htm">Psalm 113:6</a>), and the poor and contrite ones are His favourite dwelling-place (<a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>.); cf. B. Megilla 31a, "wherever Scripture testifies of the &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; of the Holy One, blessed be He, it gives prominence also, in connection with it, to His condescension, &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a> and in connection with it <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a> and <a href="/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>." The rendering of Luther, who follows the lxx and Vulgate, "When Thou humblest me, Thou makest me great" is opposed by the fact that &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; means the bending of one's self, and not of another. What is intended is, that condescension of God to mankind, and especially to the house of David, which was in operation, with an ultimate view to the incarnation, in the life of the son of Jesse from the time of his anointing to his death, viz., the divine &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (<a href="/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4</a>), which elected the shepherd boy to be king, and did not cast him off even when he fell into sin and his infirmities became manifest. To enlarge his steps under any one is equivalent to securing him room for freedom of motion (cf. the opposite form of expression in <a href="/proverbs/4-12.htm">Proverbs 4:12</a>). Jahve removed the obstacles of his course out of the way, and steeled his ankles so that he stood firm in fight and endured till he came off victorious. The praet. &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1493; substantiates what, without any other indication of it, is required by the consecutio temporum, viz., that everything here has a retrospective meaning. </body></html>
