But though conscious to ourselves of many a false step, let there not be a wicked departure from our God. David kept his eye upon the rule of God's commands. Constant care to keep from that sin, whatever it be, which most easily besets us, proves that we are upright before God. Those who show mercy to others, even they need mercy. Those who are faithful to God, shall find him all that to them which he has promised to be. The words of the Lord are pure words, very sure to be depended on, and very sweet to be delighted in. Those who resist God, and walk contrary to him, shall find that he will walk contrary to them, Le 26:21-24. The gracious recompence of which David spoke, may generally be expected by those who act from right motives. Hence he speaks comfort to the humble, and terror to the proud; Thou wilt bring down high looks. And he speaks encouragement to himself; Thou wilt light my candle: thou wilt revive and comfort my sorrowful spirit; thou wilt guide my way, that I may avoid the snares laid for me. Thou wilt light my candle to work by, and give me an opportunity of serving thee. Let those that walk in darkness, and labour under discouragements, take courage; God himself will be a Light to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For all his judgments - All his statutes, ordinances, laws.

That is, the precepts of the law of God, which David had a respect unto, loved, took delight and pleasure in, and so had them all in his sight, and made them the rule of his actions; and the law of God is delighted in by regenerate persons, after the inward man; and though it is abolished as a covenant of works, it is a rule of walk and conversation to the saints; and as such they keep it in view, and regard it impartially, not only some of its precepts, but all. This in the highest and fullest sense was done by Christ, who was made under the law, in whose heart it was, and who came to fulfil it, and has completely fulfilled it; <p>and I did not put away his statutes from me; in <a href="/2_samuel/22-23.htm">2 Samuel 22:23</a>; it is read, "and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them"; the sense is the same; this may have respect to the ceremonial law, and the ordinances of it, which David abode by, very strictly observed, renewed, and put in order; and which Christ, his antitype, never departed from, but conformed unto throughout the whole of his life; witness his circumcision, keeping of the passover, attendance on the synagogue and temple worship; nor did he put them away until they had their full accomplishment in him; when there was a disannulling of them because of their weakness and unprofitableness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For all his judgments <i>were</i> before me, and I did not put away his <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> statutes from me.</span><p>(r) For all his dangers he exercised himself in the law of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>.

The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; occurs also in prose (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6</a>) without &#1497;&#1491; (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>, cf. on the other hand the borrowed passage, <a href="/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7</a>) in the signification to reach (after anything). The verb &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, however, is only found in one other instance, viz., <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/2-10.htm">Exodus 2:10</a>, as the root (transferred from the Egyptian into the Hebrew) of the name of Moses, and even Luther saw in it an historical allusion, "He hath made a Moses of me," He hath drawn me out of great (many) waters, which had well nigh swallowed me up, as He did Moses out of the waters of the Nile, in which he would have perished. This figurative language is followed, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-18.htm">Psalm 18:18</a>, by its interpretation, just as in <a href="/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7</a> the "great waters" are explained by &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;, which, however, is not suitable here, or at least is too limited.<p>With <a href="/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a> the hymn has reached the climax of epic description, from which it now descends in a tone that becomes more and more lyrical. In the combination &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; &#1506;&#1494;, &#1506;&#1494; is not an adverbial accusative, but an adjective, like &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1498; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a>, and &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (Hebrerbrief S. 353). &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces the reason for the interposition of the divine omnipotence, viz., the superior strength of the foe and the weakness of the oppressed one. On the day of his &#1488;&#1497;&#1491;, i.e., (vid., on <a href="/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>) his load or calamity, when he was altogether a homeless and almost defenceless fugitive, they came upon him (&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; <a href="/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>), cutting off all possible means of delivering himself, but Jahve became the fugitive's staff (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>) upon which he leaned and kept himself erect. By the hand of God, out of straits and difficulties he reached a broad place, out of the dungeon of oppression to freedom, for Jahve had delighted in him, he was His chosen and beloved one. &#1495;&#1508;&#1509; has the accent on the penult here, and Metheg as a sign of the lengthening (&#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1492;) beside the e&#772;, that it may not be read e&#774;.<p>(Note: In like manner Metheg is placed beside the ee of the final closed syllable that has lost the tone in &#1495;&#1508;&#1509; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-9.htm">Psalm 22:9</a>, &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, vid., Isaiah S. 594 note.)<p>The following strophe tells the reason of his pleasing God and of His not allowing him to perish.
