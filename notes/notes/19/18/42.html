Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore. Amen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind - As the fine dust is driven by the wind, so they fled before me. There could be no more striking illustration of a defeated army flying before a conqueror. DeWette says correctly that the idea is, "I beat them small, and scattered them as dust before the wind."<p>I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets - In the corresponding place in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-43.htm">2 Samuel 22:43</a>, this is, "I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad." The idea in the place before us is, that he poured them out, for so the Hebrew word means, as the dirt or mire in the streets. As that is trodden on, or trampled down, so they, instead of being marshalled for battle, were wholly disorganized, scattered, and left to be trodden down, as the most worthless object is. A similar image occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>, where God is speaking of Sennacherib: "I will send him against an hypocritical nation ... to tread them down like the mire of the streets." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>42.

They being given up by God, and he not answering to their cries; the phrase denotes the utter ruin and destruction of them, and represents their case as desperate and irrecoverable; being, as it were, pounded to dust, and that driven away with the wind: just as the destruction of the four monarchies is signified by the iron, clay, brass, silver, and gold, being broken to pieces, and made like the chaff of the summer threshing floor, and carried away with the wind, so that no place is found for them any more, <a href="/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>; <p>I did cast them out as the dirt of the streets; expressing indignation and contempt: in <a href="/2_samuel/22-43.htm">2 Samuel 22:43</a>; it is, "I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did, spread them abroad"; which also denotes the low and miserable condition to which they were reduced, and the entire conquest made of them, and triumph over them; see <a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>; compare with this <a href="/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">42</span>. Two figures are combined to express the annihilation of David’s enemies. They were, as it were, pounded to dust (<a href="/2_kings/13-7.htm" title="Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.">2 Kings 13:7</a>), and then scattered like that dust driven before the wind. Cp. <a href="/isaiah/29-5.htm" title="Moreover the multitude of your strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away: yes, it shall be at an instant suddenly.">Isaiah 29:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm" title="Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.">Isaiah 41:2</a>. 2 Sam. reads only “as the dust of the earth.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I did cast them out</span> &c.] Flung them away as worthless refuse (<a href="/zephaniah/1-17.htm" title="And I will bring distress on men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.">Zephaniah 1:17</a>). But the mire of the streets is usually spoken of as trampled under foot (<a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm" title="I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.">Isaiah 10:6</a>; <a href="/micah/7-10.htm" title="Then she that is my enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said to me, Where is the LORD your God? my eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.">Micah 7:10</a>; <a href="/zechariah/10-5.htm" title="And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.">Zechariah 10:5</a>), and it suits the parallelism better to read with the LXX and 2 Sam., <span class="ital">I did stamp them</span> (<a href="/micah/4-13.htm" title="Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs brass: and you shall beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain to the LORD, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.">Micah 4:13</a>). The variation is again due to the confusion of similar letters (<span class="greekheb">ארקם</span>—<span class="greekheb">אדקם</span>). The addition at the end of the verse in 2 Sam., “and did spread them abroad,” is probably a gloss.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a>).

Language of utter contempt. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:36-37) Yet it is not the brazen bow in itself that makes him victorious, but the helpful strength of his God. "Shield of Thy salvation" is that consisting of Thy salvation. &#1502;&#1490;&#1503; has an unchangeable , as it has always. The salvation of Jahve covered him as a shield, from which every stroke of the foe rebounded; the right hand of Jahve supported him that his hands might not become feeble in the conflict. In its ultimate cause it is the divine &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;, to which he must trace back his greatness, i.e., God's lowliness, by virtue of which His eyes look down upon that which is on the earth (<a href="/psalms/113-6.htm">Psalm 113:6</a>), and the poor and contrite ones are His favourite dwelling-place (<a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>.); cf. B. Megilla 31a, "wherever Scripture testifies of the &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; of the Holy One, blessed be He, it gives prominence also, in connection with it, to His condescension, &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a> and in connection with it <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a> and <a href="/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>." The rendering of Luther, who follows the lxx and Vulgate, "When Thou humblest me, Thou makest me great" is opposed by the fact that &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; means the bending of one's self, and not of another. What is intended is, that condescension of God to mankind, and especially to the house of David, which was in operation, with an ultimate view to the incarnation, in the life of the son of Jesse from the time of his anointing to his death, viz., the divine &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (<a href="/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4</a>), which elected the shepherd boy to be king, and did not cast him off even when he fell into sin and his infirmities became manifest. To enlarge his steps under any one is equivalent to securing him room for freedom of motion (cf. the opposite form of expression in <a href="/proverbs/4-12.htm">Proverbs 4:12</a>). Jahve removed the obstacles of his course out of the way, and steeled his ankles so that he stood firm in fight and endured till he came off victorious. The praet. &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1493; substantiates what, without any other indication of it, is required by the consecutio temporum, viz., that everything here has a retrospective meaning. </body></html>
