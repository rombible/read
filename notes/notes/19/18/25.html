We cannot explain this description of God’s attitude to man, as if the poet were merely dealing with the conception of the Divine formed in the breast. No doubt his words are amply true in this sense. The human heart makes its God like itself, and to the pure and just He will be a pure and just God, to the cruel and unjust, cruel and unjust. But the definite mention of recompense in <a href="/psalms/18-24.htm" title="Therefore has the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.">Psalm 18:24</a>, and the reference to active interposition in behalf of the just in <a href="/psalms/18-27.htm" title="For you will save the afflicted people; but will bring down high looks.">Psalm 18:27</a>, leave us no option but to understand by “shew thyself” in <a href="/context/psalms/18-25.htm" title="With the merciful you will show yourself merciful; with an upright man you will show yourself upright;">Psalm 18:25-26</a>, not an inward conception, but an external manifestation. It is, in fact, nothing more than a re-statement of the truth of which the history of Pharaoh is the most signal historic declaration, and which we maintain whenever we speak of the natural consequences of sin as retributive justice, the truth which is summed up in the text, “whatsoever a mau soweth that shall he also reap.” We must at the same time remember that the form of the statement in the psalm is due to the view current in Israel before the development of the conception of Satanic agency, that all suggestions, evil as well as good, came from the mind of the Supreme Disposer of events.<p>(25) <span class= "bld">Man.</span>—The text of Samuel has “hero” (<span class= "ital">gebôr </span>instead of <span class= "ital">gebar</span>)<span class= "ital">.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/psalms/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/18-25.htm" title="With the merciful you will show yourself merciful; with an upright man you will show yourself upright;...">Psalm 18:25-27</a></span>. In these verses David lays down the general method of the procedure of God’s providence and moral government, which, in the issue, will be according to the moral character and conduct of men themselves. <span class="ital">With the merciful, </span>&c. — A declaration similar to that of our Lord, <span class="ital">Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. With an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright — </span>An invariable friend to his integrity; just to reward it, and faithful in all thy promises to encourage it. <span class="ital">With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure — </span>That is, the lover of purity, righteousness, and truth, and ever acting toward those whose character this is, according to the perfect rectitude and unspotted purity of thy own nature. <span class="ital">With the froward thou wilt show thyself froward — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">עם עקשׁ תתפתל</span>, <span class="ital">gnim gnickesh Tithpattal, </span>cum perverso eluctaris, Buxtorff. With the perverse thou strugglest, or, rather, wilt struggle or wrestle; that is, says Ab. Ezra, donec deviceris, until thou shalt conquer him. The word rendered <span class="ital">froward </span>signifies one of a <span class="ital">perverse </span>disposition, who twists and twines himself, just as his humour, passions, and interest lead him; or, a <span class="ital">crafty, wily </span>person, who accustoms himself to all the wiles of deceit. With one of this character, the psalmist says, God will wrestle. The meaning is, that he will deal with perverse, designing, and crafty men, according to their deserts; will oppose them in their designs, struggle against, and walk contrary to them, <a href="/context/leviticus/26-23.htm" title="And if you will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary to me;...">Leviticus 26:23-24</a>; that he will disappoint them in all their subtlest devices, and cause them to fall by those very wiles by which they endeavour to deceive and ruin others.

But though conscious to ourselves of many a false step, let there not be a wicked departure from our God. David kept his eye upon the rule of God's commands. Constant care to keep from that sin, whatever it be, which most easily besets us, proves that we are upright before God. Those who show mercy to others, even they need mercy. Those who are faithful to God, shall find him all that to them which he has promised to be. The words of the Lord are pure words, very sure to be depended on, and very sweet to be delighted in. Those who resist God, and walk contrary to him, shall find that he will walk contrary to them, Le 26:21-24. The gracious recompence of which David spoke, may generally be expected by those who act from right motives. Hence he speaks comfort to the humble, and terror to the proud; Thou wilt bring down high looks. And he speaks encouragement to himself; Thou wilt light my candle: thou wilt revive and comfort my sorrowful spirit; thou wilt guide my way, that I may avoid the snares laid for me. Thou wilt light my candle to work by, and give me an opportunity of serving thee. Let those that walk in darkness, and labour under discouragements, take courage; God himself will be a Light to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With the merciful - From the particular statement respecting the divine dealings with himself the psalmist now passes to a general statement (suggested by what God had done for him) in regard to the general principles of the divine administration. That general statement is, that God deals with men according to their character; or, that he will adapt his providential dealings to the conduct of men. They will find him to be such toward them as they have shown themselves to be toward him. The word merciful refers to one who is disposed to show kindness or compassion to those who are guilty, or to those who injure or wrong us.<p>Thou wilt show thyself merciful - Thou wilt evince toward him the same character which he shows to others. It is in accordance with this that the Saviour teaches us to pray, "And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors," <a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>. And in accordance also with this he said, "For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses," <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14-15</a>.<p>With an upright man - literally, a perfect man. See <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>, where the same word is used in the original, and rendered perfect. The idea is that of a man who is consistent, or whose character is complete in all its parts. See the note at <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>.<p>Thou wilt show thyself upright - Thou wilt deal with him according to his character. As he is faithful and just, so will he find that he has to do with a God who is faithful and just. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25-27.

The sense of the verse is, Thou metest to every one the same measure which he meteth out to others, and givest to him the fruit of his own doings, and therefore thou wilt perform mercy and truth to those who are merciful and true to others, as through thy mercy I have been. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful,.... The merciful man is the good, gracious, holy, and godly man, as the word (z) here used signifies, and is sometimes rendered; one that has received grace and mercy from the Lord, and has principles of grace and goodness wrought in him, and is kind and merciful to others, both to their souls and bodies; and to such men God shows himself merciful: not that they are first merciful to others, and then he is so to them, for it is just the reverse; nor is their mercifulness the cause or condition of his, for he has mercy on whom he will have mercy; but to such he shows fresh mercy, and bestows more grace upon them; they find grace and mercy with him now, and will do hereafter; see <a href="/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>. This may be applied to Christ, all whose ways are mercy and truth; he saw the estate his people would come into; he pitied their case, and became their surety in eternity; he betrothed them to himself in loving kindness and tender mercies; and undertook to feed the flock of slaughter, even the poor of the flock; having, through his merciful lovingkindness, assumed human nature, he went about doing good to the souls and bodies of men; he healed the diseased and fed the hungry, and had compassion on the ignorant, and them that were out of the way; and, as a merciful high priest, he bore the sins and sorrows of his people; and in his love and pity redeemed them, and continues to sympathize with them in all their afflictions and temptations; and though no mercy was shown him while he was suffering for them, for God spared him not, but awoke the sword of justice against him, and used him with the utmost rigour and severity; yet satisfaction being made, he did not leave him in the grave, nor suffer his holy, good, and merciful One to see corruption; but raised him from the dead, prevented him with the blessings of his goodness, and set upon his head a crown of honour and glory; <p>with an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright; an upright man, as the word (a) used signifies, is a perfect man, not absolutely, but comparatively; not in himself, but in Christ; perfect with a perfection of parts, but not of degrees; he is one that is upright in heart, sincere and without hypocrisy; an Israelite indeed, whose faith, hope, and love, are undisguised; he is a man of integrity, a faithful man, faithful to God, his cause and interest, his word and ordinances, and is faithful with the saints; he walks, uprightly according to the rule of God's word, and by faith in Christ; and to such upright men God shows himself upright, or faithful, by keeping his covenant with them, fulfilling his promises to them, and not suffering one good thing to fail he has given them reason to expect from him. This may also be interpreted of Christ, who is in the highest and fullest sense perfect, upright, and sincere, and faithful to him that appointed him; and as he has been faithful in all his covenant engagements with his Father, so his Father has been faithful to him in making good all he promised him; both with respect to his own glory, and the happiness of his people; see <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>. <p>(z) "benigno", Vatablus, Junius &amp; Tremellius; "bono", Gejerus, some in Vatablus; "qui bonitati studet", Tigurine version; "pio", Munster, Cocceius, Michaelis; "gracious saint", Ainsworth.

The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; occurs also in prose (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6</a>) without &#1497;&#1491; (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>, cf. on the other hand the borrowed passage, <a href="/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7</a>) in the signification to reach (after anything). The verb &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, however, is only found in one other instance, viz., <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/2-10.htm">Exodus 2:10</a>, as the root (transferred from the Egyptian into the Hebrew) of the name of Moses, and even Luther saw in it an historical allusion, "He hath made a Moses of me," He hath drawn me out of great (many) waters, which had well nigh swallowed me up, as He did Moses out of the waters of the Nile, in which he would have perished. This figurative language is followed, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-18.htm">Psalm 18:18</a>, by its interpretation, just as in <a href="/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7</a> the "great waters" are explained by &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;, which, however, is not suitable here, or at least is too limited.<p>With <a href="/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a> the hymn has reached the climax of epic description, from which it now descends in a tone that becomes more and more lyrical.
