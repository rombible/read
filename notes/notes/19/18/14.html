Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, he sent out his arrows - The word arrows here probably refers to the lightnings mentioned in the other clause of the verse. Those lightnings scattered around, and accomplishing such destruction, seemed to be arrows sent forth from the hand of God.<p>And scattered them - Herder refers this to the lightnings; DeWette, to the enemies of the psalmist. The latter seems to be the more correct interpretation, though the enemies of the psalmist are not here particularly specified. They seem, however, to have been in his eye throughout the psalm, for it was the victory achieved over them by the divine interposition that he was celebrating throughout the poem.<p>And he shot out lightnings - As arrows; or, as from a bow.<p>And discomfited them - literally, to impel, to drive; then, to put in commotion or consternation. The allusion is to an army whose order is disturbed, or which is thrown into confusion, and which is, therefore, easily conquered. The idea is that David achieved a victory over all his enemies, as if God had scattered them by a storm and tempest. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

God's "arrows" are often spoken cf. Job felt them within him (<a href="/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>).

We may understand by the expression any sharp pains, mental or bodily, which God sends<span class="cmt_word">. And he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</span> The effect of the tempest of God's wrath is to "scatter" and "discomfit" the enemy (comp. <a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>). Instead of" and he shot out lightnings," our Revisers give, <span class="accented">and lightnings manifold</span>, which is perhaps better. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:8-10) As these verses go on to describe, the being heard became manifest in the form of deliverance. All nature stands to man in a sympathetic relationship, sharing his curse and blessing, his destruction and glory, and to God is a (so to speak) synergetic relationship, furnishing the harbingers and instruments of His mighty deeds. Accordingly in this instance Jahve's interposition on behalf of David is accompanied by terrible manifestations in nature. Like the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68.htm">Psalm 68</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/77.htm">Psalm 77</a>, and the giving of the Law on Sinai, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a>, and like the final appearing of Jahve and of Jesus Christ according to the words of prophet and apostle (<a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3.htm">Habakkuk 3</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>.), the appearing of Jahve for the help of David has also extraordinary natural phenomena in its train. It is true we find no express record of any incident in David's life of the kind recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>, but it must be come real experience which David here idealises (i.e., seizes at its very roots, and generalises and works up into a grand majestic picture of his miraculous deliverance). Amidst earthquake, a black thunderstorm gathers, the charging of which is heralded by the lightning's flash, and its thick clouds descend nearer and nearer to the earth. The aorists in <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a> introduce the event, for the introduction of which, from <a href="/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a> onwards, the way has been prepared and towards which all is directed. The inward excitement of the Judge, who appears to His servant for his deliverance, sets the earth in violent oscillation. The foundations of the mountains (<a href="/isaiah/24-18.htm">Isaiah 24:18</a>) are that upon which they are supported beneath and within, as it were, the pillars which support the vast mass. &#1490;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473; (rhyming with &#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;) is followed by the Hithpa. of the same verb: the first impulse having been given they, viz., the earth and the pillars of the mountains, continue to shake of themselves. These convulsions occur, because "it is kindled with respect to God;" it is unnecessary to supply &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;, &#1495;&#1512;&#1492; &#1500;&#1493; is a synonym of &#1495;&#1501; &#1500;&#1493;. When God is wrath, according to Old Testament conception, the power of wrath which is present in Him is kindled and blazes up and breaks forth. The panting of rage may accordingly also be called the smoke of the fire of wrath (<a href="/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-5.htm">Psalm 80:5</a>). The smoking is as the breathing out of the fire, and the vehement hot breath which is inhaled and exhaled through the nose of one who is angry (cf. <a href="/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>), is like smoke rising from the internal fire of anger. The fire of anger itself "devours out of the mouth," i.e., flames forth out of the mouth, consuming whatever it lays hold of-in men in the form of angry words, with God in the fiery forces of nature, which are of a like kind with, and subservient to, His anger, and more especially in the lightning's flash. It is the lightning chiefly, that is compared here to the blazing up of burning coals. The power of wrath in God, becoming manifest in action, breaks forth into a glow, and before it entirely discharges its fire, it gives warning of action like the lightning's flash heralding the outburst of the storm. Thus enraged and breathing forth His wrath, Jahve bowed the heavens, i.e., caused them to bend towards the earth, and came down, and darkness of clouds (&#1506;&#1512;&#1508;&#1500; similar in meaning to &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, cf. &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) was under His feet: black, low-hanging clouds announced the coming of Him who in His wrath was already on His way downwards towards the earth. </body></html>
