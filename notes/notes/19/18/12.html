Through the dark curtain of clouds the lightnings dart like emanations from the Divine brightness which they hide. The difficulty arises from the position of <span class= "ital">avaiv, </span>“his clouds,” which looks like a subject rather than an object to <span class= "ital">avrû. </span>It has been conjectured, from comparison with Samuel, that the word has been inserted through error, from its likeness to the verb. If retained it must be rendered as object, “Out of the brightness of his presence there passed through his clouds hail and fiery coals.” And some obscurity of language is pardonable in a description of phenomena so overpowering and bewildering as “a tempest dropping fire.” A modern poet touches this feeling:—<p>“Then fire was sky, and sky fire,<p>And both one brief ecstasy,<p>Then ashes.”—R. BROWNING, <span class= "ital">Easter Day.</span><p>In the Authorised Version the thought is of a sudden clearing of the heavens, which is not true to nature, and the clause “hailstones and coals of fire” comes in as an exclamation, as in the next verse. But there it is probably an erroneous repetition, being wanting in Sam. and in the LXX. version of the psalm. Notice how the feeling of the terrible fury of the storm is heightened by the mention of “hail,” so rare in Palestine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/psalms/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/18-12.htm" title="At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.">Psalm 18:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">At the brightness that was before him, </span>&c. — Schultens, Waterland, and some others, translate this verse, <span class="ital">At his lightning, his clouds swelled and burst out into hail-stones and balls of fire. </span>The meaning is, that through the lightning his clouds <span class="ital">fermented, </span>that is, <span class="ital">swelled, </span>and, as it were, boiled over, being rarefied by the heat. In the former part of this description, the clouds are represented as condensed, heavy, and lowering, ready to burst out with all the fury of a tempest; and here, as beginning to disburden and discharge themselves, by the eruption of the lightning in fire, flames, and hail-stones mixed. The abrupt manner in which the burning coals and hail-stones are mentioned, points out the sudden and impetuous fall of them. The words rendered <span class="ital">coals of fire </span>here signify <span class="ital">living, burning coals. </span>Where the lightning fell it devoured all before it, and turned whatever it touched into burning embers.

Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>At the brightness that was before him - From the flash - the play of the lightnings that seemed to go before him.<p>His thick clouds passed - or, vanished. They seemed to pass away. The light, the flash, the blaze, penetrated those clouds, and seemed to dispel, or to scatter them. The whole heavens were in a blaze, as if there were no clouds, or as if the clouds were all driven away.

David here appears as passive throughout; the hand from out of the clouds seizes him and draws him out of mighty waters: while in the second part of the Psalm, in fellowship with God and under His blessing, he comes forward as a free actor.<p>The description begins in <a href="/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a> with the danger and the cry for help which is not in vain. The verb &#1488;&#1508;&#1507; according to a tradition not to be doubted (cf. &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1503; a wheel) signifies to go round, surround, as a poetical synonym of &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;, &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, and not, as one might after the Arabic have thought: to drive, urge. Instead of "the bands of death," the lxx (cf. <a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>) renders it &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; (constrictive pains) &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; but <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a> favours the meaning bands, cords, cf. <a href="/psalms/119-61.htm">Psalm 119:61</a> (where it is likewise &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497; instead of the &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, which one might have expected, <a href="/joshua/17-5.htm">Joshua 17:5</a>; <a href="/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>), death is therefore represented as a hunter with a cord and net, <a href="/psalms/91-3.htm">Psalm 91:3</a>. &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, compounded of &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; and &#1497;&#1506;&#1500; (from &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;, &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;, root &#1506;&#1500;), signifies unprofitableness, worthlessness, and in fact both deep-rooted moral corruption and also abysmal destruction (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-15.htm">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>, &#x392;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;  equals  &#x392;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bb; as a name of Satan and his kingdom).
