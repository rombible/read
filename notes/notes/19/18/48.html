Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore.

There is probably a special allusion here by the psalmist to Saul as his great enemy, but perhaps he had also in his eye others of the same kind, and the meaning may be that he had been delivered from all of that class of people.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>48. liftest me up&#8212;to safety and honors.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Above those that rise up against me; </span> above their malice and power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From the violent man; </span> from Saul, whom for honour’s sake he forbears to mention. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He delivereth me from mine enemies,.... From Saul and his men, from Ishbosheth and Abner, from Absalom, and the conspirators with him; so all believers are delivered out of the hands of their enemies by Christ, as that they can serve the Lord without fear; and so Christ himself is delivered from all his enemies, being raised from the dead, and set at the right hand of God, where he must reign till all enemies are put under his feet; <p>yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me; David was lifted up from a low and mean estate, and placed on the throne of Israel, above all those that rose up against him, and sought to destroy him; and the saints are set upon their high places in Christ, where they are out of the reach of their enemies to do them any harm; and Christ, he is highly exalted at the right hand of God, above all principality and power, might and dominion, and every name that is named in this world; <p>thou hast delivered me from the violent man; either from Saul, from whom David was delivered; or from Satan the enemy, the son of wickedness, who shall no more exact upon and afflict the Messiah, <a href="/psalms/89-21.htm">Psalm 89:21</a>.

The "deliverance" was especially from domestic foes (see vers. 17, 19). His foreign foes seem never to have brought David into much peril. Yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me. The "lifting up" was above enemies of both kinds (see ver. 43). Thou hast delivered me from the violent man (comp. ver. 17). There is no reason to doubt that in both places Saul is intended. He was at once David's "enemy," and a "man of violence." Were the question open otherwise, it would be closed by the statement in the title. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:42-43) Their prayer to their gods, wrung from them by their distress, and even to Jahve, was in vain, because it was for their cause, and too late put up to Him. &#1506;&#1500;  equals  &#1506;&#1500;; in <a href="/psalms/42-2.htm">Psalm 42:2</a> the two prepositions are interchanged. Since we do not pulverize dust but to dust, &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512; is to be taken as describing the result: so that they became as dust (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-30.htm">Job 38:30</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1503;, so that it is become like stone, and the extreme of such pregnant brevity of expression in <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>) before the wind (&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-17.htm">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>, before the front). The second figure is to be explained differently: I emptied them out (&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;&#1501; from &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;) like the dirt of the streets, i.e., not merely: so that they became such, but as one empties it out, - thus contemptuously, ignominiously and completely (cf. <a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>; <a href="/zechariah/10-5.htm">Zechariah 10:5</a>). The lxx renders it &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834; from &#1492;&#1512;&#1511; (root &#1512;&#1511; to stretch, make thin, cf. tendo tenius, dehnen dnn); and the text of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a> present the same idea in &#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1501;. </body></html>
