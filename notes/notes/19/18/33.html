Swiftness of foot was reckoned a very honourable qualification among the ancient warriors, who, as they generally fought on foot, were enabled, by their agility and swiftness, speedily to run from place to place, give orders, attack their enemies, defend their friends, and perform divers other offices the service might require of them: of which we have many instances in the battles of Homer and Virgil. One of the highest commendations Homer gives his principal hero is taken from his swiftness, terming him continually <span class="greekheb">ποδας οκυς Αχιλλευς</span>, <span class="ital">swift-footed Achilles. </span>This qualification was peculiarly useful to David, as the country of Judea, and some of those where he was obliged to make war, were very mountainous and steep. <span class="ital">And setteth me upon my high places — </span>Hebrew,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">יעמידני</span>, <span class="ital">jagnamideeni, he maketh me to stand — </span>That is, either he places me in safe and strong places, out of the reach of mine enemies; or he confirms and establishes me in that high and honourable estate, into which he hath advanced me, and gives me wisdom to improve my victories.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:32, and the following verses, are the gifts of God to the spiritual warrior, whereby he is prepared for the contest, after the example of his victorious Leader. Learn that we must seek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David the type, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up, without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies, compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring not only the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling upon the Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave; proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies, till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love the Lord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in every trouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walk with him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. If we belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquer and reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King, which is promised to all his seed for evermore.

The hind is the female deer, remarkable for fleetness or swiftness. The meaning here is, that God had made him alert or active, enabling him to pursue a flying enemy, or to escape from a swift-running foe.<p>And setteth me upon my high places - places of safety or refuge. The idea is, that God had given him security, or had rendered him safe from danger. Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>. Swiftness of foot, or ability to escape from, or to pursue an enemy, was regarded as of great value in ancient warfare. Achilles, according to the descriptions of Homer, was remarkable for it.

As light and swift as theirs, as the Targum; that is, either to flee, when there was a necessity for it, as Kimchi observes; or rather to pursue after the enemy, to run through a troop, and leap over a wall, as before; see <a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>; the same phrase is used in <a href="/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a>; and may be understood in a spiritual sense of that readiness and cheerfulness with which the saints run the ways of God's commandments, when their hearts are enlarged with his love and grace; and may very well be applied to Christ, who is often compared to a roe, or a young hart, for swiftness; who readily and at once engaged to come and do the will of God, and whose coming in the flesh, at the appointed time, was swift; and who made haste to do the work of God, in which he took the utmost pleasure; and who is a speedy and present help to his people in time of trouble; see Sol 2:8; <p>and setteth me upon my high places; the towers and fortresses, and strong and fortified places, where he was safe from his enemies; and: in a spiritual sense, may design the everlasting love of God, the covenant of grace, its blessings and promises; and Christ himself, with the fulness of grace in him, on which believers may be said to be set, when their faith is directed to them, and they live and dwell upon them; see <a href="/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a>; and, the words were fulfilled in Christ, when God highly exalted him at his right hand, and set him above all principalities and powers, and made him higher than the heavens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He maketh my feet like hinds' <i>feet</i>, and setteth me upon my <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> high places.</span><p>(a) As towers and forts, which he took out of the hands of God's enemies.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">33</span>. <span class="ital">like hinds’</span> feet] The hind, like the gazelle, was a type of the agility, swiftness, and sure-footedness which were indispensable qualifications in ancient warfare.

David’s high places are the mountain strongholds, the occupation of which secured him in the possession of the country. Cp. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-13.htm" title="He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>; and <a href="/habakkuk/3-19.htm" title="The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk on my high places.

The Israelites reckoned swiftness of foot, agility, and endurance among the highest of warlike qualities. These qualities were needed especially in the pursuit of defeated enemies; and the rapidity of David's conquests (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1-14</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-15.htm">2 Samuel 10:15</a>-20) must be ascribed to them mainly. <span class="cmt_word">And setteth me upon my high places</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> establishes me in the strongholds that command my extensive territory, and give me secure possession of it, as Zion, Rabbath-Ammon, Damascus, Petra, perhaps Zobah, Rehob, and others. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:25-28) What was said in <a href="/psalms/18-21.htm">Psalm 18:21</a> is again expressed here as a result of the foregoing, and substantiated in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>, <a href="/psalms/18-27.htm">Psalm 18:27</a>. &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491; is a friend of God and man, just as pius is used of behaviour to men as well as towards God. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; the man (construct of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;) of moral and religious completeness (integri  equals  integritatis, cf. <a href="/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>), i.e., of undivided devotion to God. &#1504;&#1489;&#1512; (instead of which we find &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1500;&#1489;&#1489; elsewhere, <a href="/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-1.htm">Psalm 73:1</a>) not one who is purified, but, in accordance with the reflexive primary meaning of Niph., one who is purifying himself, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, <a href="/1_john/3-3.htm">1 John 3:3</a>. &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; (the opposite of &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;) one who is morally distorted, perverse. Freely formed Hithpaels are used with these attributive words to give expression to the corresponding self-manifestation: &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1491;, &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1501; (Ges. 54, 2, b), &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;, and &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500; (to show one's self &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500; or &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;). The fervent love of the godly man God requites with confiding love, the entire submission of the upright with a full measure of grace, the endeavour after purity by an unbeclouded charity (cf. <a href="/psalms/73-1.htm">Psalm 73:1</a>), moral perverseness by paradoxical judgments, giving the perverse over to his perverseness (<a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>) and leading him by strange ways to final condemnation (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a>, cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-23.htm">Leviticus 26:23</a>.). The truth, which is here enunciated, is not that the conception which man forms of God is the reflected image of his own mind and heart, but that God's conduct to man is the reflection of the relation in which man has placed himself to God; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>. This universal truth is illustrated and substantiated in <a href="/psalms/18-28.htm">Psalm 18:28</a>. The people who are bowed down by affliction experience God's condescension, to their salvation; and their haughty oppressors, god's exaltation, to their humiliation. Lofty, proud eyes are among the seven things that Jahve hateth, according to <a href="/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a>. The judgment of God compels them to humble themselves with shame, <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>. </body></html>
