Those that truly love God, may triumph in him as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. It is good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy which magnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was a praying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as he did, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence is very fully described, ver. 7-15. Little appeared of man, but much of God, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the history of the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words which are used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Every part of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David is here. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in due time, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time. Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemane and Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepest calamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when the multitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love were withheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows of death surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made the earth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought him out, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in his undertaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then the earth shook and trembled - The description which follows here is one of the most sublime that is to be found in any language. It is taken from the fury of the storm and tempest, when all the elements are in commotion; when God seems to go forth in the greatness of his majesty and the terror of his power, to prostrate everything before him. We are not to regard this as descriptive of anything which literally occurred, but rather as expressive of the fact of the divine interposition, as if he thus came forth in the greatness of his power. There is no improbability indeed in supposing that in some of the dangerous periods of David's life, when surrounded by enemies, or even when in the midst of a battle, a furious tempest may have occurred that seemed to be a special divine interposition in his behalf, but we have no distinct record of such an event, and it is not necessary to suppose that such an event occurred in order to a correct understanding of the passage. All that is needful is to regard this as a representation of the mighty interposition of God; to suppose that his intervention was as direct, as manifest, and as sublime, as if he had thus interposed. There are frequent references in the Scriptures to such storms and tempests as illustrative of the majesty, the power, and the glory of God, and of the manner in which he interposes on behalf of his people. See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-5.htm">Psalm 144:5-7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/46-6.htm">Psalm 46:6-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1-11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-21.htm">Job 37:21-24</a>; <a href="/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>; and particularly <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3-16</a>. The description in Habakkuk strongly resembles the passage before us, and both were drawn doubtless from an actual observation of the fury of a tempest.<p>The foundations also of the hills moved - The mountains seemed to rock on their foundations. In the corresponding place in <a href="/2_samuel/22-8.htm">2 Samuel 22:8</a> the expression is, "The foundations of heaven moved and shook;" that is, that on which the heavens seem to rest was agitated. Many suppose that the expression refers to the mountains as if they bore up the heavens; but DeWette more properly supposes that the reference is to the heavens as a building or an edifice resting on foundations. Why the change was made in revising the psalm from the "foundations of the heavens" to the "foundations of the hills," it is impossible now to determine.<p>Because he was wroth - literally," Because it was inflamed (or enkindled) to him;" that is, because he was angry. Anger is often compared to a raging flame, because it seems to consume everything before it. Hence, we speak of it as "heated," as "burning." So we say of one that he is "inflamed by passion." The expression here is sublime in the highest degree. God seemed to be angry, and hence, he came forth in this awful manner, and the very earth trembled before him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7, 8.

Forthwith David’s prayer is answered by the Advent of Jehovah for the discomfiture of his enemies. He manifests Himself in earthquake and storm. The majestic though terrible phenomena of nature are the expression of His presence. Nature in its stern and awful aspect is a revelation of His judicial wrath. We may call this an ‘ideal’ description of a Theophany; for though it is possible that David refers to some occasion when his enemies were scattered by the breaking of a terrible storm (cp. <a href="/joshua/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven on them to Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.">Joshua 10:11</a>; <a href="/judges/5-20.htm" title="They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.">Jdg 5:20</a> f.; <a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm" title="And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.">1 Samuel 7:10</a>), we have no record of such an event having actually happened in his life; and in any case the picture is intended to serve as a description of God’s providential interposition for his deliverance in general, and not upon any single occasion. His power was exerted as really and truly as if all these extraordinary natural phenomena had visibly attested His Advent. Compare the accounts of the Exodus and the Giving of the Law. See <a href="/context/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled....">Exodus 19:16-18</a>; <a href="/context/judges/5-4.htm" title="LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water....">Jdg 5:4-5</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/68-7.htm" title="O God, when you went forth before your people, when you did march through the wilderness; Selah:...">Psalm 68:7-8</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/77-16.htm" title="The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled....">Psalm 77:16-18</a> : and cp. <a href="/psalms/50-2.htm" title="Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shined.">Psalm 50:2</a> ff., <a href="/psalms/97-2.htm" title="Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.">Psalm 97:2</a> ff., Psalms 114; <a href="/isaiah/29-6.htm" title="You shall be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm" title="Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:">Isaiah 30:27</a> ff; <a href="/isaiah/64-1.htm" title="Oh that you would rend the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might flow down at your presence,">Isaiah 64:1</a> ff; <a href="/habakkuk/3-3.htm" title="God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran.

The psalmist must not be understood literally. He does not mean that the deliverance came by earthquake, storm, and thunder, but describes the discomfiture and dismay of his opponents by a series of highly poetical images. In these he, no doubt, follows nature closely, and probably describes what he had seen, heard, and felt. <span class="cmt_word">The foundations also of the hills</span> <span class="cmt_word">moved and were shaken.</span> In violent earthquakes, the earth seems to rock to its foundations; mountain ranges are sometimes actually elevated to a height of several feet; rocks topple down; and occasionally there are earth-slips of enormous dimensions. <span class="cmt_word">Because he was wroth.</span> God's anger against the psalmist's enemies produced the entire disturbance which he is describing. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:2-4) The poet opens with a number of endearing names for God, in which he gratefully comprehends the results of long and varied experience. So far as regards the parallelism of the members, a monostich forms the beginning of this Psalm, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1-11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/25.htm">Psalm 25</a> and many others. Nevertheless the matter assumes a somewhat different aspect, if <a href="/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a> is not, with Maurer, Hengstenberg and Hupfeld, taken as two predicate clauses (Jahve is..., my God is...), but as a simple vocative-a rendering which alone corresponds to the intensity with which this greatest of the Davidic hymns opens-God being invoked by &#1492;, &#1492;, &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;, and each of these names being followed by a predicative expansion of itself, which increases in fulness of tone and emphasis. The &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1498; (with a&#772;, according to Ew. &#1431;251, b), which carries the three series of the names of God, makes up in depth of meaning what is wanting in compass. Elsewhere we find only the Piel &#1512;&#1495;&#1501; of tender sympathising love, but here the Kal is used as an Aramaism. Hence the Jalkut on this passages explains it by &#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497; &#1497;&#1514;&#1498; "I love thee," or ardent, heartfelt love and attachment. The primary signification of softness (root &#1512;&#1495;, Arab. rh&#803;, rch, to be soft, lax, loose), whence &#1512;&#1495;&#1501;, uterus, is transferred in both cases to tenderness of feeling or sentiment. The most general predicate &#1495;&#1494;&#1508;&#1497; (from &#1495;&#1494;&#1511; according to a similar inflexion to &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;, &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;, plur. &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1497; <a href="/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a>) is followed by those which describe Jahve as a protector and deliverer in persecution on the one hand, and on the other as a defender and the giver of victory in battle. They are all typical names symbolising what Jahve is in Himself; hence instead of &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497; it would perhaps have been more correct to point &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497; (and my refuge). God had already called Himself a shield to Abram, <a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; and He is called &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (cf. &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; <a href="/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>) in the great Mosaic song, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37</a> (the latter verse is distinctly echoed here).<p>&#1505;&#1500;&#1506; from &#1505;&#1500;&#1506;, Arab. sl&#8219;, findere, means properly a cleft in a rock (Arabic &#1505;&#1500;&#1506;, <p>(Note: Neshwn defines thus: Arab.

The one figure calls to mind the (well-watered) Edomitish &#1505;&#1500;&#1506; surrounded with precipitous rocks, <a href="/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>, the &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; described by Strabo, xvi. 4, 21; the other calls to mind the Phoenician rocky island &#1510;&#1493;&#1512;, S&#803;u&#770;r (Tyre), the refuge in the sea.))<p>then a cleft rock, and &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, like the Arabic sachr, a great and hard mass of rock (Aramaic &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, a mountain). The figures of the &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; (&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1510;&#1491;) and the &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489; are related; the former signifies properly specula, a watch-tower, <p>(Note: In Arabic mas&#803;a&#770;dun signifies (1) a high hill (a signification that is wanting in Freytag), (2) the summit of a mountain, and according to the original lexicons it belongs to the root Arab. mas&#803;ada, which in outward appearance is supported by the synonymous forms Arab. mas&#803;adun and mas&#803;dun, as also by their plurals Arab. ams&#803;idatun and mus&#803;da&#770;nun, wince these can only be properly formed from those singulars on the assumption of the m being part of the root. Nevertheless, since the meanings of Arab. mas&#803;ada all distinctly point to its being formed from the root Arab. ms&#803; contained in the reduplicated stem Arab. mas&#803;s&#803;a, to suck, but the meanings of Arab. mas&#803;a&#770;dun, mas&#803;sadun, and mas&#803;dun do not admit of their being referred to it, and moreover there are instances in which original nn. loci from vv. med. Arab. w and y admit of the prefixed m being treated as the first radical through forgetfulness or disregard of their derivation, and with the retention of its from secondary roots (as Arab. makana, madana, mas&#803;s&#803;ara), it is highly probable that in mas&#803;a&#770;d, mas&#803;ad and mas&#803;d we have an original &#1502;&#1510;&#1491;, &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;. These Hebrew words, however, are to be referred to a &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; in the signification to look out, therefore properly specula. - Fleischer.)<p>and the latter, a steep height. The horn, which is an ancient figure of victorious and defiant power in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>, is found here applied to Jahve Himself: "horn of my salvation" is that which interposes on the side of my feebleness, conquers, and saves me. All these epithets applied to God are the fruits of the affliction out of which David's song has sprung, viz., his persecution by Saul, when, in a country abounding in rugged rocks and deficient in forest, he betook himself to the rocks for safety, and the mountains served him as his fortresses. In the shelter which the mountains, by their natural conformations, afforded him at that time, and in the fortunate accidents, which sometimes brought him deliverance when in extreme peril, David recognises only marvellous phenomena of which Jahve Himself was to him the final cause. The confession of the God tried and known in many ways is continued in <a href="/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a> by a general expression of his experience. &#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; is a predicate accusative to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;: As one praised (worthy to be praised) do I call upon Jahve, - a rendering that is better suited to the following clause, which expresses confidence in the answer coinciding with the invocation, which is to be thought of as a cry for help, than Olshausen's, "Worthy of praise, do I cry, is Jahve," though this latter certainly is possible so far as the style is concerned (vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>, cf. also <a href="/genesis/3-3.htm">Genesis 3:3</a>; <a href="/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a>). The proof of this fact, viz., that calling upon Him who is worthy to be praised, who, as the history of Israel shows, is able and willing to help, is immediately followed by actual help, as events that are coincident, forms the further matter of the Psalm. </body></html>
