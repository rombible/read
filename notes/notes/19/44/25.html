Hearts sins and secret sins are known to God, and must be reckoned for. He knows the secret of the heart, therefore judges of the words and actions. While our troubles do not drive us from our duty to God, we should not suffer them to drive us from our comfort in God. Let us take care that prosperity and ease do not render us careless and lukewarm. The church of God cannot be prevailed on by persecution to forget God; the believer's heart does not turn back from God. The Spirit of prophecy had reference to those who suffered unto death, for the testimony of Christ. Observe the pleas used, ver. 25,26. Not their own merit and righteousness, but the poor sinner's pleas. None that belong to Christ shall be cast off, but every one of them shall be saved, and that for ever. The mercy of God, purchased, promised, and constantly flowing forth, and offered to believers, does away every doubt arising from our sins; while we pray in faith, Redeem us for thy mercies' sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For our soul is bowed down to the dust - That is, We are overborne with calamity, so that we sink to the earth.

Construed with the accusative, &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; signifies, as in <a href="/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/36-12.htm">Psalm 36:12</a>, to come upon one, and more especially of an evil lot and of powers that are hostile. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;, to lie or deceive, with &#1489;&#1468; of the object on whom the deception or treachery is practised, as in <a href="/psalms/89-34.htm">Psalm 89:34</a>.
