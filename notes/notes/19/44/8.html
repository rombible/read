The many victories Israel obtained, were not by their own strength or merit, but by God's favour and free grace. The less praise this allows us, the more comfort it affords, that we may see all as coming from the favour of God. He fought for Israel, else they had fought in vain. This is applicable to the planting of the Christian church in the world, which was not by any human policy or power. Christ, by his Spirit, went forth conquering and to conquer; and he that planted a church for himself in the world, will support it by the same power and goodness. They trusted and triumphed in and through him. Let him that glories, glory in the Lord. But if they have the comfort of his name, let them give unto him the glory due unto it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In God we boast all the day long - That is, continually or constantly. It is not a momentary or temporary expression of our feelings, but it is our habitual and constant employment. We have no other ground of reliance, and we express that reliance constantly. The word rendered "boast" here rather more literally means praise: "In God we praise all the day long." The idea is, that he was their only ground of confidence.

That which has been heard follows in the oratio directa. <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a> explains what kind of "work" is intended: it is the granting of victory over the peoples of Canaan, the work of God for which Moses prays in <a href="/psalms/90-16.htm">Psalm 90:16</a>. Concerning &#1497;&#1491;&#1498;, vid., on <a href="/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a>. The position of the words here, as in <a href="/psalms/69-11.htm">Psalm 69:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/83-19.htm">Psalm 83:19</a>, leads one to suppose that &#1497;&#1491;&#1498; is treated as a permutative of &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, and consequently in the same case with it. The figure of "planting" (after <a href="/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>) is carried forward in &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;; for this word means to send forth far away, to make wide-branching, a figure which is wrought up in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>. It was not Israel's own work, but (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, no indeed, for [Germ. nein, denn]  equals  imo) God's work: "Thy right hand and Thine arm and the light of Thy countenance," they it was which brought Israel salvation, i.e., victory. The combination of synonyms &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498; &#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1498; is just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-11.htm">Psalm 74:11</a>, Sir. 33:7, &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, and is explained by both the names of the members of the body as applied to God being only figures: the right hand being a figure for energetic interposition, and the arm for an effectual power that carries through the thing designed (cf. e.g., <a href="/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/53-1.htm">Psalm 53:1</a>), just as the light of His countenance is a figure for His loving-kindness which lights up all darkness. The final cause was His purpose of love: for (inasmuch as) Thou wast favourable to them (&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; as in <a href="/psalms/85-2.htm">Psalm 85:2</a>). The very same thought, viz., that Israel owes the possession of Canaan to nothing but Jahve's free grace, runs all through <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9.htm">Deuteronomy 9</a>. </body></html>
