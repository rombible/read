The word neighbors here refers to surrounding people or nations. They were reproached, scorned, and derided as forsaken by God, and given up to their foes. They no longer commanded the admiration of mankind as a prosperous, favored, happy people. Surrounding nations treated them with contempt as inspiring no fear, and as having nothing to entitle them to respect. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/44.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13, 14.

This teaching Israel has gathered from the history of the former times; there is no bidding defiance with the bow and sword and all the carnal weapons of attack, but Thou, etc., <a href="/psalms/44-8.htm">Psalm 44:8</a>. This "Thou" in &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is the emphatic word; the preterites describe facts of experience belonging to history. It is not Israel's own might that gives them the supremacy, but God's gracious might in Israel's weakness. Elohim is, therefore, Israel's glory or pride: "In Elohim do we praise," i.e., we glory or make our boast in Him; cf. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/10-3.htm">Psalm 10:3</a>. The music here joins in after the manner of a hymn. The Psalm here soars aloft to the more joyous height of praise, from which it now falls abruptly into bitter complaint. </body></html>
