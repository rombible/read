The many victories Israel obtained, were not by their own strength or merit, but by God's favour and free grace. The less praise this allows us, the more comfort it affords, that we may see all as coming from the favour of God. He fought for Israel, else they had fought in vain. This is applicable to the planting of the Christian church in the world, which was not by any human policy or power. Christ, by his Spirit, went forth conquering and to conquer; and he that planted a church for himself in the world, will support it by the same power and goodness. They trusted and triumphed in and through him. Let him that glories, glory in the Lord. But if they have the comfort of his name, let them give unto him the glory due unto it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For they got not the land in possession - The land of Canaan. The design of this verse is to illustrate the sentiment in the previous verse, that they owed their establishment in the promised land wholly to God. The fact that He had interposed in their behalf; that He had shown that he was able to discomfit their enemies, is appealed to as a reason why he should now interpose in a time of national danger and calamity. He who had driven out the nations in the days of their fathers; he who had established his people peaceably in the land from which the former inhabitants had been expelled, was able to interpose now and save them. The prominent thought in all this is, that it was God who had accomplished all that had been done. That same God was able to save them again.<p>By their own sword - That is, it was not owing to their valor, but to the divine power: <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-3.htm">Deuteronomy 9:3-6</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-12.htm">Joshua 24:12</a>.<p>Neither did their own arm save them - Not their own strength or prowess.<p>But thy right hand - The right hand is mentioned because it is that which is employed in wielding the sword or the spear in battle.<p>And the light of thy countenance - Thy favor.

The second prayer runs: vindica me a gente impia; &#1502;&#1503; standing for contra in consequence of a constr. praegnans. &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491; is here equivalent to one practising no &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; towards men, that is to say, one totally wanting in that &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, by which God's &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; is to be imitated and repaid by man in his conduct towards his fellow-men. There is some uncertainty whether by &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; one chief enemy, the leader of all the rest, is intended to be mentioned side by side with the unloving nation, or whether the special manner of his enemies is thus merely individualised. &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; means roguish, mischievous conduct, utterly devoid of all sense of right. In <a href="/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a> the poet establishes his petition by a twofold Why. He loves God and longs after Him, but in the mirror of his present condition he seems to himself like one cast off by Him. This contradiction between his own consciousness and the inference which he is obliged to draw from his afflicted state cannot remain unsolved. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;, God of my fortress, is equivalent to who is my fortress. Instead of &#1488;&#1500;&#1498; we here have the form &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, of the slow deliberate gait of one who is lost in his own thoughts and feelings. The sting of his pain is his distance from the sanctuary of his God. In connection with <a href="/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a> one is reminded of <a href="/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>, quite as much as of <a href="/psalms/42-9.htm">Psalm 42:9</a>. "Light and truth" is equivalent to mercy and truth. What is intended is the light of mercy or loving-kindness which is coupled with the truth of fidelity to the promises; the light, in which the will or purpose of love, which is God's most especial nature, becomes outwardly manifest. The poet wishes to be guided by these two angels of God; he desires that he may be brought (according tot he Chethb of the Babylonian text &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;, "let come upon me;" but the &#1488;&#1500; which follows does not suit this form) to the place where his God dwells and reveals Himself. "Tabernacles" is, as in <a href="/psalms/84-2.htm">Psalm 84:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>, an amplificative designation of the tent, magnificent in itself and raised to special honour by Him who dwells therein. </body></html>
