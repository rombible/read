Hearts sins and secret sins are known to God, and must be reckoned for. He knows the secret of the heart, therefore judges of the words and actions. While our troubles do not drive us from our duty to God, we should not suffer them to drive us from our comfort in God. Let us take care that prosperity and ease do not render us careless and lukewarm. The church of God cannot be prevailed on by persecution to forget God; the believer's heart does not turn back from God. The Spirit of prophecy had reference to those who suffered unto death, for the testimony of Christ. Observe the pleas used, ver. 25,26. Not their own merit and righteousness, but the poor sinner's pleas. None that belong to Christ shall be cast off, but every one of them shall be saved, and that for ever. The mercy of God, purchased, promised, and constantly flowing forth, and offered to believers, does away every doubt arising from our sins; while we pray in faith, Redeem us for thy mercies' sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall not God search this out? - That is, If this had been the case, it would be known to God. If, as a nation, we had been given to idolatry, or if our hearts had been secretly alienated from the true God, though there had been no open manifestation of apostasy, yet that could not have been concealed from him. The question here asked implies a solemn declaration on the part of the psalmist that this was not so; or that there was no such national apostasy from God, and no such prevalence of idolatry in the land as to account for what had occurred. The reason for the calamities which had come upon them, therefore, must be found in something else.<p>For he knoweth the secrets of the heart - What is in the heart: what is concealed from the world. If there were any such alienation from him in the hearts of the people, he would know it. The fact that God knows the heart, or that he understands all the secret thoughts, purposes, and motives of people, is one that is everywhere affirmed in the Scriptures.

A distinction is made between the neighbouring nations, or those countries lying immediately round about Israel (&#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, as in the exactly similar passage <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/79-4.htm">Psalm 79:4</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80-7.htm">Psalm 80:7</a>, which closely resembles it), and the nations of the earth that dwell farther away from Israel. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; is here a jesting, taunting proverb, and one that holds Israel up as an example of a nation undergoing chastisement (vid., <a href="/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>). The shaking of the head is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>, a gesture of malicious astonishment. In &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; (as in <a href="/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>) we have both the permanent aspect or look and the perpetual consciousness. Instead of "shame covers my face," the expression is "the shame of my face covers me," i.e., it has overwhelmed my entire inward and outward being (cf. concerning the radical notions of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/6-11.htm">Psalm 6:11</a>, and &#1495;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>).
