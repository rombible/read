Hearts sins and secret sins are known to God, and must be reckoned for. He knows the secret of the heart, therefore judges of the words and actions. While our troubles do not drive us from our duty to God, we should not suffer them to drive us from our comfort in God. Let us take care that prosperity and ease do not render us careless and lukewarm. The church of God cannot be prevailed on by persecution to forget God; the believer's heart does not turn back from God. The Spirit of prophecy had reference to those who suffered unto death, for the testimony of Christ. Observe the pleas used, ver. 25,26. Not their own merit and righteousness, but the poor sinner's pleas. None that belong to Christ shall be cast off, but every one of them shall be saved, and that for ever. The mercy of God, purchased, promised, and constantly flowing forth, and offered to believers, does away every doubt arising from our sins; while we pray in faith, Redeem us for thy mercies' sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If we have forgotten the name of our God - That is, if we have apostatized from him.<p>Or stretched out our hands to a strange god - Or have been guilty of idolatry.

The idea here is, that this was not the cause or reason of their calamities; that if this had occurred, it would have been a sufficient reason for what had taken place; but that no such cause actually existed, and therefore the reason must be found in something else. It was the fact of such calamities having come upon the nation when no such cause existed, that perplexed the author of the psalm, and led to the conclusion in his own mind <a href="/psalms/44-22.htm">Psalm 44:22</a> that these calamities were produced by the malignant designs of the enemies of the true religion, and that, instead of their suffering for their national sins, they were really martyrs in the cause of God, and were suffering for his sake. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/44.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21.

If Israel had either forgotten the true God (see above, ver. 17) or fallen away to the worship of false or strange gods - then her ill success against her foreign enemies would have been fully accounted for, since it would only have been in accordance with the threatenings of the Law (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-23</a>); but as she had done neither of these things, her defeats and depressed condition seemed to the psalmist wholly unaccountable. We trace here the same current belief, which comes out so strongly in the Book of Job - the belief that calamities were, almost of necessity, punishments for sin; and that when they occurred, and there had been no known precedent misconduct, the case was abnormal and extraordinary. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/44.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 44:14-17) To this defeat is now also added the shame that springs out of it. A distinction is made between the neighbouring nations, or those countries lying immediately round about Israel (&#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, as in the exactly similar passage <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/79-4.htm">Psalm 79:4</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80-7.htm">Psalm 80:7</a>, which closely resembles it), and the nations of the earth that dwell farther away from Israel. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; is here a jesting, taunting proverb, and one that holds Israel up as an example of a nation undergoing chastisement (vid., <a href="/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>). The shaking of the head is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>, a gesture of malicious astonishment. In &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; (as in <a href="/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>) we have both the permanent aspect or look and the perpetual consciousness. Instead of "shame covers my face," the expression is "the shame of my face covers me," i.e., it has overwhelmed my entire inward and outward being (cf. concerning the radical notions of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/6-11.htm">Psalm 6:11</a>, and &#1495;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>). The juxtaposition of "enemy and revengeful man" has its origin in <a href="/psalms/8-3.htm">Psalm 8:3</a>. In <a href="/psalms/44-17.htm">Psalm 44:17</a> &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500; and &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; alternate; the former is used of the impression made by the jeering voice, the other of the impression produced by the enraged mien. </body></html>
