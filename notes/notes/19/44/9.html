This is properly the commencement of the second part of the psalm, and the description is continued to <a href="/psalms/44-16.htm">Psalm 44:16</a>. The Hebrew word here rendered "hast cast off" implies disgust and abhorrence, as the casting away of that which is loathsome. See the word explained in the notes at <a href="/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a>. The reference is to what had occurred at the time when the psalm was written. See introduction to this psalm. The allusion is to the invasion of the land by foreigners; their own discomfiture in their wars; and the calamities consequent on these invasions and defeats.<p>And put us to shame - By defeat and disgrace. See the word explained above, <a href="/psalms/44-7.htm">Psalm 44:7</a>. For the defeat and discomfiture supposed to be referred to, see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20-27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-5.htm">2 Chronicles 36:5-6</a>.<p>And goest not forth with our armies - See the places referred to above.

But&#8212;contrasting, cast off as abhorrent (Ps 43:2).<p>goest not forth&#8212;literally, "will not go" (2Sa 5:23). In several consecutive verses the leading verb is future, and the following one past (in Hebrew), thus denoting the causes and effects.

Here the patriot bard begins to contrast the past glories of the nation's history with its present sadness and distress; which he does not ascribe to the death of some human champion, or to the accidents of war, but solely and alone to the withdrawal of Israel's God. It seemed to the mourner that Jehovah had grown weary of his people and put them away in abhorrence, as men lay aside leprous garments, loathing the sight of them. To show his displeasures he had made his people to be ridiculed by the heathen, whose easy victories over their largest armies covered Israel with disgrace. Alas! for a church and people when the Lord in the active energy of his Spirit withdraws from them, they want no greater shame or sorrow. He will not cast away his people finally and totally, but many a church has been left to defeat and disgrace on account of sin, and therefore all churches should be exceedingly watchful lest the like should happen to themselves. Poverty and distress bring no shame on a people, but the Lord's absence takes from a church everything which can exalt and ennoble. "And goest not forth with our armies." If the Lord be not the leader, of what avail are strong battalions? Vain are the combined efforts of the most zealous workers if God's arm be not revealed. May none of us in our churches have to mourn over the ministry, the Sabbath school, the missionary work, the visiting, the street preaching, left to be carried out without the divine aid. If our great ally will not go with us our defeat is inevitable.<p><a href="/psalms/44-10.htm">Psalm 44:10</a><p>"Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy." The humiliating consciousness that the Lord has left them soon makes men cowards. Flight closes the fight of those who have not the Lord in the van. "And they which hate us spoil for themselves." After defeat and retreat, comes spoliation. The poor, vanquished nation paid a terrible penalty for being overcome; plunder and murder desolated the conquered land, and the invaders loaded themselves with every precious thing which they could carry away. In spiritual experience we know what it is to be despoiled by our enemies; doubts and fears rob us of our comforts, and terrible forebodings spoil us of our hopes; and all because the Lord, for wise purposes, sees fit to leave us to ourselves. Alas! for the deserted soul; no calamity can equal the sorrow of being left of God, though it be but for a small moment.<p><a href="/psalms/44-11.htm">Psalm 44:11</a><p>"Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat." As sheep are slaughtered for food, so were the people slain in flocks, with ease, and frequency. Not with the dignity of sacrifice, but with the cruelty of the shambles, were they put to death. God appeared to give them up like sheep allotted to the butcher, to abandon them as the hireling abandons the flock to wolves. The plaint is bitterly eloquent. "And hast scattered us among the heathen." Many were carried into captivity, far off from the public worship of the temple of God, to pine as exiles among idolaters. All this is ascribed to the Lord as being allowed by him, and even appointed by his decree. It is well to trace the hand of God in our sorrows, for it is surely there.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/44.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast cast us off; </span> but now thy countenance and course is quite changed to us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Put us to shame; </span> made us ashamed of our boasting, and trust in thee, which we have oft professed to the face of our enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Goest not forth with our armies, </span> to lead them, and fight for them, as this phrase signifies, <span class="bld"><a href="/judges/4-14.htm" title="And Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand: is not the LORD gone out before you?

This, with what follows to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-17.htm">Psalm 44:17</a>, describe the desolate and afflicted state of the church, under the Gospel dispensation, in some parts and ages of it; and in the light in which it was viewed by the church, previous to the encouragement she took from the consideration of favours and benefits formerly bestowed, and of her covenant interest in God, related in the preceding verses. She looked upon herself as cast off, because afflicted and persecuted, and the Lord did not arise to her immediate help and deliverance; this may regard the ten persecutions under Rome Pagan; See Gill on <a href="/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a>; <p>and put us to shame; before men, at the taking of the ark, as Arama; rather for their faith in God, and boasting of him, when he did not appear for them, but suffered them to continue in their afflictions and distresses; which occasioned their enemies to triumph over them, and say unto them, where is your God? and also before God, who being forsaken by him, could not come before him with that holy boldness and confidence they were wont to do; see Sol 2:14; <p>and goest not forth with our armies; as the Generalissimo of them; see <a href="/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>; not leading them forth, and going before them; not teaching their hands to war and their fingers to fight; nor inspiring them with courage and valour; nor giving success and victory to them as formerly; but seeing that Christians, at least in the first ages of Christianity, had no armies in a literal sense, this may rather be understood of the lack of success of the Gospel in some period of it, and of the power and prevalence of antichrist, the man of sin. The Gospel ministry is a warfare; the preachers of it are good soldiers of Christ under him; their weapons are not carnal, but spiritual; great success attended the word in the first times of the Gospel; Christ went forth with his armies conquering and to conquer; and multitudes were subdued by him, and became subjects of him; but in some ages there has been but little success, few have believed the report of the Gospel, and been converted by it; Christ's ministers have laboured in vain, Satan's kingdom, though attacked, yet not weakened, nor Christ's kingdom enlarged, but rather all the reverse; antichrist has been suffered, as to make war with the saints, so to prevail and overcome, and will do so, <a href="/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4</a>; but it will not be always the case, Christ will go forth with his armies, and make great conquests again, <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>; this may refer to the wars of the Papists with the Waldenses and Albigenses, who were vanquished by the former. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/44.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But thou hast cast off, and put us to <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> shame; and goest not forth with our armies.</span><p>(i) As they confessed before that their strength came from God, so now they acknowledge that this affliction came by his just judgment.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/44.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">But now</span>] The conjunction is peculiar, and implies surprise. And then, after all these proofs of Thy good will, and in spite of our loyalty to Thee, hast thou cast us off and dishonoured us, and goest not forth with our hosts; leading them to victory as in the days of old, as the God of the armies of Israel. Almost the same words recur in <a href="/psalms/60-10.htm" title="Will not you, O God, which had cast us off? and you, O God, which did not go out with our armies?">Psalm 60:10</a>.

God has recently dealt with Israel exceptionally - has seemed to "cast them off," has "put them to shame," allowed them to be defeated and despoiled, slain and carried into captivity, made a scorn and a derision, a reproach and a byword. He no longer "goes forth with their armies," to secure them victory over their foes, but holds aloof, and covers them with confusion. The description implies, not a single defeat, but a somewhat prolonged period of depression, during which several "armies" have been beaten, several battles lost, multitudes slain, and great numbers carried away captive (ver. 11). Still, a general captivity, like the Babylonian, is certainly not spoken cf. The nation is as yet unconquered. It needs but a return of God's favour to turn the vanquished into the victors, and to replace shame by boasting. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">cast off</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a>) <span class="cmt_word">and put us to shame</span> (see also ver. 16).

Israel has still "armies" at her disposal. It is therefore certainly not the early Maccabean period, nor the time of the expiring monarchy. Her armies have free play, are sent forth, only God does not "go forth" with them (comp. <a href="/psalms/60-10.htm">Psalm 60:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/44.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 44:2-4) The poet opens with a tradition coming down from the time of Moses and of Joshua which they have heard with their own ears, in order to demonstrate the vast distance between the character of the former times and the present, just as Asaph, also, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-3.htm">Psalm 78:3</a>, appeals not to the written but to the spoken word. That which has been heard follows in the oratio directa. <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a> explains what kind of "work" is intended: it is the granting of victory over the peoples of Canaan, the work of God for which Moses prays in <a href="/psalms/90-16.htm">Psalm 90:16</a>.
