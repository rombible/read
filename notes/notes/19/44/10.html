In the substantival clause &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is neither logical copula nor predicate (as in <a href="/psalms/102-28.htm">Psalm 102:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>, there equivalent to &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/21-17.htm">1 Chronicles 21:17</a>), but an expressive resumption of the subject, as in <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-12.htm">Jeremiah 49:12</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/5-11.htm">Ezra 5:11</a>, and in the frequently recurring expression &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;; it is therefore to be rendered: Thou-He who (such an one) is my King. May He therefore, by virtue of His duty as king which He has voluntarily taken upon Himself, and of the kingly authority and power indwelling in Him, command the salvation of Jacob, full and entire (<a href="/psalms/18-51.htm">Psalm 18:51</a>; <a href="/psalms/53-7.htm">Psalm 53:7</a>). &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; as in <a href="/psalms/42-9.htm">Psalm 42:9</a>. Jacob is used for Israel just as Elohim is used instead of Jahve. If Elohim, Jacob's King, now turns graciously to His people, they will again be victorious and invincible, as <a href="/psalms/44-6.htm">Psalm 44:6</a> affirms. &#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1495; with reference to &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; as a figure and emblem of strength, as in <a href="/psalms/89-25.htm">Psalm 89:25</a> and frequently; &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; equivalent to &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. But only in the strength of God (&#1489;&#1468;&#1498; as in <a href="/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>); for not in my bow do I trust, etc., <a href="/psalms/44-7.htm">Psalm 44:7</a>. This teaching Israel has gathered from the history of the former times; there is no bidding defiance with the bow and sword and all the carnal weapons of attack, but Thou, etc., <a href="/psalms/44-8.htm">Psalm 44:8</a>. This "Thou" in &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is the emphatic word; the preterites describe facts of experience belonging to history. It is not Israel's own might that gives them the supremacy, but God's gracious might in Israel's weakness. Elohim is, therefore, Israel's glory or pride: "In Elohim do we praise," i.e., we glory or make our boast in Him; cf. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/10-3.htm">Psalm 10:3</a>. The music here joins in after the manner of a hymn. The Psalm here soars aloft to the more joyous height of praise, from which it now falls abruptly into bitter complaint. </body></html>
