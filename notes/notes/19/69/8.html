Hence we learn, when in affliction, to commit the keeping of our souls to God, that we may not be soured with discontent, or sink into despair. David was hated wrongfully, but the words far more fully apply to Christ. In a world where unrighteousness reigns so much, we must not wonder if we meet with those that are our enemies wrongfully. Let us take care that we never do wrong; then if we receive wrong, we may the better bear it. By the satisfaction Christ made to God for our sin by his blood, he restored that which he took not away, he paid our debt, suffered for our offences. Even when we can plead Not guilty, as to men's unjust accusations, yet before God we must acknowledge ourselves to deserve all that is brought upon us. All our sins take rise from our foolishness. They are all done in God's sight. David complains of the unkindness of friends and relations. This was fulfilled in Christ, whose brethren did not believe on him, and who was forsaken by his disciples. Christ made satisfaction for us, not only by putting off the honours due to God, but by submitting to the greatest dishonours that could be done to any man. We need not be discouraged if our zeal for the truths, precepts, and worship of God, should provoke some, and cause others to mock our godly sorrow and deadness to the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am become a stranger unto my brethren - That is, They treat me as they would a stranger; as one in whom they have no interest, and whom they regard with no friendship.

The allusion in the language "unto my mother's children" is intended to denote the most intimate relationship. In families where a man had many wives, as was common among the Hebrews, the nearest relationship would be denoted by being of the same "mother" rather than of the same "father." See the notes at <a href="/psalms/50-20.htm">Psalm 50:20</a>. The same thing occurs also where polygamy is not practiced, in cases where a man has married more wives than one. The idea of the psalmist here, therefore, is, that his nearest relatives treated him as if he were a stranger and a foreigner.

Apart from the words "more than the hairs of my head" (<a href="/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a>), the complaint of the multitude of groundless enemies is just the same as in <a href="/psalms/38-20.htm">Psalm 38:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-3.htm">Psalm 109:3</a>, both in substance and expression.

Moreover the reading of our text finds support, if it need any, in <a href="/lamentations/3-52.htm">Lamentations 3:52</a>. The words, "what I have not taken away, I must then restore," are intended by way of example, and perhaps, as also in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>, as a proverbial expression: that which I have not done wrong, I must suffer for (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>, and the similar complaint in <a href="/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a>). One is tempted to take &#1488;&#1494; in the sense of "nevertheless" (Ewald), a meaning, however, which it is by no means intended to convey. In this passage it takes the place of &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; (cf. &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; for &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, <a href="/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>), inasmuch as it gives prominence to the restitution desired, as an inference from a false assumption: then, although I took it not away, stole it not.<p>The transition from the bewailing of suffering to a confession of sin is like <a href="/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a>.

Should he, the sinner, be abandoned by God to destruction, then all those who are faithful in their intentions towards the Lord would be brought to shame and confusion in him, inasmuch as they would be taunted with this example. &#1511;&#1493;&#1497;&#1498; designates the godly from the side of the &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and &#1502;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498;a from the side of the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;. The multiplied names of God are so many appeals to God's honour, to the truthfulness of His covenant relationship. The person praying here is, it is true, a sinner, but that is no justification of the conduct of men towards him; he is suffering for the Lord's sake, and it is the Lord Himself who is reviled in him.

The garb of mourning, like the fasting, is an expression of sorrow for public distresses, not, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>, of personal condolence; concerning &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, vid., on <a href="/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>. On account of this mourning, reproach after reproach comes upon him, and they fling gibes and raillery at him; everywhere, both in the gate, the place where the judges sit and where business is transacted, and also at carousals, he is jeered at and traduced (<a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>, cf. <a href="/lamentations/5-14.htm">Lamentations 5:14</a>; <a href="/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>). &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; signifies in itself fabulari de... without any bad secondary meaning (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a>, confabulabitur tecum); here it is construed first with a personal and then a neuter subject (cf. <a href="/amos/8-3.htm">Amos 8:3</a>), for in <a href="/psalms/69-13.htm">Psalm 69:13</a> neither &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; (<a href="/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>) nor &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="/lamentations/3-63.htm">Lamentations 3:63</a>) is to be supplied. <a href="/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> tells us how he acts in the face of such hatred and scorn; &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>, sarcasmis hostium suam opponit in precibus constantiam (Geier). As for himself, his prayer is directed towards Jahve at the present time, when his affliction as a witness for God gives him the assurance that He will be well-pleased to accept it (&#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  &#1489;&#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>). It is addressed to Him who is at the same time Jahve and Elohim, - the revealed One in connection with the history of redemption, and the absolute One in His exaltation above the world, - on the ground of the greatness and fulness of His mercy: may He then answer him with or in the truth of His salvation, i.e., the infallibility with which His purpose of mercy verifies itself in accordance with the promises given. Thus is <a href="/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> to be explained in accordance with the accentuation. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>, it looks as though &#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; must be drawn to &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; (Hitzig), but <a href="/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a> sets us right on this point; and the fact that &#1489;&#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1498; is joined to <a href="/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> also finds support from <a href="/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>. But the repetition of the divine name perplexes one, and it may be asked whether or not the accent that divides the verse into its two parts might not more properly stand beside &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, as in <a href="/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a> beside &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;; so that <a href="/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> runs: Elohim, by virtue of the greatness of Thy mercy hear me, by virtue of the truth of Thy salvation. </body></html>
