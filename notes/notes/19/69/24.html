Verses 22,23, are applied to the judgments of God upon the unbelieving Jews, in Ro 11:9,10. When the supports of life and delights of sense, through the corruption of our nature, are made the food and fuel of sin, then our table is a snare. Their sin was, that they would not see, but shut their eyes against the light, loving darkness rather; their punishment was, that they should not see, but should be given up to their own hearts' lusts which hardened them. Those who reject God's great salvation proffered to them, may justly fear that his indignation will be poured out upon them. If men will sin, the Lord will reckon for it. But those that have multiplied to sin, may yet find mercy, through the righteousness of the Mediator. God shuts not out any from that righteousness; the gospel excludes none who do not, by unbelief, shut themselves out. But those who are proud and self-willed, so that they will not come in to God's righteousness, shall have their doom accordingly; they themselves decide it. Let those not expect any benefit thereby, who are not glad to be beholden to it. It is better to be poor and sorrowful, with the blessing of the Lord, than rich and jovial, and under his curse. This may be applied to Christ. He was, when on earth, a man of sorrows that had not where to lay his head; but God exalted him. Let us call upon the Lord, and though poor and sorrowful, guilty and defiled, his salvation will set us up on high.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Pour out thine indignation upon them - That is, Punish them for their sins; or, do justice to them.<p>And let thy wrathful anger - literally, "the burning of thy wrath;" glow of anger; burning wrath.

"Let not the water-flood overflow me" is intended to say, since it has, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>, already happened, let it not go further to my entire destruction.

Moreover &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; in the signification of manifesting pity, not found elsewhere in the Psalter, is common in Jeremiah, e.g., <a href="/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; it signifies originally to nod to any one as a sign of a pity that sympathizes with him and recognises the magnitude of the evil. "To give wormwood for meat and &#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; to drink" is a Jeremianic (<a href="/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>) designation for inflicting the extreme of pain and anguish upon one. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;) signifies first of all a poisonous plant with an umbellated head of flower or a capitate fruit; but then, since bitter and poisonous are interchangeable notions in the Semitic languages, it signifies gall as the bitterest of the bitter.
