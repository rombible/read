Hence we learn, when in affliction, to commit the keeping of our souls to God, that we may not be soured with discontent, or sink into despair. David was hated wrongfully, but the words far more fully apply to Christ. In a world where unrighteousness reigns so much, we must not wonder if we meet with those that are our enemies wrongfully. Let us take care that we never do wrong; then if we receive wrong, we may the better bear it. By the satisfaction Christ made to God for our sin by his blood, he restored that which he took not away, he paid our debt, suffered for our offences. Even when we can plead Not guilty, as to men's unjust accusations, yet before God we must acknowledge ourselves to deserve all that is brought upon us. All our sins take rise from our foolishness. They are all done in God's sight. David complains of the unkindness of friends and relations. This was fulfilled in Christ, whose brethren did not believe on him, and who was forsaken by his disciples. Christ made satisfaction for us, not only by putting off the honours due to God, but by submitting to the greatest dishonours that could be done to any man. We need not be discouraged if our zeal for the truths, precepts, and worship of God, should provoke some, and cause others to mock our godly sorrow and deadness to the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They that hate me without a cause - Without any just reason; without any provocation on my part. There were many such in the case of David, for to those who rose up against him in the time of Saul, and to Absalom also, he had given no real occasion of offence. An expression similar to the one used here occurs in <a href="/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>. See the notes at that passage. The "language" is applied to the Saviour <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>, not as having had original reference to him, but as language which received its most perfect fulfillment in the treatment which he received from his enemies. See the notes at <a href="/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>.<p>Are more than the hairs of mine head - The number is so great that it cannot be estimated.<p>They that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty - literally, "More than the hairs of my head are my haters falsely (those who hate me falsely); strong are those destroying me; my enemies." The idea is, that those who were numbered among his foes without any just provocation on his part were so numerous and strong that he could not contend with them.<p>Then I restored that which I took not away - Prof. Alexander renders this, "What I did not rob, then must I restore." This seems to have a proverbial cast, and the idea is, that under this pressure of circumstances - borne down by numbers - he was compelled to give up what he had not taken away from others. They regarded and treated him as a bad man - as if he had been a robber; and they compelled him to give up what he possessed, "as if" he had no right to it, or "as if" he had obtained it by robbery. This does not seem to refer to anything that was "voluntary" on his part - as if, for the sake of peace, he had proposed to give up that to which they had no claim, or to surrender his just rights, but to the act of compulsion by which he was "forced" to surrender what he had, "as if" he had been a public offender. How far it is proper to yield to an unjust claim for the sake of peace, or to act "as if" we had done wrong, rather than to have controversy or strife, is a point which, if this interpretation is correct, is not settled by this passage. It seems here to have been merely a question of "power." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/69.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. hate me, &c.&#8212;(Compare Joh 15:25).

The great men of the earth, kings and princes, as Herod and Pontius Pilate, and also the infernal principalities and powers, who were concerned in contriving those lies, and putting them into the minds of men; for Satan is the father of lies and falsehood; <p>then I restored that which I took not away; by rapine, force, and violence, as the word (w) signifies; and which was done by others. Thus, for instance, Christ restored the glory of God, of which he was robbed, and which was taken away by the sin of man; by veiling his own glory, not seeking that, but his Father's; and by working out the salvation of his people, in such a manner as that all the divine perfections were glorified by it; hence, "glory to God in the highest", <a href="/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a>. He satisfied justice he had never injured, though others had; he fulfilled a law, and bore the penalty of it, which he never broke; and made satisfaction for sins he never committed; and brought in a righteousness he had not taken away; and provided a better inheritance than what was lost by Adam: and all this was done at the time of his sufferings and death, and by the means of them. <p>(w) "rapui", V.

The heavens of heavens (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>) are by &#1511;&#1491;&#1501; described as primeval (perhaps, following the order of their coming into existence, as extending back beyond the heavens that belong to our globe, of the second and fourth day of Creation). God is said to ride along in the primeval heavens of the heavens (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>), when by means of the cherub (<a href="/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>) He extends His operations to all parts of these infinite distances and heights. The epithet "who rideth along in the heavens of heavens of the first beginning" denotes the exalted majesty of the superterrestrial One, who on account of His immanency in history is called "He who rideth along through the steppes" (&#1512;&#1499;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>). In &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493; we have a repetition of the thought expressed above in <a href="/psalms/68-12.htm">Psalm 68:12</a> by &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;; what is intended is God's voice of power, which thunders down everything that contends against Him. Since in the expression &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500; (<a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/12-8.htm">Jeremiah 12:8</a>) the voice, according to Ges. 138, rem. 3, note, is conceived of as the medium of the giving, i.e., of the giving forth from one's self, of the making one's self heard, we must take &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1506;&#1494; not as the object (as in the Latin phrase sonitum dare), but as an apposition: <p>(Note: The accentuation does not decide; it admits of our taking it in both ways. Cf. <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/41-2.htm">Psalm 41:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/58-7.htm">Psalm 58:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-28.htm">Psalm 68:28</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-1.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a>.)<p>behold, He maketh Himself heard with His voice, a powerful voice. Thus let them then give God &#1506;&#1494;, i.e., render back to Him in praise that acknowledges His omnipotence, the omnipotence which He hath, and of which He gives abundant proof. His glory (&#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;) rules over Israel, more particularly as its guard and defence; His power (&#1506;&#1494;), however, embraces all created things, not the earth merely, but also the loftiest regions of the sky. The kingdom of grace reveals the majesty and glory of His redemptive work (cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>), the kingdom of nature the universal dominion of His omnipotence. To this call to the kingdoms of the earth they respond in v. 36: "Awful is Elohim out of thy sanctuaries." The words are addressed to Israel, consequently &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is not the heavenly and earthly sanctuary (Hitzig), but the one sanctuary in Jerusalem (<a href="/ezekiel/21-72.htm">Ezekiel 21:72</a>) in the manifold character of its holy places (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-51.htm">Jeremiah 51:51</a>, cf. <a href="/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a>). Commanding reverence - such is the confession of the Gentile world - doth Elohim rule from thy most holy places, O Israel, the God who hath chosen thee as His mediatorial people. The second part of the confession runs: the God of Israel giveth power and abundant strength to the people, viz., whose God He is, equivalent to &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, <a href="/psalms/29-11.htm">Psalm 29:11</a>. Israel's might in the omnipotence of God it is which the Gentile world has experienced, and from which it has deduced the universal fact of experience, v. 36b. All peoples with their gods succumb at last to Israel and its God. This confession of the Gentile world closes with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (which is preceded by Mugrash transformed out of Athnach). That which the psalmist said in the name of Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-20.htm">Psalm 68:20</a>, "Blessed be the Lord," now re-echoes from all the world, "Blessed be Elohim." The world is overcome by the church of Jahve, and that not merely in outward form, but spiritually. The taking up of all the kingdoms of the world into the kingdom of God, this the great theme of the Apocalypse, is also after all the theme of this Psalm. The first half closed with Jahve's triumphant ascension, the second closes with the results of His victory and triumph, which embrace the world of peoples. </body></html>
