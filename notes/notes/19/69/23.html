Verses 22,23, are applied to the judgments of God upon the unbelieving Jews, in Ro 11:9,10. When the supports of life and delights of sense, through the corruption of our nature, are made the food and fuel of sin, then our table is a snare. Their sin was, that they would not see, but shut their eyes against the light, loving darkness rather; their punishment was, that they should not see, but should be given up to their own hearts' lusts which hardened them. Those who reject God's great salvation proffered to them, may justly fear that his indignation will be poured out upon them. If men will sin, the Lord will reckon for it. But those that have multiplied to sin, may yet find mercy, through the righteousness of the Mediator. God shuts not out any from that righteousness; the gospel excludes none who do not, by unbelief, shut themselves out. But those who are proud and self-willed, so that they will not come in to God's righteousness, shall have their doom accordingly; they themselves decide it. Let those not expect any benefit thereby, who are not glad to be beholden to it. It is better to be poor and sorrowful, with the blessing of the Lord, than rich and jovial, and under his curse. This may be applied to Christ. He was, when on earth, a man of sorrows that had not where to lay his head; but God exalted him. Let us call upon the Lord, and though poor and sorrowful, guilty and defiled, his salvation will set us up on high.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let their eyes be darkened ... - See the notes at <a href="/romans/11-10.htm">Romans 11:10</a>.<p>And make their loins continually to shake - As under a heavy burden.

The figure of sinking in the mire or mud and in the depths of the pit (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-24.htm">Psalm 55:24</a>, cf. &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="/psalms/40-3.htm">Psalm 40:3</a>) is again taken up, and so studiously wrought out, that the impression forces itself upon one that the poet is here describing something that has really taken place. The combination "from those who hate me and from the depths of the waters" shows that "the depths of the waters" is not a merely rhetorical figure; and the form of the prayer: let not the pit (the well-pit or covered tank) close (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512; with Dagesh in the Teth, in order to guard against its being read &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1496;&#1512;; cf. on the signification of &#1488;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;, clausus  equals  claudus, scil. manu) its mouth (i.e., its upper opening) upon me, exceeds the limits of anything that can be allowed to mere rhetoric. "Let not the water-flood overflow me" is intended to say, since it has, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>, already happened, let it not go further to my entire destruction. The "answer me" in <a href="/psalms/69-17.htm">Psalm 69:17</a> is based upon the plea that God's loving-kindness is &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, i.e., good, absolutely good (as in the kindred passion-Psalm, <a href="/psalms/109-21.htm">Psalm 109:21</a>), better than all besides (<a href="/psalms/63-4.htm">Psalm 63:4</a>), the means of healing or salvation from all evil.

In <a href="/psalms/69-18.htm">Psalm 69:18</a> the prayer is based upon the painful situation of the poet, which urgently calls for speedy help (&#1502;&#1492;&#1512; beside the imperative, <a href="/psalms/102-3.htm">Psalm 102:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/143-7.htm">Psalm 143:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/6-10.htm">Esther 6:10</a>, is certainly itself not an imperative like &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>, but an adverbial infinitive as in <a href="/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a>). &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, or, in order to ensure the pronunciation k&#803;orbah in distinction from k&#803;a&#772;rbah, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>, &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; (in Baer,<p>(Note: Originally - was the sign for every kind of o6, hence the Masora includes the &#1495;&#1496;&#1493;&#1507; also under the name &#1511;&#1502;&#1509; &#1495;&#1496;&#1507;; vid., Luther.

Moreover &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; in the signification of manifesting pity, not found elsewhere in the Psalter, is common in Jeremiah, e.g., <a href="/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; it signifies originally to nod to any one as a sign of a pity that sympathizes with him and recognises the magnitude of the evil. "To give wormwood for meat and &#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; to drink" is a Jeremianic (<a href="/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>) designation for inflicting the extreme of pain and anguish upon one. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;) signifies first of all a poisonous plant with an umbellated head of flower or a capitate fruit; but then, since bitter and poisonous are interchangeable notions in the Semitic languages, it signifies gall as the bitterest of the bitter.
