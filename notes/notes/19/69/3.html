Hence we learn, when in affliction, to commit the keeping of our souls to God, that we may not be soured with discontent, or sink into despair. David was hated wrongfully, but the words far more fully apply to Christ. In a world where unrighteousness reigns so much, we must not wonder if we meet with those that are our enemies wrongfully. Let us take care that we never do wrong; then if we receive wrong, we may the better bear it. By the satisfaction Christ made to God for our sin by his blood, he restored that which he took not away, he paid our debt, suffered for our offences. Even when we can plead Not guilty, as to men's unjust accusations, yet before God we must acknowledge ourselves to deserve all that is brought upon us. All our sins take rise from our foolishness. They are all done in God's sight. David complains of the unkindness of friends and relations. This was fulfilled in Christ, whose brethren did not believe on him, and who was forsaken by his disciples. Christ made satisfaction for us, not only by putting off the honours due to God, but by submitting to the greatest dishonours that could be done to any man. We need not be discouraged if our zeal for the truths, precepts, and worship of God, should provoke some, and cause others to mock our godly sorrow and deadness to the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am weary of my crying - The word "crying" here does not mean weeping, or shedding tears, but calling upon God for help. He had grown weary; his strength had been exhausted in the act of calling upon God to assist him. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>. This was an instance where one had called so long on God, and prayed so much and so earnestly, that his strength was gone. Compare <a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>.<p>My throat is dried - Or, "is parched up." The Hebrew word denotes to burn; to be enkindled; and then, to be inflamed. Here it means that by the excessive exertion of his voice, his throat had become parched, so that he could not speak.<p>Mine eyes fail - That is, become dim from exhaustion. I have looked so long in that one direction that the power of vision begins to fail, and I see nothing clearly. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>. Compare <a href="/job/17-7.htm">Job 17:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-9.htm">Psalm 31:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/38-10.htm">Psalm 38:10</a>.<p>While I wait for my God - That is, by continued "looking" to God. The word "wait" is not used here, nor is it generally in the Bible, as it is now with us, in the sense of looking for "future" interposition, or of doing nothing ourselves in expectation of what "may" occur; but it is used in the sense of looking to God alone; of exercising dependence on him; of seeking his aid. This is indeed connnected with the ordinary idea of abiding his will, but it is also an "active" state of mind - a state expressive of intense interest and desire.

In his distress; when, bearing the punishment both of loss and sense, he cried unto God; he prayed earnestly, with great intenseness and fervency of spirit; he offered supplications, with strong cryings and tears, insomuch that he calls it a roaring: and whereas there was a seeming delay of answer to his cries, he cried till he was weary of crying; and yet it is remarkable that his last cry was with a loud voice, which surprised the centurion; see <a href="/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>; <p>my throat is dried; with crying, so that he was hoarse; or "burnt" (u); with inward heat of a fever, which usually attended persons crucified; see <a href="/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a>; <p>mine eyes fail while I wait for my God; God the Father was the God of Christ, as he was man; he prepared a body for him, and anointed his human nature with the Holy Spirit; he supported and upheld him: and as such Christ loved him, believed in him, prayed to him, and waited and looked for help and salvation from him; this being delayed, his eyes failed with intense looking about for it, as well as with grief and tears. Ainsworth observes, that failing of the eyes is one of the curses of the law, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>, and it shows how in every thing Christ was made a curse for his people. <p>(u) "adustum", Montanus, Gejerus, Michaelis; so Ainsworth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/69.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> eyes fail while I wait for my God.</span><p>(d) Though his senses failed him, yet his faith was constant and encouraged him still to pray.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/69.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>.

The heavens of heavens (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>) are by &#1511;&#1491;&#1501; described as primeval (perhaps, following the order of their coming into existence, as extending back beyond the heavens that belong to our globe, of the second and fourth day of Creation). God is said to ride along in the primeval heavens of the heavens (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>), when by means of the cherub (<a href="/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>) He extends His operations to all parts of these infinite distances and heights. The epithet "who rideth along in the heavens of heavens of the first beginning" denotes the exalted majesty of the superterrestrial One, who on account of His immanency in history is called "He who rideth along through the steppes" (&#1512;&#1499;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>). In &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493; we have a repetition of the thought expressed above in <a href="/psalms/68-12.htm">Psalm 68:12</a> by &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;; what is intended is God's voice of power, which thunders down everything that contends against Him. Since in the expression &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500; (<a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/12-8.htm">Jeremiah 12:8</a>) the voice, according to Ges. 138, rem. 3, note, is conceived of as the medium of the giving, i.e., of the giving forth from one's self, of the making one's self heard, we must take &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1506;&#1494; not as the object (as in the Latin phrase sonitum dare), but as an apposition: <p>(Note: The accentuation does not decide; it admits of our taking it in both ways. Cf. <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/41-2.htm">Psalm 41:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/58-7.htm">Psalm 58:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-28.htm">Psalm 68:28</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-1.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a>.)<p>behold, He maketh Himself heard with His voice, a powerful voice. Thus let them then give God &#1506;&#1494;, i.e., render back to Him in praise that acknowledges His omnipotence, the omnipotence which He hath, and of which He gives abundant proof. His glory (&#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;) rules over Israel, more particularly as its guard and defence; His power (&#1506;&#1494;), however, embraces all created things, not the earth merely, but also the loftiest regions of the sky. The kingdom of grace reveals the majesty and glory of His redemptive work (cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>), the kingdom of nature the universal dominion of His omnipotence. To this call to the kingdoms of the earth they respond in v. 36: "Awful is Elohim out of thy sanctuaries." The words are addressed to Israel, consequently &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is not the heavenly and earthly sanctuary (Hitzig), but the one sanctuary in Jerusalem (<a href="/ezekiel/21-72.htm">Ezekiel 21:72</a>) in the manifold character of its holy places (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-51.htm">Jeremiah 51:51</a>, cf. <a href="/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a>). Commanding reverence - such is the confession of the Gentile world - doth Elohim rule from thy most holy places, O Israel, the God who hath chosen thee as His mediatorial people. The second part of the confession runs: the God of Israel giveth power and abundant strength to the people, viz., whose God He is, equivalent to &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, <a href="/psalms/29-11.htm">Psalm 29:11</a>. Israel's might in the omnipotence of God it is which the Gentile world has experienced, and from which it has deduced the universal fact of experience, v. 36b. All peoples with their gods succumb at last to Israel and its God. This confession of the Gentile world closes with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (which is preceded by Mugrash transformed out of Athnach). That which the psalmist said in the name of Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-20.htm">Psalm 68:20</a>, "Blessed be the Lord," now re-echoes from all the world, "Blessed be Elohim." The world is overcome by the church of Jahve, and that not merely in outward form, but spiritually. The taking up of all the kingdoms of the world into the kingdom of God, this the great theme of the Apocalypse, is also after all the theme of this Psalm. The first half closed with Jahve's triumphant ascension, the second closes with the results of His victory and triumph, which embrace the world of peoples. </body></html>
