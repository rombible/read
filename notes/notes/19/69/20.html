The tokens of God's favour to us are enough to keep our spirits from sinking in the deepest outward troubles. If we think well of God, and continue to do so under the greatest hardships, we need not fear but he will do well for us. And if at any time we are called on to suffer reproach and shame, for Christ's sake, this may be our comfort, that he knows it. It bears hard on one that knows the worth of a good name, to be oppressed with a bad one; but when we consider what a favour it is to be accounted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Jesus, we shall see that there is no reason why it should be heart-breaking to us. The sufferings of Christ were here particularly foretold, which proves the Scripture to be the word of God; and how exactly these predictions were fulfilled in Jesus Christ, which proves him to be the true Messiah. The vinegar and the gall given to him, were a faint emblem of that bitter cup which he drank up, that we might drink the cup of salvation. We cannot expect too little from men, miserable comforters are they all; nor can we expect too much from the God of all comfort and consolation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Reproach hath broken my heart - The reproaches, the calumnies, the aspersions, the slanders of others, have crushed me.

Undeserved reproaches will be as likely to produce this result on a sensitive heart as any form of suffering; and there are thousands who are crushed to the earth by such reproaches.<p>And I am full of heaviness - Or, I am sick; I am weak; I am ill at ease.

"To give wormwood for meat and &#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; to drink" is a Jeremianic (<a href="/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>) designation for inflicting the extreme of pain and anguish upon one. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;) signifies first of all a poisonous plant with an umbellated head of flower or a capitate fruit; but then, since bitter and poisonous are interchangeable notions in the Semitic languages, it signifies gall as the bitterest of the bitter.
