The tokens of God's favour to us are enough to keep our spirits from sinking in the deepest outward troubles. If we think well of God, and continue to do so under the greatest hardships, we need not fear but he will do well for us. And if at any time we are called on to suffer reproach and shame, for Christ's sake, this may be our comfort, that he knows it. It bears hard on one that knows the worth of a good name, to be oppressed with a bad one; but when we consider what a favour it is to be accounted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Jesus, we shall see that there is no reason why it should be heart-breaking to us. The sufferings of Christ were here particularly foretold, which proves the Scripture to be the word of God; and how exactly these predictions were fulfilled in Jesus Christ, which proves him to be the true Messiah. The vinegar and the gall given to him, were a faint emblem of that bitter cup which he drank up, that we might drink the cup of salvation. We cannot expect too little from men, miserable comforters are they all; nor can we expect too much from the God of all comfort and consolation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Draw nigh unto my soul - To me - for my life is in danger.<p>And redeem it - Ransom it; save it from ruin.

The waters are said to rush in unto the soul (&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;), when they so press upon the imperilled one that the soul, i.e., the life of the body, more especially the breath, is threatened; cf. <a href="/jonah/2-6.htm">Jonah 2:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>. Waters are also a figure of calamities that come on like a flood and drag one into their vortex, <a href="/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/124-5.htm">Psalm 124:5</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/66-12.htm">Psalm 66:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/88-8.htm">Psalm 88:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/88-18.htm">Psalm 88:18</a>; here, however, the figure is cut off in such a way that it conveys the impression of reality expressed in a poetical form, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40.htm">Psalm 40</a>, and much the same as in Jonah's psalm. The soft, yielding morass is called &#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, and the eddying deep &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;. The Nomen Hophal. &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; signifies properly a being placed, then a standing-place, or firm standing (lxx &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), like &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, that which is stretched out, extension, <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; (Ephraimitish &#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;) is a streaming, a flood, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;, Arab. sbl, to stream, flow (cf. note on <a href="/psalms/58-9.htm">Psalm 58:9</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;, to fall into, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-12.htm">Psalm 66:12</a>, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1507; with an accusative, to overflow, as in <a href="/psalms/124-4.htm">Psalm 124:4</a>. The complaining one is nearly drowned in consequence of his sinking down, for he has long cried in vain for help: he is wearied by continual crying (&#1497;&#1490;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/45-3.htm">Jeremiah 45:3</a>), his throat is parched (&#1504;&#1495;&#1512; from &#1495;&#1512;&#1512;; lxx and Jerome: it is become hoarse), his eyes have failed (<a href="/jeremiah/14-6.htm">Jeremiah 14:6</a>) him, who waits upon his God. The participle &#1502;&#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, equal to a relative clause, is, as in 18:51, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14-6.htm">1 Kings 14:6</a>, attached to the suffix of the preceding noun (Hitzig). Distinct from this use of the participle without the article is the adverbially qualifying participle in <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>; Sol 5:2, cf. &#1495;&#1497;,   <a href="/2_samuel/12-21.htm">2 Samuel 12:21</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>.

Concerning the accentuation of &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; vid., on <a href="/psalms/38-20.htm">Psalm 38:20</a>. Apart from the words "more than the hairs of my head" (<a href="/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a>), the complaint of the multitude of groundless enemies is just the same as in <a href="/psalms/38-20.htm">Psalm 38:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-3.htm">Psalm 109:3</a>, both in substance and expression. Instead of &#1502;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, my destroyers, the Syriac version has the reading &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; (more numerous than my bones), which is approved by Hupfeld; but to reckon the multitude of the enemy by the number of one's own bones is both devoid of taste and unheard of. Moreover the reading of our text finds support, if it need any, in <a href="/lamentations/3-52.htm">Lamentations 3:52</a>. The words, "what I have not taken away, I must then restore," are intended by way of example, and perhaps, as also in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>, as a proverbial expression: that which I have not done wrong, I must suffer for (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>, and the similar complaint in <a href="/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a>). One is tempted to take &#1488;&#1494; in the sense of "nevertheless" (Ewald), a meaning, however, which it is by no means intended to convey. In this passage it takes the place of &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; (cf. &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; for &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, <a href="/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>), inasmuch as it gives prominence to the restitution desired, as an inference from a false assumption: then, although I took it not away, stole it not.<p>The transition from the bewailing of suffering to a confession of sin is like <a href="/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a>. In the undeserved persecution which he endures at the hand of man, he is obliged nevertheless to recognise well-merited chastisement from the side of God. And whilst by &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-16.htm">Jeremiah 17:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-23.htm">Jeremiah 18:23</a>, and on &#1500; as an exponent of the object, <a href="/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Jeremiah 16:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/40-2.htm">Jeremiah 40:2</a>) he does not acknowledge himself to be a sinner after the standard of his own shortsightedness, but of the divine omniscience, he at the same time commends his sinful need, which with self-accusing modesty he calls &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; (<a href="/psalms/38-6.htm">Psalm 38:6</a>) and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;    (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-10.htm">2 Chronicles 28:10</a>), to the mercy of the omniscient One. Should he, the sinner, be abandoned by God to destruction, then all those who are faithful in their intentions towards the Lord would be brought to shame and confusion in him, inasmuch as they would be taunted with this example. &#1511;&#1493;&#1497;&#1498; designates the godly from the side of the &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and &#1502;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498;a from the side of the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;. The multiplied names of God are so many appeals to God's honour, to the truthfulness of His covenant relationship. The person praying here is, it is true, a sinner, but that is no justification of the conduct of men towards him; he is suffering for the Lord's sake, and it is the Lord Himself who is reviled in him. It is upon this he bases his prayer in <a href="/psalms/69-8.htm">Psalm 69:8</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, for thy sake, as in <a href="/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>.

On account of this mourning, reproach after reproach comes upon him, and they fling gibes and raillery at him; everywhere, both in the gate, the place where the judges sit and where business is transacted, and also at carousals, he is jeered at and traduced (<a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>, cf. <a href="/lamentations/5-14.htm">Lamentations 5:14</a>; <a href="/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>). &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; signifies in itself fabulari de... without any bad secondary meaning (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a>, confabulabitur tecum); here it is construed first with a personal and then a neuter subject (cf. <a href="/amos/8-3.htm">Amos 8:3</a>), for in <a href="/psalms/69-13.htm">Psalm 69:13</a> neither &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; (<a href="/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>) nor &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="/lamentations/3-63.htm">Lamentations 3:63</a>) is to be supplied. <a href="/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> tells us how he acts in the face of such hatred and scorn; &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>, sarcasmis hostium suam opponit in precibus constantiam (Geier). As for himself, his prayer is directed towards Jahve at the present time, when his affliction as a witness for God gives him the assurance that He will be well-pleased to accept it (&#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  &#1489;&#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>). It is addressed to Him who is at the same time Jahve and Elohim, - the revealed One in connection with the history of redemption, and the absolute One in His exaltation above the world, - on the ground of the greatness and fulness of His mercy: may He then answer him with or in the truth of His salvation, i.e., the infallibility with which His purpose of mercy verifies itself in accordance with the promises given. Thus is <a href="/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> to be explained in accordance with the accentuation. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>, it looks as though &#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; must be drawn to &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; (Hitzig), but <a href="/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a> sets us right on this point; and the fact that &#1489;&#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1498; is joined to <a href="/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> also finds support from <a href="/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>. But the repetition of the divine name perplexes one, and it may be asked whether or not the accent that divides the verse into its two parts might not more properly stand beside &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, as in <a href="/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a> beside &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;; so that <a href="/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> runs: Elohim, by virtue of the greatness of Thy mercy hear me, by virtue of the truth of Thy salvation. </body></html>
