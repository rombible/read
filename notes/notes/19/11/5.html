The psalmist, before he gives an account of his temptation to distrust God, records his resolution to trust in Him, as that by which he was resolved to live and die. The believer, though not terrified by his enemies, may be tempted, by the fears of his friends, to desert his post, or neglect his work. They perceive his danger, but not his security; they give him counsel that savours of worldly policy, rather than of heavenly wisdom. The principles of religion are the foundations on which the faith and hope of the righteous are built. We are concerned to hold these fast against all temptations to unbelief; for believers would be undone, if they had not God to go to, God to trust in, and future bliss to hope for. The prosperity of wicked people in their wicked, evil ways, and the straits and distresses which the best men are sometimes brought into, tried David's faith. We need not say, Who shall go up to heaven, to fetch us thence a God to trust in? The word is nigh us, and God in the word; his Spirit is in his saints, those living temples, and the Lord is that Spirit. This God governs the world. We may know what men seem to be, but God knows what they are, as the refiner knows the value of gold when he has tried it. God is said to try with his eyes, because he cannot err, or be imposed upon. If he afflicts good people, it is for their trial, therefore for their good. However persecutors and oppressors may prosper awhile, they will for ever perish. God is a holy God, and therefore hates them. He is a righteous Judge, and will therefore punish them. In what a horrible tempest are the wicked hurried away at death! Every man has the portion of his cup assigned him. Impenitent sinner, mark your doom! The last call to repentance is about to be addressed to you, judgement is at hand; through the gloomy shade of death you pass into the region of eternal wrath. Hasten then, O sinner, to the cross of Christ. How stands the case between God and our souls? Is Christ our hope, our consolation, our security? Then, not otherwise, will the soul be carried through all its difficulties and conflicts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord trieth the righteous - That is, he "proves" them, searches them, tests the reality of their piety. His dealings with them are such as to test the genuineness of their religion, and are designed to show their sincerity and the real power of their religious principles. It is not for the purpose of destroying them, or punishing them, that he deals with them as he does, but it is to show the reality of their attachment to him. This language seems here to be used to show the feeling of the persecuted and afflicted author of the psalm. He understood the reason why these calamities were suffered to come upon him - to wit, as a trial of his faith; and therefore it was his duty to remain and bear these troubles, and not to attempt to escape from them by flight. He says, therefore, that these troubles in the case of the righteous were in strong contrast with the purpose of the divine dealings toward the wicked, on whom God would "rain" snares, fire, and brimstone. In their case his judgments were for the purpose of punishing and destroying; in the case of the righteous it was to "try" them, or to test the reality of their religion.<p>But the wicked - The wicked in general. All the wicked.<p>And him that loveth violence - Referring particularly here to those who were engaged in persecuting him who was the author of this psalm. They were contemplating acts of violence toward him <a href="/psalms/11-2.htm">Psalm 11:2</a>; he says that all such persons were the objects of the divine displeasure, and would be appropriately punished.<p>His soul hateth - that is, "he" hates. God is often spoken of in language appropriate to man; and he is here referred to as having a soul - as he is elsewhere as having eyes, hands, or feet. The meaning is, that all such persons were the objects of the divine abhorrence, and that the divine dealings with them were not, as with the righteous, to "try" them, but to "punish" and "destroy" them. Knowing this, the persecuted author of the psalm, instead of fleeing, calmly committed himself and his cause to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

The ardent longing of the meek and lowly sufferers for the arising, the parusia of Jahve (<a href="/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>), has now been heard by Him, and that under circumstances which find expression in the following futt., which have a past signification: God has given and preserved to their hearts the right disposition towards Himself (&#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, as in <a href="/psalms/78-8.htm">Psalm 78:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/11-13.htm">Job 11:13</a>, Sir. 2:17 &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, post-biblical &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;<p>(Note: B.

It was a mutual relation, the design of which was finally and speedily to obtain justice for the fatherless and oppressed, yea crushed, few, in order that mortal man of the earth may no longer (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-21.htm">Isaiah 14:21</a>, and in post-biblical Hebrew &#1489;&#1468;&#1500; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1500; instead of &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;) terrify. From the parallel conclusion, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/9-20.htm">Psalm 9:20-21</a>, it is to be inferred that &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; does not refer to the oppressed but to the oppressor, and is therefore intended as the subject; and then the phrase &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; also belongs to it, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a>, people of the world, <a href="/psalms/80-14.htm">Psalm 80:14</a> boar of the woods, whereas in <a href="/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a> &#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; belongs to the verb (to devour from off the earth). It is only in this combination that &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; forms with &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1509; a significant paronomasia, by contrasting the conduct of the tyrant with his true nature: a mortal of the earth, i.e., a being who, far removed from any possibility of vying with the God who is in heaven, has the earth as his birth-place. It is not &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;, for the earth is not referred to as the material out of which man is formed, but as his ancestral house, his home, his bound, just as in the expression of John &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c9;&#787;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, <a href="/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31</a> (Lat. ut non amplius terreat homo terrenus). A similar play of words was attempted before in <a href="/psalms/9-20.htm">Psalm 9:20</a> &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1506;&#1494;. The Hebrew verb &#1506;&#1512;&#1509; signifies both to give way to fear, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-21.htm">Deuteronomy 7:21</a>, and to put in fear, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, <a href="/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-12.htm">Isaiah 47:12</a>. It does mean "to defy, rebel against," although it might have this meaning according to the Arabic &#8219;rd&#803; (to come in the way, withstand, according to which Wetzstein explains &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-6.htm">Job 30:6</a>, like Arab. &#8219;ird&#803;, "a valley that runs slantwise across a district, a gorge that blocks up the traveller's way"<p>(Note: Zeitschrift fr Allgem.
