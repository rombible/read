The psalmist, before he gives an account of his temptation to distrust God, records his resolution to trust in Him, as that by which he was resolved to live and die. The believer, though not terrified by his enemies, may be tempted, by the fears of his friends, to desert his post, or neglect his work. They perceive his danger, but not his security; they give him counsel that savours of worldly policy, rather than of heavenly wisdom. The principles of religion are the foundations on which the faith and hope of the righteous are built. We are concerned to hold these fast against all temptations to unbelief; for believers would be undone, if they had not God to go to, God to trust in, and future bliss to hope for. The prosperity of wicked people in their wicked, evil ways, and the straits and distresses which the best men are sometimes brought into, tried David's faith. We need not say, Who shall go up to heaven, to fetch us thence a God to trust in? The word is nigh us, and God in the word; his Spirit is in his saints, those living temples, and the Lord is that Spirit. This God governs the world. We may know what men seem to be, but God knows what they are, as the refiner knows the value of gold when he has tried it. God is said to try with his eyes, because he cannot err, or be imposed upon. If he afflicts good people, it is for their trial, therefore for their good. However persecutors and oppressors may prosper awhile, they will for ever perish. God is a holy God, and therefore hates them. He is a righteous Judge, and will therefore punish them. In what a horrible tempest are the wicked hurried away at death! Every man has the portion of his cup assigned him. Impenitent sinner, mark your doom! The last call to repentance is about to be addressed to you, judgement is at hand; through the gloomy shade of death you pass into the region of eternal wrath. Hasten then, O sinner, to the cross of Christ. How stands the case between God and our souls? Is Christ our hope, our consolation, our security? Then, not otherwise, will the soul be carried through all its difficulties and conflicts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness - This would be more correctly rendered, "For Jehovah is righteous; he loves righteousness." The idea is, that God is himself righteous, and, consequently, he loves those who are righteous. He may be confided in, therefore, by the righteous as their friend, and being under his protection they have nothing to fear.<p>His countenance doth behold the upright - The word rendered "countenance" is, in the Hebrew, in the plural number; literally," his faces." It is not easy to account for this use of the plural, though it is common in the Scriptures. There may be an allusion to the fact that man seems to have two faces - one on the right side, and one on the left, two eyes, two cheeks, two nostrils, etc., as if made up of two persons. Applied to God, it has no other signification than it has when applied to man; nor should we seek to find anything mystical in the fact that the plural form is used. The term here, like the eyelids in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>, is equivalent to eyes, since the most remarkable feature of the countenance is the eyes; and the idea is, that God looks upon the upright; that is, he sees their dangers amid their wants; he looks upon them with favor and affection. Being thus constantly under his eye, and being objects of his favorable regard, they can have nothing to fear; or, in other words, they are safe. This, then, is the argument of the righteous man, in reply to the suggestion <a href="/psalms/11-1.htm">Psalm 11:1</a> that he should "flee" from danger. The argument is, that God would be his defender, and that he might safely rely on His protection. The wicked have everything to fear; the righteous, nothing. The one is never safe; the other, always. The one will be delivered out of all his troubles; the end of the other can be only ruin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. his countenance&#8212;literally, "their faces," a use of the plural applied to God, as in Ge 1:26; 3:22; 11:7; Isa 6:8, &c., denoting the fulness of His perfections, or more probably originating in a reference to the trinity of persons. "Faces" is used as "eyes" (Ps 11:4), expressing here God's complacency towards the upright (compare Ps 34:15, 16).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is given as the reason why God hateth and punisheth wicked men so dreadfully, because he loves righteousness, and therefore must needs hate wickedness and punish wicked men.

The Lord is righteous in himself, and in all his ways and works; and therefore righteousness, as it lies both in punishing the wicked, and in maintaining the righteous cause of his people, must be loved by him, it being agreeable to his nature: he loves to exercise righteousness in the earth, to administer it to and among men; this he delights in. He is well pleased with the righteousness of his Son, it being satisfactory to his justice, and that by which his law is magnified and made honourable; and he is well pleased with his people, as they are clothed with it: and he approves of their righteous actions, as they are done in obedience to his righteous law, in faith, from a principle of love, and with a view to his glory; these are acceptable to him in Christ; <p>his countenance doth behold the upright; whom wicked men privily shoot at, <a href="/psalms/11-2.htm">Psalm 11:2</a>; God looks with pleasure upon them, and takes delight in them, and takes care of them, protects and defends them, and at last saves them; and which, with all that goes before, was an encouragement to David to trust in the Lord; see <a href="/psalms/7-10.htm">Psalm 7:10</a>; and moreover, the Lord lifts up the light of his countenance on such, and indulges them with his gracious presence, than which nothing is more comfortable and desirable. Some choose to render the word, "their countenance" (y), meaning the trinity of Persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, who all have a gracious regard to such: others render the clause thus, "the upright shall see his face", the face of God; so the Chaldee paraphrase and the Arabic version; see <a href="/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a>. <p>(y) "facies eorum", Genebrardus, Vatablus, Gussetius; so R.

Hidden in Jahve (<a href="/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>) he needs no other refuge. However well-meant and well-grounded the advice, he considers it too full of fear and is himself too confident in God, to follow it. David also introduces his friends as speaking in other passages in the Psalms belonging to the period of the Absolom persecution, <a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/4-7.htm">Psalm 4:7</a>. Their want of courage, which he afterwards had to reprove and endeavour to restore, showed itself even before the storm had burst, as we see here. With the words "how can you say" he rejects their proposal as unreasonable, and turns it as a reproach against them. If the Chethb, &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, is adopted, then those who are well-disposed, say to David, including with him his nearest subjects who are faithful to him: retreat to your mountain, (ye) birds (&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; collective as in <a href="/psalms/8-9.htm">Psalm 8:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/148-10.htm">Psalm 148:10</a>); or, since this address sounds too derisive to be appropriate to the lips of those who are supposed to be speaking here: like birds (comparatio decurtata as in <a href="/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/58-9.htm">Psalm 58:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/21-8.htm">Psalm 21:8</a>). &#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1505; which seems more natural in connection with the vocative rendering of &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512; (cf. <a href="/isaiah/18-6.htm">Isaiah 18:6</a> with <a href="/ezekiel/39-4.htm">Ezekiel 39:4</a>) may also be explained, with the comparative rendering, without any need for the conjecture &#1492;&#1512; &#1499;&#1502;&#1493; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512; (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a>), as a retrospective glance at the time of the persecution under Saul: to the mountains, which formerly so effectually protected you (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/26-20.htm">1 Samuel 26:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>). But the Ker, which is followed by the ancient versions, exchanges &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493; for &#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, cf &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497; <a href="/isaiah/51-23.htm">Isaiah 51:23</a>. Even reading it thus we should not take &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512;, which certainly is epicoene, as vocative: flee to your mountain, O bird (Hitz.); and for this reason, that this form of address is not appropriate to the idea of those who profer their counsel. But we should take it as an equation instead of a comparison: fly to your mountain (which gave you shelter formerly), a bird, i.e., after the manner of a bird that flies away to its mountain home when it is chased in the plain. But this Ker appears to be a needless correction, which removes the difficulty of &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493; coming after &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, by putting another in the place of this synallage numeri.<p>(Note: According to the above rendering: "Flee ye to your mountain, a bird" it would require to be accented &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493; &#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1501; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1494; (as a transformation from &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493; &#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1501; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512; vid., Baer's Accentssystem XVIII. 2).

As &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; implies, this danger is imminent. The perfect overrides the future: they are not only already in the act of bending the bow, they have made ready their arrow, i.e., their deadly weapon, upon the string (&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;  equals  &#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/21-13.htm">Psalm 21:13</a>, Arab. watar, from &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, wata ra, to stretch tight, extend, so that the thing is continued in one straight line) and even taken aim, in order to discharge it (&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; with &#1500; of the aim, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/54-5.htm">Psalm 54:5</a>, with acc. of the object) in the dark (i.e., secretly, like an assassin) at the upright (those who by their character are opposed to them).

We prefer the latter, since the king and those who are loyal to him, who are associated in thought with &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, are compared to the &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;. The construction of the clause beginning with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is like <a href="/job/38-41.htm">Job 38:41</a>. The fut. has a present signification.

And all counter-effort is so useless that it is well to be as far from danger as possible. </body></html>
