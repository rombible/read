Probably (if the arrangement of the words is right) we have here another expression of a widely-spread feeling—a feeling which inspired the apocalyptic literature, which had for its object partly to answer this question, how long? But it has been suggested, as more in the Hebrew style, to end the clause with the word <span class= "ital">know, </span>and make it directly parallel with the preceding (“there is neither a prophet nor one who knows”), and carry on the interrogative to the next verse, where its repetition would add much to the force of the question there put.

Besides, it is not unusual, in Scripture, to say there is none of a sort of persons or things, when there is a very great scarcity of them. Bishop Patrick thinks what is here said respecting there being no prophet, to tell the Jews how long the captivity would last, is a proof that this Psalm was written toward the end of that captivity.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/74.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>74:1-11 This psalm appears to describe the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple by the Chaldeans. The deplorable case of the people of God, at the time, is spread before the Lord, and left with him. They plead the great things God had done for them. If the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt was encouragement to hope that he would not cast them off, much more reason have we to believe, that God will not cast off any whom Christ has redeemed with his own blood. Infidels and persecutors may silence faithful ministers, and shut up places of worship, and say they will destroy the people of God and their religion together. For a long time they may prosper in these attempts, and God's oppressed servants may see no prospect of deliverance; but there is a remnant of believers, the seed of a future harvest, and the despised church has survived those who once triumphed over her. When the power of enemies is most threatening, it is comfortable to flee to the power of God by earnest prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/74.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We see not our signs - The emblems of worship, or the national emblems or banners, which we have been accustomed to see.

The nation is subdued and conquered.<p>There is no more any prophet - No one is raised up as the special messenger of God to assure us of his favor, or to take the lead in the national troubles. In times of danger God had been accustomed to send to them some special teacher who would declare his will, direct the nation what to do, and give encouraging assurances that the national troubles would cease, and that deliverance would come. They saw no such messengers of God now. This is not inconsistent with the supposition that this psalm was written before the captivity, and in the time of the Chaldean invasion, or with the supposition that Jeremiah was then alive, for the meaning may be, not that literally there was no prophet in the land, but that there was no one who had come from God as a special messenger of comfort and deliverance. Ruin had come upon them, and there were no indications of divine interposition in their behalf.<p>Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long - How long these calamities are to continue.

In <a href="/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2</a> God is reminded of what He has once done for the congregation of His people. &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-2.htm">Psalm 44:2</a>, points back into the Mosaic time of old, to the redemption out of Egypt, which is represented in &#1511;&#1504;&#1492; (<a href="/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>) as a purchasing, and in &#1490;&#1488;&#1500; (<a href="/psalms/77-15.htm">Psalm 77:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-35.htm">Psalm 78:35</a>, <a href="/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>) as a ransoming (redemptio). &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1498; is a factitive object; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; is the name given to the whole nation in its distinctness of race from other peoples, as in <a href="/jeremiah/10-16.htm">Jeremiah 10:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-19.htm">Jeremiah 51:19</a>, cf. <a href="/isaiah/63-17.htm">Isaiah 63:17</a>. &#1494;&#1492; (<a href="/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2</a>) is rightly separated from &#1492;&#1512;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (Mugrash); it stands directly for &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-8.htm">Psalm 104:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/104-26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-22.htm">Proverbs 23:22</a>; <a href="/job/15-17.htm">Job 15:17</a> (Ges. 122, 2). The congregation of the people and its central abode are, as though forgotten of God, in a condition which sadly contrasts with their election. &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1510;&#1495; are ruins (vid., <a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18</a>) in a state of such total destruction, that all hope of their restoration vanishes before it; &#1504;&#1510;&#1495; here looks forward, just as &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; (&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;), <a href="/isaiah/63-12.htm">Isaiah 63:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/61-4.htm">Psalm 61:4</a>, looks backwards. May God then lift His feet up high (&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; poetical for &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, cf. <a href="/psalms/58-11.htm">Psalm 58:11</a> with <a href="/psalms/68-24.htm">Psalm 68:24</a>), i.e., with long hurried steps, without stopping, move towards His dwelling - lace that now lies in ruins, that by virtue of His interposition it may rise again. Hath the enemy made merciless havoc - he hath ill-treated (&#1492;&#1512;&#1506;, as in <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>) everything (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/8-7.htm">Psalm 8:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-2.htm">Zephaniah 1:2</a>, for &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; or &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;) in the sanctuary - how is it possible that this sacrilegious vandalism should remain unpunished!  </body></html>
