The deplorable case of the people of God, at the time, is spread before the Lord, and left with him. They plead the great things God had done for them. If the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt was encouragement to hope that he would not cast them off, much more reason have we to believe, that God will not cast off any whom Christ has redeemed with his own blood. Infidels and persecutors may silence faithful ministers, and shut up places of worship, and say they will destroy the people of God and their religion together. For a long time they may prosper in these attempts, and God's oppressed servants may see no prospect of deliverance; but there is a remnant of believers, the seed of a future harvest, and the despised church has survived those who once triumphed over her. When the power of enemies is most threatening, it is comfortable to flee to the power of God by earnest prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/74.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? - Thou seemest to have cast us off forever, or finally.

See <a href="/deuteronomy/29-20.htm">Deuteronomy 29:20</a>. The presence of smoke indicates fire, and the language here is such as often occurs in the Scriptures, when anger or wrath is compared with fire. See <a href="/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-14.htm">Jeremiah 15:14</a>.<p>Against the sheep of thy pasture - Thy people, represented as a flock. See <a href="/psalms/79-13.htm">Psalm 79:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>. This increases the tenderness of the appeal. The wrath of God seemed to be enkindled against his own people, helpless and defenseless, who needed his care, and who might naturally look for it - as a flock needs the care of a shepherd, and as the care of the shepherd might be expected. He seemed to be angry with his people, and to have cast them off, when they had every reason to anticipate his protection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/74.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 74<p>Ps 74:1-23. If the historical allusions of Ps 74:6-8, &c., be referred, as is probable, to the period of the captivity, the author was probably a descendant and namesake of Asaph, David's contemporary and singer (compare 2Ch 35:15; Ezr 2:41). He complains of God's desertion of His Church, and appeals for aid, encouraging himself by recounting some of God's mighty deeds, and urges his prayer on the ground of God's covenant relation to His people, and the wickedness of His and their common enemy.<p>1. cast &#8230; off&#8212;with abhorrence (compare Ps 43:2; 44:9).

To cast Us off at all were hard, but when thou dost for so long a time desert thy people it is an evil beyond all endurance - the very chief of woes and abyss of misery. It is our wisdom when under chastisement to enquire, "Show me wherefore thou contendest with me?" and if the affliction be a protracted one, we should the more eagerly enquire the purport of it. Sin is usually at the bottom of all the hidings of the Lord's face; let us ask the Lord to reveal the special form of it to us, that we may repent of it, overcome it, and henceforth forsake It. When a church is in a forsaken condition it must not sit still in apathy, but turn to the hand which smiteth it, and humbly enquire the reason why. At the same time, the enquiry of the text is a faulty one for it implies two mistakes. There are two questions, which only admit of negative replies. "Hath God cast away his people?" (<a href="/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1</a>); and the other, "Will the Lord cast off for ever?" (<a href="/psalms/77-7.htm">Psalm 77:7</a>). God is never weary of his people so as to abhor them, and even when his anger is turned against them, it is but for a small moment, and with a view to their eternal good. Grief in its distraction asks strange questions and surmises impossible terrors. It is a wonder of grace that the Lord has not long ago put us away as men lay aside cast-off garments, but he hateth putting away, and will still be patient with his chosen. "Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?" They are thine, they are the objects of thy care, they are poor, silly, and defenceless things: pity them, forgive them, and come to their rescue. They are but sheep, do not continue to be wroth with them. It is a terrible thing when the anger of God smokes, but it is an infinite mercy that it does not break into a devouring flame. It is meet to pray the Lord to remove every sign of his wrath, for it is to those who are truly the Lord's sheep a most painful thing to be the objects of his displeasure. To vex the Holy Spirit is no mean sin, and yet how frequently are we guilty of it; hence it is no marvel that we are often under a cloud.<p><a href="/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2</a><p>continued...i.e. Composed by Asaph; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. By that famous Asaph who flourished in David’s time, and by the Spirit of God foresaw and foretold the things here mentioned. But the clear, and exact, and particular, and most pathetical description of the thing here expressed, looks much more like a narrative of what is past than a prophecy of what is to come; which usually is delivered marc darkly. Besides, such a prophecy of the destruction of the temple before it was built would have been a great discouragement to the building of it, and would probably have been taken notice of by Solomon in his prayer for it, when it was newly built. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

An appeal to God, Who seems to have abandoned and forgotten the people and city of His choice.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>THE misery of the Jews is here at its deepest (Four Friends, p. 291). The psalmist describes Jerusalem as fallen into "perpetual ruins" (ver. 3). The temple is violated (ver. 3); its carved work is ruthlessly cut down (ver. 6); the aid of fire has been called in to destroy it, and its walls are cast down to the ground (ver. 7). Nor has Jerusalem alone suffered. The object has been to "make havoc" of Israel "altogether;" and the enemy have spread themselves, and "burnt up all the houses of God in the land" (ver. 8). The prophets have succumbed; their voices are heard no more (ver. 9). A blasphemous enemy lords it over the entire country (vers. 10, 23), and sets up its banners as signs of its dominion (ver. 4). Three periods have been assigned for the composition of the psalm: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the time of the invasion of Shishak; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that of the Babylonian conquest; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the early Maceabean period, or the reign of Judas Maccabaens. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In favour of the first is the ascription of the psalm in the "title" to Asaph. But all other considerations are against it. There is no evidence that Shishak ever entered Jerusalem. He certainly did not break down the carved work of the temple, or set the temple on fire, much less "cast it down to the ground." His invasion was a mere raid, and Rehoboam seems to have bought his retreat by the sacrifice of the temple treasury (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-28</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-12</a>). The circumstances described in the psalm are also unsuitable to the reign of Judas Maccabaeus, in whose time the temple suffered desecration at the hands of the Syrians, but was not seriously damaged, much less demolished. Thus the only date suitable for the composition of the psalm is that immediately following the capture of the city under Nebuchadnezzar.  We must explain the "title" by the consideration that Asaph, like Jeduthun and Heman, became a tribe name, attaching to all the descendants of the original Asaph, and was equivalent to "sou of Asaph" (see <a href="/ezra/2-41.htm">Ezra 2:41</a>; <a href="/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-44.htm">Nehemiah 7:44</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/11-22.htm">Nehemiah 11:22</a>). The psalm consists of three portions: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A complaint to God, including a description of all the horrors of the situation (vers. 1-11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> An enumeration of God's mercies in the olden time, as a foundation for hope that he will yet rescue Israel (vers. 12-17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> An earnest prayer for relief and restoration, and the re-establishment of the covenant (vers. 18-23). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O God, why hast thou cast us off forever?</span> It could only have been in the extremity of distress that a devout Israelite believed, even for a time, that Israel was "<span class="accented">cast off forever"</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/79-5.htm">Psalm 79:5</a>, which must have been written nearly at the same period as this). <span class="cmt_word">Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</span> God's anger "smokes" when it is hot and furious (see <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-32.htm">Psalm 104:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>). It is now smoking "against the sheep of his pasture" - his own flock (<a href="/psalms/78-53.htm">Psalm 78:53</a>), his peculiar people (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-6.htm">Jeremiah 50:6, 17</a>; and <a href="/psalms/79-13.htm">Psalm 79:13</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/73.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But he does not thus deeply degrade himself: after God has once taken him by the right hand and rescued him from the danger of falling (<a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>), he clings all the more firmly to Him, and will not suffer his perpetual fellowship with Him to be again broken through by such seizures which estrange him from God. confidently does he yield up himself to the divine guidance, though he may not see through the mystery of the plan (&#1506;&#1510;&#1492;) of this guidance. He knows that afterwards (&#1488;&#1495;&#1512; with Mugrash: adverb as in <a href="/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a>), i.e., after this dark way of faith, God will &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; receive him, i.e., take him to Himself, and take him from all suffering (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-16.htm">Psalm 49:16</a>, and of Enoch, <a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>). The comparison of <a href="/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a> [8] is misleading; there &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; is rightly accented as a preposition: after glory hath He sent me forth (vid., K&#1510;hler), and here as an adverb; for although the adverbial sense of &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; would more readily lead one to look for the arrangement of the words &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512; &#1514;&#1511;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497; &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, still "to receive after glory" (cf. the reverse <a href="/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>) is an awkward thought. &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, which as an adjective "glorious" (Hofmann) is alien to the language, is either accusative of the goal (Hupfeld), or, which yields a form of expression that is more like the style of the Old Testament, accusative of the manner (Luther, "with honour"). In &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; the poet comprehends in one summary view what he looks for at the goal of the present divine guidance. The future is dark to him, but lighted up by the one hope that the end of his earthly existence will be a glorious solution of the riddle. Here, as elsewhere, it is faith which breaks through not only the darkness of this present life, but also the night of Hades. At that time there was as yet no divine utterance concerning any heavenly triumph of the church, militant in the present world, but to faith the Jahve-Name had already a transparent depth which penetrated beyond Hades into an eternal life. The heaven of blessedness and glory also is nothing without God; but he who can in love call God his, possesses heaven upon earth, and he who cannot in love call God his, would possess not heaven, but hell, in the midst of heaven. In this sense the poet says in <a href="/psalms/73-25.htm">Psalm 73:25</a> : whom have I in heaven? i.e., who there without Thee would be the object of my desire, the stilling of my longing? without Thee heaven with all its glory is a vast waste and void, which makes me indifferent to everything, and with Thee, i.e., possessing Thee, I have no delight in the earth, because to call Thee mine infinitely surpasses every possession and every desire of earth. If we take &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; still more exactly as parallel to &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, without making it dependent upon &#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;: and possessing Thee I have no desire upon the earth, then the sense remains essentially the same; but if we allow &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; to be governed by &#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1514;&#1497; in accordance with the general usage of the language, we arrive at this meaning by the most natural way. Heaven and earth, together with angels and men, afford him no satisfaction - his only friend, his sole desire and love, is God. The love for God which David expresses in <a href="/psalms/16-2.htm">Psalm 16:2</a> in the brief utterance, "Thou art my Lord, Thou art my highest good," is here expanded with incomparable mystical profoundness and beauty. Luther's version shows his master-hand. The church follows it in its "Herzlich lieb hab' ich dich" when it sings - <p>"The whole wide world delights me not,<p>For heaven and earth, Lord, care Inot,<p>If I may but have Thee;"<p>and following it, goes on in perfect harmony with the text of our Psalm - <p>"Yea, though my heart be like to break,<p>Thou art my trust that nought can shake;" <p>(Note: Miss Winkworth's translation.)<p>or with Paul Gerhard, [in his Passion-hymn "Ein Lmmlein geht und trgt die Schuld der Welt und ihrer Kinder,"<p>"Light of my heart, that shalt Thou be;<p>And when my heart in pieces breaks,<p>Thou shalt my heart remain."<p>For the hypothetical perfect &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; expresses something in spite of which he upon whom it may come calls God his God: licet defecerit. Though his outward and inward man perish, nevertheless God remains ever the rock of his heart as the firm ground upon which he, with his ego, remains standing when everything else totters; He remains his portion, i.e., the possession that cannot be taken from him, if he loses all, even his spirit-life pertaining to the body, - and God remains to him this portion &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, he survives with the life which he has in God the death of the old life. The poet supposes an extreme case, - one, that is, it is true, impossible, but yet conceivable, - that his outward and inward being should sink away; even then with the merus actus of his ego he will continue to cling to God. In the midst of the natural life of perishableness and of sin, a new, individual life which is resigned to God has begun within him, and in this he has the pledge that he cannot perish, so truly as God, with whom it is closely united, cannot perish. It is just this that is also the nerve of the proof of the resurrection of the dead which Jesus advances in opposition to the Sadducees (<a href="/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>). </body></html>
