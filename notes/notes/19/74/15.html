What God had done for his people, as their King of old, encouraged them to depend on him. It was the Lord's doing, none besides could do it. This providence was food to faith and hope, to support and encourage in difficulties. The God of Israel is the God of nature. He that is faithful to his covenant about the day and the night, will never cast off those whom he has chosen. We have as much reason to expect affliction, as to expect night and winter.

The main allusion is probably to the Jordan, and the idea is, that God had, as it were, divided all the waters, or prevented any obstruction to his people from the river in any respect; as if the waters in the very springs and fountains, and the waters in the channel of the river flowing from those springs and fountains, had been so restrained and divided that there was a safe passage through them. <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>.<p>Thou driedst up mighty rivers - Margin, "rivers of strength." The Hebrew - &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;  'e&#770;ytha&#770;n - (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>) - means rather perennial, constant, ever-flowing. The allusion is to rivers or streams that flow constantly, or that do not dry up. It was this which made the miracle so apparent. It could not be pretended that they had gone over the bed of a stream which was accustomed to be dry at certain seasons of the year. They passed over rivers that never dried up; and, therefore, it could have been only by miracle. The main allusion is undoubtedly to the passage of the Jordan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/74.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. cleave the fountain&#8212;that is, the rocks of Horeb and Kadesh; for fountains.<p>driedst up&#8212;Jordan, and, perhaps, Arnon and Jabbok (Nu 21:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/74.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood, </span> i.e. thou didst by cleaving the rock make a fountain in it, and a flood or stream to flow from it, for the refreshment of thy people in those dry deserts.

"Our signs" is the direct antithesis to "their sings" (<a href="/psalms/74-4.htm">Psalm 74:4</a>), hence they are not to be understood, after <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/86-17.htm">Psalm 86:17</a>, as signs which God works. The suffix demands, besides, something of a perpetual character; they are the instituted ordinances of divine worship by means of which God is pleased to stand in fellowship with His people, and which are now no longer to be seen because the enemies have set them aside. The complaint "there is not prophet any more" would seem strange in the period immediately after the destruction of Jerusalem, for Jeremiah's term of active service lasted beyond this. Moreover, a year before (in the tenth year of Zedekiah's reign) he had predicted that the Babylonian domination, and relatively the Exile, would last seventy years; besides, six years before the destruction Ezekiel appeared, who was in communication with those who remained behind in the land. The reference to <a href="/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a> (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/7-26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26</a>) does not satisfy one; for there it is assumed that there were prophets, a fact which is here denied. Only perhaps as a voice coming out of the Exile, the middle of which (cf. <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">2 Chronicles 15:3</a>, and besides Canticum trium puerorum, <a href="/psalms/74-14.htm">Psalm 74:14</a> : &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) was truly thus devoid of signs or miracles, and devoid of the prophetic word of consolation, can <a href="/psalms/74-9.htm">Psalm 74:9</a> be comprehended. The seventy years of Jeremiah were then still a riddle without any generally known solution (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>). If, however, synagogues are meant in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-8.htm">Psalm 74:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/74-9.htm">Psalm 74:9</a> now too accords with the like-sounding lament in the calamitous times of Antiochus (1 Macc. 4:46; 9:27; 14:41). In <a href="/psalms/74-10.htm">Psalm 74:10</a> the poet turns to God Himself with the question "How long?" how long is this (apparently) endless blaspheming of the enemy to last? Why dost Thou draw back (viz., &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, from us, not &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/psalms/81-15.htm">Psalm 81:15</a>) Thy hand and Thy right hand? The conjunction of synonyms "Thy hand and Thy right hand" is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>, Sirach 33:7, a fuller expression for God's omnipotent energy. This is now at rest; <a href="/psalms/74-11.htm">Psalm 74:11</a> calls upon it to give help by an act of judgment. "Out of the midst of Thy bosom, destroy," is a pregnant expression for, "drawing forth out of Thy bosom the hand that rests inactive there, do Thou destroy." The Chethb &#1495;&#1493;&#1511;&#1498; has perhaps the same meaning; for &#1495;&#1493;&#1511;, Arab. h&#803;awq, signifies, like &#1495;&#1497;&#1511;, Arab. h&#803;ayq, the act of encompassing, then that which encompasses. Instead of &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;&#1498; (<a href="/exodus/4-7.htm">Exodus 4:7</a>) the expression is &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489; &#1495;&#1497;&#1511;&#1498;, because there, within the realm of the bosom, the punitive justice of God for a time as it were slumbers. On the &#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which outwardly is without any object, cf. <a href="/psalms/59-14.htm">Psalm 59:14</a>. </body></html>
