Thus, “from the miraculous interpositions of God in behalf of his people, the psalmist passes to those ordinary and standing evidences of his goodness toward us, the sweet vicissitudes of light and darkness, and the grateful succession of times and seasons; by which man is taught, in the most sorrowful night, to look for a joyful morning; and, during the severest winter, to expect a reviving spring. Thus is the revolving year our constant instructer and monitor; incessantly inculcating the duties of faith and hope, as well as those of adoration, gratitude, and praise.” — Horne.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/74.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>74:12-17 The church silences her own complaints. What God had done for his people, as their King of old, encouraged them to depend on him. It was the Lord's doing, none besides could do it. This providence was food to faith and hope, to support and encourage in difficulties. The God of Israel is the God of nature. He that is faithful to his covenant about the day and the night, will never cast off those whom he has chosen. We have as much reason to expect affliction, as to expect night and winter. But we have no more reason to despair of the return of comfort, than to despair of day and summer.

He made the one and the other, and divided the one from the other; and can make them longer or shorter, clear or cloudy, as he pleases: and the day of prosperity and night of adversity are at his disposal; all the times of his people and of his church are in his hands; sometimes it is a night of darkness, deadness, sleepiness, and security, as it now is; ere long there will be no more night, but bright day; the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven fold as the light of seven days; and this is to be expected from him whose is the day and the night also, <a href="/revelation/21-25.htm">Revelation 21:25</a>. Jarchi interprets the day, of the redemption of Israel; and the night, of distresses and afflictions: <p>thou hast prepared the light and the sun; first the light, and then the sun; for the light was before the sun; or the luminary, even the sun. Aben Ezra interprets the "light" of the moon, and so the Targum; and Kimchi, both of the moon and of the stars; Jarchi takes the light figuratively to be meant of the light of the law; but it is much better to understand it of the light of the Gospel, which God has prepared, and will send forth more largely in the latter day, whereby the whole earth shall be lightened; and when Christ the "sun" of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings, and who gives both the light of grace and glory to his people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/74.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> day <i>is</i> thine, the night also <i>is</i> thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.</span><p>(m) Seeing that God by his providence governs and disposes all things, he gathers that he will take care chiefly for his children.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/74.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">The day</span> &c.] Thine is the day and the night is thine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the light and the sun</span>] Possibly equivalent to ‘the moon and the sun’ (<a href="/psalms/104-19.htm" title="He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knows his going down.">Psalm 104:19</a>); but more probably ‘the luminaries and especially the sun.’ Cp. <a href="/genesis/1-14.htm" title="And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:">Genesis 1:14</a>; <a href="/genesis/1-16.htm" title="And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.">Genesis 1:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">16, 17</span>.

The sun is then particularized, as so much the most important of the luminaries. But the result is "an imperfect parallelism" (Cheyne). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/74.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The worst thing the poet has to complain of is that God has not acknowledged His people during this time of suffering as at other times. "Our signs" is the direct antithesis to "their sings" (<a href="/psalms/74-4.htm">Psalm 74:4</a>), hence they are not to be understood, after <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/86-17.htm">Psalm 86:17</a>, as signs which God works. The suffix demands, besides, something of a perpetual character; they are the instituted ordinances of divine worship by means of which God is pleased to stand in fellowship with His people, and which are now no longer to be seen because the enemies have set them aside. The complaint "there is not prophet any more" would seem strange in the period immediately after the destruction of Jerusalem, for Jeremiah's term of active service lasted beyond this. Moreover, a year before (in the tenth year of Zedekiah's reign) he had predicted that the Babylonian domination, and relatively the Exile, would last seventy years; besides, six years before the destruction Ezekiel appeared, who was in communication with those who remained behind in the land. The reference to <a href="/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a> (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/7-26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26</a>) does not satisfy one; for there it is assumed that there were prophets, a fact which is here denied. Only perhaps as a voice coming out of the Exile, the middle of which (cf. <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">2 Chronicles 15:3</a>, and besides Canticum trium puerorum, <a href="/psalms/74-14.htm">Psalm 74:14</a> : &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) was truly thus devoid of signs or miracles, and devoid of the prophetic word of consolation, can <a href="/psalms/74-9.htm">Psalm 74:9</a> be comprehended. The seventy years of Jeremiah were then still a riddle without any generally known solution (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>). If, however, synagogues are meant in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-8.htm">Psalm 74:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/74-9.htm">Psalm 74:9</a> now too accords with the like-sounding lament in the calamitous times of Antiochus (1 Macc. 4:46; 9:27; 14:41). In <a href="/psalms/74-10.htm">Psalm 74:10</a> the poet turns to God Himself with the question "How long?" how long is this (apparently) endless blaspheming of the enemy to last? Why dost Thou draw back (viz., &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, from us, not &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/psalms/81-15.htm">Psalm 81:15</a>) Thy hand and Thy right hand? The conjunction of synonyms "Thy hand and Thy right hand" is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>, Sirach 33:7, a fuller expression for God's omnipotent energy. This is now at rest; <a href="/psalms/74-11.htm">Psalm 74:11</a> calls upon it to give help by an act of judgment. "Out of the midst of Thy bosom, destroy," is a pregnant expression for, "drawing forth out of Thy bosom the hand that rests inactive there, do Thou destroy." The Chethb &#1495;&#1493;&#1511;&#1498; has perhaps the same meaning; for &#1495;&#1493;&#1511;, Arab. h&#803;awq, signifies, like &#1495;&#1497;&#1511;, Arab. h&#803;ayq, the act of encompassing, then that which encompasses. Instead of &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;&#1498; (<a href="/exodus/4-7.htm">Exodus 4:7</a>) the expression is &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489; &#1495;&#1497;&#1511;&#1498;, because there, within the realm of the bosom, the punitive justice of God for a time as it were slumbers. On the &#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, which outwardly is without any object, cf. <a href="/psalms/59-14.htm">Psalm 59:14</a>. </body></html>
