The deplorable case of the people of God, at the time, is spread before the Lord, and left with him. They plead the great things God had done for them. If the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt was encouragement to hope that he would not cast them off, much more reason have we to believe, that God will not cast off any whom Christ has redeemed with his own blood. Infidels and persecutors may silence faithful ministers, and shut up places of worship, and say they will destroy the people of God and their religion together. For a long time they may prosper in these attempts, and God's oppressed servants may see no prospect of deliverance; but there is a remnant of believers, the seed of a future harvest, and the despised church has survived those who once triumphed over her. When the power of enemies is most threatening, it is comfortable to flee to the power of God by earnest prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/74.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O God, how long shall the adversary reproach?... - How long shall this state of things be allowed to continue? Is there to be no end to it? Are these desolations never to be repaired - these ruins never to be rebuilt? It "seemed" so; and hence, this earnest appeal. So to us it often appears as if our trials were never to come to an end. One calamity succeeds another; and there comes no relief. Yet there is relief. Deliverance may come, and soon come, in the present life; or if not in the present life, yet to all those who are the children of God it will soon come by their removal to a world where trial will be forever unknown. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/74.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

The name of God, as in the next clause, the divine Persons and perfections, the purposes and providence of God, his people, ways, worship, truths, and ordinances: <p>shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? The "adversary" and "enemy" being in the singular number, may intend some particular one, as antichrist; who is emphatically and eminently "the enemy" of God, he opposing himself to, and exalting himself above, all that is called God; and the adversary of Christ, as his name shows; not only setting himself in his room and stead, but undermining him in all his offices; changing his laws as a King, dishonouring his sacrifice and intercession as a priest, and doing injury to his word and ordinances as a Prophet; and who has a mouth speaking blasphemies against God, his name, and tabernacle, heaven, and they that dwell therein, angels and saints, <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>. He reproaches and blasphemes God himself, by showing himself to be God, by suffering himself to be so called, and to be worshipped as if he was God; by taking infallibility to himself, and setting up image worship, and obliging persons to it: he reproaches and blasphemes the Son of God, in whom the name of God is, by pretending to be his vicar on earth, and head of the church; to transubstantiate the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ; and to offer him up again in the blasphemous service of the mass: he reproaches and blasphemes his Gospel, which is his name, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>, by introducing doctrines contrary to it, as the doctrines of merit, of works of supererogation, and justification by works; and the Scriptures, which bear the name and authority of God, by making them a nose of wax, taking upon himself to be the infallible interpreter of Scripture, and sole judge of controversies; by setting up his own unwritten traditions upon an equality with them, and forbidding the use of them to the people in their mother tongue: and he reproaches and blasphemes his name and authority by assuming it to himself in civil things, deposing and setting up kings at his pleasure; in religious affairs, dispensing with the laws of God, and teaching for doctrines the commandments of men; yea, in matters of salvation, giving out pardons and indulgences, pretending to open and shut heaven at pleasure. Moreover, these terms may be understood of many enemies and adversaries, even of all the enemies of the grace of God, and person of Christ; such reproach and blaspheme the name of God the Father; by denying some of his perfections, as his sovereignty, omniscience, and punitive justice, and by charging his decrees with injustice, insincerity, and cruelty; they reproach and blaspheme the name of Christ, by denying his deity, eternal sonship, and distinct personality, and by speaking contemptuously of his righteousness, blood, and sacrifice; and they do despight unto the Spirit of grace, and speak evil of his person, and the operations of his grace on the souls of men; and such a day of rebuke and blasphemy is the present one: and these things give good men that observe them a great concern for the name of God, who are ready to fear there will be no end to these reproaches and blasphemies; but there will, the time is coming when the name of the Lord will be excellent in all the earth, and the Lord alone shall be exalted; but it is not known how long it will be to it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/74.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/74.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">How long</span>] Taking up the last words of <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/74-9.htm" title="We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knows how long.">Psalm 74:9</a></span>, the Psalmist begins the second division of the Psalm with an appeal parallel to that in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/psalms/74-1.htm" title="O God, why have you cast us off for ever? why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?...">Psalm 74:1-3</a></span>.

Since &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="/psalms/74-3.htm">Psalm 74:3</a> is the Temple, &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="/psalms/74-4.htm">Psalm 74:4</a> ought likewise to mean the Temple with reference to the several courts; but the plural would here (cf. <a href="/psalms/74-8.htm">Psalm 74:8</a>) be misleading, and is, too, only a various reading. Baer has rightly decided in favour of &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1498;; <p>(Note: The reading &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; is received, e.g., by Elias Hutter and Nissel; the Targum translates it, Kimchi follows it in his interpretation, and Abraham of Zante follows it in his paraphrase; it is tolerably widely known, but, according to the lxx and Syriac versions and MSS, it is to be rejected.)<p>&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, as in <a href="/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a>., is the instituted (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-1.htm">Numbers 17:1-13</a> :19 [4]) place of God's intercourse with His congregation (cf. Arab. m&#305;&#770;&#8219;a&#770;d, a rendezvous). What Jeremiah says in <a href="/lamentations/2-7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a> (cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1490;, <a href="/jeremiah/2-15.htm">Jeremiah 2:15</a>) is here more briefly expressed. By &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514;&#1501; (<a href="/psalms/74-4.htm">Psalm 74:4</a>) we must not understand military insignia; the scene of the Temple and the supplanting of the Israelitish national insignia to be found there, by the substitution of other insignia, requires that the word should have the religious reference in which it is used of circumcision and of the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>); such heathen &#1488;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;, which were thrust upon the Temple and the congregation of Jahve as henceforth the lawful ones, were those which are set forth in 1 Macc. 1:45-49, and more particularly the so-called abomination of desolation mentioned in v. 54 of the same chapter. With &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; (<a href="/psalms/74-5.htm">Psalm 74:5</a>) the terrible scene which was at that time taking place before their eyes (<a href="/psalms/79-10.htm">Psalm 79:10</a>) is introduced. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; is the subject; it became visible, tangible, noticeable, i.e., it looked, and one experienced it, as if a man caused the axe to enter into the thicket of the wood, i.e., struck into or at it right and left. The plural &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; forces itself into the simile because it is the many heathen warriors who are, as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-22.htm">Jeremiah 46:22</a>., likened to these hewers of wood. Norzi calls the Kametz of &#1489;&#1505;&#1489;&#1498;&#1470;&#1506;&#1509; Kametz chatuph; the combining form would then be a contraction of &#1505;&#1489;&#1498; (Ewald, Olshausen), for the long a&#772; of &#1505;&#1489;&#1498; does not admit of any contraction. According to another view it is to be read bi-sba&#772;ch-etz, as in <a href="/esther/4-8.htm">Esther 4:8</a> ketha&#772;b-hada&#772;th with counter-tone Metheg beside the long vowel, as e.g., &#1506;&#1509;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503;, <a href="/genesis/2-16.htm">Genesis 2:16</a>). The poet follows the work of destruction up to the destroying stroke, which is introduced by the &#1493;&#1506;&#1514; (perhaps &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;, Ker &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;), which arrests one's attention. In <a href="/psalms/74-5.htm">Psalm 74:5</a> the usual, unbroken quiet is depicted, as is the heavy Cyclopean labour in the Virgilian illi inter sese, etc.; in jahalomu&#770;n, <a href="/psalms/74-6.htm">Psalm 74:6</a> (now and then pointed jahlomu&#770;n), we hear the stroke of the uplifted axes, which break in pieces the costly carved work of the Temple. The suffix of &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; (the carved works thereof) refers, according to the sense, to &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1498;. The lxx, favouring the Maccabaean interpretation, renders: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;). This shattering of the panelling is followed in <a href="/psalms/74-7.htm">Psalm 74:7</a> by the burning, first of all, as we may suppose, of this panelling itself so far as it consists of wood. The guaranteed reading here is &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, not &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498;. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; signifies to set on fire, immittere igni, differing from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;, to set fire to, immittere ignem. On &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, cf. <a href="/lamentations/2-2.htm">Lamentations 2:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>. Hitzig, following the lxx, Targum, and Jerome, derives the exclamation of the enemies &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1501; from &#1504;&#1497;&#1503;: their whole generation (viz., we will root out)! But &#1504;&#1497;&#1503; is posterity, descendants; why therefore only the young and not the aged? And why is it an expression of the object and not rather of the action, the object of which would be self-evident? &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1501; is fut. Kal of &#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, here  equals  Hiph. &#1492;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, to force, oppress, tyrannize over, and like &#1488;&#1504;&#1505;, to compel by violence, in later Hebrew. &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1501; (from &#1497;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, like &#1497;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;) is changed in pause into &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1501;; cf. the future forms in <a href="/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-19.htm">Exodus 34:19</a>, and also in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10-12</a>. Now, after mention has been made of the burning of the Temple framework, &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500; cannot denote the place of the divine manifestation after its divisions (Hengstenberg), still less the festive assemblies (Bttcher), which the enemy could only have burnt up by setting fire to the Temple over their heads, and &#1499;&#1500; does not at all suit this. The expression apparently has reference to synagogues (and this ought not to be disputed), as Aquila and Symmachus render the word. For there is no room for thinking of the separate services conducted by the prophets in the northern kingdom (<a href="/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>), because this kingdom no longer existed at the time this Psalm was written; nor of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the burning down of which no pious Israelite would have bewailed; nor of the sacred places memorable from the early history of Israel, which are nowhere called &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, and after the founding of the central sanctuary appear only as the seats of false religious rites. The expression points (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, Sota ix. 15) to places of assembly for religious purposes, to houses for prayer and teaching, that is to say, to synagogues - a weighty instance in favour of the Maccabaean origin of the Psalm. </body></html>
