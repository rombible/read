The deliverance from Egypt has the foremost place (vers. 13,14), as the most striking. Then the deliverance from the wilderness, and the passage of Jordan (ver. 15). From these the poet passes to God's mercies in nature - day and night, light and sun, set bounds of earth and sea, alternations of the seasons - all formed and arranged by the Almighty (vers. 16, 17). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For God is my King of old (</span>comp. <a href="/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>).

Since &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="/psalms/74-3.htm">Psalm 74:3</a> is the Temple, &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="/psalms/74-4.htm">Psalm 74:4</a> ought likewise to mean the Temple with reference to the several courts; but the plural would here (cf. <a href="/psalms/74-8.htm">Psalm 74:8</a>) be misleading, and is, too, only a various reading. Baer has rightly decided in favour of &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1498;; <p>(Note: The reading &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; is received, e.g., by Elias Hutter and Nissel; the Targum translates it, Kimchi follows it in his interpretation, and Abraham of Zante follows it in his paraphrase; it is tolerably widely known, but, according to the lxx and Syriac versions and MSS, it is to be rejected.)<p>&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, as in <a href="/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a>., is the instituted (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-1.htm">Numbers 17:1-13</a> :19 [4]) place of God's intercourse with His congregation (cf. Arab. m&#305;&#770;&#8219;a&#770;d, a rendezvous). What Jeremiah says in <a href="/lamentations/2-7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a> (cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1490;, <a href="/jeremiah/2-15.htm">Jeremiah 2:15</a>) is here more briefly expressed. By &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514;&#1501; (<a href="/psalms/74-4.htm">Psalm 74:4</a>) we must not understand military insignia; the scene of the Temple and the supplanting of the Israelitish national insignia to be found there, by the substitution of other insignia, requires that the word should have the religious reference in which it is used of circumcision and of the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>); such heathen &#1488;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;, which were thrust upon the Temple and the congregation of Jahve as henceforth the lawful ones, were those which are set forth in 1 Macc. 1:45-49, and more particularly the so-called abomination of desolation mentioned in v. 54 of the same chapter. With &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; (<a href="/psalms/74-5.htm">Psalm 74:5</a>) the terrible scene which was at that time taking place before their eyes (<a href="/psalms/79-10.htm">Psalm 79:10</a>) is introduced. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; is the subject; it became visible, tangible, noticeable, i.e., it looked, and one experienced it, as if a man caused the axe to enter into the thicket of the wood, i.e., struck into or at it right and left. The plural &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; forces itself into the simile because it is the many heathen warriors who are, as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-22.htm">Jeremiah 46:22</a>., likened to these hewers of wood. Norzi calls the Kametz of &#1489;&#1505;&#1489;&#1498;&#1470;&#1506;&#1509; Kametz chatuph; the combining form would then be a contraction of &#1505;&#1489;&#1498; (Ewald, Olshausen), for the long a&#772; of &#1505;&#1489;&#1498; does not admit of any contraction. According to another view it is to be read bi-sba&#772;ch-etz, as in <a href="/esther/4-8.htm">Esther 4:8</a> ketha&#772;b-hada&#772;th with counter-tone Metheg beside the long vowel, as e.g., &#1506;&#1509;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503;, <a href="/genesis/2-16.htm">Genesis 2:16</a>). The poet follows the work of destruction up to the destroying stroke, which is introduced by the &#1493;&#1506;&#1514; (perhaps &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;, Ker &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;), which arrests one's attention. In <a href="/psalms/74-5.htm">Psalm 74:5</a> the usual, unbroken quiet is depicted, as is the heavy Cyclopean labour in the Virgilian illi inter sese, etc.; in jahalomu&#770;n, <a href="/psalms/74-6.htm">Psalm 74:6</a> (now and then pointed jahlomu&#770;n), we hear the stroke of the uplifted axes, which break in pieces the costly carved work of the Temple. The suffix of &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; (the carved works thereof) refers, according to the sense, to &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1498;. The lxx, favouring the Maccabaean interpretation, renders: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;). This shattering of the panelling is followed in <a href="/psalms/74-7.htm">Psalm 74:7</a> by the burning, first of all, as we may suppose, of this panelling itself so far as it consists of wood. The guaranteed reading here is &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, not &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498;. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; signifies to set on fire, immittere igni, differing from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;, to set fire to, immittere ignem. On &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, cf. <a href="/lamentations/2-2.htm">Lamentations 2:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>. Hitzig, following the lxx, Targum, and Jerome, derives the exclamation of the enemies &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1501; from &#1504;&#1497;&#1503;: their whole generation (viz., we will root out)! But &#1504;&#1497;&#1503; is posterity, descendants; why therefore only the young and not the aged? And why is it an expression of the object and not rather of the action, the object of which would be self-evident? &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1501; is fut. Kal of &#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, here  equals  Hiph. &#1492;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, to force, oppress, tyrannize over, and like &#1488;&#1504;&#1505;, to compel by violence, in later Hebrew. &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1501; (from &#1497;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, like &#1497;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;) is changed in pause into &#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1501;; cf. the future forms in <a href="/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-19.htm">Exodus 34:19</a>, and also in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10-12</a>. Now, after mention has been made of the burning of the Temple framework, &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500; cannot denote the place of the divine manifestation after its divisions (Hengstenberg), still less the festive assemblies (Bttcher), which the enemy could only have burnt up by setting fire to the Temple over their heads, and &#1499;&#1500; does not at all suit this. The expression apparently has reference to synagogues (and this ought not to be disputed), as Aquila and Symmachus render the word. For there is no room for thinking of the separate services conducted by the prophets in the northern kingdom (<a href="/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>), because this kingdom no longer existed at the time this Psalm was written; nor of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the burning down of which no pious Israelite would have bewailed; nor of the sacred places memorable from the early history of Israel, which are nowhere called &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, and after the founding of the central sanctuary appear only as the seats of false religious rites. The expression points (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, Sota ix. 15) to places of assembly for religious purposes, to houses for prayer and teaching, that is to say, to synagogues - a weighty instance in favour of the Maccabaean origin of the Psalm. </body></html>
