The word proud here is applied to the waters as if raging, swelling, rolling, tumultuous; as if they were self-confident, arrogant, haughty. Such raging billows, as they break and dash upon the shore, are a striking embIem of human passions, whether in an individual, or in a gathering of men - as an army, or a mob. Compare <a href="/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>. This is again an amplification, or an ascent of thought. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/124-2.htm">Psalm 124:2</a>.

It begins with a Kyrie eleison, which is confirmed in a crescendo manner after the form of steps. The church is already abundantly satiated with ignominy. &#1512;&#1489; is an abstract "much," and &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-3.htm">Psalm 62:3</a>, something great (vid., B&#1510;ttcher, Lehrbuch, &#1431;624). The subjectivizing, intensive &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; accords with <a href="/psalms/120-6.htm">Psalm 120:6</a> - probably an indication of one and the same author. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; is strengthened by &#1500;&#1506;&#1490;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1494; in <a href="/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a>. The article of &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;&#1490; is restrospectively demonstrative: full of such scorn of the haughty (Ew. &#1431;290, d). &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; is also retrospectively demonstrative; but since a repetition of the article for the fourth time would have been inelegant, the poet here says &#1500;&#1490;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; with the Lamed, which serves as a circumlocution of the genitive. The Masora reckons this word among the fifteen "words that are written as one and are to be read as two." The Ker&#1502; runs viz., &#1500;&#1490;&#1488;&#1497; &#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, superbis oppressorum (&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, part. Kal, like &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-1.htm">Zephaniah 3:1</a>, and frequently). But apart from the consideration that instead of &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;, from the unknown &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, it might more readily be pointed &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; (a form of nouns indicating defects, contracted &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;), this genitival construction appears to be far-fetched, and, inasmuch as it makes a distinction among the oppressors, inappropriate. The poet surely meant &#1500;&#1490;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. This word &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (after the form &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;) is perhaps an intentional new formation of the poet. Saadia interprets it after the Talmudic &#1500;&#1490;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, legio; but how could one expect to find such a Grecized Latin word (&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;) in the Psalter! dunash ben-Labrat (about 960) regards &#1490;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as a compound word in the signification of &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. In fact the poet may have chosen the otherwise unused adjectival form &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; because it reminds one of &#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, although it is not a compound word like &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. If the Psalm is a Maccabaean Psalm, it is natural to find in &#1500;&#1490;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; an allusion to the despotic domination of the &#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. </body></html>
