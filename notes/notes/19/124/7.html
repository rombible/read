The people of God are like little birds, being harmless and innocent, singing forth the praises of God for his goodness to them; as also because weak and unable to resist their foes; and worthless in themselves, like sparrows, as the word (i) here used signifies; and are fearful and timorous, and flee at the least apprehension of danger, <a href="/psalms/102-7.htm">Psalm 102:7</a>. Satan, and wicked men under his influence, are like fowlers who lay snares for them, to draw them into sin, into immorality and error, in order to bring them to ruin and destruction; hence we read of the snare of the devil and of wicked men, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-7.htm">1 Timothy 3:7</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>; and who form plans and lay schemes to oppress and destroy them; but through the wisdom given them to discern these devices and stratagems, and through the power of divine grace, accompanying them, they escape what was intended for their hurt, and particularly in the following manner: <p>the snare is broken, and we are escaped; measures concerted by wicked men are broken, their schemes are confounded, their devices are disappointed, so that they cannot perform their enterprise; and by this means the saints escape the evils designed against them, the afflictions of the world, and the temptations of Satan. <p>(i) , Sept.

The timorous defenceless bird is an apt emblem for weak helpless men. Cp. <a href="/psalms/11-1.htm" title="In the LORD put I my trust: how say you to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?">Psalm 11:1</a>. By ‘snare’ (<span class="ital">pach</span>) is probably meant a kind of clapnet. The frame breaks or the spring fails to act, so that the bird is not captured, or else escapes.

Another metaphor. We have been like birds taken in the "snare," or net, of a fowler. But now we are escaped - not, however, of our own strength or of our own cleverness. The snare is broken for us by God's providence, and so we are escaped. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/124.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It is commonly rendered, "If it had not been Jahve who was for us." But, notwithstanding the subject that is placed first (cf. <a href="/genesis/23-13.htm">Genesis 23:13</a>), the &#1513;&#1473; belongs to the &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;; since in the Aramaizing Hebrew (cf. on the other hand <a href="/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>) &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473; (cf. Arab. lawla&#770; an) signifies nisi (prop. nisi quod), as in the Aramaic (&#1491;&#1468;) &#1513;&#1473; (&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;) &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;, o si (prop. o si quod). The &#1488;&#1494;&#1497;, peculiar to this Psalm in the Old Testament, instead of &#1488;&#1494; follows the model of the dialectic &#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;, Arab. id&#817;an, Syr. ha&#772;den (&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;, &#1492;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;). In order to begin the apodosis of &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; (&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;) emphatically the older language makes use of the confirmatory &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-10.htm">Genesis 43:10</a>; here we have &#1488;&#1494;&#1497; (well rendered by the lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;), as in <a href="/psalms/119-92.htm">Psalm 119:92</a>. The Lamed of &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1504;&#1493; is raphe in both instances, according to the rule discussed above, p. 373. When men (&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;) rose up against Israel and their anger was kindled against them, they who were feeble in themselves over against the hostile world would have been swallowed up alive if they had not had Jahve for them, if they had not had Him on their side. This "swallowing up alive" is said elsewhere of Hades, which suddenly and forcibly snatches away its victims, <a href="/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>; here, however, as <a href="/psalms/124-6.htm">Psalm 124:6</a> shows, it is said of the enemies, who are represented as wild beasts. In <a href="/psalms/124-4.htm">Psalm 124:4</a> the hostile power which rolls over them is likened to an overflowing stream, as in <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>., the Assyrian. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, a stream or river, is Milel; it is first of all accusative: towards the stream (<a href="/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>); then, however, it is also used as a nominative, like &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;, and the like (cf. common Greek &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;); so that  &#1514;&#1492;- is related to  &#1514;- ( &#1492;-) as  &#1504;&#1492;-,  &#1502;&#1493;- to  &#1503;- and  &#1501;- (Bttcher, 615). These latest Psalms are fond of such embellishments by means of adorned forms and Aramaic or Aramaizing words. &#1494;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is a word which is indeed not unhebraic in its formation, but is more indigenous to Chaldee; it is the Targum word for &#1494;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/psalms/86-14.htm">Psalm 86:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-51.htm">Psalm 119:51</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-78.htm">Psalm 119:78</a> (also in <a href="/psalms/54-5.htm">Psalm 54:5</a> for &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;), although according to Levy the MSS do not present &#1494;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; but &#1494;&#1497;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;.
