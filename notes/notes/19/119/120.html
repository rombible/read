The more we love the law of God, the more watchful we shall be, lest vain thoughts draw us from what we love. Would we make progress in keeping God's commands, we must be separate from evil-doers. The believer could not live without the grace of God; but, supported by his hand, his spiritual life shall be maintained. Our holy security is grounded on Divine supports. All departure from God's statutes is error, and will prove fatal. Their cunning is falsehood. There is a day coming which will put the wicked into everlasting fire, the fit place for the dross.

There is nothing unaccountable in this. Any man would tremble, should God manifest himself to him as he might do; and it is possible that the mind may have such an overpowering sense of the presence and majesty of God, that the body shall be agitated, lose its strength, and with the deepest alarm fall to the earth. Compare <a href="/daniel/10-8.htm">Daniel 10:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>.

His hope rests on God's word, without allowing itself to be led astray by doubters and apostates. &#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; (the form of nouns which indicate defects or failings) are those inwardly divided, halting between two opinions (&#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;),    <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, who do homage partly to the worship of Jahve, partly to heathenism, and therefore are trying to combine faith and naturalism. In contrast to such, the poet's love, faith, and hope are devoted entirely to the God of revelation; and to all those who are desirous of drawing him away he addresses in <a href="/psalms/119-115.htm">Psalm 119:115</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/6-9.htm">Psalm 6:9</a>) an indignant "depart." He, however, stands in need of grace in order to persevere and to conquer. For this he prays in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-116.htm">Psalm 119:116-117</a>. The &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; is the same as in &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1503;. The ah of &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492; is the intentional ah (Ew. 228, c), as in <a href="/isaiah/41-23.htm">Isaiah 41:23</a>. The statement of the ground of the &#1505;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514;, vilipendis, does not mean: unsuccessful is their deceit (Hengstenberg, Olshausen), but falsehood without the consistency of truth is their self-deceptive and seductive tendency. The lxx and Syriac read &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501;, "their sentiment;" but this is an Aramaic word that is unintelligible in Hebrew, which the old translators have conjured into the text only on account of an apparent tautology. The reading &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468; or &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468; (Aquila, Symmachus, and Jerome; lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, therefore &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;) instead of &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468; might more readily be justified in <a href="/psalms/119-119.htm">Psalm 119:119</a>; but the former gives too narrow a meaning, and the reading rests on a mistaking of the construction of &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; with an accusative of the object and of the effect: all the wicked, as many of them as are on the earth, dost Thou put away as dross (&#1505;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501;( ssor). Accordingly &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="/psalms/119-120.htm">Psalm 119:120</a> are God's punitive judgments, or rather (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-91.htm">Psalm 119:91</a>) God's laws (judgments) according to which He judges. What is meant are sentences of punishment, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. Of these the poet is afraid, for omnipotence can change words into deeds forthwith. In fear of the God who has attested Himself in <a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a> and elsewhere, his skin shudders and his hair stands on end. </body></html>
