It is unspeakable comfort to a gracious soul, to think with what tenderness all its complaints are received by a gracious God. We can talk of the wonders of redeeming love, when we understand the way of God's precepts, and walk in that way. The penitent melts in sorrow for sin: even the patient spirit may melt in the sense of affliction, it is then its interest to pour out its soul before God. The way of lying means all false ways by which men deceive themselves and others, or are deceived by Satan and his instruments. Those who know and love the law of the Lord, desire to know it more, and love it better. The way of serious godliness is the way of truth; the only true way to happiness: we must always have actual regard to it. Those who stick to the word of God, may in faith expect and pray for acceptance with God. Lord, never leave me to do that by which I shall shame myself, and do not thou reject my services. Those that are going to heaven, should still press forward. God, by his Spirit, enlarges the hearts of his people when he gives them wisdom. The believer prays to be set free from sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have declared my ways - That is, I have declared or recounted them to thee.

It is only when we declare all our ways before God, that we can hope he "will" hear us. It is right and proper that we should go before God with all our cares and troubles. There is nothing that gives us anxiety, of which we may not speak to him, however trivial it may seem to be - even as a child speaks to a mother of the smallest matter that troubles him.

This is his life's aim: he will do it under fear of the curse of apostasy; he will do it also though he suffer persecution on account of it. In <a href="/psalms/119-17.htm">Psalm 119:17</a> the expression is only &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-19.htm">Psalm 118:19</a>, not &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-77.htm">Psalm 119:77</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-116.htm">Psalm 119:116</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-144.htm">Psalm 119:144</a> : the apodosis imper. only begins with &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, whereas &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; is the good itself for the bestowment of which the poet prays. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500; in <a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a> is imper. apoc. Piel for &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, like &#1490;&#1505; in <a href="/daniel/1-12.htm">Daniel 1:12</a>. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is the expression for everything supernatural and mysterious which is incomprehensible to the ordinary understanding and is left to the perception of faith. The T&#1508;ra beneath the surface of its letter contains an abundance of such "wondrous things," into which only eyes from which God has removed the covering of natural short-sightedness penetrate; hence the prayer in <a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>. Upon earth we have no abiding resting-place, we sojourn here as in a strange land (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-19.htm">Psalm 119:19</a>, <a href="/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>). Hence the poet prays in <a href="/psalms/119-19.htm">Psalm 119:19</a> that God would keep His commandments, these rules of conduct for the journey of life, in living consciousness for him. Towards this, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-20.htm">Psalm 119:20</a>, his longing tends. &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505; (Hiph. in <a href="/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16</a>) signifies to crush in pieces, Arab. jrs&#780;, and here, like the Aramaic &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, to be crushed, broken in pieces. &#1500;&#1514;&#1488;&#1489;&#1492; (from &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-40.htm">Psalm 119:40</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-174.htm">Psalm 119:174</a>, a secondary form of &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;) states the bias of mind in or at which the soul feels itself thus overpowered even to being crushed: it is crushing form longing after God's judgment, viz., after a more and more thorough knowledge of them. In <a href="/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a> the lxx has probably caught the meaning of the poet better than the pointing has done, inasmuch as it draws &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a>, so that <a href="/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a> consists of two words, just like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>; and Kamphausen also follows this in his rendering. For &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as an attribute is unpoetical, and as an accusative of the predicate far-fetched; whereas it comes in naturally as a predicate before &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;: cursed (&#1488;&#1512;&#1512;  equals  Arab. harra, detestari), viz., by God.
