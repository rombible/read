The more we love the law of God, the more watchful we shall be, lest vain thoughts draw us from what we love. Would we make progress in keeping God's commands, we must be separate from evil-doers. The believer could not live without the grace of God; but, supported by his hand, his spiritual life shall be maintained. Our holy security is grounded on Divine supports. All departure from God's statutes is error, and will prove fatal. Their cunning is falsehood. There is a day coming which will put the wicked into everlasting fire, the fit place for the dross. See what comes of sin Surely we who fall so low in devout affections, should fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into heavenly rest, any of us should be found to come short of it, Heb 4:1.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hold thou me up - Keep me from falling in the trials and temptations of life.

The word of God is his constant guide, to which he has entrusted himself for ever. The way here below is a way through darkness, and leads close past abysses: in this danger of falling and of going astray the word of God is a lamp to his feet, i.e., to his course, and a light to his path (<a href="/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a>); his lamp or torch and his sun. That which he has sworn, viz., to keep God's righteous requirements, he has also set up, i.e., brought to fulfilment, but not without being bowed down under heavy afflictions in confessing God; wherefore he prays (as in <a href="/psalms/119-25.htm">Psalm 119:25</a>) that God would revive him in accordance with His word, which promises life to those who keep it. The confessions of prayer coming from the inmost impulse of his whole heart, in which he owns his indebtedness and gives himself up entirely to God's mercy, he calls the free-will offerings of his mouth in <a href="/psalms/119-108.htm">Psalm 119:108</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/19-15.htm">Psalm 19:15</a>). He bases the prayer for a gracious acceptance of these upon the fact of his being reduced to extremity. "To have one's soul in one's hand" is the same as to be in conscious peril of one's life, just as "to take one's soul into one's hand" (<a href="/judges/12-3.htm">Judges 12:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-21.htm">1 Samuel 28:21</a>; <a href="/job/13-14.htm">Job 13:14</a>) is the same as to be ready to give one's life for it, to risk one's life.<p>(Note: Cf. B. Taanth 8a: "The prayer of a man is not answered &#1488;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1503; &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1489;&#1499;&#1508;&#1493;, i.e., if he is not ready to sacrifice his life.")<p>Although his life is threatened (<a href="/psalms/119-87.htm">Psalm 119:87</a>), yet he does not waver and depart from God's word; he has taken and obtained possession of God's testimonies for ever (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-98.htm">Psalm 119:98</a>); they are his "heritage," for which he willingly gives up everything else, for they (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; inexactly for &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;) it is which bless and entrance him in his inmost soul.
