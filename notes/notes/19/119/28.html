It is unspeakable comfort to a gracious soul, to think with what tenderness all its complaints are received by a gracious God. We can talk of the wonders of redeeming love, when we understand the way of God's precepts, and walk in that way. The penitent melts in sorrow for sin: even the patient spirit may melt in the sense of affliction, it is then its interest to pour out its soul before God. The way of lying means all false ways by which men deceive themselves and others, or are deceived by Satan and his instruments. Those who know and love the law of the Lord, desire to know it more, and love it better. The way of serious godliness is the way of truth; the only true way to happiness: we must always have actual regard to it. Those who stick to the word of God, may in faith expect and pray for acceptance with God. Lord, never leave me to do that by which I shall shame myself, and do not thou reject my services. Those that are going to heaven, should still press forward. God, by his Spirit, enlarges the hearts of his people when he gives them wisdom. The believer prays to be set free from sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My soul melteth - Margin, "droppeth." The Hebrew word here employed - &#1491;&#1500;&#1507;  da&#770;laph - means to drop, to drip, to distil, spoken of a house, as when the rain drops through the roof, <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:18</a>; then, to shed tears, to weep, <a href="/job/16-20.htm">Job 16:20</a> - and this seems to be the meaning here. The idea of melting is not properly in the word, and the term weep would better express the meaning. His soul seemed to drop tears. It overflowed with tears. Yet there is an idea of abundant or constant weeping. It is not a gush of emotion, as when we say of one that he is "bathed in tears;" it is the idea of a steady flow or dropping of tears - slow, silent, but constant - as if the soul were dripping away or dissolving. Thus the idea is more striking and beautiful than that of melting. It is quiet but continuous grief that slowly wears away the soul. There are two kinds of sorrow:<p>(a) the one represented by floods of tears, like fierce torrents that sweep all away, and are soon passed;<p>(b) the other is the gentle dropping - the constant wearing - the slow attrition caused by inward grief, that secretly but certainly wears away the soul.<p>The latter is more common, and more difficult to be borne than the other. The Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate render this, "My soul slumbereth."<p>For heaviness - This word means grief, sorrow, vexation. <a href="/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-21.htm">Proverbs 17:21</a>. It is here silent grief; hidden sorrow. How many thus pine in secret, until life slowly wears away, and they sink to the grave.<p>Strengthen thou me - Give me strength to meet this constant wearing away - this slow work of sorrow. We need strength to bear great and sudden sorrow; we need it not less to bear that which constantly wears upon us; which makes our sleep uneasy; which preys upon our nerves, and slowly eats away our life.<p>According unto thy word - See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-9.htm">Psalm 119:9</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-25.htm">Psalm 119:25</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28-32.

The T&#1508;ra beneath the surface of its letter contains an abundance of such "wondrous things," into which only eyes from which God has removed the covering of natural short-sightedness penetrate; hence the prayer in <a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>.

In <a href="/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a> the lxx has probably caught the meaning of the poet better than the pointing has done, inasmuch as it draws &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a>, so that <a href="/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a> consists of two words, just like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>; and Kamphausen also follows this in his rendering.
