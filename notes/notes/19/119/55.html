He that by his Spirit works faith in us, will work for us. The word of God speaks comfort in affliction. If, through grace, it makes us holy, there is enough in it to make us easy, in all conditions. Let us be certain we have the Divine law for what we believe, and then let not scoffers prevail upon us to decline from it. God's judgments of old comfort and encourage us, for he is still the same. Sin is horrible in the eyes of all that are sanctified. Ere long the believer will be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. In the mean time, the statutes of the Lord supply subjects for grateful praise. In the season of affliction, and in the silent hours of the night, he remembers the name of the Lord, and is stirred up to keep the law. All who have made religion the first thing, will own that they have been unspeakable gainers by it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have remembered thy name, O Lord, in the night ... - I have thought on thee in the night, when on my bed; I have done it in the night of calamity and sorrow.

This is his comfort in his dejected condition, that God's promissory declaration has quickened him and proved its reviving power in his case.

In the remembrance of these, which determine the lot of a man according to the relation he holds towards them, the poet found comfort. It can be rendered: then I comforted myself; or according to a later usage of the Hithpa.: I was comforted.

God's statutes are here his "songs," which give him spiritual refreshing, sweeten the hardships of the pilgrimage, and measure and hasten his steps. The Name of God has been in his mind hitherto, not merely by day, but also by night; and in consequence of this he has kept God's law (&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, as five times besides in this Psalm, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>, and to be distinguished from &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/119-44.htm">Psalm 119:44</a>).

To others something else is allotted (<a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>), to him this one most needful thing. </body></html>
