And when the salvation of the saints is completed, it will plainly appear that it was not in vain to trust in God's word. We need to pray that we may never be afraid or ashamed to own God's truths and ways before men. And the psalmist resolves to keep God's law, in a constant course of obedience, without backsliding. The service of sin is slavery; the service of God is liberty. There is no full happiness, or perfect liberty, but in keeping God's law. We must never be ashamed or afraid to own our religion. The more delight we take in the service of God, the nearer we come to perfection. Not only consent to his law as good, but take pleasure in it as good for us. Let me put forth all the strength I have, to do it.

Arab. charu&#770;f, a lamb  equals  a plucker of leaves or grass), but will be able to answer him on the ground of his own experience. The verb &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, which in itself has many meanings, acquires the signification "to give an answer" through the word, &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, that is added (synon. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;). <a href="/psalms/119-43.htm">Psalm 119:43</a> also refers to the duty of confessing God. The meaning of the prayer is, that God may not suffer him to come to such a pass that he will be utterly unable to witness for the truth; for language dies away in the mouth of him who is unworthy of its before God. The writer has no fear of this for himself, for his hope is set towards God's judgments (&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1498;, defective plural, as also in <a href="/psalms/119-149.htm">Psalm 119:149</a>; in proof of which, compare <a href="/psalms/119-156.htm">Psalm 119:156</a> and <a href="/psalms/119-175.htm">Psalm 119:175</a>), his confidence takes its stand upon them. The futures which follow from <a href="/psalms/119-44.htm">Psalm 119:44</a> to <a href="/psalms/119-48.htm">Psalm 119:48</a> declare that what he would willingly do by the grace of God, and strives to do, is to walk &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1492;, in a broad space (elsewhere &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;), therefore unstraitened, which in this instance is not equivalent to happily, but courageously and unconstrainedly, without allowing myself to be intimidated, and said of inward freedom which makes itself known outwardly. In <a href="/psalms/119-46.htm">Psalm 119:46</a> the Vulgate renders: Et loquebar de (in) testimoniis tuis in conspectu regum et non confundebar - the motto of the Augsburg Confession, to which it was adapted especially in connection with this historical interpretation of the two verbs, which does not correspond to the original text. The lifting up of the hands in <a href="/psalms/119-48.htm">Psalm 119:48</a> is an expression of fervent longing desire, as in connection with prayer, <a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/134-2.htm">Psalm 134:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, and frequently. The second &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497; is open to the suspicion of being an inadvertent repetition. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; (synon. &#1489;&#1468; &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;) signifies a still or audible meditating that is absorbed in the object. </body></html>
