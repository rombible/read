He desired to know more of God in Christ; to know more of the doctrines of the word, and the duties of religion. He had a deep sense of unworthiness, and holy fear that his prayer should not come before God; Lord, what I pray for is, what thou hast promised. We have learned nothing to purpose, if we have not learned to praise God. We should always make the word of God the rule of our discourse, so as never to transgress it by sinful speaking, or sinful silence. His own hands are not sufficient, nor can any creature lend him help; therefore he looks up to God, that the hand that had made him may help him. He had made religion his deliberate choice. There is an eternal salvation all the saints long for, and therefore they pray that God would help their way to it. Let thy judgments help me; let all ordinances and all providences, (both are God's judgments,) further me in glorifying God; let them help me for that work. He often looks back with shame and gratitude to his lost estate. He still prays for the tender care of Him who purchased his flock with his own blood, that he may receive from him the gift of eternal life. Seek me, that is, Find me; for God never seeks in vain. Turn me, and I shall be turned. Let this psalm be a touchstone by which to try our hearts, and our lives. Do our hearts, cleansed in Christ's blood, make these prayers, resolutions and confessions our own? Is God's word the standard of our faith, and the law of our practice? Do we use it as pleas with Christ for what we need?

Princes persecute him without adequate cause, but his heart does not fear before them, but before God's words (the Ker likes the singular, as in <a href="/psalms/119-147.htm">Psalm 119:147</a>), to deny which would be to him the greatest possible evil. It is, however, a fear that is associated with heartfelt joy (<a href="/psalms/119-111.htm">Psalm 119:111</a>). It is the joy of a conflict that is rewarded by rich spoil (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>, <a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>).
