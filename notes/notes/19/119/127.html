Christ our Surety, having paid our debt and ransom, secures all the blessings of salvation to every true believer. The psalmist expects the word of God's righteousness, and no other salvation than what is secured by that word, which cannot fall to the ground. We deserve no favour form God; we are most easy when we cast ourselves upon God's mercy, and refer ourselves to it. If any man resolve to do God's will as his servant, he shall be made to know his testimonies. We must do what we can for the support of religion, and, after all, must beg of God to take the work into his own hands. It is hypocrisy to say we love God's commandments more than our worldly interests. The way of sin is a false way, being directly contrary to God's precepts, which are right: those that love and esteem God's law, hate sin, and will not be reconciled to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore I love thy commandments ... - The more people break them <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-126.htm">Psalm 119:126</a>, the more I see their value; the more precious they are to me.

In the present time of apostasy and persecution he keeps all the more strictly to the direction of the divine word, and commends himself to the protection and teaching of God. In the consciousness of his godly behaviour (elsewhere always &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, here in one instance &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; &#1493;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;) the poet hopes that God will surely not (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;) leave him to the arbitrary disposal of his oppressors. This hope does not, however, raise him above the necessity and duty of constant prayer that Jahve would place Himself between him and his enemies. &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; seq. acc. signifies to stand in any one's place as furnishing a guarantee, and in general as a mediator, <a href="/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>; &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; similar to &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/86-17.htm">Psalm 86:17</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a> : in my behalf, for my real advantage. The expression of longing after redemption in <a href="/psalms/119-123.htm">Psalm 119:123</a> sounds like <a href="/psalms/119-81.htm">Psalm 119:81</a>. "The word of Thy righteousness" is the promise which proceeds from God's "righteousness," and as surely as He is "righteous" cannot remain unfulfilled. The one chief petition of the poet, however, to which he comes back in <a href="/psalms/119-124.htm">Psalm 119:124</a>., has reference to the ever deeper knowledge of the word of God; for this knowledge is in itself at once life and blessedness, and the present calls most urgently for it. For the great multitude (which is the subject to &#1492;&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;) practically and fundamentally break God's law; it is therefore time to act for Jahve (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/29-20.htm">Ezekiel 29:20</a>), and just in order to this there is need of well-grounded, reliable knowledge. Therefore the poet attaches himself with all his love to God's commandments; to him they are above gold and fine gold (<a href="/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>), which he might perhaps gain by a disavowal of them. Therefore he is as strict as he possibly can be with God's word, inasmuch as he acknowledges and observes all precepts of all things (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;), i.e., all divine precepts, let them have reference to whatsoever they will, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, right (&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;, to declare both in avowal and deed to be right); and every false (lying) tendency, all pseudo-Judaism, he hates. It is true <a href="/psalms/119-126.htm">Psalm 119:126</a> may be also explained: it is time that Jahve should act, i.e., interpose judicially; but this thought is foreign to the context, and affords no equally close union for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;; moreover it ought then to have been accented &#1506;&#1514; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;.
