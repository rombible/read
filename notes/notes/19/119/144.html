The promises are faithfully performed by Him that made them. Zeal against sin should constrain us to do what we can against it, at least to do more in religion ourselves. Our love to the word of God is evidence of our love to God, because it is designed to make us partake his holiness. Men's real excellency always makes them low in their own eyes. When we are small and despised, we have the more need to remember God's precepts, that we may have them to support us. The law of God is the truth, the standard of holiness, the rule of happiness; but the obedience of Christ alone justifies the believer. Sorrows are often the lot of saints in this vale of tears; they are in heaviness through manifold temptations. There are delights in the word of God, which the saints often most sweetly enjoy when in trouble and anguish. This is life eternal, to know God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent, Joh 17:3. May we live the life of faith and grace here, and be removed to the life of glory hereafter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The righteousness of thy testimonies - The principles of righteousness on which they are founded.

God rules righteously and faithfully according to His word, for which the poet is accordingly zealous, although young and despised. The predicate &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; in <a href="/psalms/119-137.htm">Psalm 119:137</a> precedes its subject &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498; (God's decisions in word and in deed) in the primary form (after the model of the verbal clause <a href="/psalms/124-5.htm">Psalm 124:5</a>), just as in German [and English] the predicative adjective remains undeclined. The accusatives &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; and &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/119-138.htm">Psalm 119:138</a> are not predicative (Hitzig), to which the former ("as righteousness") - not the latter however - is not suited, but adverbial accusatives (in righteousness, in faithfulness), and &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; according to its position is subordinate to &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; as a virtual adjective (cf. <a href="/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>): the requirements of the revealed law proceed from a disposition towards and mode of dealing with men which is strictly determined by His holiness (&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;), and beyond measure faithfully and honestly designs the well-being of men (&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;). To see this good law of God despised by his persecutors stirs the poet up with a zeal, which brings him, from their side, to the brink of extreme destruction (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-10.htm">Psalm 69:10</a>, cf. &#1510;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="/psalms/88-17.htm">Psalm 88:17</a>). God's own utterance is indeed without spot, and therefore not to be carped at; it is pure, fire-proved, noblest metal (<a href="/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/12-7.htm">Psalm 12:7</a>), therefore he loves it, and does not, though young (lxx &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, Vulgate adolescentulus) and lightly esteemed, care for the remonstrances of his proud opponents who are old and more learned than himself (the organization of <a href="/psalms/119-141.htm">Psalm 119:141</a> is like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-95.htm">Psalm 119:95</a>, and frequently). The righteousness (&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;) of the God of revelation becomes eternal righteousness (&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;), and His law remains eternal truth (&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;). &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; is here the name of the attribute and of the action that is conditioned in accordance with it; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; the name of the state that thoroughly accords with the idea of that which is right. So too in <a href="/psalms/119-144.htm">Psalm 119:144</a> : &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; are Jahve's testimonies for ever, so that all creatures must give glory to their harmony with that which is absolutely right. To look ever deeper and deeper into this their perfection is the growing life of the spirit. The poet prays for this vivifying insight. </body></html>
