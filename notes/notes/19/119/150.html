Whither should the child go but to his father? Save me from my sins, my corruptions, my temptations, all the hinderances in my way, that I may keep thy testimonies. Christians who enjoy health, should not suffer the early hours of the morning to glide away unimproved. Hope in God's word encourages us to continue in prayer. It is better to take time from sleep, than not to find time for prayer. We have access to God at all hours; and if our first thoughts in the morning are of God, they will help to keep us in his fear all the day long. Make me lively and cheerful. God knows what we need and what is good for us, and will quicken us. If we are employed in God's service, we need not fear those who try to set themselves as far as they can out of the reach of the convictions and commands of his law. When trouble is near, God is near. He is never far to seek. All his commandments are truth. And God's promises will be performed.

God rules righteously and faithfully according to His word, for which the poet is accordingly zealous, although young and despised. The predicate &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; in <a href="/psalms/119-137.htm">Psalm 119:137</a> precedes its subject &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498; (God's decisions in word and in deed) in the primary form (after the model of the verbal clause <a href="/psalms/124-5.htm">Psalm 124:5</a>), just as in German [and English] the predicative adjective remains undeclined. The accusatives &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; and &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/119-138.htm">Psalm 119:138</a> are not predicative (Hitzig), to which the former ("as righteousness") - not the latter however - is not suited, but adverbial accusatives (in righteousness, in faithfulness), and &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; according to its position is subordinate to &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; as a virtual adjective (cf. <a href="/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>): the requirements of the revealed law proceed from a disposition towards and mode of dealing with men which is strictly determined by His holiness (&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;), and beyond measure faithfully and honestly designs the well-being of men (&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;). To see this good law of God despised by his persecutors stirs the poet up with a zeal, which brings him, from their side, to the brink of extreme destruction (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-10.htm">Psalm 69:10</a>, cf. &#1510;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="/psalms/88-17.htm">Psalm 88:17</a>). God's own utterance is indeed without spot, and therefore not to be carped at; it is pure, fire-proved, noblest metal (<a href="/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/12-7.htm">Psalm 12:7</a>), therefore he loves it, and does not, though young (lxx &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, Vulgate adolescentulus) and lightly esteemed, care for the remonstrances of his proud opponents who are old and more learned than himself (the organization of <a href="/psalms/119-141.htm">Psalm 119:141</a> is like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-95.htm">Psalm 119:95</a>, and frequently). The righteousness (&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;) of the God of revelation becomes eternal righteousness (&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;), and His law remains eternal truth (&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;). &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; is here the name of the attribute and of the action that is conditioned in accordance with it; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; the name of the state that thoroughly accords with the idea of that which is right. So too in <a href="/psalms/119-144.htm">Psalm 119:144</a> : &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; are Jahve's testimonies for ever, so that all creatures must give glory to their harmony with that which is absolutely right. To look ever deeper and deeper into this their perfection is the growing life of the spirit. The poet prays for this vivifying insight. </body></html>
