Christ our Surety, having paid our debt and ransom, secures all the blessings of salvation to every true believer. The psalmist expects the word of God's righteousness, and no other salvation than what is secured by that word, which cannot fall to the ground. We deserve no favour form God; we are most easy when we cast ourselves upon God's mercy, and refer ourselves to it. If any man resolve to do God's will as his servant, he shall be made to know his testimonies. We must do what we can for the support of religion, and, after all, must beg of God to take the work into his own hands. It is hypocrisy to say we love God's commandments more than our worldly interests. The way of sin is a false way, being directly contrary to God's precepts, which are right: those that love and esteem God's law, hate sin, and will not be reconciled to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy - Not according to justice - for, sinners as we are, we can never urge that as a plea before God. No man who knows himself could ask of God to deal with him according to the strict and stern principles of justice.

His hope rests on God's word, without allowing itself to be led astray by doubters and apostates. &#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; (the form of nouns which indicate defects or failings) are those inwardly divided, halting between two opinions (&#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;),    <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, who do homage partly to the worship of Jahve, partly to heathenism, and therefore are trying to combine faith and naturalism. In contrast to such, the poet's love, faith, and hope are devoted entirely to the God of revelation; and to all those who are desirous of drawing him away he addresses in <a href="/psalms/119-115.htm">Psalm 119:115</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/6-9.htm">Psalm 6:9</a>) an indignant "depart." He, however, stands in need of grace in order to persevere and to conquer. For this he prays in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-116.htm">Psalm 119:116-117</a>. The &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; is the same as in &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1503;. The ah of &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492; is the intentional ah (Ew. 228, c), as in <a href="/isaiah/41-23.htm">Isaiah 41:23</a>. The statement of the ground of the &#1505;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514;, vilipendis, does not mean: unsuccessful is their deceit (Hengstenberg, Olshausen), but falsehood without the consistency of truth is their self-deceptive and seductive tendency. The lxx and Syriac read &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501;, "their sentiment;" but this is an Aramaic word that is unintelligible in Hebrew, which the old translators have conjured into the text only on account of an apparent tautology. The reading &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468; or &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468; (Aquila, Symmachus, and Jerome; lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, therefore &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;) instead of &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468; might more readily be justified in <a href="/psalms/119-119.htm">Psalm 119:119</a>; but the former gives too narrow a meaning, and the reading rests on a mistaking of the construction of &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; with an accusative of the object and of the effect: all the wicked, as many of them as are on the earth, dost Thou put away as dross (&#1505;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501;( ssor). Accordingly &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="/psalms/119-120.htm">Psalm 119:120</a> are God's punitive judgments, or rather (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-91.htm">Psalm 119:91</a>) God's laws (judgments) according to which He judges. What is meant are sentences of punishment, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. Of these the poet is afraid, for omnipotence can change words into deeds forthwith. In fear of the God who has attested Himself in <a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a> and elsewhere, his skin shudders and his hair stands on end. </body></html>
