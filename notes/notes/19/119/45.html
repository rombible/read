And when the salvation of the saints is completed, it will plainly appear that it was not in vain to trust in God's word. We need to pray that we may never be afraid or ashamed to own God's truths and ways before men. And the psalmist resolves to keep God's law, in a constant course of obedience, without backsliding. The service of sin is slavery; the service of God is liberty. There is no full happiness, or perfect liberty, but in keeping God's law. We must never be ashamed or afraid to own our religion. The more delight we take in the service of God, the nearer we come to perfection. Not only consent to his law as good, but take pleasure in it as good for us. Let me put forth all the strength I have, to do it.

Luther renders it, "freely." The Septuagint, "in a broad place." The Hebrew word means "wide, broad, large, spacious." The reference is to that which is free and open; that in which there are no limits, checks, restraints; where a man does what he pleases. The meaning here is, that he would feel he was free. He would not be restrained by evil passions and corrupt desires. He would be delivered from those things which seemed to fetter his goings. This does not here refer so much to external troubles or hindrances, to being oppressed and straitened by external foes, as to internal enemies - to the servitude of sin - to the slavery of appetite and passion.

In the petition "give me understanding" (which occurs six times in this Psalm) &#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; is causative, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>, and frequently in the post-exilic writings. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; (from &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, abscindere, as &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; accords in sound with &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) signifies gain and acquisition by means of the damage which one does to his neighbour by depreciating his property, by robbery, deceit, and extortion (<a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>), and as a name of a vice, covetousness, and in general selfishness. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; is that which is without real, i.e., without divine, contents or intrinsic worth, - God-opposed teaching and life. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1498;<p>(Note: Heidenheim and Baer erroneously have &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1498; with Jod. plural., contrary to the Masora.)<p>is a defective plural; cf. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1498;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-41.htm">Psalm 119:41</a>, &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1498;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-43.htm">Psalm 119:43</a>, and frequently.

The reproach which the poet fears in <a href="/psalms/119-39.htm">Psalm 119:39</a> is not the reproach of confessing, but of denying God. Accordingly &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498; are not God's judgments i.e., acts of judgment, but revealed decisions or judgments: these are good, inasmuch as it is well with him who keeps them. He can appeal before God to the fact that he is set upon the knowledge and experience of these with longing of heart; and he bases his request upon the fact that God by virtue of His righteousness, i.e., the stringency with which He maintains His order of grace, both as to its promises and its duties, would quicken him, who is at present as it were dead with sorrow and weariness. </body></html>
