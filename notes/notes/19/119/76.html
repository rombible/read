We ought, therefore, continually to beseech him, by his Holy Spirit, to give us understanding. The comforts some have in God, should be matter of joy to others. But it is easy to own, that God's judgments are right, until it comes to be our own case. All supports under affliction must come from mercy and compassion. The mercies of God are tender mercies; the mercies of a father, the compassion of a mother to her son. They come to us when we are not able to go to them. Causeless reproach does not hurt, and should not move us. The psalmist could go on in the way of his duty, and find comfort in it. He valued the good will of saints, and was desirous to keep up his communion with them. Soundness of heart signifies sincerity in dependence on God, and devotedness to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort - Margin, as in Hebrew, "to comfort me." The word rendered merciful-kindness means mercy, favor, grace, kindness; and the idea is, that all his consolation - all that he expected or desired - must be derived from mere favor; from the goodness of God. He had no source of comfort in himself, and he had no claim on God for comfort.

The good word of the gracious God is the fountain of all good; and it is learned in the way of lowliness. He reviews his life, and sees in everything that has befallen him the good and well-meaning appointment of the God of salvation in accordance with the plan and order of salvation of His word. The form &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498;, which is the form out of pause, is retained in <a href="/psalms/119-65.htm">Psalm 119:65</a> beside Athnach, although not preceded by Olewejored (cf. <a href="/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-11.htm">Psalm 48:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-21.htm">Proverbs 30:21</a>). Clinging believingly to the commandments of God, he is able confidently to pray that He would teach him "good discernment" and "knowledge." &#1496;&#1506;&#1501; is ethically the capacity of distinguishing between good and evil, and of discovering the latter as it were by touch; &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1496;&#1506;&#1501;, good discernment, is a coupling of words like &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1500;&#1489;, a happy disposition, cheerfulness. God has brought him into this relationship to His word by humbling him, and thus setting him right out of his having gone astray. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-67.htm">Psalm 119:67</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, is not God's utterance conveying a promise, but imposing a duty. God is called &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; as He who is graciously disposed towards man, and &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489; as He who acts out this disposition; this loving and gracious God he implores to become his Teacher. In his fidelity to God's word he does not allow himself to be led astray by any of the lies which the proud try to impose upon him (Bttcher), or better absolutely (cf. <a href="/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>): to patch together over him, making the true nature unrecognisable as it were by means of false plaster or whitewash (&#1496;&#1508;&#1500;, to smear over, bedaub, as the Targumic, Talmudic, and Syriac show). If the heart of these men, who by slander make him into a caricature of himself, is covered as it were with thick fat (a figure of insensibility and obduracy, <a href="/psalms/17-10.htm">Psalm 17:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-7.htm">Psalm 73:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>, lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, Aquila &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;) against all the impressions of the word of God, he, on the other hand, has his delight in the law of God (&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; with an accusative of the object, not of that which is delighted, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-19.htm">Psalm 94:19</a>, but of that which delights). How beneficial has the school of affliction through which he has attained to this, been to him! The word proceeding from the mouth of God is now more precious to him than the greatest earthly riches. </body></html>
