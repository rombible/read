Many have knowledge, but little judgment; those who have both, are fortified against the snares of Satan, and furnished for the service of God. We are most apt to wander from God, when we are easy in the world. We should leave our concerns to the disposal of God, seeing we know not what is good for us. Lord, thou art our bountiful Benefactor; incline our hearts to faith and obedience. The psalmist will go on in his duty with constancy and resolution. The proud are full of the world, and its wealth and pleasures; these make them senseless, secure, and stupid. God visits his people with affliction, that they may learn his statutes. Not only God's promises, but even his law, his percepts, though hard to ungodly men, are desirable, and profitable, because they lead us with safety and delight unto eternal life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their heart is as fat as grease - They are prospered.

According to <a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>, the words &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1497; &#1492; belong together. <a href="/psalms/119-57.htm">Psalm 119:57</a> is an inference drawn from it (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/2-14.htm">Exodus 2:14</a>, and frequently), and the existing division of the verse is verified. &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13</a>, is an expression of caressing, flattering entreaty; in Latin, caput mulcere (demulcere). His turning to the word of God the poet describes in <a href="/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59</a> as a result of a careful trying of his actions. After that he quickly and cheerfully, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>, determined to keep it without any long deliberation with flesh and blood, although the snares of wicked men surround him. The meaning of &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497; is determined according to <a href="/psalms/119-110.htm">Psalm 119:110</a> : the pointing does not distinguish so sharply as one might have expected between &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, and &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, snares, bonds (vid., <a href="/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>.); but the plural nowhere, according to the usage of the language as we now have it, signifies bands (companies), from the singular in <a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a> (Bttcher, 800). Thankfulness urges him to get up at midnight (acc. temp. as in <a href="/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a>) to prostrate himself before God and to pray. Accordingly he is on friendly terms with, he is closely connected with (<a href="/proverbs/28-24.htm">Proverbs 28:24</a>), all who fear God. Out of the fulness of the loving-kindness of God, which is nowhere unattested upon earth (<a href="/psalms/119-64.htm">Psalm 119:64</a>  equals  <a href="/psalms/33-5.htm">Psalm 33:5</a>), he implores for himself the inward teaching concerning His word as the highest and most cherished of mercies. </body></html>
