Hope deferred made him faint; his eyes failed by looking out for this expected salvation. But when the eyes fail, yet faith must not. His affliction was great. He was become like a leathern bottle, which, if hung up in the smoke, is dried and shrivelled up. We must ever be mindful of God's statutes. The days of the believer's mourning shall be ended; they are but for a moment, compared with eternal happiness. His enemies used craft as well as power for his ruin, in contempt of the law of God. The commandments of God are true and faithful guides in the path of peace and safety. We may best expect help from God when, like our Master, we do well and suffer for it. Wicked men may almost consume the believer upon earth, but he would sooner forsake all than forsake the word of the Lord. We should depend upon the grace of God for strength to do every good work. The surest token of God's good-will toward us, is his good work in us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mine eyes fail for thy word - The same word in Hebrew as in the previous verse and in <a href="/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>. The idea here is that of looking out for a thing - of "straining the eyes" - so that their power becomes exhausted. The language expresses a longing desire - a waiting - an intense wish - for a thing, as when we look for a ship long expected, or for a friend long absent, or for help when in danger. Such a desire the psalmist had for the word of God, for divine truth.<p>Saying, When wilt thou comfort me? - How long shall I be compelled to wait for comfort? How often in the Psalms do the expressions occur, "When," and "How long!" How often in the life of the believer now are similar expressions appropriate! God often seems greatly to try the faith and patience of his people by mere delay; and the strength of faith and the power of religion are shown in such circumstances by persevering faith in the divine promises, even when there seems to be no evidence that he will interpose. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>82.

Either with looking for the Messiah, the essential Word, that was to be, and afterwards was made flesh, and dwelt among men; or for the fulfilment of the word of promise, on which he was made to hope; but that being deferred; and he believing in hope against hope, and looking out continually till it was accomplished, his eyes grew weary, and failed him, and he was just ready to give up all expectation of it; see <a href="/psalms/77-8.htm">Psalm 77:8</a>; <p>saying, when wilt thou comfort me? The people of God are sometimes very disconsolate, and need comforting, through the prevalence of sin, the power of Satan's temptations, the hidings of God's face, and a variety of afflictions; when they apply to God for comfort, who only can comfort them, and who has his set times to do it; but they are apt to think it long, and inquire, as David here, when it will be. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">82</span>. <span class="ital">saying</span>] R.V. while I say.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 82.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mine eyes fail for thy Word</span>.

God humbles, but He also exalts again according to His word; for this the poet prays in order that he may be a consolatory example to the God-fearing, to the confusion of his enemies. It is impossible that God should forsake man, who is His creature, and deny to him that which makes him truly happy, viz., the understanding and knowledge of His word. For this spiritual gift the poet prays in <a href="/psalms/119-73.htm">Psalm 119:73</a> (cf. on 73a, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>; <a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>; <a href="/job/31-15.htm">Job 31:15</a>); and he wishes in <a href="/psalms/119-74.htm">Psalm 119:74</a> that all who fear God may see in him with joy an example of the way in which trust in the word of God is rewarded (cf. <a href="/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-27.htm">Psalm 35:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-33.htm">Psalm 69:33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-42.htm">Psalm 107:42</a>, and other passages). He knows that God's acts of judgment are pure righteousness, i.e., regulated by God's holiness, out of which they spring, and by the salvation of men, at which they aim; and he knows that God has humbled him &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; (accus. adverb. for &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;), being faithful in His intentions towards him; for it is just in the school of affliction that one first learns rightly to estimate the worth of His word, and comes to feel its power. But trouble, though sweetened by an insight into God's salutary design, is nevertheless always bitter; hence the well-justified prayer of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-76.htm">Psalm 119:76</a>, that God's mercy may notwithstanding be bestowed upon him for his consolation, in accordance with the promise which is become his (&#1500; as in <a href="/psalms/119-49.htm">Psalm 119:49</a>), His servant's. &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-78.htm">Psalm 119:78</a>, instead of being construed with the accusative of the right, or of the cause, that is perverted, is construed with the accusative of the person upon whom such perversion of right, such oppression by means of misrepresentation, is inflicted, as in <a href="/job/19-6.htm">Job 19:6</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-36.htm">Lamentations 3:36</a>.

If instead of &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; (which is favoured by <a href="/psalms/119-63.htm">Psalm 119:63</a>), we read according to the Chethb &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-125.htm">Psalm 119:125</a>), then what is meant by &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; is a turning towards him for the purpose of learning: may their knowledge be enriched from his experience.
