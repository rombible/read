The promises are faithfully performed by Him that made them. Zeal against sin should constrain us to do what we can against it, at least to do more in religion ourselves. Our love to the word of God is evidence of our love to God, because it is designed to make us partake his holiness. Men's real excellency always makes them low in their own eyes. When we are small and despised, we have the more need to remember God's precepts, that we may have them to support us. The law of God is the truth, the standard of holiness, the rule of happiness; but the obedience of Christ alone justifies the believer. Sorrows are often the lot of saints in this vale of tears; they are in heaviness through manifold temptations. There are delights in the word of God, which the saints often most sweetly enjoy when in trouble and anguish. This is life eternal, to know God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent, Joh 17:3.

The initial letter with which every verse commences sounds like the Hebrew word for righteousness: our keynote is righteousness.<p><a href="/psalms/119-137.htm">Psalm 119:137</a><p>"Righteous art thou, O Lord." The Psalmist has not often used the name of Jehovah in this vast composition. The whole Psalm shows him to have been a deeply religious man, thoroughly familiar with the things of God; and such persons never use the holy name of God carelessly, nor do they even use it at all frequently in comparison with the thoughtless and the ungodly. Familiarity begets reverence in this case. Here he uses the sacred name in worship. He praises God by ascribing to him perfect righteousness. God is always right, and he is always actively right, that is, righteous. This quality is bound up in our very idea of God. We cannot imagine an unrighteous God. "And upright are thy judgments." Here he extols God's word, or recorded judgments, as being right, even as their Author is righteous. That which comes from the righteous God is itself righteous. Jehovah both saith and doth that which is right, and that alone. This is a great stay to the soul in time of trouble. When we are most sorely afflicted, and cannot see the reason for the dispensation, we may fall back upon this most sure and certain fact, that God is righteous, and his dealings with us are righteous too. It should be our glory to sing this brave confession when all things around us appear to suggest the contrary. This is the richest adoration - this which rises from the lips of faith when carnal reason utters about undue severity, and the like.<p><a href="/psalms/119-138.htm">Psalm 119:138</a><p>"Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful." All that which God hath testified in his word is right and truthful. It is righteous, and may be relied upon for the present; it is faithful, and may be trusted in for the future. About every portion of the inspired testimonies there is a divine authority, they are issued and published by God's command, and they bear the impress of the royal style which carries omnipotence about it. Not only the precepts but the promises also are commanded of the Lord, and so are all the teachings of Scripture. It is not left to our choice whether we will accept them or no; they are issued by royal command, and are not to be questioned. Their characteristic is that they are like the Lord who has proclaimed them, they are the essence of justice and the soul of truth. God's word is righteous and cannot be impeached; it is faithful and cannot be questioned; it is true from the beginning, and it will be true unto the end.<p>Dwell upon that sweet word - "very faithful." What a mercy that we have a God to deal with who is scrupulously faithful, true to all the items and details of his promises, punctual to time, steadfast during all time. Well may we risk all upon a word which is "ever faithful, ever sure."<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div><span class="bld">TZADDI</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ver. 137. <span class="bld">Righteous art thou, </span> by thine essence and nature, and therefore it is impossible that thou shouldst be unjust in any of thy laws or providences. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/119.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>TZADDI.--The Eighteenth Part. <p>TZADDI.

The deeper his depression of spirit concerning those who despise the word of God, the more ardently does he yearn after the light and food of that word. The testimonies of God are &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, wonderful and strange (paradoxical) things, exalted above every-day life and the common understanding. In this connection of the thoughts &#1504;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1501; is not intended of careful observance, but of attentive contemplation that is prolonged until a clear penetrating understanding of the matter is attained. The opening, disclosure (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, apertio, with Tsere in distinction from &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, porta) of God's word giveth light, inasmuch as it makes the simple (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>) wise or sagacious; in connection with which it is assumed that it is God Himself who unfolds the mysteries of His word to those who are anxious to learn. Such an one, anxious to learn, is the poet: he pants with open mouth, viz., for the heavenly fare of such disclosures (&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; like &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/29-23.htm">Job 29:23</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/81-11.htm">Psalm 81:11</a>). &#1497;&#1488;&#1489; is a hapaxlegomenon, just as &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; is also exclusively peculiar to the Psalm before us; both are secondary forms of &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;. Love to God cannot indeed remain unresponded to. The experience of helping grace is a right belonging to those who love the God of revelation; love in return for love, salvation in return for the longing for salvation, is their prerogative. On the ground of this reciprocal relation the petitions in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-133.htm">Psalm 119:133-135</a> are then put up, coming back at last to the one chief prayer "teach me." &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-133.htm">Psalm 119:133</a>, is not merely a "promise" in this instance, but the declared will of God in general. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; refers pre-eminently to all sin of disavowal (denying God), into which he might fall under outward and inward pressure (&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;). For he has round about him those who do not keep God's law. On account of these apostates (&#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, equivalent to &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;) his eyes run down rivers of water (&#1497;&#1512;&#1491; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-48.htm">Lamentations 3:48</a>, with an accusative of the object). His mood is not that of unfeeling self-glorying, but of sorrow like that of Jeremiah, because of the contempt of Jahve, and the self-destruction of those who contemn Him. </body></html>
