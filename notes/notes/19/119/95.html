And the engagements of God's covenant are established more firmly than the earth itself. All the creatures answer the ends of their creation: shall man, who alone is endued with reason, be the only unprofitable burden of the earth? We may make the Bible a pleasant companion at any time. But the word, without the grace of God, would not quicken us. See the best help for bad memories, namely, good affections; and though the exact words be lost, if the meaning remain, that is well. I am thine, not my own, not the world's; save me from sin, save me from ruin. The Lord will keep the man in peace, whose mind is stayed on him. It is poor perfection which one sees and end of. Such are all things in this world, which pass for perfections. The glory of man is but as the flower of the grass. The psalmist had seen the fulness of the word of God, and its sufficiency. The word of the Lord reaches to all cases, to all times. It will take us from all confidence in man, or in our own wisdom, strength, and righteousness. Thus shall we seek comfort and happiness from Christ alone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wicked have waited for me to destroy me - That is, they have lain in wait; or, they have laid a plan.

The bounds of created perfection may be defined, but those of God's law in its nature, application, and influence, are infinite. There is no human thing so perfect but that something is wanting to it; its limits are narrow, whereas God's law is of infinite breadth, reaching to all cases, perfectly meeting what each requires, and to all times (Ps 19:3, 6, 7-11; Ec 3:11). It cannot be cramped within any definitions of man's dogmatical systems. Man never outgrows the Word. It does not shock the ignorant man with declared anticipations of discoveries which he had not yet made; while in it the man of science finds his newest discoveries by tacit anticipations provided for.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As my best comforters, and counsellors, and defenders against all the assaults and designs of mine enemies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/119.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The wicked have waited for me to destroy me,.... This is another reason why he desires the Lord would save him; because wicked men, such who feared not God, nor regarded men, sons of Belial; such as Saul's courtiers and the conspirators with Absalom were, had laid wait and were waiting an opportunity, and were hoping and expecting to have one, that they might take away his life; destroy him out of the world, as Kimchi; or eternally, as Aben Ezra thinks; by endeavouring to draw him out of the right ways of religion and godliness, into the ways of sin and wickedness, and so ruin him for ever; <p>but I will consider thy testimonies; the word of God, which testified of his power and providence, employed in the protection of his people, and so an encouragement to put trust and confidence in him; and of his mind and will, with respect to the way in which he should walk; and so making these his counsellors, as he did, <a href="/psalms/119-24.htm">Psalm 119:24</a>; and well weighing and considering in his mind what they dictated to him, he was preserved from the attempts of his enemies to destroy him, either temporally or spiritually. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 95.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wicked have waited for me to destroy me</span>; or, "laid in wait for me" (comp. <a href="/psalms/56-6.htm">Psalm 56:6</a>, where the same verb is used). <span class="cmt_word">But I will consider thy testimonies</span> I will look to thy word of promise, and so sustain their assaults upon me. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/119.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The eightfold Lamed. Eternal and imperishable in the constant verifying of itself is the vigorous and consolatory word of God, to which the poet will ever cling. It has heaven as its standing-place, and therefore it also has the qualities of heaven, and before all others, heaven-like stability. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a> (<a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>) uses similar language in reference to God's faithfulness, of which here <a href="/psalms/119-90.htm">Psalm 119:90</a> says that it endureth into all generations. The earth hath He creatively set up, and it standeth, viz., as a practical proof and as a scene of His infinite, unchangeable faithfulness. Heaven and earth are not the subjects of <a href="/psalms/119-91.htm">Psalm 119:91</a> (Hupfeld), for only the earth is previously mentioned; the reference to the heavens in <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a> is of a very different character. Hitzig and others see the subject in &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498;: with respect to Thy judgments, they stand fast unto this day; but the &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; which follows requires another meaning to be assigned to &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;: either of taking up one's place ready for service, or, since &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; is a current phrase in <a href="/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-6.htm">Joshua 20:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-24.htm">Ezekiel 44:24</a>, of placing one's self ready to obey (Bttcher). The subject of &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, as the following &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; shows, is meant to be thought of in the most general sense (cf. <a href="/job/38-14.htm">Job 38:14</a>): all beings are God's servants (subjects), and have accordingly to be obedient and humble before His judicial decisions - &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, "even to this day," the poet adds, for these judicial decisions are those which are formulated beforehand in the Tra. Joy in this ever sure, all-conditioning word has upheld the poet in his affliction, <a href="/psalms/119-92.htm">Psalm 119:92</a>. He who has been persecuted and cast down as it were to death, owes his reviving to it, <a href="/psalms/119-93.htm">Psalm 119:93</a>.

He knows from experience that all (earthly) perfection (&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;) has an end (inasmuch as, having reached its height, it changes into its opposite); God's commandment (singular as in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-22.htm">Deuteronomy 11:22</a>), on the contrary, is exceeding broad (cf. <a href="/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a>), unlimited in its duration and verification. </body></html>
