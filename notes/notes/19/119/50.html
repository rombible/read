He that by his Spirit works faith in us, will work for us. The word of God speaks comfort in affliction. If, through grace, it makes us holy, there is enough in it to make us easy, in all conditions. Let us be certain we have the Divine law for what we believe, and then let not scoffers prevail upon us to decline from it. God's judgments of old comfort and encourage us, for he is still the same. Sin is horrible in the eyes of all that are sanctified. Ere long the believer will be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. In the mean time, the statutes of the Lord supply subjects for grateful praise. In the season of affliction, and in the silent hours of the night, he remembers the name of the Lord, and is stirred up to keep the law.

The word here rendered "comfort" occurs only here and in <a href="/job/6-10.htm">Job 6:10</a>. The obvious meaning is, that his only consolation in his affliction was derived from the word of God; the word which had caused him to hope, and the word by which he had been quickened or made alive. The particular design of this is to show the value of the word of God as a source of comfort in trouble.<p>For thy word hath quickened me - Has made me alive; or, caused me to live. That is, the word, the truth of God, had been the instrument of calling him from the death of sin, and of imparting to him new life, or had been the means of his regeneration. Compare <a href="/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>. As it was by this "word" that he had been made alive, so his only comfort was in that word, and it was to him a just ground of consolation that God had brought him from the death of sin, and had imparted to him spiritual life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>50. for&#8212;rather, "This is my comfort &#8230; that," &c.

David had his afflictions, and so has every good man; none are without; it is the will and pleasure of God that so it should be; and many are their afflictions, inward and outward: the word of God is often their comfort under them, the written word, heard or read; and especially a word of promise, powerfully applied: this is putting underneath everlasting arms, and making their bed in sickness. This either respects what goes before, concerning the word of promise hoped in, or what follows: <p>for thy word hath quickened me; not only had been the means of quickening him when dead in am, as it often is the means of quickening dead sinners, being the savour of life unto life; but of reviving his drooping spirits, when in affliction and distress; and of quickening the graces of the Spirit of God in him, and him to the exercise of them, when they seemed ready to die; and to the fervent and diligent discharge of duty, when listless and backward to it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">50</span>. <span class="ital">This</span>] i.e. Thy word, if the rendering <span class="ital">for</span> is retained in the next line.

Arab. charu&#770;f, a lamb  equals  a plucker of leaves or grass), but will be able to answer him on the ground of his own experience. The verb &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, which in itself has many meanings, acquires the signification "to give an answer" through the word, &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, that is added (synon. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;). <a href="/psalms/119-43.htm">Psalm 119:43</a> also refers to the duty of confessing God. The meaning of the prayer is, that God may not suffer him to come to such a pass that he will be utterly unable to witness for the truth; for language dies away in the mouth of him who is unworthy of its before God. The writer has no fear of this for himself, for his hope is set towards God's judgments (&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1498;, defective plural, as also in <a href="/psalms/119-149.htm">Psalm 119:149</a>; in proof of which, compare <a href="/psalms/119-156.htm">Psalm 119:156</a> and <a href="/psalms/119-175.htm">Psalm 119:175</a>), his confidence takes its stand upon them. The futures which follow from <a href="/psalms/119-44.htm">Psalm 119:44</a> to <a href="/psalms/119-48.htm">Psalm 119:48</a> declare that what he would willingly do by the grace of God, and strives to do, is to walk &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1492;, in a broad space (elsewhere &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;), therefore unstraitened, which in this instance is not equivalent to happily, but courageously and unconstrainedly, without allowing myself to be intimidated, and said of inward freedom which makes itself known outwardly. In <a href="/psalms/119-46.htm">Psalm 119:46</a> the Vulgate renders: Et loquebar de (in) testimoniis tuis in conspectu regum et non confundebar - the motto of the Augsburg Confession, to which it was adapted especially in connection with this historical interpretation of the two verbs, which does not correspond to the original text. The lifting up of the hands in <a href="/psalms/119-48.htm">Psalm 119:48</a> is an expression of fervent longing desire, as in connection with prayer, <a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/134-2.htm">Psalm 134:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, and frequently.
