The Scriptures show us what we were, what we are, and what we shall be. They show us the mercy and the justice of the Lord, the joys of heaven, and the pains of hell. Thus they give to the simple, in a few days, understanding of those matters, which philosophers for ages sought in vain. The believer, wearied with the cares of life and his conflicts with sin, pants for the consolations conveyed to him by means of the sacred word. And every one may pray, Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. We must beg that the Holy Spirit would order our steps. The dominion of sin is to be dreaded and prayed against by every one. The oppression of men is often more than flesh and blood can bear; and He who knoweth our frame, will not refuse to remove it in answer to the prayers of his people. Whatever obscurity may appear as to the faith of the Old Testament believers, their confidence at the throne of grace can only be explained by their having obtained more distinct views of gospel privileges, through the sacrifices and services of their law, than is generally imagined. Go to the same place, plead the name and merits of Jesus, and you will not, you cannot plead in vain. Commonly, where there is a gracious heart, there is a weeping eye. Accept, O Lord, the tears our blessed Redeemer shed in the days of his flesh, for us who should weep for our brethren or ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Look thou upon me - Turn not away from me.

The word seems here to be used in the sense of "right;" of what is due; or, of what is usually determined: that is, as God usually determines, judges, acts toward those who love him. The idea is, Treat me according to the rules which regulate the treatment of thy people. Let me be regarded as one of them, and be dealt with accordingly.

Not as in himself; a sinful creature will not bear looking upon by the Lord, especially with the strict eye of justice; but as in Christ, and clothed with his righteousness; and so not merely in a providential way, though that is a favour, but in a way of special grace and mercy. It may be rendered, "turn unto me" (r); as it is in <a href="/psalms/25-16.htm">Psalm 25:16</a>; the Lord had turned from him, and had hid his face, which had given him trouble; and therefore he desires he would turn again to him, and show him his face and favour; <p>and be merciful unto me; in forgiving his sins, and admitting him to communion with him: he pleads mercy, and not merit and this shows it was not any look but a look of grace and mercy he prays for; <p>as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name; that is, himself: such as love the Lord have favours shown them; he shows mercy to thousands of them that love him; he loves them that love him; he manifests his love to them, and admits them to great nearness to himself. David was one of these; he loved him in sincerity, and above all others and could appeal to him for the truth of it, and desires no other nor better usage than such had; and indeed a man need not desire better, since all things work for their good now, and it is not to be conceived what God has prepared for them hereafter. <p>(r)  "convertere ad me", Michaelis; "turn the face unto me", Ainsworth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">132</span>. <span class="ital">Look</span> &c.] Turn unto me and be gracious unto me.

In the present time of apostasy and persecution he keeps all the more strictly to the direction of the divine word, and commends himself to the protection and teaching of God. In the consciousness of his godly behaviour (elsewhere always &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, here in one instance &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; &#1493;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;) the poet hopes that God will surely not (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;) leave him to the arbitrary disposal of his oppressors. This hope does not, however, raise him above the necessity and duty of constant prayer that Jahve would place Himself between him and his enemies. &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; seq. acc. signifies to stand in any one's place as furnishing a guarantee, and in general as a mediator, <a href="/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>; &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; similar to &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/86-17.htm">Psalm 86:17</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a> : in my behalf, for my real advantage. The expression of longing after redemption in <a href="/psalms/119-123.htm">Psalm 119:123</a> sounds like <a href="/psalms/119-81.htm">Psalm 119:81</a>. "The word of Thy righteousness" is the promise which proceeds from God's "righteousness," and as surely as He is "righteous" cannot remain unfulfilled. The one chief petition of the poet, however, to which he comes back in <a href="/psalms/119-124.htm">Psalm 119:124</a>., has reference to the ever deeper knowledge of the word of God; for this knowledge is in itself at once life and blessedness, and the present calls most urgently for it. For the great multitude (which is the subject to &#1492;&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;) practically and fundamentally break God's law; it is therefore time to act for Jahve (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/29-20.htm">Ezekiel 29:20</a>), and just in order to this there is need of well-grounded, reliable knowledge. Therefore the poet attaches himself with all his love to God's commandments; to him they are above gold and fine gold (<a href="/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>), which he might perhaps gain by a disavowal of them. Therefore he is as strict as he possibly can be with God's word, inasmuch as he acknowledges and observes all precepts of all things (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;), i.e., all divine precepts, let them have reference to whatsoever they will, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, right (&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;, to declare both in avowal and deed to be right); and every false (lying) tendency, all pseudo-Judaism, he hates. It is true <a href="/psalms/119-126.htm">Psalm 119:126</a> may be also explained: it is time that Jahve should act, i.e., interpose judicially; but this thought is foreign to the context, and affords no equally close union for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;; moreover it ought then to have been accented &#1506;&#1514; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;.
