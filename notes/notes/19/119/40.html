God, by his Spirit, gives a right understanding. But the Spirit of revelation in the word will not suffice, unless we have the Spirit of wisdom in the heart. God puts his Spirit within us, causing us to walk in his statutes. The sin here prayed against is covetousness. Those that would have the love of God rooted in them, must get the love of the world rooted out; for the friendship of the world is enmity with God. Quicken me in thy way; to redeem time, and to do every duty with liveliness of spirit. Beholding vanity deadens us, and slackens our pace; a traveller must not stand gazing upon every object that presents itself to his view. The promises of God's word greatly relate to the preservation of the true believer. When Satan has drawn a child of God into worldly compliances, he will reproach him with the falls into which he led him. Victory must come from the cross of Christ. When we enjoy the sweetness of God's precepts, it will make us long for more acquaintance with them.

He further prays for instruction and guidance that he may escape the by-paths of selfishness and of disavowal. The noun &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, used also elsewhere as an accus. adverb., in the signification ad extremum (<a href="/psalms/119-33.htm">Psalm 119:33</a> and <a href="/psalms/119-112.htm">Psalm 119:112</a>) is peculiar to our poet. &#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (with a Sheb&#1490; which takes a colouring in accordance with the principal form) refers back to &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;. In the petition "give me understanding" (which occurs six times in this Psalm) &#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; is causative, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>, and frequently in the post-exilic writings. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; (from &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, abscindere, as &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; accords in sound with &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) signifies gain and acquisition by means of the damage which one does to his neighbour by depreciating his property, by robbery, deceit, and extortion (<a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>), and as a name of a vice, covetousness, and in general selfishness. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; is that which is without real, i.e., without divine, contents or intrinsic worth, - God-opposed teaching and life. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1498;<p>(Note: Heidenheim and Baer erroneously have &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1498; with Jod. plural., contrary to the Masora.)<p>is a defective plural; cf. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1498;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-41.htm">Psalm 119:41</a>, &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1498;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-43.htm">Psalm 119:43</a>, and frequently. Establishing, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-38.htm">Psalm 119:38</a>, is equivalent to a realizing of the divine word or promise. The relative clause &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; is not to be referred to &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; according to <a href="/psalms/119-85.htm">Psalm 119:85</a> (where the expression is different), but to &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498;: fulfil to Thy servant Thy word or promise, as that which (quippe quae) aims at men attaining the fear of Thee and increasing therein (cf. <a href="/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>). The reproach which the poet fears in <a href="/psalms/119-39.htm">Psalm 119:39</a> is not the reproach of confessing, but of denying God. Accordingly &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498; are not God's judgments i.e., acts of judgment, but revealed decisions or judgments: these are good, inasmuch as it is well with him who keeps them. He can appeal before God to the fact that he is set upon the knowledge and experience of these with longing of heart; and he bases his request upon the fact that God by virtue of His righteousness, i.e., the stringency with which He maintains His order of grace, both as to its promises and its duties, would quicken him, who is at present as it were dead with sorrow and weariness. </body></html>
