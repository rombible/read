The psalmist prayed with his whole heart, knowing how to value the blessing he prayed for: he desired the mercy promised, and depended on the promise for it. He turned from by-paths, and returned to God's testimonies. He delayed not. It behoves sinners to hasten to escape; and the believer will be equally in haste to glorify God. No care or grief should take away God's word out of our minds, or hinder the comfort it bestows. There is no situation on earth in which a believer has not cause to be thankful. Let us feel ashamed that others are more willing to keep from sleep to spend the time in sinful pleasures, than we are to praise God. And we should be more earnest in prayer, that our hearts may be filled with his mercy, grace, and peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The bands of the wicked - Margin, "companies."

Very probably Saul and his ministers seized on his effects, when he fled from him; and the Amalekites plundered him of all his substance, when they took Ziklag; and Absalom and the conspirators with him robbed him, when he was obliged, because of them, to flee from his palace and court, which they entered and took possession of.

This is his comfort in his dejected condition, that God's promissory declaration has quickened him and proved its reviving power in his case.

In the remembrance of these, which determine the lot of a man according to the relation he holds towards them, the poet found comfort. It can be rendered: then I comforted myself; or according to a later usage of the Hithpa.: I was comforted.

The poet calls his earthly life "the house of his pilgrimage;" for it is true the earth is man's (<a href="/psalms/115-16.htm">Psalm 115:16</a>), but he has no abiding resting-place there (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>), his &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>) is elsewhere (vid., supra, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-19.htm">Psalm 119:19</a>, <a href="/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>). God's statutes are here his "songs," which give him spiritual refreshing, sweeten the hardships of the pilgrimage, and measure and hasten his steps. The Name of God has been in his mind hitherto, not merely by day, but also by night; and in consequence of this he has kept God's law (&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, as five times besides in this Psalm, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>, and to be distinguished from &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/119-44.htm">Psalm 119:44</a>).

To others something else is allotted (<a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>), to him this one most needful thing. </body></html>
