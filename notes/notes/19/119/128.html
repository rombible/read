Christ our Surety, having paid our debt and ransom, secures all the blessings of salvation to every true believer. The psalmist expects the word of God's righteousness, and no other salvation than what is secured by that word, which cannot fall to the ground. We deserve no favour form God; we are most easy when we cast ourselves upon God's mercy, and refer ourselves to it. If any man resolve to do God's will as his servant, he shall be made to know his testimonies. We must do what we can for the support of religion, and, after all, must beg of God to take the work into his own hands. It is hypocrisy to say we love God's commandments more than our worldly interests. The way of sin is a false way, being directly contrary to God's precepts, which are right: those that love and esteem God's law, hate sin, and will not be reconciled to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right - literally, "Therefore all the commandments of all I regard as right." The idea seems to be, that he regarded as right and just all the commandments of God pertaining to "every" thing and "every" person; all, considered in every way; all, wherever the law extended, and whomsoever it embraced; all the law pertaining to duty toward God and toward man. He saw in the "violation" of the laws of God <a href="/psalms/119-126.htm">Psalm 119:126</a> a reason for approving "all" law; all that would restrain people from sin, and that would bind them to duty and to virtue. The effect had been to lead him to reflect on the worth of law as law, and he had come to the conclusion that all the laws of God were to be approved and loved, inasmuch as they would, in their observance, prevent the wrongs and sorrows which he saw to be consequent on their violation.<p>And I hate every false way - Every course of life not based on truth, or on a right view of things.

In the present time of apostasy and persecution he keeps all the more strictly to the direction of the divine word, and commends himself to the protection and teaching of God. In the consciousness of his godly behaviour (elsewhere always &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, here in one instance &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; &#1493;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;) the poet hopes that God will surely not (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;) leave him to the arbitrary disposal of his oppressors. This hope does not, however, raise him above the necessity and duty of constant prayer that Jahve would place Himself between him and his enemies. &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; seq. acc. signifies to stand in any one's place as furnishing a guarantee, and in general as a mediator, <a href="/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>; &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; similar to &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/86-17.htm">Psalm 86:17</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a> : in my behalf, for my real advantage. The expression of longing after redemption in <a href="/psalms/119-123.htm">Psalm 119:123</a> sounds like <a href="/psalms/119-81.htm">Psalm 119:81</a>. "The word of Thy righteousness" is the promise which proceeds from God's "righteousness," and as surely as He is "righteous" cannot remain unfulfilled. The one chief petition of the poet, however, to which he comes back in <a href="/psalms/119-124.htm">Psalm 119:124</a>., has reference to the ever deeper knowledge of the word of God; for this knowledge is in itself at once life and blessedness, and the present calls most urgently for it.

Therefore the poet attaches himself with all his love to God's commandments; to him they are above gold and fine gold (<a href="/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>), which he might perhaps gain by a disavowal of them. Therefore he is as strict as he possibly can be with God's word, inasmuch as he acknowledges and observes all precepts of all things (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;), i.e., all divine precepts, let them have reference to whatsoever they will, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, right (&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;, to declare both in avowal and deed to be right); and every false (lying) tendency, all pseudo-Judaism, he hates. It is true <a href="/psalms/119-126.htm">Psalm 119:126</a> may be also explained: it is time that Jahve should act, i.e., interpose judicially; but this thought is foreign to the context, and affords no equally close union for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;; moreover it ought then to have been accented &#1506;&#1514; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;.
