Hope deferred made him faint; his eyes failed by looking out for this expected salvation. But when the eyes fail, yet faith must not. His affliction was great. He was become like a leathern bottle, which, if hung up in the smoke, is dried and shrivelled up. We must ever be mindful of God's statutes. The days of the believer's mourning shall be ended; they are but for a moment, compared with eternal happiness. His enemies used craft as well as power for his ruin, in contempt of the law of God. The commandments of God are true and faithful guides in the path of peace and safety. We may best expect help from God when, like our Master, we do well and suffer for it. Wicked men may almost consume the believer upon earth, but he would sooner forsake all than forsake the word of the Lord. We should depend upon the grace of God for strength to do every good work.

This strengthening according to God's promise is his earnest desire (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;) now, when within a very little his enemies have compassed his ruin (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;). His soul and eyes languish (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; as in <a href="/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>, cf. <a href="/job/19-27.htm">Job 19:27</a>) for God's salvation, that it may be unto him according to God's word or promise, that this word may be fulfilled. In <a href="/psalms/119-83.htm">Psalm 119:83</a> &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is hypothetical, as in <a href="/psalms/21-12.htm">Psalm 21:12</a> and frequently; here, as perhaps also in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>, in the sense of "although" (Ew. &#1431;362, b). He does not suffer anything to drive God's word out of his mind, although he is already become like a leathern bottle blackened and shrivelled up in the smoke. The custom of the ancients of placing jars with wine over the smoke in order to make the wine prematurely old, i.e., to mellow it (vid., Rosenm&#1516;ller), does not yield anything towards the understanding of this passage: the skin-bottle that is not intended for present use is hung up on high; and the fact that it had to withstand the upward ascending smoke is intelligible, notwithstanding the absence of any mention of the chimney. The point of comparison, in which we agree for the most part with Hitzig, is the removal of him who in his dungeon is continually exposed to the drudgery of his persecutors. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/119-84.htm">Psalm 119:84</a> is equivalent to "how few." Our life here below is short, so also is the period within which the divine righteousness can reveal itself. &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (instead of which the lxx erroneously reads &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;), pits, is an old word, <a href="/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a>. The relative clause, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-85.htm">Psalm 119:85</a>, describes the "proud" as being a contradiction to the revealed law; for there was no necessity for saying that to dig a pit for others is not in accordance with this law. All God's commandments are an emanation of His faithfulness, and therefore too demand faithfulness; but it is just this faithfulness that makes the poet an object of deadly hatred. They have already almost destroyed him"in the land." It is generally rendered "on earth;" but "in heaven" at the beginning of the following octonary is too far removed to be an antithesis to it, nor does it sound like one (cf. on the other hand &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; ouranoi's, <a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>). It is therefore: in the land (cf. <a href="/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-9.htm">Psalm 73:9</a>), where they think they are the only ones who have any right there, they have almost destroyed him, without shaking the constancy of his faith. But he stands in need of fresh grace in order that he may not, however, at last succumb. </body></html>
