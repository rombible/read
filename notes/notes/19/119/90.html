And the engagements of God's covenant are established more firmly than the earth itself. All the creatures answer the ends of their creation: shall man, who alone is endued with reason, be the only unprofitable burden of the earth? We may make the Bible a pleasant companion at any time. But the word, without the grace of God, would not quicken us. See the best help for bad memories, namely, good affections; and though the exact words be lost, if the meaning remain, that is well. I am thine, not my own, not the world's; save me from sin, save me from ruin. The Lord will keep the man in peace, whose mind is stayed on him. It is poor perfection which one sees and end of. Such are all things in this world, which pass for perfections. The glory of man is but as the flower of the grass. The psalmist had seen the fulness of the word of God, and its sufficiency. The word of the Lord reaches to all cases, to all times. It will take us from all confidence in man, or in our own wisdom, strength, and righteousness. Thus shall we seek comfort and happiness from Christ alone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy faithfulness - The accomplishment of thy promises.<p>Is unto all generations - Margin, "to generation and generation." From one generation to another. The generations of people change and pass away, but thy promises do not change. They are as applicable to one generation as to another; they meet every generation alike. The people of no one age can lay any exclusive claim to them, or feel that they were made only for them. They are as universal - as much adapted to the new generations that come upon the earth - as the light of the sun, ever-enduring, is; or as the fountains and streams, which flow from age to age.<p>Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth - Margin, "Standeth." It is firm. The earth thus established or made firm, is an illustration of thy faithfulness, and of the stability and permanence of thy promises. It is the same from generation to generation, with its rivers, streams, and fountains; with its fruits and flowers; with its balmy air and its sweet prospects; with its riches of gold and silver; with its pearls and diamonds; with its treasures of land and ocean.

This strengthening according to God's promise is his earnest desire (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;) now, when within a very little his enemies have compassed his ruin (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;). His soul and eyes languish (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; as in <a href="/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>, cf. <a href="/job/19-27.htm">Job 19:27</a>) for God's salvation, that it may be unto him according to God's word or promise, that this word may be fulfilled. In <a href="/psalms/119-83.htm">Psalm 119:83</a> &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is hypothetical, as in <a href="/psalms/21-12.htm">Psalm 21:12</a> and frequently; here, as perhaps also in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>, in the sense of "although" (Ew. &#1431;362, b). He does not suffer anything to drive God's word out of his mind, although he is already become like a leathern bottle blackened and shrivelled up in the smoke. The custom of the ancients of placing jars with wine over the smoke in order to make the wine prematurely old, i.e., to mellow it (vid., Rosenm&#1516;ller), does not yield anything towards the understanding of this passage: the skin-bottle that is not intended for present use is hung up on high; and the fact that it had to withstand the upward ascending smoke is intelligible, notwithstanding the absence of any mention of the chimney. The point of comparison, in which we agree for the most part with Hitzig, is the removal of him who in his dungeon is continually exposed to the drudgery of his persecutors. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/119-84.htm">Psalm 119:84</a> is equivalent to "how few."

The relative clause, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-85.htm">Psalm 119:85</a>, describes the "proud" as being a contradiction to the revealed law; for there was no necessity for saying that to dig a pit for others is not in accordance with this law. All God's commandments are an emanation of His faithfulness, and therefore too demand faithfulness; but it is just this faithfulness that makes the poet an object of deadly hatred. They have already almost destroyed him"in the land." It is generally rendered "on earth;" but "in heaven" at the beginning of the following octonary is too far removed to be an antithesis to it, nor does it sound like one (cf. on the other hand &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; ouranoi's, <a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>). It is therefore: in the land (cf. <a href="/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-9.htm">Psalm 73:9</a>), where they think they are the only ones who have any right there, they have almost destroyed him, without shaking the constancy of his faith. But he stands in need of fresh grace in order that he may not, however, at last succumb. </body></html>
