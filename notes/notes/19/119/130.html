The Scriptures show us what we were, what we are, and what we shall be. They show us the mercy and the justice of the Lord, the joys of heaven, and the pains of hell. Thus they give to the simple, in a few days, understanding of those matters, which philosophers for ages sought in vain. The believer, wearied with the cares of life and his conflicts with sin, pants for the consolations conveyed to him by means of the sacred word. And every one may pray, Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. We must beg that the Holy Spirit would order our steps. The dominion of sin is to be dreaded and prayed against by every one. The oppression of men is often more than flesh and blood can bear; and He who knoweth our frame, will not refuse to remove it in answer to the prayers of his people. Whatever obscurity may appear as to the faith of the Old Testament believers, their confidence at the throne of grace can only be explained by their having obtained more distinct views of gospel privileges, through the sacrifices and services of their law, than is generally imagined. Go to the same place, plead the name and merits of Jesus, and you will not, you cannot plead in vain. Commonly, where there is a gracious heart, there is a weeping eye. Accept, O Lord, the tears our blessed Redeemer shed in the days of his flesh, for us who should weep for our brethren or ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The entrance of thy words giveth light - The Septuagint translates this, "the manifestation (or declaration) - &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  he&#772; de&#772;lo&#772;sis - of thy words enlightens." So the Vulgate. Luther renders it, "When thy word is revealed, so it delivers us, and makes the simple wise." DeWette, "The opening (revelation) of thy word," etc. The Hebrew word - &#1508;&#1514;&#1495;  pethach - means an "opening" or "entrance" - as of a gate, <a href="/joshua/20-4.htm">Joshua 20:4</a>; <a href="/judges/9-35.htm">Judges 9:35</a>; and then "a door," as of a tent or the temple, <a href="/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/6-8.htm">1 Kings 6:8</a>; or the gate of a city, <a href="/isaiah/3-26.htm">Isaiah 3:26</a>; and then it means opening, insight, instruction. The word as used here seems to denote the opening or unfolding of the word of God; the revelation of that word to the mind. A door is open so that we enter into a house; a gate, so that we enter into a city; and thus the meaning of the word of God is "opened" to us, so that we may, as it were, enter in and see its beauty. The language does not, therefore, denote the entrance of that word into the mind, but, its being made open to us so that we may perceive its beauty, or may ourselves "enter" into its meaning, its mysteries, and its beauties.<p>It giveth understanding unto the simple - The word rendered "simple" literally means "those who are open to persuasion," or who are easily enticed or seduced. Then it refers to the credulous, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>, and then to the "inexperienced."

The beginning of them; the first three chapters in Genesis, what light do they give into the origin of all things; the creation of man, his state of innocence; his fall through the temptations of Satan, and his recovery and salvation by Christ, the seed of the woman, the first principles of the oracles of God, the rudiments of religion, the elements of the world, the rites of the ceremonial law, gave great light into Gospel mysteries. As soon as a man enters upon reading the Scriptures, if he has any degree of understanding of the things in them, they immediately throw light into his mind; or, however, as soon as ever the word has an entrance into the heart, and through the Spirit, power, and grace of God, makes its way and has a place there, that being opened by the Lord for that purpose, light arises in darkness. It maybe rendered, "the opening of thy words giveth light" (p); and may signify either the interpretation and explanation of the word of God by the ministers of it, which is often of singular use for enlightening and warming the hearts of men, <a href="/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>; and to this sense are the Vulgate Latin and Septuagint versions; the one rendering it "the declaration of thy words", the other, "the manifestation" of them; and so the Ethiopic and Arabic versions; and to this sense is the Targum; <p>"the impression of thy words will enlighten those that are dark.'' <p>Or it may intend the word that opens, as well as is opened, since it is the means of opening blind eyes; and so giving light to men to see their lost state by nature, and the suitableness of Christ as a Saviour, his fulness and grace, ability and willingness; to behold the wondrous things of the Gospel, the way they should walk in, and the duties of religion they should perform; <p>it giveth understanding unto the simple: who want understanding in the knowledge of divine and spiritual things, as all men do; and who are sensible of their want of it, ingenuously confess it, and are meek and humble; and so not above instruction, as proud and conceited persons are. Some render it "babes" (q); and it may design such who are but of weak parts, in comparison of others, to whom the things of the Gospel are revealed, when they are hid from the wise and prudent: Christ by his Spirit opens their understandings, that they may understand the Scriptures; and by means of them gives them an understanding of himself, and of those things which make them wise unto salvation, and make for their spiritual peace and comfort, and their eternal welfare; see <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>. <p>(p) "apertio", Pagninus, Montanus, Musculus, Vatablus, Michaelis; "apertura", Cocceius, Gejerus; so Ainsworth.

In the present time of apostasy and persecution he keeps all the more strictly to the direction of the divine word, and commends himself to the protection and teaching of God. In the consciousness of his godly behaviour (elsewhere always &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, here in one instance &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; &#1493;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;) the poet hopes that God will surely not (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;) leave him to the arbitrary disposal of his oppressors. This hope does not, however, raise him above the necessity and duty of constant prayer that Jahve would place Himself between him and his enemies. &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; seq. acc. signifies to stand in any one's place as furnishing a guarantee, and in general as a mediator, <a href="/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>; &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; similar to &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/86-17.htm">Psalm 86:17</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a> : in my behalf, for my real advantage. The expression of longing after redemption in <a href="/psalms/119-123.htm">Psalm 119:123</a> sounds like <a href="/psalms/119-81.htm">Psalm 119:81</a>. "The word of Thy righteousness" is the promise which proceeds from God's "righteousness," and as surely as He is "righteous" cannot remain unfulfilled. The one chief petition of the poet, however, to which he comes back in <a href="/psalms/119-124.htm">Psalm 119:124</a>., has reference to the ever deeper knowledge of the word of God; for this knowledge is in itself at once life and blessedness, and the present calls most urgently for it. For the great multitude (which is the subject to &#1492;&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;) practically and fundamentally break God's law; it is therefore time to act for Jahve (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/29-20.htm">Ezekiel 29:20</a>), and just in order to this there is need of well-grounded, reliable knowledge. Therefore the poet attaches himself with all his love to God's commandments; to him they are above gold and fine gold (<a href="/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>), which he might perhaps gain by a disavowal of them. Therefore he is as strict as he possibly can be with God's word, inasmuch as he acknowledges and observes all precepts of all things (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;), i.e., all divine precepts, let them have reference to whatsoever they will, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, right (&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;, to declare both in avowal and deed to be right); and every false (lying) tendency, all pseudo-Judaism, he hates. It is true <a href="/psalms/119-126.htm">Psalm 119:126</a> may be also explained: it is time that Jahve should act, i.e., interpose judicially; but this thought is foreign to the context, and affords no equally close union for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;; moreover it ought then to have been accented &#1506;&#1514; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;.
