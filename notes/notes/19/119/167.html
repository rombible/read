By the word of God we are unspeakable gainers. Every man hates to have a lie told him, but we should more hate telling a lie; by the latter we give an affront to God. The more we see the beauty of truth, the more we shall see the hateful deformity of a lie. We are to praise God even for afflictions; through grace we get good from them. Those that love the world have great vexation, for it does not answer what they expect; those that love God's word have great peace, for it outdoes what they expect. Those in whom this holy love reigns, will not perplex themselves with needless scruples, or take offence at their brethren. A good hope of salvation will engage the heart in doing the commandments. And our love to the word of God must subdue our lusts, and root out carnal affections: we must make heart work of it, or we make nothing of it. We must keep the commandments of God by obedience to them, and his promises by reliance on them. God's eye is on us at all times; this should make us very careful to keep his commandments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My soul hath kept thy testimonies, and I love them exeeedingly - I am conscious of loving them; I feel an inward assurance that I do love them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>166-168.

Princes persecute him without adequate cause, but his heart does not fear before them, but before God's words (the Ker likes the singular, as in <a href="/psalms/119-147.htm">Psalm 119:147</a>), to deny which would be to him the greatest possible evil. It is, however, a fear that is associated with heartfelt joy (<a href="/psalms/119-111.htm">Psalm 119:111</a>). It is the joy of a conflict that is rewarded by rich spoil (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>, <a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>). Not merely morning and evening, not merely three times a day (<a href="/psalms/55-18.htm">Psalm 55:18</a>), but seven times (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; as in <a href="/leviticus/26-18.htm">Leviticus 26:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>), i.e., ever again and again, availing himself of every prayerful impulse, he gives thanks to God for His word, which so righteously decides and so correctly guides, is a source of transcendent peace to all who love it, and beside which one is not exposed to any danger of stumbling (&#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;, lxx &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, cf. <a href="/1_john/2-10.htm">1 John 2:10</a>) without some effectual counter-working.
