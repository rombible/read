We ought, therefore, continually to beseech him, by his Holy Spirit, to give us understanding. The comforts some have in God, should be matter of joy to others. But it is easy to own, that God's judgments are right, until it comes to be our own case. All supports under affliction must come from mercy and compassion. The mercies of God are tender mercies; the mercies of a father, the compassion of a mother to her son. They come to us when we are not able to go to them. Causeless reproach does not hurt, and should not move us. The psalmist could go on in the way of his duty, and find comfort in it. He valued the good will of saints, and was desirous to keep up his communion with them. Soundness of heart signifies sincerity in dependence on God, and devotedness to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy hands have made me - This commences a new division of the psalm, in which each verse begins with the Hebrew letter Jod (&#1497; y) - or "i" - the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet, called in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>, "jot;" "one jot or tittle shall in no wise pass from the law." The words "thy hands have made me" are expressive of the idea that he had been formed or moulded by God - as the "hands" are the instruments by which we do anything.

Its subject would seem to be personal experience and its attractive influence upon others. The prophet is in deep sorrow, but looks to be delivered and made a blessing. Endeavouring to teach, the Psalmist first seeks to be taught (<a href="/psalms/119-73.htm">Psalm 119:73</a>), persuades himself that he win be well received (<a href="/psalms/119-74.htm">Psalm 119:74</a>), and rehearses the testimony which he intends to bear (<a href="/psalms/119-75.htm">Psalm 119:75</a>). He prays for more experience (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-76.htm">Psalm 119:76</a>, 19 119:77), for the baffling of the proud (<a href="/psalms/119-78.htm">Psalm 119:78</a>), for the gathering together of the godly to him (<a href="/psalms/119-79.htm">Psalm 119:79</a>), and for himself again that he may be fully equipped for his witness-bearing and may be sustained in it (<a href="/psalms/119-80.htm">Psalm 119:80</a>). This is the anxious yet hopeful cry of one who is heavily afflicted by cruel adversaries, and therefore makes his appeal to God as his only friend.<p><a href="/psalms/119-73.htm">Psalm 119:73</a><p>"Thy hands have made me and fashioned me." It is profitable to remember our creation, it is pleasant to see that the divine hand has had much to do with us, for it never moves apart from the divine thought. It excites reverence, gratitude, and affection towards God when we view him as our Maker, putting forth the careful skill and power of his hands in our forming and fashioning. He took a personal interest in us, making us with his own hands; he was doubly thoughtful, for he is represented both as making and moulding us. In both giving existence and arranging existence he manifested love and wisdom; and therefore we find reasons for praise, confidence, and expectation in our being and well-being. "Give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments." As thou hast made me, teach me. Here is the vessel which thou hast fashioned; Lord, fill it. Thou hast given me both soul and body; grant me now thy grace that my soul may know thy will, and my body may join in the performance of it. The plea is very forcible; it is an enlargement of the cry, "Forsake not the work of thine own hands." Without understanding the divine law and rendering obedience to it we are imperfect and useless; but we may reasonably hope that the great Potter will complete his work and give the finishing touch to it by imparting to it sacred knowledge and holy practice. If God had roughly made us, and had not also elaborately fashioned us, this argument would lose much of its force; but surely from the delicate art and marvellous skill which the Lord has shown in the formation of the human body, we may infer that he is prepared to take equal pains with the soul till it shall perfectly bear his image.<p>A man without a mind is an idiot, the mere mockery of a man; and a mind' without grace is wicked, the sad perversion of a mind. We pray that we may not be left without a spiritual judgment: for this the Psalmist prayed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-66.htm">Psalm 119:66</a>, and he here pleads for it again; there is no true knowing and keeping of the commandments without it. Fools can sin; but only those who are taught of God can be holy. We often speak of gifted men; but he has the best gifts to whom God has given a sanctified understanding wherewith to know and prize the ways of the Lord. Note well that David's prayer for understanding is not for the sake of speculative knowledge, and the gratification of his curiosity: he desires an enlightened judgment that he may learn God's commandments, and so become obedient and holy. This is the best of learning. A man may abide in the College where this science is taught all his days, and yet cry out for ability to learn more. The commandment of God is exceeding broad, and so it affords scope for the most vigorous and instructed mind' in fact, no man has by nature an understanding capable of compassing so wide a field, and hence the prayer, "give me understanding"; - as much as to say - I can learn other things with the mind I have, but thy law is so pure, so perfect, spiritual and sublime, that I need to have my mind enlarged before I can become proficient in it. He appeals to his maker to do this, as if he felt that no power short of that which made him could make him wise unto holiness. We need a new creation, and who can grant us that but the Creator himself? He who made us to live must make us to learn; he who gave us power to stand must give us grace to understand. Let us each one breathe to heaven the prayer of this verse ere we advance a step further, for we shall be lost even in these petitions unless we pray our way through them, and cry to God for understanding.<p><a href="/psalms/119-74.htm">Psalm 119:74</a><p>"They that fear thee will be glad when they see me: because I have hoped in thy word." When a man of God obtains grace for himself he becomes a blessing to others, especially if that grace has made him a man of sound understanding and holy knowledge. God-fearing men are encouraged when they meet with experienced believers. A hopeful man is a God-send when things are declining or in danger. When the hopes of one believer are fulfilled his companions are cheered and established, and led to hope also. It is good for the eyes to see a man whose witness is that the Lord is true; it is one of the joys of saints to hold converse with their more advanced brethren. The fear of God is not a left-handed grace, as some have called it; it is quite consistent with gladness; for if even the sight of a comrade gladdens the God-fearing, how glad must they be in the presence of the Lord himself l We do not only meet to share each others' burdens, but to partake in each others' joys, and some men contribute largely to the stock of mutual gladness. Hopeful men bring gladness with them. Despondent spirits spread the infection of depression, and hence few are glad to see them, while those whose hopes are grounded upon God's word carry sunshine in their faces, and are welcomed by their fellows. There are professors whose presence scatters sadness, and the godly quietly steal out of their company: may this never be the case with us.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div><span class="bld">JOD</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> I am thy creature, and therefore obliged to serve and obey thee with all my might; which that I may do aright I beg thy instruction or assistance.

Thy hands have made me and fashioned me,.... Not the psalmist himself, nor his parents, but the Lord alone: for though parents are fathers of our flesh, they are but instruments in the hand of the Lord; though man is produced by natural generation, yet the formation and fashioning of men are as much owing to the power and wisdom of God, which are his hands, as the formation of Adam was. Job owns this in much the same words as the psalmist does, <a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>; see <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13</a>. God not only gives conception, and forms the embryo in the womb, but fashions and gives it its comely and proportionate parts. Or, "covered me"; the first word may respect conception, and this the covering of the fetus with the secundine (t); see <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13</a>; <p>give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments; since he had a proper comely body, and a reasonable soul; though debased by sin, and brought into a state of ignorance, especially as to spiritual things, he desires he might have a spiritual understanding given him; of the word of God in general, the truths and doctrines of it, which are not understood by the natural man; and of the precepts of it in particular, that he might so learn them as to know the sense and meaning of them, their purity and spirituality; and so as to do them from a principle of love, in faith, and to the glory of God: for it is not a bare learning them by heart, or committing them to memory, nor a mere theory of them, but the practice of them in faith and love, which is here meant. <p>(t) Vid.

He reviews his life, and sees in everything that has befallen him the good and well-meaning appointment of the God of salvation in accordance with the plan and order of salvation of His word. The form &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498;, which is the form out of pause, is retained in <a href="/psalms/119-65.htm">Psalm 119:65</a> beside Athnach, although not preceded by Olewejored (cf. <a href="/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-11.htm">Psalm 48:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-21.htm">Proverbs 30:21</a>). Clinging believingly to the commandments of God, he is able confidently to pray that He would teach him "good discernment" and "knowledge." &#1496;&#1506;&#1501; is ethically the capacity of distinguishing between good and evil, and of discovering the latter as it were by touch; &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1496;&#1506;&#1501;, good discernment, is a coupling of words like &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1500;&#1489;, a happy disposition, cheerfulness. God has brought him into this relationship to His word by humbling him, and thus setting him right out of his having gone astray. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-67.htm">Psalm 119:67</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, is not God's utterance conveying a promise, but imposing a duty. God is called &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; as He who is graciously disposed towards man, and &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489; as He who acts out this disposition; this loving and gracious God he implores to become his Teacher. In his fidelity to God's word he does not allow himself to be led astray by any of the lies which the proud try to impose upon him (Bttcher), or better absolutely (cf. <a href="/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>): to patch together over him, making the true nature unrecognisable as it were by means of false plaster or whitewash (&#1496;&#1508;&#1500;, to smear over, bedaub, as the Targumic, Talmudic, and Syriac show). If the heart of these men, who by slander make him into a caricature of himself, is covered as it were with thick fat (a figure of insensibility and obduracy, <a href="/psalms/17-10.htm">Psalm 17:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-7.htm">Psalm 73:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>, lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, Aquila &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;) against all the impressions of the word of God, he, on the other hand, has his delight in the law of God (&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; with an accusative of the object, not of that which is delighted, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-19.htm">Psalm 94:19</a>, but of that which delights).
