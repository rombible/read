When we see our mistake, it becomes us to think with shame upon our carnal security as our folly. If God hide his face, a good man is troubled, though no other calamity befal him. But if God, in wisdom and justice, turn from us, it will be the greatest folly if we turn from him. No; let us learn to pray in the dark. The sanctified spirit, which returns to God, shall praise him, shall be still praising him; but the services of God's house cannot be performed by the dust; it cannot praise him; there is none of that device or working in the grave, for it is the land of silence. We ask aright for life, when we do so that we may live to praise him. In due time God delivered the psalmist out of his troubles. Our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when employed in praising God. He would persevere to the end in praise, hoping that he should shortly be where this would be the everlasting work. But let all beware of carnal security. Neither outward prosperity, nor inward peace, here, are sure and lasting. The Lord, in his favour, has fixed the believer's safety firm as the deep-rooted mountains, but he must expect to meet with temptations and afflictions. When we grow careless, we fall into sin, the Lord hides his face, our comforts droop, and troubles assail us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me, - etc. This, too, is the prayer which he uttered in the calamities adverted to in <a href="/psalms/30-7.htm">Psalm 30:7</a>. It is a cry for mercy founded on the idea referred to in <a href="/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-11. As in Ps 6:5; 88:10; Isa 38:18, the appeal for mercy is based on the destruction of his agency in praising God here, which death would produce. The terms expressing relief are poetical, and not to be pressed, though "dancing" is the translation of a word which means a lute, whose cheerful notes are contrasted with mourning, or (Am 5:16) wailing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me,....

Here the psalmist's prayer, uttered in his distress, ends, and he proceeds to declare the result. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 30:5-6) <a href="/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a> call upon all the pious to praise this God, who after a short season of anger is at once and henceforth gracious. Instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; of Jahve, we find the expression &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; in this instance, as in <a href="/psalms/97-12.htm">Psalm 97:12</a> after <a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>. Jahve, by revealing Himself, renders Himself capable of being both named and remembered, and that in the most illustrious manner. The history of redemption is, as it were, an unfolding of the Name of Jahve and at the same time a setting up of a monument, an establishment of a memorial, and in fact the erection of a &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;; because all God's self-attestations, whether in love or in wrath, flow from the sea of light of His holiness. When He manifests Himself to His won love prevails; and wrath is, in relation to them, only a vanishing moment: a moment passes in His anger, a (whole) life in His favour, i.e., the former endures only for a moment, the latter the whole life of a man. "Alles Ding whrt seine Zeit, Gottes Lieb' in Ewigkeit." All things last their season, God's love to all eternity. The preposition &#1489;&#1468; does not here, as in the beautiful parallel <a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>., cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-10.htm">Psalm 60:10</a>, denote the time and mode of that which takes place, but the state in which one spends the time. <a href="/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a> portrays the rapidity with which love takes back wrath (cf. <a href="/isaiah/17-14.htm">Isaiah 17:14</a>): in the evening weeping takes up its abode with us for the night, but in the morning another guest, viz., &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, appears, like a rescuing angel, before whom &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497; disappears. The predicate &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; etaci does not belong to <a href="/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a> as well (Hupfeld, Hitzig). The substantival clause: and in the morning joy  equals  joy is present, depicts the unexpectedness and surprise of the help of Him who sends &#1489;&#1499;&#1497; and &#1512;&#1504;&#1492;. </body></html>
