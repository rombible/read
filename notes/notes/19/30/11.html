When we see our mistake, it becomes us to think with shame upon our carnal security as our folly. If God hide his face, a good man is troubled, though no other calamity befal him. But if God, in wisdom and justice, turn from us, it will be the greatest folly if we turn from him. No; let us learn to pray in the dark. The sanctified spirit, which returns to God, shall praise him, shall be still praising him; but the services of God's house cannot be performed by the dust; it cannot praise him; there is none of that device or working in the grave, for it is the land of silence. We ask aright for life, when we do so that we may live to praise him. In due time God delivered the psalmist out of his troubles. Our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when employed in praising God. He would persevere to the end in praise, hoping that he should shortly be where this would be the everlasting work. But let all beware of carnal security. Neither outward prosperity, nor inward peace, here, are sure and lasting. The Lord, in his favour, has fixed the believer's safety firm as the deep-rooted mountains, but he must expect to meet with temptations and afflictions. When we grow careless, we fall into sin, the Lord hides his face, our comforts droop, and troubles assail us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast turned for me - In my behalf.

It was this which he commemorated at the dedication of his house; this joy succeeding scenes of sorrow that he now called to remembrance as he entered the place which he had reared for a permanent abode.

Quiet and peace? Ay, and a great deal more than that. "Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing." He makes their hearts to dance at the sound of his name. He takes off their sackcloth. That is good. What a delight to be rid of the habiliments of woe! But what then? He clothes us. And how? With some common dress? Nay, but with that royal vestment which is the array of glorified spirits in heaven. "Thou hast girded me with gladness." This is better than to wear garments of silk or cloth of gold, bedight with embroidery and bespangled with gems. Many a poor man wears this heavenly apparel wrapped around his heart, though fustian and corduroy are his only outward garb; and such a man needs not envy the emperor in all his pomp.

He would have no dumb children in the house. They are all to sing in heaven, and therefore they should all sing on earth.

Suddenly, in a moment, all was changed. The angel ceased to slay. God bade him hold his hand. The Prophet Gad was sent with the joyful news to David, and commanded him at once to build an altar at Jehovah. Then the mourning ceased, and a joyful ceremonial was instituted, of which dancing, as so often, formed a part (see <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14-16</a>; <a href="/psalms/149-3.htm">Psalm 149:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-4.htm">Jeremiah 31:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">put off</span> (rather, <span class="accented">didst put off</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>my sackcloth</span>.

Instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; of Jahve, we find the expression &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; in this instance, as in <a href="/psalms/97-12.htm">Psalm 97:12</a> after <a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>. Jahve, by revealing Himself, renders Himself capable of being both named and remembered, and that in the most illustrious manner. The history of redemption is, as it were, an unfolding of the Name of Jahve and at the same time a setting up of a monument, an establishment of a memorial, and in fact the erection of a &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;; because all God's self-attestations, whether in love or in wrath, flow from the sea of light of His holiness. When He manifests Himself to His won love prevails; and wrath is, in relation to them, only a vanishing moment: a moment passes in His anger, a (whole) life in His favour, i.e., the former endures only for a moment, the latter the whole life of a man. "Alles Ding whrt seine Zeit, Gottes Lieb' in Ewigkeit." All things last their season, God's love to all eternity. The preposition &#1489;&#1468; does not here, as in the beautiful parallel <a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>., cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-10.htm">Psalm 60:10</a>, denote the time and mode of that which takes place, but the state in which one spends the time. <a href="/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a> portrays the rapidity with which love takes back wrath (cf. <a href="/isaiah/17-14.htm">Isaiah 17:14</a>): in the evening weeping takes up its abode with us for the night, but in the morning another guest, viz., &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, appears, like a rescuing angel, before whom &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497; disappears. The predicate &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; etaci does not belong to <a href="/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a> as well (Hupfeld, Hitzig). The substantival clause: and in the morning joy  equals  joy is present, depicts the unexpectedness and surprise of the help of Him who sends &#1489;&#1499;&#1497; and &#1512;&#1504;&#1492;. </body></html>
