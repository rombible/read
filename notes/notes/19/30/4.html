Of the holiness of God, or of the rectitude and sanctity of his nature, demonstrated by his faithfulness to his promises, David had the highest and most comfortable assurance. “God having, at last, brought him to the throne and settled him in the possession of it, notwithstanding he was often reduced to the greatest hazard of his life, and his advancement to the kingdom seemed, according to all human probability, almost impossible.” — Chandler.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:1-5. The great things the Lord has done for us, both by his providence and by his grace, bind us in gratitude to do all we can to advance his kingdom among men, though the most we can do is but little. God's saints in heaven sing to him; why should not those on earth do the same? Not one of all God's perfections carries in it more terror to the wicked, or more comfort to the godly, than his holiness. It is a good sign that we are in some measure partakers of his holiness, if we can heartily rejoice at the remembrance of it. Our happiness is bound up in the Divine favour; if we have that, we have enough, whatever else we want; but as long as God's anger continues, so long the saints' weeping continues.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his - This call upon others to give thanks to God is in view of the mercy which he had experienced. He invites them to unite with him in celebrating the praises of that God who had showed him so much mercy. It was not because they had been benefited by these tokens of the divine favor; but:<p>(a) because when we are partakers of the divine mercy, we desire that others may assist us in giving utterance to the praise due to God; and<p>(b) because others may learn from the mercies bestowed on us that God is worthy of praise, or may see in His dealings with us an argument for His goodness; and may, therefore, appropriately unite in His praise.<p>Thus religion diffuses its influence on all around us, and tends to "unite" the hearts of many in every manifestation of the character of God. Infidelity is solitary and dissocial; religion is social; and, no matter on whom the favor is bestowed, its effect is to unite the hearts of many to each other and to God.<p>And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness - Margin, "to the memorial." The Hebrew is, "to the memory of his holiness." The sense is, in calling to recollection the acts of his holiness, or his holy perfections. Compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>. The word "holiness" here is used in a large sense as denoting, not so much the hatred of sin, as benevolence, kindness, mercy - the divine compassion toward those who are in trouble or danger. It is true that it is a proper subject of rejoicing and praise that God is a holy God, a God of truth and justice, a God who cannot look upon sin but with abhorrence, a God in whose nature is combined every possible perfection; but that is not the exact idea here. The word refers to his compassion, goodness, kindness; and to the acts by which that had been manifested to the psalmist, as laying a proper foundation for gratitude and praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. remembrance&#8212;the thing remembered or memorial.<p>holiness&#8212;as the sum of God's perfections (compare Ps 22:3), used as name (Ex 3:15; Ps 135:13).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/30.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>4 Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.<p>5 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life; weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.<p><a href="/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a><p>"Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his." "Join my song; assist me to express my gratitude." He felt that he could not praise God enough himself, and therefore he would enlist the hearts of others. "Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his." David would not fill his choir with reprobates, but with sanctified persons, who could sing from their hearts. He calls to you, ye people of God, because ye are saints: and if sinners are wickedly silent, let your holiness constrain you to sing. You are his saints - chosen, blood-bought, called, and set apart for God sanctified on purpose that You should offer the daily sacrifice of praise. Abound ye in this heavenly duty. "Sing unto the Lord." It is a pleasing exercise; it is a profitable engagement. Do not need to be stirred up so often to so pleasant a service. "And give thanks." Let your songs be grateful songs, in which the Lord's mercies shall live again in joyful remembrance. The very remembrance of the past should tune our harps, even if present joys be lacking. "At the remembrance of his holiness." Holiness is an attribute which inspires the deepest awe, and demands a reverent mind; but still give thanks at the remembrance of it. "Holy, holy, holy!" is the song of seraphim and cherubim; let us join it not dolefully, as though we trembled at the holiness of God, but cheerfully, as humbly rejoicing in it.<p><a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a><p>"For his anger endureth but a moment." David here alludes to those dispensations of God's providence which are the chastisement ordered in his paternal government towards his erring children, such as the plague which fell upon Jerusalem for David's sins; these are but short judgments, and they are removed as soon as real penitence sues for pardon and presents the great and acceptable sacrifice. What a mercy is this, for if the Lord's wrath smoked for a long season, flesh would utterly fail before him. God puts up his rod with great readiness as soon as its work is done; he is slow to anger and swift to end it. If his temporary and fatherly anger be so severe that it had need be short, what must be the terror of eternal wrath exercised by the Judge towards his adversaries? "In his favour is life." As soon as the Lord looked favourably upon David, the city lived, and the king's heart lived too. We die like withered flowers when the Lord frowns, but his sweet smile revives us as the dews refresh the fields. His favour not only sweetens and cheers life, but it is life itself, the very essence of life. Who would know life, let him seek the favour of the Lord. "Weeping may endure for a night:" but nights are not for ever. Even in the dreary winter the day-star lights his lamp. It seems fit that in our nights the dews of grief should fall. When the Bridegroom's absence makes it dark within, it is meet that the widowed soul should pine for a renewed sight of the Well-beloved. "But joy cometh in the morning." When the Sun of Righteousness comes, we wipe our eyes, and joy chases out intruding sorrow. Who would not be joyful that knows Jesus? The first beams of the morning bring us comfort when Jesus is the day-dawn, and all believers know it to be so. Mourning only lasts till morning: when the night is gone the gloom shall vanish. This is adduced as a reason for saintly singing, and forcible reason it is; short nights and merry days call for the psaltery and harp. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="ital">at the mention</span>, &c.; when you call to mind, or when others celebrate, as I do, this day, the holiness of God’s nature; which he demonstrates by his works, by his faithfulness, care, and kindness towards his holy ones. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his,....

David continually calls upon the people to join him in his praises of God. Even when the mercy vouchsafed has been granted specially to himself, he regards the people as interested, since he is their ruler in peace and their leader in war (see <a href="/psalms/9-11.htm">Psalm 9:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>, etc.).

And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness; literally, <span class="accented">give thanks to the memorial of his holiness</span>, which is explained, by reference to <a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>, as meaning,  "Give thanks to his holy Name" (comp. <a href="/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-21.htm">Psalm 145:21</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Now follows the description of the revelation of God's power, which is the ground of the summons, and is to be the subject-matter of their praise. The All-glorious One makes Himself heard in the language (<a href="/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3</a>.) of the thunder, and reveals Himself in the storm. There are fifteen lines, which naturally arrange themselves into three five-line strophes. The chief matter with the poet, however, is the sevenfold &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1492;. Although &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; is sometimes used almost as an ejaculatory "Hark!" (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>), this must not, with Ewald (286, f), be applied to the &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1492; of the Psalm before us, the theme of which is the voice of God, who announced Himself from heaven - a voice which moves the world. The dull sounding &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; serves not merely to denote the thunder of the storm, but even the thunder of the earthquake, the roar of the tempest, and in general, every low, dull, rumbling sound, by which God makes Himself audible to the world, and more especially from the wrathful side of His doxa. The waters in <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a> are not the lower waters. Then the question arises what are they? Were the waters of the Mediterranean intended, they would be more definitely denoted in such a vivid description. It is, however, far more appropriate to the commencement of this description to understand them to mean the mass of water gathered together in the thick, black storm-clouds (vid., <a href="/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>). The rumbling<p>(Note: The simple rendering of &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; by "voice" has been retained in the text of the Psalm, as in the Authorised Version. The word, however, which Dr. Delitzsch uses is Gedrhn, the best English equivalent of which is a "rumbling." - Tr.)<p>of Jahve is, as the poet himself explains in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>, the thunder produced on high by the &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; (cf. &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1492;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, <a href="/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7</a>.), which rolls over the sea of waters floating above the earth in the sky. <a href="/psalms/29-4.htm">Psalm 29:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-4.htm">Psalm 29:4</a>, just like <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>, are independent substantival clauses.

In <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a> the first peals of thunder are heard; in <a href="/psalms/29-4.htm">Psalm 29:4</a> the storm is coming nearer, and the peals become stronger, and now it bursts forth with its full violence: <a href="/psalms/29-5.htm">Psalm 29:5</a> describes this in a general form, and <a href="/psalms/29-5.htm">Psalm 29:5</a> expresses by the fut. consec., as it were inferentially, that which is at present taking place: amidst the rolling of the thunder the descending lightning flashes rive the cedars of Lebanon (as is well-known, the lightning takes the outermost points). The suffix in <a href="/psalms/29-6.htm">Psalm 29:6</a> does not refer proleptically to the mountains mentioned afterwards, but naturally to the cedars (Hengst., Hupf., Hitz.), which bend down before the storm and quickly rise up again. The skipping of Lebanon and Sirion, however, is not to be referred to the fact, that their wooded summits bend down and rise again, but, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/114-4.htm">Psalm 114:4</a>, to their being shaken by the crash of the thunder-a feature in the picture which certainly does not rest upon what is actually true in nature, but figuratively describes the apparent quaking of the earth during a heavy thunderstorm. &#1513;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>, is the Sidonian name of Hermon, and therefore side by side with Lebanon it represents Anti-Lebanon.

The lightning makes these mountains bound (Luther, lecken, i.e., according to his explanation: to spring, skip) like young antelopes. &#1512;&#1488;&#1501;,<p>(Note: On Arab. r'm vid., Seetzen's Reisen iii. 339 and also iv. 496.)<p>like &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, is a generic name of the antelope, and of the buffalo that roams in herds through the forests beyond the Jordan even at the present day; for there are antelopes that resemble the buffalo and also (except in the formation of the head and the cloven hoofs) those that resemble the horse, the lxx renders: &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. Does this mean the unicorn Germ. one-horn depicted on Persian and African monuments? Is this unicorn distinct from the one horned antelope? Neither an unicorn nor an one horned antelope have been seen to the present day by any traveller. Both animals, and consequently also their relation to one another, are up to the present time still undefinable from a scientific point of view.<p>(Note: By &#1512;&#1488;&#1501; Ludolf in opposition to Bochart understands the rhinoceros; but this animal, belonging to the swine tribe, is certainly not meant, or even merely associated with it. Moreover, the rhinoceros Germ. nose-horn is called in Egypt charnin (from Arab. chrn  equals  qrn), but the unicorn, charnit. "In the year 1862 the French archaeologist, M. Waddington, was with me in Damascus when an antiquary brought me an ancient vessel on which a number of animals were engraved, their names being written on their bellies. Among the well known animals there was also an unicorn, exactly like a zebra or a horse, but with a long horn standing out upon its forehead; on its body was the word Arab. chrn&#305;&#770;t. M. Waddington wished to have the vessel and I gave it up to him; and he took it with him to Paris. We talked a good deal about this unicorn, and felt obliged to come to the conclusion that the form of the fabulous animal might have become known to the Arabs at the time of the crusades, when the English coat of arms came to Syria." - Wetzstein.)<p>Each peal of thunder is immediately followed by a flash of lightning; Jahve's thunder cleaveth flames of fire, i.e., forms (as it were &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;) the fire-matter of the storm-clouds into cloven flames of fire, into lightnings that pass swiftly along; in connection with which it must be remembered that &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1492; denotes not merely the thunder as a phenomenon, but at the same time it denotes the omnipotence of God expressing itself therein. The brevity and threefold division of <a href="/psalms/29-7.htm">Psalm 29:7</a> depicts the incessant, zigzag, quivering movement of the lightning (tela trisulca, ignes trisulci, in Ovid). From the northern mountains the storm sweeps on towards the south of Palestine into the Arabian desert, viz., as we are told in <a href="/psalms/29-8.htm">Psalm 29:8</a> (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-5.htm">Psalm 29:5</a>, according to the schema of "parallelism by reservation"), the wilderness region of Kadesh (Kadesh Barnea), which, however we may define its position, must certainly have lain near the steep western slope of the mountains of Edom toward the Arabah. Jahve's thunder, viz., the thunderstorm, puts this desert in a state of whirl, inasmuch as it drives the sand (&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;) before it in whirlwinds; and among the mountains it, viz., the strong lightning and thundering, makes the hinds to writhe, inasmuch as from fright they bring forth prematurely. both the Hiph. &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500; and the Pil. &#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; are used with a causative meaning (root &#1495;&#1493;, &#1495;&#1497;, to move in a circle, to encircle). The poet continues with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507;, since he makes one effect of the storm to develope from another, merging as it were out of its chrysalis state. &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is a poetical plural form; and &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507; describes the effect of the storm which "shells" the woods, inasmuch as it beats down the branches of the trees, both the tops and the foliage. While Jahve thus reveals Himself from heaven upon the earth in all His irresistible power, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;, in His heavenly palace (<a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>), &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; (note how &#1489;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493; resolves this &#1499;&#1500;&#1493; out of itself), i.e., each of the beings therein, says: &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;. That which the poet, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>, has called upon them to do, now takes place. Jahve receives back His glory, which is immanent in the universe, in the thousand-voiced echo of adoration. </body></html>
