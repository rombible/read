Let us see what makes the times bad, and when they may be said to be so. Ask the children of this world, What makes the times bad? they will tell you, Scarcity of money, decay of trade, and the desolations of war, make the times bad: but the Scripture lays the badness of the times on causes of another nature, 2Ti 3:1, c.: perilous times shall come, for sin shall abound; and of this David complains. When piety decays times really are bad. He who made man's mouth will call him to an account for his proud, profane, dissembling, or even useless words. When the poor and needy are oppressed, then the times are very bad. God himself takes notice of the oppression of the poor, and the sighing of the needy. When wickedness abounds, and is countenanced by those in authority, then the times are very bad. See with what good things we are here furnished for such bad times; and we cannot tell what times we may be reserved for. 1. We have a God to go to, from whom we may ask and expect the redress of all our grievances. 2. God will certainly punish and restrain false and proud men. 3. God will work deliverance for his oppressed people. His help is given in the fittest time. Though men are false, God is faithful; though they are not to be trusted, God is. The preciousness of God's word is compared to silver refined to the highest degree. How many proofs have been given of its power and truth! God will secure his chosen remnant, however bad the times are. As long as the world stands, there will be a generation of proud and wicked men. But all God's people are put into the hands of Christ our Saviour; there they are in safety, for none can pluck them thence; being built on Him, the Rock, they are safe, notwithstanding temptation or persecution come with ever so much force upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wicked walk on every side - Everywhere. They have full license, or seem to be wholly unrestrained.<p>When the vilest men are exalted - Margin, "The vilest of the sons of men are exalted." This expression has been very variously translated. Dr. Horsley renders it, "When the scorn of the sons of men is exalted." De Wette, "They exalt themselves; terror to the sons of men." Luther, "Where such wicked people rule among the sons of men." Hengstenberg, "Like exaltation is disgrace to the sons of men." Prof. Alexander seems inclined to favor this last view. According to this interpretation, the meaning is, that "although the wicked are now in the ascendant, and the righteous are treated with contempt, this disgrace is realy an exaltation, because only ... in man's judgment, not in God's, who will abundantly indemnity his people for the dishonor put upon them." The word rendered in our version "the vilest" - &#1494;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;  zu&#770;llu&#770;th - means, according to Gesenius, "trembling, terror." It occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. The verb from which it is derived - &#1494;&#1500;&#1500;  za&#770;lal - means to shake, to tremble; then (as one shakes out, or casts away worthless things) to be vile, abject, despised, worthless.<p>Perhaps, however, the common version expresses the idea more accurately than any of these proposed amendments. I would offer the following as a fair translation of the passage: "The wicked walk on every side; (it is) as the lifting up, or the exaltation of vileness among the sons of men." That is, the state of things is as if the vilest were exalted, or were honored. It seems to be the very exaltation of wickedness or depravity in the world. A state of things exists in which, from the prevalence of iniquity, the wicked seem to go unrestrained; in which no regard is paid to truth; in which falsehood and flattery abound; and it is as if honor were done to the worst forms of sin, and the most abandoned seem to be the most exalted. This appears to be the reason in the mind of the psalmist why the divine interposition is necessary; with this idea the psalm commences, and with this it appropriately closes. There was a state of widespread depravity and successful iniquity, as if all honor were conferred on wicked and abandoned men, while the virtuous were oppressed and degraded. The psalm expresses "confidence" in God - confidence in his faithful word and promises; but the psalmist sees a state of things wherein it was eminently desirable that God should interpose, for the righteous seemed to have failed out of the earth, and the wicked seemed to be wholly in the ascendancy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

When those in power are vile, their underlings will be no better. As a warm sun brings out noxious flies, so does a sinner in honour foster vice everywhere. Our turf would not so swarm with abominables if those who are styled honourables did not give their countenance to the craft. Would to God that the glory and triumph of our Lord Jesus would encourage us to walk and work on every side; as like acts upon like, since an exalted sinner encourages sinners, our exalted Redeemer must surely excite, cheer, and stimulate his saints. Nerved by a sight of his reigning power we shall meet the evils of the times in the spirit of holy resolution, and shall the more hopefully pray, "Help, Lord." <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The wicked walk on every side; </span> which phrase may note, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The verb &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; to complete, means here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7-10.htm">Psalm 7:10</a>, to have an end; and the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1505; is equivalent to &#1488;&#1508;&#1505; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/77-9.htm">Psalm 77:9</a>, to come to the extremity, to cease.

So the old Persic man, Zend upaman, cf. &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; with its derivatives which are applied in several ways in the New Testament to characterise &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;.)<p>We find similar complaints of the universal prevalence of wickedness in <a href="/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-28.htm">Jeremiah 7:28</a>, and elsewhere. They contain their own limitation. For although those who complain thus without pharisaic self-righteousness would convict themselves of being affected by the prevailing corruption, they are still, in their penitence, in their sufferings for righteousness' sake, and in their cry for help, a standing proof that humanity has not yet, without exception, become a massa perdita. That which the writer especially laments, is the prevailing untruthfulness.
