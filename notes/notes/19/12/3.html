a man may comfort himself with such meditations and prayers. Let us see what makes the times bad, and when they may be said to be so. Ask the children of this world, What makes the times bad? they will tell you, Scarcity of money, decay of trade, and the desolations of war, make the times bad: but the Scripture lays the badness of the times on causes of another nature, 2Ti 3:1, c.: perilous times shall come, for sin shall abound; and of this David complains. When piety decays times really are bad. He who made man's mouth will call him to an account for his proud, profane, dissembling, or even useless words. When the poor and needy are oppressed, then the times are very bad. God himself takes notice of the oppression of the poor, and the sighing of the needy. When wickedness abounds, and is countenanced by those in authority, then the times are very bad. See with what good things we are here furnished for such bad times; and we cannot tell what times we may be reserved for. 1. We have a God to go to, from whom we may ask and expect the redress of all our grievances. 2. God will certainly punish and restrain false and proud men. 3. God will work deliverance for his oppressed people. His help is given in the fittest time. Though men are false, God is faithful; though they are not to be trusted, God is. The preciousness of God's word is compared to silver refined to the highest degree. How many proofs have been given of its power and truth! God will secure his chosen remnant, however bad the times are. As long as the world stands, there will be a generation of proud and wicked men. But all God's people are put into the hands of Christ our Saviour; there they are in safety, for none can pluck them thence; being built on Him, the Rock, they are safe, notwithstanding temptation or persecution come with ever so much force upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord shall cut off - This might be rendered, "May the Lord cut off," implying a wish on the part of the psalmist that it might occur. But probably the common rendering is the correct one. It is the statement of a solemn truth, designed for warning, that all such persons would be punished.<p>All flattering lips - The meaning is, that he will cut off all "persons" who use flattery; that is, he will cut them off from the favors which he will show to his own people, or will punish them. The word used here is the common one to denote disowning or excommunicating, and derives its meaning from the act of separating offenders from a community. See <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/18-29.htm">Leviticus 18:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3</a>, <a href="/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>; et soepe.<p>And the tongue that speaketh proud things - That boasts, or is self-confident. For an example of this, see <a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>; and compare the notes at that passage. It was this disposition to falsehood, flattery, and boasting, which constituted the fact stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/12-1.htm">Psalm 12:1</a>, that "godly" and "faithful" men - men on whom reliance might be placed, whose word might be trusted, and whose promised aid in the cause of truth might be depended on - had seemed to "fail" among men. That is, no such men could be found.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4.

Well did the apostle call them "raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame." Free-thinkers are generally very free-talkers, and they are never more at ease than when railing at God's dominion, and arrogating to themselves unbounded license. Strange is it that the easy yoke of the Lord should so gall the shoulders of the proud, while the iron bands of Satan they bind about themselves as chains of honour: they boastfully cry unto God, "Who is lord over us?" and hear not the hollow voice of the evil one, who cries from the infernal lake, "I am your Lord, and right faithfully do ye serve me." Alas, poor fools, their pride and glory shall be cut off like a fading flower! May God grant that our soul may not be gathered with them. It is worthy of observation that flattering lips, and tongues speaking proud things, are classed together: the fitness of this is clear, for they are guilty of the same vice, the first flatters another, and the second flatters himself, in both cases a lie is in their right hands. One generally imagines that flatterers are such mean parasites, so cringing and fawning, that they cannot be proud; but the wise man will tell you that while all pride is truly meanness, there is in the very lowest meanness no small degree of pride. Csar's horse is even more proud of carrying Csar, than Csar is of riding him. The mat on which the emperor wiped his shoes, boasts vaingloriously, crying out, "I cleaned the imperial boots." None are so detestably domineering as the little creatures who creep into office by cringing to the great; those are bad times, indeed, in which these obnoxious beings are numerous and powerful. No wonder that the justice of God in cutting off such injurious persons is matter for a Psalm, for both earth and heaven are weary of such provoking offenders, whose presence is a very plague to the people afflicted thereby. Men cannot tame the tongues of such boastful flatterers; but the Lord's remedy if sharp is sure, and is an unanswerable answer to their swelling words of vanity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or <span class="ital">great things</span>, or <span class="ital">great words</span>, either bragging or threatening what they will do, and what great things they will effect, to wit, by their tongues, as they themselves explain it in the next verse, which they will use so cunningly and powerfully, that they shall not need to use their hands, or strike a stroke. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips,....

Above the earth are the heavens, and in heaven is the throne of Jahve, the King of kings. And this temple, this palace in the heavens, is the place whence issues the final decision of all earthly matters, <a href="/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a>; <a href="/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a>. For His throne above is also the super-terrestrial judgment-seat, <a href="/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>.

The mention of the eyelids is intentional. When we observe a thing closely or ponder over it, we draw the eyelids together, in order that our vision may be more concentrated and direct, and become, as it were, one ray piercing through the object. Thus are men open to the all-seeing eyes, the all-searching looks of Jahve: the just and the unjust alike. He tries the righteous, i.e., He knows that in the depth of his soul there is an upright nature that will abide all testing (<a href="/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>; <a href="/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a>), so that He lovingly protects him, just as the righteous lovingly depends upon Him. And His soul hates (i.e., He hates him with all the energy of His perfectly and essentially holy nature) the evil-doer and him that delights in the violence of the strong towards the weak. And the more intense this hatred, the more fearful will be the judgments in which it bursts forth. </body></html>
