But this Psalmist, whether David or another, says this, and means it, when all things are dark and frowning around him. The superscription attributes the words to David himself, fleeing from Saul, and hiding in the cave. Whether that be so or no, the circumstances under which the Psalmist sings are obviously those of very great difficulty and oppression. But he sings himself into confidence and good cheer. In the dark he believes in the light. There are some flowers that give their perfumes after sunset and are sweetest when the night dews are falling. The true religious life is like these. A heart really based upon God, and at rest in Him, never breathes forth such fragrant and strong perfume as in the darkness of sorrow. The repetition of ‘My heart is fixed’ adds emphasis to the expression of unalterable determination. The fixed heart is resolved to ‘sing and give praise’ in spite of everything that might make sobs and tears choke the song.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Note the fixed heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The Hebrew uses the metaphor of the ‘heart’ to cover a great deal more of the inward self than we are accustomed to do. We mainly mean thereby that in us which loves. But the Old Testament speaks of the ‘thoughts and intents’ as well as the ‘affections’ of the heart. And so to this Psalmist his ‘heart’ was not only that in him which loved, but that which purposed and which thought. When he says ‘My heart is fixed’ he does not merely mean that he is conscious of a steadfast love, but also and rather of a fixed and settled determination, and of an abiding communion of thought between himself and God. And he not only makes this declaration as the expression of his experience for the moment, but he mortgages the future, and in so far as any man dare, he ventures to say that this temper of entire consecration, of complete communion, of fixed resolve to cleave to God, which is his present mood, will be his future whatever may wait his outward life then. The lesson from that resolve is that our religion, if it is worth anything, must be a continuous and uniformly acting force throughout our whole lives, and not merely sporadic and spasmodic, by fits and starts. The lines that a child’s unsteady and untrained hand draws in its copy-book are too good a picture of the ‘crooked, wandering ways in which we live,’ in so far as our religion is concerned. The line should be firm and straight, uniform in breadth, unvarying in direction, like a sunbeam, homogeneous and equally tenacious like an iron rod. Unless it be thus strong and uniform, it will scarcely sustain the weights that it must bear, or resist the blows that it must encounter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> For a fixed heart I must have a fixed determination, and not a mere fluctuating and soon broken intention. I must have a steadfast affection, and not merely a fluttering love, that, like some butterfly, lights now on this, now on that, sweet flower, but which has a flight straight as a carrier pigeon to its cot, which shall bear me direct to God. And I must have a continuous realisation of my dependence upon God, and of God’s sweet sufficiency, going with me all through the dusty day. A firm determination, a steadfast love, a constant thought, these at least are inculcated in the words of my text. ‘My heart is fixed, O God! my heart is fixed.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Ah, brethren! how unlike the broken, interrupted, divergent lines that we draw! Our religious moments are not knit together, and touching one upon the other, but they are like the pools in the bed of a half dried up Australian stream-a pond here, and a stretch of white, blistering pebbles there, and then a little drop of water, and then another reach of dryness. They should all be knit together by one continuous flow of a fixed love, desire, and thought. Is our average Christianity fairly represented by such words as these of my text? Do they not rather make us burn with shame when we think that a man who lived in the twilight of God’s revelation, and was weighed upon by distresses such as wrung this psalm out of him, should have poured out this resolve, which we who live in the sunlight and are flooded with blessings find it hard to echo with sincerity and truth? Fixed hearts are rare amongst the Christians of this day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Notice the manifold hindrances to such a uniformity of our religious life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>They are formidable enough, God knows, we all know it, and I do not need to dwell upon them. There is, for example, the tendency to fluctuation which besets all our feelings, and especially our religious emotions. What would happen to a steam-engine if the stoker now piled on coals and then fell asleep by the furnace door? One moment the boiler would be ready to burst; at another moment there would be no steam to drive anything. That is the sort of alternation that goes on amongst hosts of Christians to-day. Their springtime and summer are followed certainly by an autumn and a bitter winter. Every moment of elevation has a corresponding moment of depression. They never catch a glimpse of God and of His love brighter and more sweet than ordinary without its being followed by long weariness and depression and darkness. That is the kind of life that many of you are contented to live as Christian people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But is there any necessity for such alternations? Some degree of fluctuation there will always be. The very exercise of emotion tends to its extinction. Varying conditions of health and other externals will affect the buoyancy and clear-sightedness and vivacity of the spiritual life. Only a barometer that is out of order will always stand at set fair. The vane which never points but to south is rusty and means nothing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But while there cannot be absolute uniformity, there might and should be a far nearer approach to an equable temperature of a much higher range than the readings of most professing Christians give. There is, indeed, a dismally uniform arctic temperature in many of them. Their hearts are fixed, truly, but fixed on earth. Their frost is broken by no thaw, their tepid formalism interrupted by no disturbing enthusiasm. We do not now speak of these, but of those who have moments of illumination, of communion, of submission of will, which fade all too soon. To such we would earnestly say that these moments may be prolonged and made more continuous. We need not be at the mercy of our own unregulated feelings. We can control our hearts, and keep them fixed, even if they should wish to wander. If we would possess the blessing of an approximately uniform religious life, we must assert the control of ourselves and use both bridle and spur. A great many religious people seem to think that ‘good times’ come and go, and that they can do nothing to bring or keep or banish them. But that is not so. If the fire is burning low, there is such a thing on the hearth as a poker, and coals are at hand. If we feel our faith falling asleep, are we powerless to rouse it? Cannot we say ‘I <span class="ital">will</span> trust’? Let us learn that the variations in our religious emotions are largely subject to our own control, and may, if we will govern ourselves, be brought far nearer to uniformity than they ordinarily are.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Besides the fluctuations due to our own changes of mood, there are also the distracting influences of even the duties which God lays upon us. It is hard for a man with the material task of the moment that takes all his powers, to keep a little corner of his heart clear, and to feel that God is there. It is difficult in the clatter of the mill or in the crowds on ‘Change, to do our work as for and in remembrance of Christ. It <span class="ital">is</span> difficult; but it is possible. Distractions are made distractions by our own folly and weakness. There is nothing that it is our duty to do which an honest attempt to do from the right motive could not convert into a positive help to getting nearer God. It is for us to determine whether the tasks of life, and this intrusive external and material world, shall veil Him from us, or shall reveal Him to us. It is for us to determine whether we shall make our secular avocation and its trials, little and great, a means to get nearer to God, or a means to shut Him out from us, and us from Him. There is nothing but sin incompatible with the fixed heart, the resolved will, the continual communion, nothing incompatible though there may be much that makes it difficult to realise and preserve these.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And then, of course, the trials and sorrows which strike us all make this fixed heart hard to keep. It is easy, as I said, to vow, ‘I will sing and give praise,’ when flesh is comfortable and prosperity is spreading its bright sky over our heads. It is harder to say it when disappointment and bitterness are in the heart, and an empty place there that aches and will never be filled. It is harder for a man to say it when, like this Psalmist, his soul is ‘amongst lions’ and he ‘lies amongst them that are set on fire.’ But still, rightly taken, sorrow is the best ladder to God; and there is no such praise as comes from the lips that, if they did not praise, must sob, and that praise because they are beginning to learn that evil, as the world calls it, is the stepping-stone to the highest good. ‘My heart is fixed. I will sing and give praise’ may be the voice of the mourner as well as of the prosperous and happy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Lastly, let me say just a word as to the means by which such a uniform character may be impressed upon our religious experience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>There is another psalm where this same phrase is employed with a very important and illuminating addition, in which we read, ‘His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.’ That is the secret of a fixed heart-continuous faith rooted and grounded in Him. This fluttering, changeful, unreliable, emotional nature of mine will be made calm and steadfast by faith, and duties done in the faith of God will bind me to Him; and sorrows borne and joys accepted in the faith of God will be links in the chain that knits Him to me.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But then the question comes, how to get this continuous faith? Brethren! I know no answer except the simple one, by continually making efforts after it, and adopting the means which Christ enjoins to secure it. A man climbing a hill, though he has to look to his feet when in the slippery places, and all his energies are expended in hoisting himself upwards by every projection and crag, will do all the better if he lifts his eye often to the summit that gleams above him. So we, in our upward course, shall make the best progress when we consciously and honestly try to look beyond the things seen and temporal, even whilst we are working in the midst of them, and to keep clear before us the summit to which our faith tends. If we lived in the endeavour to realise that great white throne, and Him that sits upon it, we should find it easier to say, ‘My heart is fixed, O God! my heart is fixed.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But be sure of this, there will be no such uniformity of religious experience throughout our lives unless there be frequent times in them in which we go into our chambers and shut our doors about us, and hold communion with our Father in secret. Everything noble and great in the Christian life is fed by solitude, and everything poor and mean and hypocritical and low-toned is nourished by continual absence from the secret place of the Most High. There must be moments of solitary communion, if there are to be hours of strenuous service and a life of continual consecration.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We need not ask ourselves the question whether the realisation of the ideal of this fixedness in its perfect completeness is possible for us here on earth or not. You and I are a long way on this side of that realisation yet, and we need not trouble ourselves about the final stages until we have got on a stage or two more.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What would you think of a boy if, when he had just been taught to draw with a pencil, he said to his master, ‘Do you think I shall ever be able to draw as well as Raphael?’ His teacher would say to him, ‘Whether you will or not, you will be able to draw a good deal better than now, if you try.’ We need not trouble ourselves with the questions that disturb some people until we are very much nearer to perfection than any of us yet are. At any rate, we can approach indefinitely to that ideal, and whether it is possible for us in this life ever to have hearts so continuously fixed as that no attraction shall draw the needle aside one point from the pole or not, it is possible for us all to have them a great deal steadier than in that wavering, fluctuating vacillation which now rules them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So let us pray the prayer, ‘Unite my heart to fear Thy name,’ make the resolve, ‘My heart is fixed,’ and listen obediently to the command, ‘He exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they should cleave unto the Lord.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/psalms/57.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/57-7.htm" title="My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise....">Psalm 57:7-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">My heart is fixed — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">נכון</span>, <span class="ital">nachon, prepared, </span>or, <span class="ital">established; </span>namely, in a full assurance of obtaining thy merciful help.

His heart is fixed; it is prepared for every event, being stayed upon God. If by the grace of God we are brought into this even, composed frame of mind, we have great reason to be thankful. Nothing is done to purpose, in religion, unless it is done with the heart. The heart must be fixed for the duty, put in frame for it; fixed in the duty by close attention. Our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when praising God; dull and sleepy devotions will never be acceptable to God. Let us awake early in the morning, to begin the day with God; early in the beginning of a mercy. When God comes toward us with his favours, let us go forth to meet him with our praises. David desired to bring others to join in praising God; and in his psalms, he is still praising God among the people, singing to Him among the nations. Let us seek to have our hearts fixed to praise his boundless mercy and unfailing faithfulness; and to glorify him with body, soul, and spirit, which are his. Let us earnestly pray that the blessings of the gospel may be sent through every land.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My heart is fixed, O God - Margin, as in Hebrew, "prepared." Compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>. The word "suited" or "prepared" accurately expresses the sense of the Hebrew, and it is so rendered in the Septuagint, (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;  hetoime&#772;); in the Vulgate, "paratum;" and by Luther, "bereit." The word is used, however, in the sense of "standing erect," <a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7</a>; to "establish" or "strengthen," <a href="/psalms/89-4.htm">Psalm 89:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/10-17.htm">Psalm 10:17</a>; and hence, to be erect; to be firm, steady, constant, fixed. This seems to be the meaning here, as it is expressed in our common version. His heart was firm and decided. He did not waver in his purpose, or lean now to one side and then to the other; he was not "swayed" or "moved" by the events that had occurred. He felt conscious of standing firm in the midst of all his troubles. He confided in God. He did not doubt his justice, his goodness, his mercy; and, even in his trials, he was ready to praise him, and was "resolved" to praise him. The repetition of the word "fixed" gives emphasis and intensity to the expression, and is designed to show in the strongest manner that his heart, his purpose, his confidence in God, did not waver in the slightest degree.<p>I will sing and give praise - My heart shall confide in thee; my lips shall utter the language of praise. In all his troubles God was his refuge; in all, he found occasion for praise. So it should be the fixed and settled purpose of our hearts that we will at all times confide in God, and that in every situation in life we will render him praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/57.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Twice does he declare this to the glory of God who thus comforts the souls of his servants. Reader, it is surely well with thee, if thy once roving heart is now firmly fixed upon God and the proclamation of his glory. "I will sing and give praise." Vocally and instrumentally will I celebrate thy worship. With lip and with heart will I ascribe honour to thee. Satan shall not stop me, nor Saul, nor the Philistines.

Let the noblest powers of my nature bestir them-selves: the intellect which conceives thought, the tongue which expresses it, and the inspired imagination which beautifies it - let all be on the alert now that the hour for praise has come. "Awake, Psaltery and harp." Let all the music with which I am familiar be well attuned for the hallowed service of praise. "I myself will awake early." I will awake the dawn with my joyous notes. No sleepy verses and weary notes shall be heard from; I will thoroughly arouse myself for this high employ. When we are at our best we fall far short of the Lord's deserts, let us, therefore, make sure that what we bring him is our best, and, if marred with infirmity, at least let it not be deteriorated by indolence. Three times the Psalmist calls upon himself to awake. Do we need so much arousing, and for such work?

The shadow of the wings of God is the protection of His gentle, tender love; and the shadow of the wings is the quickening, cordial solace that is combined with this protection. Into this shadow the poet betakes himself for refuge now as he has done before, until &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., the abysmal danger that threatens him, be overpast, praeteriverit (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>, and on the enallage numeri <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-10.htm">Psalm 10:10</a>, Ges. &#1431;147, a). Not as though he would then no longer stand in need of the divine protection, but he now feels himself to be specially in need of it; and therefore his chief aim is an undaunted triumphant resistance of the impending trials. The effort on his own part, however, by means of which he always anew takes refuge in this shadow, is prayer to Him who dwells above and rules the universe. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; is without the article, which it never takes; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; (<a href="/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a>) is the same, because it is regularly left out before the participle, which admits of being more fully defined, <a href="/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-19.htm">Ezekiel 21:19</a> (Hitzig). He calls upon God who accomplisheth concerning, i.e., for him (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>), who carrieth out his cause, the cause of the persecuted one; &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; is transitive as in <a href="/psalms/138-8.htm">Psalm 138:8</a>. The lxx renders &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;, as though it were &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/13-6.htm">Psalm 13:6</a>, and frequently); and even Hitzig and Hupfeld hold that the meaning is exactly the same. But although &#1490;&#1502;&#1500; and &#1490;&#1502;&#1512; fall back upon one and the same radical notion, still it is just their distinctive final letters that serve to indicate a difference of signification that is strictly maintained. In <a href="/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a> follow futures of hope. In this instance "that which brings me deliverance" is to be supplied in thought to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; (cf. <a href="/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a>) and not &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7</a>; and this general and unmentioned object is then specialized and defined in the words "His mercy and His truth" in <a href="/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>. Mercy and truth are as it were the two good spirits, which descending from heaven to earth (cf. <a href="/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>) bring the divine &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; to an accomplishment. The words &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1508;&#1497; sdro standing between a and c have been drawn by the accentuators to the first half of the verse, they probably interpreting it thus: He (God) reproacheth my devourers for ever (Sela). But &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; always (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a>) has God as its object, not as its subject. &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1508;&#1497; is to be connected with what follows as a hypothetical protasis (Ges. 155, 4, a): supposing that he who is greedy or pants for me (inhians mihi) slandereth, then Elohim will send His mercy and His truth. The music that becomes forte in between, introduces and accompanies the throbbing confidence of the apodosis.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>, on the contrary, we may follow the interpretation of the text that is handed down and defined by the accentuation, natural as it may also be, with Luther and others, to take one's own course. Since &#1500;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (has Zarka (Zinnor) and &#1500;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; Olewejored, it is accordingly to be rendered: "My soul is in the midst of lions, I will (must) lie down with flaming ones; the children of men - their teeth are a spear and arrows." The rendering of the lxx, of Theodotion, and of the Syriac version accords with the interpunction of our text so far as both begin a new clause with &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; (&#1493;&#1491;&#1502;&#1499;&#1514;, and I slept); whereas Aquila and Symmachus (taking &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, as it seems, as a periphrastic expression of the subject-notion placed in advance) render all as afar as &#1500;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; as one clause, at least dividing the verse into two parts, just as the accentuators do, at &#1500;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;. The rendering of Aquila is &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;; that of Symmachus: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;; or according to another reading, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. They are followed by Jerome, who, however, in order that he may be able to reproduce the &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, changes &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492;: Anima mea in medio leonum dormivit ferocientium. This construction, however, can be used in Greek and Latin, but not in Hebrew. We therefore follow the accents even in reference to the Zarka above &#1500;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (a plural form that only occurs in this one passage in the Psalter,  equals  &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;). In a general way it is to be observed that this &#1500;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; in connection with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; is not so much the accusative of the object as the accusative of the place, although it may even be said to be the customary local accusative of the object with verbs of dwelling; on &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/3-8.htm">Ruth 3:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/3-14.htm">Ruth 3:14</a>, and <a href="/psalms/88-6.htm">Psalm 88:6</a>; <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a> (where at least the possibility of this construction of the verb is presupposed). But in particular it is doubtful (1) what &#1500;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; signifies. The rendering "flaming ones" is offered by the Targum, Saadia, and perhaps Symmachus. The verb &#1500;&#1492;&#1496; obtains this signification apparently from the fundamental notion of licking or swallowing; and accordingly Theodotion renders it by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, and Aquila most appropriately by &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (a word used of a ravenous furious longing for anything). But &#1500;&#1492;&#1496; nowhere means "to devour;" the poet must, therefore, in connection with &#1500;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, have been thinking of the flaming look or the fiery jaws of the lions, and this attributive will denote figuratively their strong desire, which snorts forth as it were flames of fire. The question further arises, (2) how the cohortative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492; is meant to be taken. Since the cohortative sometimes expresses that which is to be done more by outward constraint than inward impulse-never, however, without willing it one's self (Ew. 228, a) - the rendering "I must," or "therefore must I lie down," commends itself. But the contrast, which has been almost entirely overlooked, between the literal beasts of prey and the children of men, who are worse than these, requires the simple and most natural rendering of the cohortative. We need only picture to ourselves the situation. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489; here has the sense of cubitum ire (<a href="/psalms/4-9.htm">Psalm 4:9</a>). Starting from this &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492; we look to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-9.htm">Psalm 57:9</a>, and it at once becomes clear that we have before us an evening or nightly song. David the persecuted one finds himself in the wilderness and, if we accept the testimony of the inscription, in a cave: his soul is in the midst of lions, by which he means to say that his life is exposed to them. Here bold in faith, he is resolved to lie down to sleep, feeling himself more secure among lions than among men; for the children of men, his deadly foes both in word and in deed, are worse than beasts of prey: teeth and tongue are murderous weapons. This more than brutal joy at the destruction of one's neighbour <p>(Note: Cf. Sir. 25:15, in the Hebrew: &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1508;&#1514;&#1503; &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; (no poison exceeds the poison of the serpent, and no wrath exceeds the wrath of an enemy).)<p>which prevails among men, urges him to put forth the prayer that God, who in Himself is exalted above the heavens and the whole earth, would show Himself by some visible manifestation over the heavens above as the exalted One, and the prayer that His glory may be, i.e., may become manifest (or even: exalted be His glory, &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;), over the whole earth beneath, - His glory which to His saints is a health-diffusing light, and to the heartless foes of men and God a consuming fire, - so that the whole world shall be compelled to acknowledge this glory in which His holiness manifests itself, and shall become conformed to it after everything that is hostile is overthrown. </body></html>
