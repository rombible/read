The most eminent believers need often repeat the publican's prayer, God be merciful to me a sinner. But if our souls trust in the Lord, this may assure us, in our utmost dangers, that our calamities will at length be overpast, and in the mean time, by faith and prayer, we must make him our refuge. Though God be most high, yet he condescends so low, as to take care that all things are made to work for good to his people. This is a good reason why we should pray earnestly. Look which way we will on this earth, refuge fails, no help appears; but we may look for it from heaven. If we have fled from the wrath to come, unto Jesus Christ, he that performed all things needful to purchase the salvation of his people, will do for us and in us all things needful for our enjoyment of it. It made David droop to think there should be those that bore him so much ill-will. But the mischief they designed against him, returned on themselves. And when David was in the greatest distress and disgrace, he did not pray, Lord, exalt me, but, Lord, exalt thine own name. Our best encouragement in prayer, is taken from the glory of God, and to that, more than to our own comfort, we should have regard in all our petitions for mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens - Compare <a href="/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>. The language here is that of a man who in trouble lifts his thoughts to God; who feels that God reigns; who is assured in his own soul that all things are under his hand; and who is desirous that God should be magnified whatever may become of himself. His prime and leading wish is not for himself, for his own safety, for his own deliverance from danger; it is that "God" may be honored - that the name of God may be glorified - that God may be regarded as supreme over all things - that God may be exalted in the highest possible degree - an idea expressed in the prayer that he may be exalted "above the heavens."<p>Let thy glory be above all the earth - The honor of thy name; thy praise. Let it be regarded, and be in fact, "above" all that pertains to this lower world; let everything on earth, or that pertains to earth, be subordinate to thee, or be surrendered for thee. This was the comfort which David found in trouble. And this "is" the only true source of consolation. The welfare of the universe depends on God; and that God should be true, and just, and good, and worthy of confidence and love - that he should reign, - that his law should be obeyed - that his plans should be accomplished, - is of more importance to the universe than anything that merely pertains to us; than the success of any of our own plans; than our health, our prosperity, or our life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/57.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

That is, show thyself to be God, that sittest in the heavens, and art higher than they, by saving me, and disappointing mine enemies; that I, and those that are with me, may magnify the Lord and exalt his name together. The Targum is, <p>"be thou exalted above the angels of heaven, O God;'' <p>let thy glory be above all the earth; that is, above all the inhabitants of the earth, as the Chaldee paraphrase: let the glory of God in my deliverance be seen by all that dwell upon the earth; for by how much the lower and more distressed his case and condition were, by so much the more would the glory of God be displayed in bringing him out of it. Nothing lies nearer the hearts of the people of God than his glory; this is more desirable than their own salvation: David breathes after the one, when he says nothing of the other, that being uppermost; though his meaning is, that the one might be brought about by the other. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/57.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{f}</span> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; <i>let</i> thy glory <i>be</i> above all the earth.</span><p>(f) Do not permit me to be destroyed to the contempt of your Name.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/57.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.
