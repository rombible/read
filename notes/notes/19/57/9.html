His heart is fixed; it is prepared for every event, being stayed upon God. If by the grace of God we are brought into this even, composed frame of mind, we have great reason to be thankful. Nothing is done to purpose, in religion, unless it is done with the heart. The heart must be fixed for the duty, put in frame for it; fixed in the duty by close attention. Our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when praising God; dull and sleepy devotions will never be acceptable to God. Let us awake early in the morning, to begin the day with God; early in the beginning of a mercy. When God comes toward us with his favours, let us go forth to meet him with our praises. David desired to bring others to join in praising God; and in his psalms, he is still praising God among the people, singing to Him among the nations. Let us seek to have our hearts fixed to praise his boundless mercy and unfailing faithfulness; and to glorify him with body, soul, and spirit, which are his. Let us earnestly pray that the blessings of the gospel may be sent through every land.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people - So great a deliverance as he here hoped for, would make it proper that he should celebrate the praise of God in the most public manner; that he should make his goodness known as far as possible among the nations.

Michaelis notes that his desire has had a full accomplishment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/57.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>By means of the two distinctive tense-forms the poet describes his believing flight to God for refuge as that which has once taken place (&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1492; from &#1495;&#1505;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1505;&#1497; out of pause, like the same forms in <a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/122-6.htm">Psalm 122:6</a>), and still, because it is a living fact, is ever, and now in particular, renewed (&#1488;&#1495;&#1505;&#1492;). The shadow of the wings of God is the protection of His gentle, tender love; and the shadow of the wings is the quickening, cordial solace that is combined with this protection. Into this shadow the poet betakes himself for refuge now as he has done before, until &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., the abysmal danger that threatens him, be overpast, praeteriverit (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>, and on the enallage numeri <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-10.htm">Psalm 10:10</a>, Ges. &#1431;147, a). Not as though he would then no longer stand in need of the divine protection, but he now feels himself to be specially in need of it; and therefore his chief aim is an undaunted triumphant resistance of the impending trials. The effort on his own part, however, by means of which he always anew takes refuge in this shadow, is prayer to Him who dwells above and rules the universe. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; is without the article, which it never takes; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; (<a href="/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a>) is the same, because it is regularly left out before the participle, which admits of being more fully defined, <a href="/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-19.htm">Ezekiel 21:19</a> (Hitzig). He calls upon God who accomplisheth concerning, i.e., for him (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>), who carrieth out his cause, the cause of the persecuted one; &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; is transitive as in <a href="/psalms/138-8.htm">Psalm 138:8</a>. The lxx renders &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;, as though it were &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/13-6.htm">Psalm 13:6</a>, and frequently); and even Hitzig and Hupfeld hold that the meaning is exactly the same. But although &#1490;&#1502;&#1500; and &#1490;&#1502;&#1512; fall back upon one and the same radical notion, still it is just their distinctive final letters that serve to indicate a difference of signification that is strictly maintained. In <a href="/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a> follow futures of hope. In this instance "that which brings me deliverance" is to be supplied in thought to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; (cf. <a href="/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a>) and not &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7</a>; and this general and unmentioned object is then specialized and defined in the words "His mercy and His truth" in <a href="/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>. Mercy and truth are as it were the two good spirits, which descending from heaven to earth (cf. <a href="/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>) bring the divine &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; to an accomplishment. The words &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1508;&#1497; sdro standing between a and c have been drawn by the accentuators to the first half of the verse, they probably interpreting it thus: He (God) reproacheth my devourers for ever (Sela). But &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; always (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a>) has God as its object, not as its subject. &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1508;&#1497; is to be connected with what follows as a hypothetical protasis (Ges. 155, 4, a): supposing that he who is greedy or pants for me (inhians mihi) slandereth, then Elohim will send His mercy and His truth. The music that becomes forte in between, introduces and accompanies the throbbing confidence of the apodosis.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>, on the contrary, we may follow the interpretation of the text that is handed down and defined by the accentuation, natural as it may also be, with Luther and others, to take one's own course. Since &#1500;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (has Zarka (Zinnor) and &#1500;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; Olewejored, it is accordingly to be rendered: "My soul is in the midst of lions, I will (must) lie down with flaming ones; the children of men - their teeth are a spear and arrows." The rendering of the lxx, of Theodotion, and of the Syriac version accords with the interpunction of our text so far as both begin a new clause with &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; (&#1493;&#1491;&#1502;&#1499;&#1514;, and I slept); whereas Aquila and Symmachus (taking &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, as it seems, as a periphrastic expression of the subject-notion placed in advance) render all as afar as &#1500;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; as one clause, at least dividing the verse into two parts, just as the accentuators do, at &#1500;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;. The rendering of Aquila is &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;; that of Symmachus: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;; or according to another reading, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. They are followed by Jerome, who, however, in order that he may be able to reproduce the &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, changes &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492;: Anima mea in medio leonum dormivit ferocientium. This construction, however, can be used in Greek and Latin, but not in Hebrew. We therefore follow the accents even in reference to the Zarka above &#1500;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (a plural form that only occurs in this one passage in the Psalter,  equals  &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;). In a general way it is to be observed that this &#1500;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; in connection with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; is not so much the accusative of the object as the accusative of the place, although it may even be said to be the customary local accusative of the object with verbs of dwelling; on &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/3-8.htm">Ruth 3:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/3-14.htm">Ruth 3:14</a>, and <a href="/psalms/88-6.htm">Psalm 88:6</a>; <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a> (where at least the possibility of this construction of the verb is presupposed). But in particular it is doubtful (1) what &#1500;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; signifies. The rendering "flaming ones" is offered by the Targum, Saadia, and perhaps Symmachus. The verb &#1500;&#1492;&#1496; obtains this signification apparently from the fundamental notion of licking or swallowing; and accordingly Theodotion renders it by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, and Aquila most appropriately by &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (a word used of a ravenous furious longing for anything). But &#1500;&#1492;&#1496; nowhere means "to devour;" the poet must, therefore, in connection with &#1500;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, have been thinking of the flaming look or the fiery jaws of the lions, and this attributive will denote figuratively their strong desire, which snorts forth as it were flames of fire. The question further arises, (2) how the cohortative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492; is meant to be taken. Since the cohortative sometimes expresses that which is to be done more by outward constraint than inward impulse-never, however, without willing it one's self (Ew. 228, a) - the rendering "I must," or "therefore must I lie down," commends itself. But the contrast, which has been almost entirely overlooked, between the literal beasts of prey and the children of men, who are worse than these, requires the simple and most natural rendering of the cohortative. We need only picture to ourselves the situation. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489; here has the sense of cubitum ire (<a href="/psalms/4-9.htm">Psalm 4:9</a>). Starting from this &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492; we look to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-9.htm">Psalm 57:9</a>, and it at once becomes clear that we have before us an evening or nightly song. David the persecuted one finds himself in the wilderness and, if we accept the testimony of the inscription, in a cave: his soul is in the midst of lions, by which he means to say that his life is exposed to them. Here bold in faith, he is resolved to lie down to sleep, feeling himself more secure among lions than among men; for the children of men, his deadly foes both in word and in deed, are worse than beasts of prey: teeth and tongue are murderous weapons. This more than brutal joy at the destruction of one's neighbour <p>(Note: Cf. Sir. 25:15, in the Hebrew: &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1508;&#1514;&#1503; &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; (no poison exceeds the poison of the serpent, and no wrath exceeds the wrath of an enemy).)<p>which prevails among men, urges him to put forth the prayer that God, who in Himself is exalted above the heavens and the whole earth, would show Himself by some visible manifestation over the heavens above as the exalted One, and the prayer that His glory may be, i.e., may become manifest (or even: exalted be His glory, &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;), over the whole earth beneath, - His glory which to His saints is a health-diffusing light, and to the heartless foes of men and God a consuming fire, - so that the whole world shall be compelled to acknowledge this glory in which His holiness manifests itself, and shall become conformed to it after everything that is hostile is overthrown. </body></html>
