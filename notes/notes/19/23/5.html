In these words, the believer is taught to express his satisfaction in the care of the great Pastor of the universe, the Redeemer and Preserver of men. With joy he reflects that he has a shepherd, and that shepherd is Jehovah. A flock of sheep, gentle and harmless, feeding in verdant pastures, under the care of a skilful, watchful, and tender shepherd, forms an emblem of believers brought back to the Shepherd of their souls. The greatest abundance is but a dry pasture to a wicked man, who relishes in it only what pleases the senses; but to a godly man, who by faith tastes the goodness of God in all his enjoyments, though he has but little of the world, it is a green pasture. The Lord gives quiet and contentment in the mind, whatever the lot is. Are we blessed with the green pastures of the ordinances, let us not think it enough to pass through them, but let us abide in them. The consolations of the Holy Spirit are the still waters by which the saints are led; the streams which flow from the Fountain of living waters. Those only are led by the still waters of comfort, who walk in the paths of righteousness. The way of duty is the truly pleasant way. The work of righteousness in peace. In these paths we cannot walk, unless. God lead us into them, and lead us on in them. Discontent and distrust proceed from unbelief; an unsteady walk is the consequence: let us then simply trust our Shepherd's care, and hearken to his voice. The valley of the shadow of death may denote the most severe and terrible affliction, or dark dispensation of providence, that the psalmist ever could come under. Between the part of the flock on earth and that which is gone to heaven, death lies like a dark valley that must be passed in going from one to the other. But even in this there are words which lessen the terror. It is but the shadow of death: the shadow of a serpent will not sting, nor the shadow of a sword kill. It is a valley, deep indeed, and dark, and miry; but valleys are often fruitful, and so is death itself fruitful of comforts to God's people. It is a walk through it: they shall not be lost in this valley, but get safe to the mountain on the other side. Death is a king of terrors, but not to the sheep of Christ. When they come to die, God will rebuke the enemy; he will guide them with his rod, and sustain them with his staff. There is enough in the gospel to comfort the saints when dying, and underneath them are the everlasting arms. The Lord's people feast at his table, upon the provisions of his love. Satan and wicked men are not able to destroy their comforts, while they are anointed with the Holy Spirit, and drink of the cup of salvation which is ever full. Past experience teaches believers to trust that the goodness and mercy of God will follow them all the days of their lives, and it is their desire and determination, to seek their happiness in the service of God here, and they hope to enjoy his love for ever in heaven. While here, the Lord can make any situation pleasant, by the anointing of his Spirit and the joys of his salvation. But those that would be satisfied with the blessings of his house, must keep close to the duties of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou preparest a table - The image is now changed, though expressing the general idea which is indicated in the first verse of the psalm, "I shall not want." The evidence or proof of this in the previous verses is, that God was a shepherd, and would provide for him as a shepherd does for his flock; the evidence here is that God had provided a table, or a feast, for him in the very presence of his enemies, and had filled his cup with joy. The word "table" here is synonymous with "feast;" and the meaning is, "thou providest for my wants." There "may" be an allusion here to some particular period of the life of the psalmist, when he was in want, and when he perhaps felt an apprehension that he would perish, and when God had unexpectedly provided for his wants; but it is impossible now to determine to what occasion he thus refers. There were numerous occasions in the life of David which would be well represented by this language, "as if" God had provided a meal for him in the very "presence" of his foes, and in spite of them.<p>Before me - For me. It is spread in my presence, and for me.<p>In the presence of mine enemies - That is, in spite of them, or so that they could not prevent it. They were compelled to look on and see how God provided for him. It was manifest that this was from God; it was a proof of the divine favor; it furnished an assurance that he who had done this would never leave him to want. The friends of God are made to triumph in the very presence of their foes. Their enemies are compelled to see how He interposes in their behalf, how He provides for them, and how He defends them. Their final triumph in the day of judgment will be in the very presence of all their assembled enemies, for in their very presence He will pronounce the sentence which will make their eternal happiness sure, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-36</a>.<p>Thou anointest my head with oil - Margin, as in Hebrew, "makest fat." That is, thou dost pour oil on my head so abundantly that it seems to be made fat with it. The expression indicates abundance. The allusion is to the custom of anointing the head on festival occasions, as an indication of prosperity and rejoicing (see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-17.htm">Matthew 6:17</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/7-46.htm">Luke 7:46</a>, note), and the whole is indicative of the divine favor, of prosperity, and of joy.<p>My cup runneth over - It is not merely "full;" it runs over. This, too, indicates abundance; and from the abundance of the favors thus bestowed, the psalmist infers that God would always provide for him, and that He would never leave him to want. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

This beautiful Psalm most admirably sets before us, in its chief figure, that of a shepherd, the gentle, kind, and sure care extended to God's people, who, as a shepherd, both rules and feeds them. The closing verse shows that the blessings mentioned are spiritual.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thou furnishest me with plenty and variety of provisions and comforts, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">mine enemies</span> seeing, and envying, and fretting at it, but not being able to hinder it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With oil; </span> or, <span class="ital">ointment</span>, as the Syriac and Arabic interpreters render it; with aromatical ointments, which were then used at great feasts, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/92-10.htm" title="But my horn shall you exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.">Psalm 92:10</a> <a href="/amos/6-6.htm" title="That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.">Amos 6:6</a> <a href="/matthew/6-17.htm" title="But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;">Matthew 6:17</a> <a href="/luke/7-38.htm" title="And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.">Luke 7:38</a></span>.

In a providential way granting a sufficiency, and even an affluence of temporal good things; the providence of God lays and spreads a table for his people in the wilderness, and sets them down at it, and bids them welcome to it; see <a href="/psalms/78-19.htm">Psalm 78:19</a>; and in a way of grace, the Lord making large provisions in his house for them, called the goodness and fatness of his house, and a feast of fat things; and under the Gospel dispensation, the table of the Lord, on which are set his flesh and blood for faith to feed upon; see <a href="/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2</a>; and also in heaven, the joys of which are compared to a feast, and the enjoyment of them to sitting at a table, and which are prepared by the Lord for his people, from the foundation of the world; and of which they have some foresight and foretaste in this world; see <a href="/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>; and all this <p>in the presence of my enemies; they seeing and envying the outward prosperity of the saints, whenever they enjoy it, and their liberty of worshipping God, hearing his word, and attending on his ordinances, none making them afraid; as they will see, and envy, and be distressed at a more glorious state of the church yet to come, <a href="/revelation/11-12.htm">Revelation 11:12</a>; and even, as it should seem from the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, the glory and happiness of the saints in the other world will be seen, or by some way or other known, by wicked men; which will be an affliction to them, and an aggravation of their misery; though here it seems chiefly to regard the present life. Some have thought there is an allusion to princes, who, having conquered others, eat and feast at a well spread table in the presence of the conquered, and they being under it; see <a href="/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>; <p>thou anointest my head with oil; giving him an abundance of good things, not only for necessity, but for pleasure and delight; especially pouring out largely upon him the oil of gladness, the Spirit of God and his graces, the anointing which teaches all things, and filling him with spiritual joy and comfort; for this refers not to the anointing of David with material oil for the kingdom, by Samuel, while Saul was living, or by the men of Judah, and afterwards by all the tribes of Israel, when Saul was dead. The allusion is to the custom of the eastern countries, at feasts, to anoint the heads of the guests with oil; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:7</a>. It was usual to anoint the head, as well as other parts of the body, on certain occasions; hence that of Propertius (y): and in the times before Homer (z) it was usual both to wash and anoint before meals, and not the head only, but the feet also; which, though Pliny (a) represents as luxurious, was in use in Christ's time, <a href="/luke/7-38.htm">Luke 7:38</a>; and spoken of as an ancient custom by Aristophanes (b) his Scholiast for daughters to anoint the feet of their parents after they had washed them; which may serve to illustrate the passage in the Gospel; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>; <p>my cup runneth over; denoting an affluence of temporal good things, and especially of spiritual ones, which was David's case. Such who are blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ, to whom the grace of the Lord has been exceeding abundant, and the Lord himself is the portion of their cup, their cup may be said to run over indeed. <p>(y) "Terque lavet nostras spica cilissa comas", l. 4. eleg. 6. v. 74.

It is, as is clear from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27</a>, an eating that satisfies the soul, a spiritual meal, that is intended, and in fact, one that is brought about by the mighty act of rescue God has wrought. At the close of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, where the form of the ritual thank-offering is straightway ignored, &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/psalms/22-23.htm">Psalm 22:23</a>) takes the place of the &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;. There it is the view of one who is rescued and who thankfully glorifies God, which leads to others sharing with him in the enjoyment of the salvation he has experienced; here it is an actual enjoyment of it, the joy, springing from thankfulness, manifesting itself not merely in words but in a thank-offering feast, at which, in Israel, those who long for salvation are the invited guests, for with them it is an acknowledgment of the mighty act of a God whom they already know; but among the heathen, men of the most diversified conditions, the richest and the poorest, for to them it is a favour unexpectedly brought to them, and which is all the more gratefully embraced by them on that account. So magnificent shall be the feast, that all &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, i.e., those who stand out prominently before the world and before their own countrymen by reason of the abundance of their temporal possessions (compare on the ascensive use of &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-9.htm">Isaiah 23:9</a>), choose it before this abundance, in which they might revel, and, on account of the grace and glory which the celebration includes within itself, they bow down and worship. In antithesis to the "fat ones of the earth" stand those who go down to the dust (&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, always used in this formula of the dust of the grave, like the Arabic tura&#770;b) by reason of poverty and care. In the place of the participle &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; we now have with &#1493;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; ( equals  &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;) a clause with &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, which has the value of a relative clause (as in <a href="/psalms/49-21.htm">Psalm 49:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-39.htm">Psalm 78:39</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-13.htm">Proverbs 9:13</a>, and frequently): and they who have not heretofore prolonged and could not prolong their life (Ges. 123, 3, c). By comparing <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a> Hupfeld understands it to be those who are actually dead; so that it would mean, His kingdom extends to the living and the dead, to this world and the nether world. But any idea of a thankful adoration of God on the part of the dwellers in Hades is alien to the Old Testament; and there is nothing to force us to it here, since &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491; &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, can just as well mean descensuri as qui descenderunt, and &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; dna ,tnuredne &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (also in <a href="/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a>) means to preserve his own life, - a phrase which can be used in the sense of vitam sustentare and of conservare with equal propriety. It is, therefore, those who are almost dead already with care and want, these also (and how thankfully do these very ones) go down upon their knees, because they are accounted worthy to be guests at this table. It is the same great feast, of which Isaiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, prophesies, and which he there accompanies with the music of his words. And the result of this evangel of the mighty act of rescue is not only of boundless universality, but also of unlimited duration: it propagates itself from one generation to another.<p>Formerly we interpreted <a href="/psalms/22-31.htm">Psalm 22:31</a> "a seed, which shall serve Him, shall be reckoned to the Lord for a generation;" taking &#1497;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; as a metaphor applying to the census, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/87-6.htm">Psalm 87:6</a>, and &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, according to <a href="/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a> and other passages, as used of a totality of one kind, as &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; of the whole body of those of the same race. But the connection makes it more natural to take &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; in a genealogical sense; and, moreover, with the former interpretation it ought to have been &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; instead of &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;. We must therefore retain the customary interpretation: "a seed (posterity) shall serve Him, it shall be told concerning the Lord to the generation (to come)." Decisive in favour of this interpretation is &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; with the following &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, by which &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; acquires the meaning of the future generation, exactly as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-18.htm">Psalm 71:18</a>, inasmuch as it at once becomes clear, that three generations are distinctly mentioned, viz., that of the fathers who turn unto Jahve, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>, that of the coming &#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-31.htm">Psalm 22:31</a>, and &#1506;&#1501; &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;, to whom the news of the salvation is propagated by this &#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="/psalms/22-31.htm">Psalm 22:31</a> : "They shall come (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; as in <a href="/psalms/71-18.htm">Psalm 71:18</a> : to come into being), and shall declare His righteousness to the people that shall be born, that He hath finished." Accordingly &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; is the principal notion, which divides itself into (&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;) &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; and &#1506;&#1501; &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;; from which it is at once clear, why the expression could be thus general, "a posterity," inasmuch as it is defined by what follows. &#1506;&#1501; &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; is the people which shall be born, or whose birth is near at hand (<a href="/psalms/78-6.htm">Psalm 78:6</a>); the lxx well renders it: &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; (cf. <a href="/psalms/102-19.htm">Psalm 102:19</a> &#1506;&#1501; &#1504;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488; populus creandus). &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1514;&#1493; is the dikaiosu'nee of God, which has become manifest in the rescue of the great sufferer. That He did not suffer him to come down to the very border of death without snatching him out of the way of his murderous foes and raising him to a still greater glory, this was divine &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;. That He did not snatch him out of the way of his murderous foes without suffering him to be on the point of death - even this wrathful phase of the divine &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, is indicated in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>, but then only very remotely. For the fact, that the Servant of God, before spreading the feast accompanying the shelamim (thank-offering) in which He makes the whole world participants in the fruit of His suffering, offered Himself as an asham (sin-offering), does not become a subject of prophetic revelation until later on, and then under other typical relationships. The nature of the &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, which is in accordance with the determinate counsel of God, is only gradually disclosed in the Old Testament. This one word, so full of meaning (as in <a href="/psalms/52-11.htm">Psalm 52:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>), implying the carrying through of the work of redemption, which is prefigured in David, comprehends everything within itself. It may be compared to the &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>, at the close of the history of the creation. It is the last word of the Psalm, just as &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is the last word of the Crucified One. The substance of the gospel in its preparatory history and its fulfilment, of the declaration concerning God which passes from generation to generation, is this, that God has accomplished what He planned when He anointed the son of Jesse and the Son of David as mediator in His work of redemption; that He accomplished it by leading the former through affliction to the throne, and making the cross to the latter a ladder leading up to heaven. </body></html>
