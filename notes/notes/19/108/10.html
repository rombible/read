When the heart is firm in faith and love, the tongue, being employed in grateful praises, is our glory. Every gift of the Lord honours and profits the possessor, as it is employed in God's service and to his glory. Believers may pray with assured faith and hope, for all the blessings of salvation; which are secured to them by the faithful promise and covenant of God. Then let them expect from him help in every trouble, and victory in every conflict. Whatever we do, whatever we gain, God must have all the glory. Lord, visit all our souls with this salvation, with this favour which thou bearest to thy chosen people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/108.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who will bring me ... - This is taken, without alteration, from <a href="/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/108.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 108<p>Ps 108:1-13. This Psalm is composed of Ps 108:1-5 of Ps 57:7-11; and Ps 108:6-12 of Ps 60:5-12. The varieties are verbal and trivial, except that in Ps 108:9, "over Philistia will I triumph," differs from Ps 60:8, the interpretation of which it confirms. Its altogether triumphant tone may intimate that it was prepared by David, omitting the plaintive portions of the other Psalms, as commemorative of God's favor in the victories of His people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/108.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This he repeats in this place, either because, though the enemies were defeated and subdued, yet there was some strong city or cities which were not yet taken; or in way of thankful commemoration of God’s goodness in answering his former requests, as if he had said, I remember this day, to thy glory and my own comfort, my former straits and dangers, which made mile cry out, <span class="ital">Who will bring me</span>, &c.? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/108.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Over Philistia will I triumph,....
