Every gift of the Lord honours and profits the possessor, as it is employed in God's service and to his glory. Believers may pray with assured faith and hope, for all the blessings of salvation; which are secured to them by the faithful promise and covenant of God. Then let them expect from him help in every trouble, and victory in every conflict. Whatever we do, whatever we gain, God must have all the glory.

See the notes at <a href="/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a>, this is repeated: "My heart is fixed; O God, my heart is fixed:" indicating that there "might" have been some doubt or vacillation caused by the circumstances then existing, and the repetition would have respect to that, as if the psalmist had been unsettled and wavering for a time, but was at last firm. In such circumstances it would not be unnatural to "repeat" the assertion, as if there were no longer any doubt. In the beginning of a psalm, however, where there had been no previous expression or feeling of doubt so far as appears, there would be no propriety in repeating the assertion.<p>I will sing and give praise - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a>.<p>Even with my glory - This is not in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1-11</a>. It is literally here, "truly my glory." In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-8.htm">Psalm 57:8</a>, however, the expression, "Awake up, my glory," occurs, and this seems to correspond with that language. It means here that it was his glory - his honor - thus to be employed in giving praise to God. It was worthy of all that there was elevated in his nature; of all that constituted his glory; of his highest powers. At no time is man employed in a more noble and lofty work than praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/108.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 108<p>Ps 108:1-13. This Psalm is composed of Ps 108:1-5 of Ps 57:7-11; and Ps 108:6-12 of Ps 60:5-12. The varieties are verbal and trivial, except that in Ps 108:9, "over Philistia will I triumph," differs from Ps 60:8, the interpretation of which it confirms. Its altogether triumphant tone may intimate that it was prepared by David, omitting the plaintive portions of the other Psalms, as commemorative of God's favor in the victories of His people.   <a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/108.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.<p>2 Awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will awake early.<p>3 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people, and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.<p>4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.<p>5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;<p>These five verses are found in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7-11</a> almost verbatim: the only important alteration being the use of the great name of Jehovah in <a href="/psalms/108-3.htm">Psalm 108:3</a> instead of Adonai in <a href="/psalms/57-9.htm">Psalm 57:9</a>. This the English reader will only be able to perceive by the use of capitals in the present Psalm and not in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1-11</a>. There are other inconsiderable alterations, but the chief point of difference probably lies in the position of the verses. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1-11</a> these notes of praise follow prayer and grow out of it; but in this case the Psalmist begins at once to sing and give praise, and afterwards prays to God in a remarkably confident manner, so that he seems rather to seize the blessing than to entreat for it. Sometimes we must climb to praise by the ladder of prayer, and at other times we must bless God for the past in order to be able in faith to plead for the present and the future. By the aid of God's Spirit we can both pray ourselves up to praise, or praise the Lord till we get into a fit frame for prayer. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1-11</a> these words are a song in the cave of Adullam, and are the result of faith which is beginning its battles amid domestic enemies of the most malicious kind: but here they express the continued resolve and praise of a man who has already weathered many a campaign, has overcome all home conflicts, and is looking forward to conquests far and wide. The passage served as a fine close for one Psalm, and it makes an equally noteworthy opening for another. We cannot too often with fixed heart resolve to magnify the Lord; nor need we ever hesitate to use the same words in drawing near to God, for the Lord who cannot endure vain repetitions is equally weary of vain variations. Some expressions are so admirable that they ought to be used again: who would throw away a cup because he drank from it before? God should be served with the best words, and when we have them they are surely good enough to be used twice. To use the same words continually and never utter a new song would show great slothfulness, and would lead to dead formalism, but we need not regard novelty of language as at all essential to devotion, nor strain after it as an urgent necessity. It may be that our heavenly Father would here teach us that if we are unable to find a great variety of suitable expressions in devotion, we need not in the slightest degree distress ourselves, but may either pray or praise, "using the same words."<p><a href="/psalms/108-1.htm">Psalm 108:1</a><p>"O God, my heart is fixed." Though I have many wars to disturb me, and many cares to toss me to and fro, yet I am settled in one mind and cannot be driven from it. My heart has taken hold and abides in one resolve. Thy grace has overcome the fickleness of nature, and I am now in a resolute and determined frame of mind. "I will sing and give praise." Both with voice and music will I extol thee - "I will sing and play," as some read it. Even though I have to shout in the battle I will also sing in my soul, and if my fingers must needs be engaged with the bow, yet shall they also touch the ten-stringed instrument and show forth thy praise. "Even with my glory" - with my intellect, my tongue, my poetic faculty, my musical skill, or whatever else causes me to be renowned, and confers honour upon me. It is my glory to be able to speak and not to be a dumb animal, therefore my voice shall show forth thy praise; it is my glory to know God and not to be a heathen, and therefore my instructed intellect shall adore thee; it is my glory to be a saint and no more a rebel, therefore the grace I have received shall bless thee; it is my glory to be immortal and not a mere brute which perisheth, therefore my inmost life shall celebrate thy majesty. When he says I will, he supposes that there might be some temptation to refrain, but this he puts on one side, and with fixed heart prepares himself for the joyful engagement. He who sings with a fixed heart is likely to sing on, and all the while to sing well.<p><a href="/psalms/108-2.htm">Psalm 108:2</a><p>"Awake, psaltery and harp." As if he could not be content with voice alone, but must use the well-tuned strings, and communicate to them something of his own liveliness. Strings are wonderful things when some men play upon them, they seem to become sympathetic and incorporated with the minstrel, as if his very soul were imparted to them and thrilled through them. Only when a thoroughly enraptured soul speaks in the instrument can music be acceptable with God: as mere musical sound the Lord can have no pleasure therein, he is only pleased with the thought and feeling which are thus expressed. When a man has musical gift, he should regard it as too lovely a power to be enlisted in the cause of sin.
