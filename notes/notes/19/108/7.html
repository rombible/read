When the heart is firm in faith and love, the tongue, being employed in grateful praises, is our glory. Every gift of the Lord honours and profits the possessor, as it is employed in God's service and to his glory. Believers may pray with assured faith and hope, for all the blessings of salvation; which are secured to them by the faithful promise and covenant of God. Then let them expect from him help in every trouble, and victory in every conflict. Whatever we do, whatever we gain, God must have all the glory. Lord, visit all our souls with this salvation, with this favour which thou bearest to thy chosen people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/108.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God hath spoken ... - This is taken, without change, from <a href="/psalms/60-6.htm">Psalm 60:6</a>.

This Psalm is composed of Ps 108:1-5 of Ps 57:7-11; and Ps 108:6-12 of Ps 60:5-12. The varieties are verbal and trivial, except that in Ps 108:9, "over Philistia will I triumph," differs from Ps 60:8, the interpretation of which it confirms. Its altogether triumphant tone may intimate that it was prepared by David, omitting the plaintive portions of the other Psalms, as commemorative of God's favor in the victories of His people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/108.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/108.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That thy beloved may be delivered,....

He makes Ephraim the chief defence of His kingdom, and Judah the seat of government, while surrounding nations are treated as vassals. It is possible that the original Psalmist was quoting some actual oracle, but more probably he was reproducing freely in poetical form the drift of the great promise to David (<a href="/context/2_samuel/7-9.htm" title="And I was with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies out of your sight, and have made you a great name, like to the name of the great men that are in the earth....">2 Samuel 7:9-10</a>).

These two places in particular may be named, because of their connexion with the history of Jacob, who halted first at Succoth and then at Shechem, when he returned to Canaan (<a href="/context/genesis/33-17.htm" title="And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth....">Genesis 33:17-18</a>).
