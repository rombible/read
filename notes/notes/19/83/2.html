But then we may call upon him, as the psalmist here. All wicked people are God's enemies, especially wicked persecutors. The Lord's people are his hidden one; the world knows them not. He takes them under his special protection. Do the enemies of the church act with one consent to destroy it, and shall not the friends of the church be united? Wicked men wish that there might be no religion among mankind. They would gladly see all its restraints shaken off, and all that preach, profess, or practise it, cut off. This they would bring to pass if it were in their power. The enemies of God's church have always been many: this magnifies the power of the Lord in preserving to himself a church in the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/83.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult - Are excited; are aroused; are moving in a wild, furious, tumultuous manner, rushing on to the accomplishment of their designs.

The "congregation of God" is, as in <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>; <a href="/joshua/22-16.htm">Joshua 22:16</a>., "the congregation of (the sons of) Israel," which God has purchased from among the nations (<a href="/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2</a>), and upon which as its Lawgiver He has set His divine impress. The psalmist and seer sees Elohim standing in this congregation of God. The part. Niph. (as in <a href="/isaiah/3-13.htm">Isaiah 3:13</a>) denotes not so much the suddenness and unpreparedness, as, rather, the statue-like immobility and terrifying designfulness of His appearance. Within the range of the congregation of God this holds good of the elohim. The right over life and death, with which the administration of justice cannot dispense, is a prerogative of God. From the time of <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, however, He has transferred the execution of this prerogative to mankind, and instituted in mankind an office wielding the sword of justice, which also exists in His theocratic congregation, but here has His positive law as the basis of its continuance and as the rule of its action. Everywhere among men, but here pre-eminently, those in authority are God's delegates and the bearers of His image, and therefore as His representatives are also themselves called elohim, "gods" (which the lxx in <a href="/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a> renders &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, and the Targums here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7-8</a>, <a href="/exodus/22-27.htm">Exodus 22:27</a> uniformly, &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;). The God who has conferred this exercise of power upon these subordinate elohim, without their resigning it of themselves, now sits in judgment in their midst. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; of that which takes place before the mind's eye of the psalmist. How long, He asks, will ye judge unjustly? &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500; is equivalent to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>, <a href="/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35</a> (the opposite is &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>). How long will ye accept the countenance of the wicked, i.e., incline to accept, regard, favour the person of the wicked? The music, which here becomes forte, gives intensity to the terrible sternness (das Niederdonnernde) of the divine question, which seeks to bring the "gods" of the earth to their right mind. Then follow admonitions to do that which they have hitherto left undone. They are to cause the benefit of the administration of justice to tend to the advantage of the defenceless, of the destitute, and of the helpless, upon whom God the Lawgiver especially keeps His eye. The word &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;), of which there is no evidence until within the time of David and Solomon, is synonymous with &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;. &#1491;&#1500; with &#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501; is pointed &#1491;&#1500;, and with &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, on account of the closer notional union, &#1491;&#1500; (as in <a href="/psalms/72-13.htm">Psalm 72:13</a>). They are words which are frequently repeated in the prophets, foremost in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>), with which is enjoined upon those invested with the dignity of the law, and with jurisdiction, justice towards those who cannot and will not themselves obtain their rights by violence. </body></html>
