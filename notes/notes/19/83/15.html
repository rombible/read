God is the same still that ever he was; the same to his people, and the same against his and their enemies. God would make their enemies like a wheel; unsettled in all their counsels and resolves. Not only let them be driven away as stubble, but burnt as stubble. And this will be the end of wicked men. Let them be made to fear thy name, and perhaps that will bring them to seek thy name. We should desire no confusion to our enemies and persecutors but what may forward their conversion. The stormy tempest of Divine vengeance will overtake them, unless they repent and seek the pardoning mercy of their offended Lord. God's triumphs over his enemies, clearly prove that he is, according to his name JEHOVAH, an almighty Being, who has all power and perfection in himself. May we fear his wrath, and yield ourselves to be his willing servants. And let us seek deliverance by the destruction of our fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/83.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So persecute them - So pursue them; so follow them up. The word "persecute" is now used in a somewhat different sense, as denoting pain or suffering inflicted on account of religious opinion. It means here simply to pursue.<p>With thy tempest - With the expressions of thy displeasure; with punishment which may be compared with the fury of a storm.<p>And make them afraid with thy storm - Or, Make them afraid, terrify them, so that they will flee away. As all that is here sought by prayer is what people endeavor to do when an enemy invades their country - as they make arrangements for repelling those enemies, and overthrowing them, and as they feel that it is right to do so - there is no impropriety in making this the subject of prayer to God. What it is right for men to attempt, it is right to pray for; what it would be right for them to do if they had the power, it is right to ask God to accomplish; what is free from malignity in the act, and in the design, may be free from malignity in the desire and the prayer; and if men can carry with them the idea that what they are endeavoring to do is right, whether as magistrates, judges, rulers, defenders of their country, or as private men, they will have very little difficulty in regard to the so-called "imprecatory psalms."

Pursue them with thy fury, follow them with thy vengeance; cause it to fall upon them like a mighty tempest: <p>and make them afraid with thy storm; God has his storms and tempests of wrath and vengeance, which he sometimes causes to fall upon wicked men in this life, to their inexpressible terror, and with which he takes them out of this world; and he has still more horrible ones to rain upon them hereafter: see <a href="/job/27-20.htm">Job 27:20</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/83.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/83.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm</span>. There is some confusion of metaphors; but the general meaning is clear. God is called upon to execute vengeance upon Israel's enemies by sweeping them away with the storm and tempest of his wrath (comp. <a href="/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/83.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; reference is made to Gideon's victory over the Midianites, which belongs to the most glorious recollections of Israel, and to which in other instances, too, national hopes are attached, <a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a> [4], <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>, cf. <a href="/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a>; and with the asyndeton &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1505;&#1512;&#1488; &#1499;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; (&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1505;&#1512;&#1488;, as Norzi states, who does not rightly understand the placing of the Metheg) to the victory of Barak and Deborah over Sisera and the Canaanitish king Jabin, whose general he was. The Beth of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is like the Beth of &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; in <a href="/psalms/110-7.htm">Psalm 110:7</a> : according to <a href="/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a> the Kishon carried away the corpses of the slain army. &#8219;Endo&#770;r, near Tabor, and therefore situated not far distant from Taanach and Megiddo (<a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>), belonged to the battle-field. &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;, starting from the radical notion of that which flatly covers anything, which lies in &#1491;&#1501;, signifying the covering of earth lying flat over the globe, therefore humus (like &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, terra, and &#1514;&#1489;&#1500;, tellus), is here (cf. <a href="/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>) in accord with &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503; (from &#1491;&#1502;&#1503;), which is in substance akin to it. In <a href="/psalms/83-12.htm">Psalm 83:12</a> we have a retrospective glance at Gideon's victory. &#8219;Oreb and Zee&#772;b were &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; of the Midianites, <a href="/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>; Zebach and Tsalmunna&#8219;, their kings, <a href="/judges/8-5.htm">Judges 8:5</a>.<p>(Note: The Syriac Hexapla has (<a href="/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>) &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1506; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1503;, a substitution which is accepted by Geiger, Deutsch. Morgenlnd. Zeitschr. 1862, S. 729f. Concerning the signification of the above names of Midianitish princes, vid., Nldeke, Ueber die Amalekiter, S. 9.)<p>The pronoun precedes the word itself in &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1493;, as in <a href="/exodus/2-6.htm">Exodus 2:6</a>; the heaped-up suffixes e&#772;mo (e&#770;mo) give to the imprecation a rhythm and sound as of rolling thunder. Concerning &#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1498;, vid., on <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>. So far as the matter is concerned, <a href="/2_chronicles/20-11.htm">2 Chronicles 20:11</a> harmonizes with <a href="/psalms/83-13.htm">Psalm 83:13</a>.
