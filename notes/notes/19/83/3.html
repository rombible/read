But then we may call upon him, as the psalmist here. All wicked people are God's enemies, especially wicked persecutors. The Lord's people are his hidden one; the world knows them not. He takes them under his special protection. Do the enemies of the church act with one consent to destroy it, and shall not the friends of the church be united? Wicked men wish that there might be no religion among mankind. They would gladly see all its restraints shaken off, and all that preach, profess, or practise it, cut off. This they would bring to pass if it were in their power. The enemies of God's church have always been many: this magnifies the power of the Lord in preserving to himself a church in the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/83.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They have taken crafty counsel - The one word translated "have taken crafty" - &#1506;&#1512;&#1501;  &#8219;a&#770;ram - means properly to make naked; and then, to be crafty, cunning, malignant, <a href="/1_samuel/23-22.htm">1 Samuel 23:22</a>. It is well rendered here, they have taken crafty counsel. The meaning is, they have made their counsel or their consultations crafty, cunning, artful, malignant. Instead of pursuing a course in their deliberations that would be just, true, honorable, they have followed the reverse. On the word rendered "counsel" - &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;  so&#770;d - which means a couch or cushion, and hence, a divan - see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/64-2.htm">Psalm 64:2</a>, note. The idea here is, that the persons referred to in the subsequent part of the psalm (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/83-6.htm">Psalm 83:6-8</a>) had been assembled in a divan, or for consultation, and that they had there formed a malignant plan - against God and his people - which they were now proceeding to execute.<p>Against thy people - For the purpose of destroying them.<p>And consulted against thy hidden ones - The word rendered "hidden ones" - from the verb &#1510;&#1508;&#1503;  tsa&#770;phan, to hide, to conceal - properly denotes that which is secret, private, inaccessible <a href="/ezekiel/7-22.htm">Ezekiel 7:22</a>; and then, anything protected or hidden so as to be secure. Compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>. It would seem here to refer to those who were so protected by Yahweh - so inaccessible to others by reason of his guardian care - that they would be safe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/83.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. hidden ones&#8212;whom God specially protects (Ps 27:5; 91:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/83.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Thy people of Israel, as it is explained in the foregoing words, and in the next verse; who are called God’s hidden or secret ones, to intimate the singular care and respect which God hath to them, as to his peculiar treasure, as they are called, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a> <a href="/psalms/135-4.htm" title="For the LORD has chosen Jacob to himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.">Psalm 135:4</a></span>, whom he will hide and preserve in the secret of his presence, and under the shadow of his wings; and withal, to note their folly in seeking the destruction of those whom God was engaged and resolved to protect. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/83.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They have taken crafty counsel against thy people,....

In connection with this way of taking <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a>, the manner in which the divine language is continued in <a href="/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a> is harsh and unadjusted. God Himself speaks in <a href="/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a> of the judges, but reluctantly alienated from them; and confident of the futility of all attempts to make them better, He tells them their sentence in <a href="/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>. The verbs in <a href="/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a> are designedly without any object: complaint of the widest compass is made over their want of reason and understanding; and &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493; takes the perfect form in like manner to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;, noverunt, cf. <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-18.htm">Isaiah 44:18</a>. Thus, then, no result is to be expected from the divine admonition: they still go their ways in this state of mental darkness, and that, as the Hithpa. implies, stalking on in carnal security and self-complacency. The commands, however, which they transgress are the foundations (cf. <a href="/psalms/11-3.htm">Psalm 11:3</a>), as it were the shafts and pillars (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4</a>, cf. <a href="/proverbs/29-4.htm">Proverbs 29:4</a>), upon which rests the permanence of all earthly relationships with are appointed by creation and regulated by the T&#x3c4;ra. Their transgression makes the land, the earth, to totter physically and morally, and is the prelude of its overthrow. When the celestial Lord of the domain thinks upon this destruction which injustice and tyranny are bringing upon the earth, His wrath kindles, and He reminds the judges and rulers that it is His own free declaratory act which has clothed them with the god-like dignity which they bear. They are actually elohim, but not possessed of the right of self-government; there is a Most High (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;) to whom they as sons are responsible. The idea that the appellation elohim, which they have given to themselves, is only sarcastically given back to them in <a href="/psalms/82-1.htm">Psalm 82:1</a> (Ewald, Olshausen), is refuted by <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>, according to which they are really elohim by the grace of God. But if their practice is not an Amen to this name, then they shall be divested of the majesty which they have forfeited; they shall be divested of the prerogative of Israel, whose vocation and destiny they have belied. They shall die off &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, like common men not rising in any degree above the mass (cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, opp. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-3.htm">Psalm 49:3</a>); they shall fall like any one (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-7.htm">Judges 16:7</a>, <a href="/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>) of the princes who in the course of history have been cast down by the judgment of God (<a href="/hosea/7-7.htm">Hosea 7:7</a>). Their divine office will not protect them. For although justitia civilis is far from being the righteousness that avails before God, yet injustitia civilis is in His sight the vilest abomination. </body></html>
