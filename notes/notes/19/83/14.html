God is the same still that ever he was; the same to his people, and the same against his and their enemies. God would make their enemies like a wheel; unsettled in all their counsels and resolves. Not only let them be driven away as stubble, but burnt as stubble. And this will be the end of wicked men. Let them be made to fear thy name, and perhaps that will bring them to seek thy name. We should desire no confusion to our enemies and persecutors but what may forward their conversion. The stormy tempest of Divine vengeance will overtake them, unless they repent and seek the pardoning mercy of their offended Lord. God's triumphs over his enemies, clearly prove that he is, according to his name JEHOVAH, an almighty Being, who has all power and perfection in himself. May we fear his wrath, and yield ourselves to be his willing servants. And let us seek deliverance by the destruction of our fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/83.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the fire burneth a wood ... - The same idea is here presented under another form. No image of desolation is more fearful than that of fire raging in a forest; or of fire on the mountains.

Of the confederate peoples the chronicler (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20</a>) mentions the Moabites, the Ammonites, the inhabitants of Mount Ser, and the Me(unim, instead of which Josephus, Antiq. ix. 1. 2, says: a great body of Arabians. This crowd of peoples comes from the other side of the Dead Sea, &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; (as it is to be read in <a href="/psalms/83-2.htm">Psalm 83:2</a> in the chronicler instead of &#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1501;, cf. on <a href="/psalms/60-2.htm">Psalm 60:2</a>); the territory of Edom, which is mentioned first by the poet, was therefore the rendezvous. The tents of Edom and of the Ishmaelites are (cf. Arab. ahl, people) the people themselves who live in tents. Moreover, too, the poet ranges the hostile nations according to their geographical position. The seven first named from Edom to Amalek, which still existed at the time of the psalmist (for the final destruction of the Amalekites by the Simeonites, <a href="/1_chronicles/4-42.htm">1 Chronicles 4:42</a>., falls at an indeterminate period prior to the Exile), are those out of the regions east and south-east of the Dead Sea. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a>, the Ishmaelites had spread from Higz through the peninsula of Sinai beyond the eastern and southern deserts as far up as the countries under the dominion of Assyria.

Then follow the Philistines and Phoenicians, the two nations of the coast of the Mediterranean, which also appear in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1-15</a> (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3.htm">Joel 3</a>) as making common cause with the Edomites against Israel.
