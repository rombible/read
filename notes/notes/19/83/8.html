But then we may call upon him, as the psalmist here. All wicked people are God's enemies, especially wicked persecutors. The Lord's people are his hidden one; the world knows them not. He takes them under his special protection. Do the enemies of the church act with one consent to destroy it, and shall not the friends of the church be united? Wicked men wish that there might be no religion among mankind. They would gladly see all its restraints shaken off, and all that preach, profess, or practise it, cut off. This they would bring to pass if it were in their power. The enemies of God's church have always been many: this magnifies the power of the Lord in preserving to himself a church in the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/83.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Assur also is joined with them - Assyria. Assyria was on the northeast of Palestine. The conspirators had secured, it seems, the aid of this powerful kingdom, and they felt confident of success.<p>They have holpen the children of Lot - The sons, or the descendants of Lot. The margin is, as the Hebrew, "been an arm to." That is, they were an aid, or help; in other words, the sons of Lot were permitted, as it were, to make use of the arm of these powerful nations in accomplishing their purposes. The sons of Lot were Moab and Ammon, the ancestors of the Moabites and the Ammonites, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37-38</a>. It would appear from this, that the purpose of destroying the Hebrew people had been originated by the Moabites and Ammonites, and that they had called in the aid of the surrounding nations to enable them to carry out their plan. The enumeration of those who had joined in the alliance shows that all the nations adjacent to Palestine, on every side, had entered into the agreement, so that the land was completely encompassed, or hemmed in, by enemies. In these circumstances, the conspirators felt secure; in these circumstances, the Hebrew people had no resource but to call upon God. Thus it often occurs that the people of God are so surrounded by enemies, or are so hemmed in by troubles and trials, that they have no other resource than this: they are shut up to the necessity of prayer. Often God so orders, or permits things to occur, as to cut off his people from every other dependence, and to make them feel that there is no help for them but in Him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/83.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-8. tabernacles&#8212;for people (Ps 78:67).<p>they&#8212;all these united with the children of Lot, or Ammonites and Moabites (compare 2Ch 20:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/83.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Is joined with them</span> in their counsels, and possibly with some of their forces, though not so openly and powerfully as afterwards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The children of Lot; </span> Moab and Ammon, who were the principal parties in that war, <span class="bld">2 Chronicles 20</span>, called here the children of Lot, to intimate their horrible degeneration from their pious progenitors. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/83.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Assur also is joined with them,.... Before mentioned, or Assyria, though at so great a distance from Israel, and unprovoked by them: according to R. Joseph Kimchi, the sense is, that the Assyrians joined them, continuing in their wickedness, though their army had been destroyed by an angel in Hezekiah's time, of which they were unmindful; but this, as his son observes, makes this confederacy and war to be after the times of Hezekiah; whereas it was long before it: the Targum is, <p>"Sennacherib, king of Syria, is joined with them;'' <p>and so some refer this to his invasion of Judea, and besieging Jerusalem, with an army consisting of many nations, in Hezekiah's time; but he was the principal there, and not an auxiliary, as here: <p>they have holpen the children of Lot; or were "an arm" (h) unto them, assisted and strengthened them: these were the Moabites and Ammonites, who were the principals in the war, and the rest auxiliaries, as it appears they were in the times of Jehoshaphat, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1</a>, here were ten different nations, which joined in confederacy against the people of Israel; to which answer the ten horns of the beast, or ten antichristian kings, who agreed to give their kingdom to the beast, and to make war with the Lamb and his followers, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>, and it may be observed, that these were on all sides of the land of Israel; the Edomites, Ishmaelites, and Amalekites, were on the south; the Moabites, Ammonites, and Hagarenes, were on the east; the Assyrians on the north; and the Philistines, Gebalites, and Tyrians, on the west: so that Israel was surrounded on all sides with enemies, as the Lord's people are troubled on every side, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>, and so the Gog and Magog army, of which some understand this, will encompass the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city, <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a>. <p>Selah.

The mention of Assyria as an auxiliary of Moab and Ammon seems to imply that it was not yet a leading power, which would fall in with an early date for the Psalm. Assyria is not known to have come in contact with Israel until the reign of Jehu, who paid tribute to Shalmaneser II in b.c. 842. Still in the time of Jehoshaphat the Assyrians appear to have made conquests in Phoenicia and Syria, and the Ammonites might have procured help from them as they did from Syria at an earlier date (<a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm" title="And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.">2 Samuel 10:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If the Psalm belongs to the Persian or Maccabaean age, Assyria must stand for Persia or Syria. Theodoret suggests that the Samaritans, as Assyrian colonists, are meant. Lagarde, followed by Cheyne, cuts the knot by reading <span class="ital">Geshur</span> for <span class="ital">Asshur</span> (see <a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;">2 Samuel 3:3</a>); but this petty Syrian kingdom would hardly be mentioned as an important ally.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they have holpen</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">they have been an arm</span>, i.e. a help.

The phrase occurs in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm" title="And when you come near over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>, the only other passages in O.T. outside of Genesis where Lot is mentioned.

Assyria - the great empire - the most important of all the kingdoms of the earth - has joined the petty nations upon Israel's border, and  holds a place in the great confederacy. From the historical books it would appear that this occurred but once, viz. in David's great war with the Ammonites and their allies (see the Introduction). <span class="cmt_word">They have holpen the children of Lot</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Moabites and Ammonites (comp. <a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37, 38</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9, 19</a>).
