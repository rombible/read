Praise God for his sanctuary, and the privileges we enjoy by having it among us; praise him because of his power and glory in the firmament. Those who praise the Lord in heaven, behold displays of his power and glory which we cannot now conceive. But the greatest of all his mighty acts is known in his earthly sanctuary. The holiness and the love of our God are more displayed in man's redemption, than in all his other works. Let us praise our God and Saviour for it. We need not care to know what instruments of music are mentioned. Hereby is meant that in serving God we should spare no cost or pains. Praise God with strong faith; praise him with holy love and delight; praise him with entire confidence in Christ; praise him with believing triumph over the powers of darkness; praise him by universal respect to all his commands; praise him by cheerful submission to all his disposals; praise him by rejoicing in his love, and comforting ourselves in his goodness; praise him by promoting the interests of the kingdom of his grace; praise him by lively hope and expectation of the kingdom of his glory. Since we must shortly breathe our last, while we have breath let us praise the Lord; then we shall breathe our last with comfort. Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord. Such is the very suitable end of a book inspired by the Spirit of God, written for the work of praise; a book which has supplied the songs of the church for more than three thousand years; a book which is quoted more frequently than any other by Christ and his apostles; a book which presents the loftiest ideas of God and his government, which is fitted to every state of human life, which sets forth every state of religious experience, and which bears simple and clear marks of its Divine origin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/150.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Praise him for his mighty acts - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a> : "One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts." The Hebrew word is the same. The reference is to that which displays the power of God; the things which manifest his omnipotence.<p>Praise him according to his excellent greatness - Hebrew, the multitude of his greatness. Let the praise in elevation correspond with this; let it be such as shall properly express this; let all be employed that will contribute to make this known, or that will be appropriate to this. Hence, the psalmist proceeds to call on all to make use of everything, by instrument and voice, that would in any manner set forth the praise of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/150.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. mighty acts&#8212;(Ps 145:4).<p>excellent greatness&#8212;or, abundance of greatness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/150.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As his infinite majesty deserves to be praised. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/150.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Praise him for his mighty acts,....

Such a new era has now dawned for the church of the saints, the Israel that has remained faithful to its God and the faith of its fathers. The Creator of Israel (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1493;, plural, with the plural suffix, like &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>, cf. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493; in <a href="/job/40-19.htm">Job 40:19</a>; according to Hupfeld and Hitzig, cf. Ew. 256, b, Ges. 93, 9, singular; but aj, ajich, aw, are always really plural suffixes) has shown that He is also Israel's Preserver and the King of Zion, that He cannot leave the children of Zion for any length of time under foreign dominion, and has heard the sighing of the exiles (<a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-13.htm">Isaiah 26:13</a>). Therefore the church newly appropriated by its God and King is to celebrate Him, whose Name shines forth anew out of its history, with festive dance, timbrel, and cithern. For (as the occasion, hitherto only hinted at, is now expressly stated) Jahve takes a pleasure in His people; His wrath in comparison with His mercy is only like a swiftly passing moment (<a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>.). The futures that follow state that which is going on at the present time. &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; is, as frequently, a designation of the ecclesia pressa, which has hitherto, amidst patient endurance of suffering, waited for God's own act of redemption. He now adorns them with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, help against the victory over the hostile world; now the saints, hitherto enslaved and contemned, exult &#1489;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, in honour, or on account of the honour which vindicates them before the world and is anew bestowed upon them (&#1489;&#1468; of the reason, or, which is more probable in connection with the boldness of the expression, of the state and mood);<p>(Note: Such, too (with pomp, not "with an army"), is the meaning of &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; in 1 Macc. 10:60; 14:4, 5, vid., Grimm in loc.))<p>they shout for joy upon their beds, upon which they have hitherto poured forth their complaints over the present (cf. <a href="/hosea/7-14.htm">Hosea 7:14</a>), and ardently longed for a better future (<a href="/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>); for the bed is the place of soliloquy (<a href="/psalms/4-5.htm">Psalm 4:5</a>), and the tears shed there (<a href="/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>) are turned into shouts of joy in the case of Israel. </body></html>
