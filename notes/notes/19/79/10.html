How unrighteous soever men were, the Lord was righteous in permitting them to do what they did. Deliverances from trouble are mercies indeed, when grounded upon the pardon of sin; we should therefore be more earnest in prayer for the removal of our sins than for the removal of afflictions. They had no hopes but from God's mercies, his tender mercies. They plead no merit, they pretend to none, but, Help us for the glory of thy name; pardon us for thy name's sake. The Christian forgets not that he is often bound in the chain of his sins. The world to him is a prison; sentence of death is passed upon him, and he knows not how soon it may be executed. How fervently should he at all times pray, O let the sighing of a prisoner come before thee, according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die! How glorious will the day be, when, triumphant over sin and sorrow, the church beholds the adversary disarmed for ever! while that church shall, from age to age, sing the praises of her great Shepherd and Bishop, her King and her God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/79.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore should the heathen say Where is their God? - The nations. Why should such a course of forbearance toward them be pursued as to lead them to ask the question whether God is able to punish them, or to come to the conclusion that he is not the God of those who profess to worship him. See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-10.htm">Psalm 42:10</a>, note.<p>Let him be known among the heathen - Let him so manifest himself among them that they cannot but see that he is God; that he is a just God; that he is the Friend and Protector of his people.<p>In our sight - So that we may see it; or, so that it may be seen that he is our Friend and Protector.<p>By the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed - Margin, vengeance. The true idea is, "Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants - the blood poured out, or shed, be known among the nations in our sight." The prayer is that God would so interpose that there could be no doubt that it was on account of the blood of his people which had been shed by their enemies. It is a prayer that just punishment might be executed - a prayer which may be offered at anytime. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/79.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.
