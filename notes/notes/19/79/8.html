How unrighteous soever men were, the Lord was righteous in permitting them to do what they did. Deliverances from trouble are mercies indeed, when grounded upon the pardon of sin; we should therefore be more earnest in prayer for the removal of our sins than for the removal of afflictions. They had no hopes but from God's mercies, his tender mercies. They plead no merit, they pretend to none, but, Help us for the glory of thy name; pardon us for thy name's sake. The Christian forgets not that he is often bound in the chain of his sins. The world to him is a prison; sentence of death is passed upon him, and he knows not how soon it may be executed. How fervently should he at all times pray, O let the sighing of a prisoner come before thee, according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die! How glorious will the day be, when, triumphant over sin and sorrow, the church beholds the adversary disarmed for ever! while that church shall, from age to age, sing the praises of her great Shepherd and Bishop, her King and her God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/79.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O remember not against us forrmer iniquities - Margin, The iniquities of them that were before us. The Hebrew may mean either former times, or former generations. The allusion, however, is substantially the same. It is not their own iniquities which are particularly referred to, but the iniquity of the nation as committed in former times; and the prayer is, that God would not visit them with the results of the sins of former generations, though their own ancestors. The language is derived from the idea so constantly affirmed in the Scripture, and so often illustrated in fact, that the effects of sin pass over from one generation to the next, and involve it in calamity.

The word prevent here, as elsewhere in the Scriptures, does not mean to hinder, as with us, but to go before; to anticipate. See <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3-12.htm">Job 3:12</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/21-3.htm">Psalm 21:3</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-14.htm">Isaiah 21:14</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/17-25.htm">Matthew 17:25</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>, note. The prayer here is, that God, in his tender mercy or compassion, would anticipate their ruin; would interpose before matters had gone so far as to make their destruction inevitable.<p>For we are brought very low - The idea in the original word is that of being pendulous, or hanging down - as vines do, or as anything does that is wilted, or withered, or as the hands do when one is weak, faint, or sick. Then it refers to a failure or exhaustion of strength; and the idea here is that their strength as a nation was exhausted. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/79.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. former iniquities&#8212;literally, "iniquities of former times."<p>prevent us&#8212;literally, "meet us," as in Ps 21:3.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/79.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Former iniquities; </span> the sins committed by our forefathers, and by us, who have filled up the measure of their sins, for which we confess thou hast most righteously brought this desolating judgment upon us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy tender mercies; </span> upon which all our confidence is fixed; for merit and righteousness we have none.

Or, "our ancient iniquities", as the Septuagint; the most ancient sin of all is that of our first parents, in which we are involved, and by which we are made sinners; and for which judgment comes upon all men; and from thence flows the corruption of nature, or that original sin of our nature in which we are all conceived and born, and so are transgressors from the womb; or iniquities of former times, of our youth, as Kimchi, sins done of old, committed long ago, in the youthful age, see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/25-7.htm">Psalm 25:7</a>, or the sins of former persons, of our fathers, as Aben Ezra, which the Lord visits sometimes upon the children: some think reference is had to the sin of their forefathers in making and worshipping the golden calf; the Jews (e) have a saying, that there is no punishment happens to Israel, but there is an ounce in it for the sin of the calf; their meaning is, that this is always remembered and visited, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-34.htm">Exodus 32:34</a>, the phrase may take in all the sins of former persons, their ancestors, and of former times, from age to age, they had continued in, which had brought ruin upon them; and all their own sins, of nature and of youth, all past ones, to the present time: and it is desired that God would not "remember these against them"; that is, that he would not chastise or punish them for them, but that he would pardon them; for forgiveness of sin is sometimes expressed by a non-remembrance of it, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>, or that he would not "remember unto" (f) them; that is, put them in mind of them, lay them home and heavy upon their consciences, charge them with the guilt of them, and demand satisfaction for them; which is causing them to possess the sins of their youth, or former ones, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>, <p>let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us; the mercy of God is rich, plenteous, and abundant; many are the acts, and manifold the instances of it; and there is a heart of compassion, and a tenderness expressed in it; and which is free, and comes before the merits of men, goes before them, and is not caused by them; and the phrase denotes the early and timely application of it, the case being desperate, and requiring haste, and the danger such that nothing but mercy could prevent; and indeed it is mercy that prevents both our temporal and eternal ruin. The reason given for this request is, <p>for we are brought very low; sin brings men into a low estate, and only the grace and mercy of God can raise them up, and that exalts to an high estate; or are become very "weak" (g) and helpless; sin strips men of their strength, leaves them without any, and incapable of helping themselves out of that estate into which it has brought them: or are quite "exhausted" (h) and dried up, no good thing in them, no comfort left them; but are poor, and wretched, and miserable. <p>(e) T Hieros.
