Those will be most happy who begin the soonest to serve so good a Master. All aim to be happy. Surely this must look further than the present world; for man's life on earth consists but of few days, and those full of trouble. What man is he that would see the good of that where all bliss is perfect? Alas! few have this good in their thoughts. That religion promises best which creates watchfulness over the heart and over the tongue. It is not enough not to do hurt, we must study to be useful, and to live to some purpose; we must seek peace and pursue it; be willing to deny ourselves a great deal for peace' sake. It is the constant practice of real believers, when in distress, to cry unto God, and it is their constant comfort that he hears them. The righteous are humbled for sin, and are low in their own eyes. Nothing is more needful to true godliness than a contrite heart, broken off from every self-confidence. In this soil every grace will flourish, and nothing can encourage such a one but the free, rich grace of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The righteous are taken under the special protection of the Lord, yet they have their share of crosses in this world, and there are those that hate them. Both from the mercy of Heaven, and the malice of hell, the afflictions of the righteous must be many. But whatever troubles befal them, shall not hurt their souls, for God keeps them from sinning in troubles. No man is desolate, but he whom God has forsaken.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What man is he that desireth life? - That desires to live long. All people naturally love life; and all naturally desire to live long; and this desire, being founded in our nature, is not wrong. Life is, in itself, a good - a blessing to be desired; death is in itself an evil, and a thing to be dreaded, and there is nothing wrong, in itself, in such a dread. Equally proper is it to wish not to be cut down in early life; for where one has before him an eternity for which to prepare, he feels it undesirable that he should be cut off in the beginning of his way. The psalmist, therefore, does not put this question because he supposes that there were any who did not desire life, or did not wish to see many days, but in order to fix the attention on the inquiry, and to prepare the mind for the answer which was to follow. By thus putting the question, also, he has implicitly expressed the opinion that it is lawful to desire life, and to wish to see many days.<p>And loveth many days - literally, "loving days." That is, who so loves days, considered as a part of life, that he wishes they may be prolonged and multiplied.<p>That he may see good - That he may enjoy prosperity, or find happiness. In other words, who is he that would desire to understand the way by which life may be lengthened out to old age, and by which it may be made happy and prosperous? The psalmist proposes to answer this question - as he does in the following verses, by stating the results of what he had experienced and observed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

He longed for God and took pains to find Him (such is the meaning of &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; in distinction from &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;), and this striving, which took the form of prayer, did not remain without some actual answer (&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; is used of the being heard and the fulfilment as an answer to the petition of the praying one). The perfects, as also in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>, describe facts, one of which did not take place without the other; whereas &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; would give them the relation of antecedent and consequent. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>, his own personal experience is generalised into an experimental truth, expressed in the historical form: they look unto Him and brighten up, i.e., whosoever looketh unto Him (&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; &#1488;&#1500; of a look of intense yearning, eager for salvation, as in <a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>) brightens up. It is impracticable to make the &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; from <a href="/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a> the subject; it is an act and the experience that immediately accompanies it, that is expressed with an universal subject and in gnomical perfects. The verb &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;, here as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>, has the signification to shine, glitter (whence &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;, light). Theodoret renders it: &#x39f;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, the gracious countenance of God is reflected on their faces; to the actus directus of fides supplex succeeds the actus reflexus of fides triumphans. It never comes to pass that their countenances must be covered with shame on account of disappointed hope: this shall not and cannot be, as the sympathetic force of &#1488;&#1500; implies. In all the three dialects &#1495;&#1508;&#1512; (&#1495;&#1508;&#1512;) has the signification of being ashamed and sacred; according to Gesenius and F&#1516;rst (root &#1508;&#1512;) it proceeds from the primary signification of reddening, blushing; in reality, however, since it is to be combined, not with Arab. hmr, but with chmr (cf. Arab. kfr, &#1499;&#1508;&#1512;, Arab. gfr, gmr), it proceeds from the primary signification of covering, hiding, veiling (Arabic chafira, tachaffara, used of a woman, cf. chamara, to be ashamed, to blush, to be modest, used of both sexes), so that consequently the shame-covered countenance is contrasted with that which has a bright, bold, and free look. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>, this general truth is again individualised. By &#1494;&#1492; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; (like &#1494;&#1492; &#1505;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>) David points to himself. From the great peril in which he was placed at the court of the Philistines, from which God has rescued him, he turns his thoughts with gratitude and praise to all the deliverances which lie in the past. </body></html>
