Those will be most happy who begin the soonest to serve so good a Master. All aim to be happy. Surely this must look further than the present world; for man's life on earth consists but of few days, and those full of trouble. What man is he that would see the good of that where all bliss is perfect? Alas! few have this good in their thoughts. That religion promises best which creates watchfulness over the heart and over the tongue. It is not enough not to do hurt, we must study to be useful, and to live to some purpose; we must seek peace and pursue it; be willing to deny ourselves a great deal for peace' sake. It is the constant practice of real believers, when in distress, to cry unto God, and it is their constant comfort that he hears them. The righteous are humbled for sin, and are low in their own eyes. Nothing is more needful to true godliness than a contrite heart, broken off from every self-confidence. In this soil every grace will flourish, and nothing can encourage such a one but the free, rich grace of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The righteous are taken under the special protection of the Lord, yet they have their share of crosses in this world, and there are those that hate them. Both from the mercy of Heaven, and the malice of hell, the afflictions of the righteous must be many. But whatever troubles befal them, shall not hurt their souls, for God keeps them from sinning in troubles. No man is desolate, but he whom God has forsaken.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He keepeth all his bones - That is, he preserves or guards the righteous.<p>Not one of them is broken - Perhaps there is a direct and immediate allusion here to what the psalmist had himself experienced. In His dangers God had preserved him, so that he had escaped without a broken bone. But the statement is more general, and is designed to convey a truth in respect to the usual and proper effect of religion, or to denote the advantage, in reference to personal safety in the dangers of this life, derived from religion. The language is of a general character, such as often occurs in the Scriptures, and it should, in all fairness, be so construed. It cannot mean that the bones of a righteous man are never broken, or that the fact that a man has a broken bone proves that he is not righteous; but it means that, as a general principle, religion conduces to safety, or that the righteous are under the protection of God. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30-31</a>. Nothing more can be demanded in the fair interpretation of the language than this. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. bones&#8212;framework of the body.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All his bones, </span> i.e. all the parts and members of their bodies, which are synecdochically expressed by the bones, which are the stay and strength of the rest.

But these words, though they are here spoken of the righteous men in general, of whom they are true in a metaphorical sense; yet they had a further meaning in them, being designed by the Spirit of God (which dictated to David, not only the matter, but the very words and expressions) to signify a great mystery, that none of Christ’s bones should be broken; to which purpose they are alleged, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/19-36.htm" title="For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.">John 19:36</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken.

God "keepeth," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> watches over, keeps from harm, the entire persons of the righteous, letting no hurt touch them, but such as he permits and sees to be needful. In using the phrase, "not one of them is broken," the psalmist probably alludes to <a href="/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a> and <a href="/numbers/9-12.htm">Numbers 9:12</a>, taking the Paschal lamb as a type of innocence, and so of godliness. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 34:12-15) The first main division of the Psalm is ended; the second (much the same as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1-11</a>) assumes more the tone of a didactic poem; although even <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/34-9.htm">Psalm 34:9</a> have something of the didactic style about them. The poet first of all gives a direction for fearing God. We may compare <a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a> - how thoroughly Davidic is the turn which the Psalm here takes! &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are not children in years or in understanding; but it is a tender form of address of a master experienced in the ways of God to each one and to all, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, and frequently.

We see from <a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>., where <a href="/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a> also, in its form, calls to mind the Psalm before us, why the poet gives the pre-eminence to the avoiding of sins of the tongue. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, from among what is good peace is made prominent, - peace, which not only are we not to disturb, but which we are to seek, yea, pursue it like as the hunter pursues the finest of the herds.
