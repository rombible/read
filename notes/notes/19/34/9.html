This sense is undoubtedly good: but I see nothing to object against our own reading: for the meaning is, that if God takes care of the beasts of the field, much more will he take care of them who fear him, and much sooner suffer those to die for want of their prey, than these to perish through want of necessaries, or the failure of his protection.” <span class="ital">Shall not want any good thing — </span>Any thing necessary and truly good for them, all circumstances considered; of which God alone is a competent judge. And, therefore, although he doth usually take special care to supply the wants of good men, and hath often done it by extraordinary ways, when ordinary have failed; yet he knows that wants and crosses are sometimes more necessary for, and will be more useful to them, than those things which they may think needful, and in such cases he manifests greater mercy to them in denying them supplies than in granting them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:1-10 If we hope to spend eternity in praising God, it is fit that we should spend much of our time here in this work. He never said to any one, Seek ye me in vain. David's prayers helped to silence his fears; many besides him have looked unto the Lord by faith and prayer, and it has wonderfully revived and comforted them. When we look to the world, we are perplexed, and at a loss. But on looking to Christ depends our whole salvation, and all things needful thereunto do so also. This poor man, whom no man looked upon with any respect, or looked after with any concern, was yet welcome to the throne of grace; the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. The holy angels minister to the saints, and stand for them against the powers of darkness. All the glory be to the Lord of the angels. By taste and sight we both make discoveries, and have enjoyment; Taste and see God's goodness; take notice of it, and take the comfort of it. He makes all truly blessed that trust in him. As to the things of the other world, they shall have grace sufficient for the support of spiritual life. And as to this life, they shall have what is necessary from the hand of God. Paul had all, and abounded, because he was content, Php 4:11-18. Those who trust to themselves, and think their own efforts sufficient for them, shall want; but they shall be fed who trust in the Lord. Those shall not want, who with quietness work, and mind their own business.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O fear the Lord - Reverence him; honor him; confide in him. Compare <a href="/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>.<p>Ye his saints - His holy ones. All who profess to be his friends. This exhortation is addressed especially to the saints, or to the pious, because the speaker professed to be a friend of God, and had had personal experience of the truth of what he is here saying. It is the testimony of one child of God addressed to others, to encourage them by the result of his own experience.<p>For there is no want to them that fear him - All their needs will be abundantly supplied. Sooner or later all their real necessities will be met, and God will bestow upon them every needed blessing. The statement here cannot be regarded as absolutely and universally true - that is, it cannot mean that they who fear the Lord will never, in any instance, be hungry or thirsty, or destitute of raiment or of a comfortable home; but it is evidently intended to be a general affirmation, and is in accordance with the other statements which occur in the Bible about the advantages of true religion in securing temporal as well as spiritual blessings from God. Thus, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>, it is said, "Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come." Thus, in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-16.htm">Isaiah 33:16</a>, it is said of the righteous man, "Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure."<p>And so, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>, David records the result of his own observation at the end of a long life, "I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread." But while these statements should not be interpreted as affirming absolutely that no child of God will ever be in need of food, or drink, or raiment, or home, or friends, yet it is generally true that the needs of the righteous are supplied, often in an unexpected manner, and from an unexpected source. It is true that virtue and religion conduce to temporal prosperity; and it is almost universally true that the inmates of charity-houses and prisons are neither the pious, nor the children of the pious. These houses are the refuge, to a great extent, of the intemperate, the godless, and the profligate - or of the families of the intemperate, the godless, and the profligate; and if all such persons were to be discharged from those abodes, our almshouses and prisons would soon become tenantless. A community could most easily provide for all those who have been trained in the ways of religion, but who are reduced to poverty by fire, or by flood, or by ill health; and they would most cheerfully do it. Nothing can be more true than that if a man wished to do all that could be done in the general uncertainty of human affairs to secure prosperity, it would be an advantage to him to be a virtuous and religious man. God never blesses or prospers a sinner as such, though he often does it notwithstanding the fact that he is a sinner; but he does and will bless and prosper a righteous man as such, and because he is righteous.

The substantival clause <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-2.htm">Psalm 34:2</a>, is intended to have just as much the force of a cohortative as the verbal clause <a href="/psalms/34-2.htm">Psalm 34:2</a>. &#1488;&#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, like &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1493;, is to be written with Chateph-Pathach in the middle syllable. In distinction from &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, afflicti, &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; signifies submissi, those who have learnt endurance or patience in the school of affliction. The praise of the psalmist will greatly help to strengthen and encourage such; for it applies to the Deliverer of the oppressed. But in order that this praise may sound forth with strength and fulness of tone, he courts the assistance of companions in <a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>. To acknowledge the divine greatness with the utterance of praise is expressed by &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; with an accusative in <a href="/psalms/69-31.htm">Psalm 69:31</a>; in this instance with &#1500;: to offer &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; unto Him, cf. <a href="/psalms/29-2.htm">Psalm 29:2</a>. Even &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; has this subjective meaning: with the heart and in word and deed, to place the exalted Name of God as high as it really is in itself. In accordance with the rule, that when in any word two of the same letters follow one another and the first has a Sheb, this Sheb must be an audible one, and in fact Chateph Pathach preceded by Gaja (Metheg), we must write &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492;. </body></html>
