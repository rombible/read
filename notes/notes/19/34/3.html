He never said to any one, Seek ye me in vain. David's prayers helped to silence his fears; many besides him have looked unto the Lord by faith and prayer, and it has wonderfully revived and comforted them. When we look to the world, we are perplexed, and at a loss. But on looking to Christ depends our whole salvation, and all things needful thereunto do so also. This poor man, whom no man looked upon with any respect, or looked after with any concern, was yet welcome to the throne of grace; the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. The holy angels minister to the saints, and stand for them against the powers of darkness. All the glory be to the Lord of the angels. By taste and sight we both make discoveries, and have enjoyment; Taste and see God's goodness; take notice of it, and take the comfort of it. He makes all truly blessed that trust in him. As to the things of the other world, they shall have grace sufficient for the support of spiritual life. And as to this life, they shall have what is necessary from the hand of God. Paul had all, and abounded, because he was content, Php 4:11-18. Those who trust to themselves, and think their own efforts sufficient for them, shall want; but they shall be fed who trust in the Lord. Those shall not want, who with quietness work, and mind their own business.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O magnify the Lord with me - This seems to be addressed primarily to the "humble," those referred to in the previous verse. As they could appreciate what he would say, as they could understand the nature of his feelings in view of his deliverance, he calls upon them especially to exult with him in the goodness of God. As he and they had common calamities and trials, so might they have common joys; as they were united in danger and sorrow, so it was proper that they should be united in joy and in praise. The word "magnify' means literally "to make great," and then, to make great in the view of the mind, or to regard and treat as great. The idea is, that he wished all, in circumstances similar to those in which he had been placed, to have a just sense of the greatness of God, and of his claims to love and praise.

The psalmist invites the humble ones, who he knew would rejoice at the goodness of God to him, to join with him in ascribing greatness to the Lord, which is meant by magnifying him; for he cannot be made great by men, only declared how great he is, and that can only be done in an imperfect manner; <p>and let us exalt his name together: by proclaiming him to be the most High; by making mention of his glorious perfections and works, that he be exalted; and by praising him in the highest strains; or by having the high praises of him in their mouths; and there is more pleasure as well as more glory brought to God by doing this in a social way, or by a number of saints joining together in such service. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">magnify</span>] Man <span class="ital">makes</span> God <span class="ital">great</span> by acknowledging and celebrating His greatness (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-3.htm" title="Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe you greatness to our God.">Deuteronomy 32:3</a>), and <span class="ital">exalts</span> His Name by confessing that He is supreme above all.

Not content with praising God in his own person, the psalmist calls on Israel generally to praise the Lord with him. He then proceeds to assign reasons why God should be praised (vers. 4-10). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Hence the call to praise God is supported (2) by a setting forth of that which His people possess in Him. This portion of the song is like a paraphrase of the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>. The theme in <a href="/psalms/33-12.htm">Psalm 33:12</a> is proved in <a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13</a> by the fact, that Jahve is the omniscient Ruler, because He is the Creator of men, without whose knowledge nothing is undertaken either secretly or openly, and especially if against His people.  Then in <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a> it is supported by the fact, that His people have in Jahve a stronger defence than the greatest worldly power would be. Jahve is called the fashioner of all the hearts of men, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>, as being their Maker. As such He is also the observer of all the works of men; for His is acquainted with their origin in the laboratory of the heart, which He as Creator has formed. Hupfeld takes &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; as an equalisation (pariter ac) of the two appositions; but then it ought to be &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-3.htm">Psalm 49:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>). The lxx correctly renders it &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, singillatim. It is also needless to translate it, as Hupfeld does: He who formed, qui finxit; for the hearts of men were not from the very first created all at one time, but the primeval impartation of spirit-life is continued at every birth in some mysterious way. God is the Father of spirits, <a href="/hebrews/12-9.htm">Hebrews 12:9</a>. For this very reason everything that exists, even to the most hidden thing, is encompassed by His omniscience and omnipotence. He exercises an omniscient control over all things, and makes all things subservient to the designs of His plan of the universe, which, so far as His people are concerned, is the plan of salvation. Without Him nothing comes to pass; but through Him everything takes place. The victory of the king, and the safety of the warrior, are not their own works. Their great military power and bodily strength can accomplish nothing without God, who can also be mighty in the feeble.  Even for purposes of victory (&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, cf. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/21-2.htm">Psalm 21:2</a>) the war-horse is &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;, i.e., a thing that promises much, but can in reality do nothing; it is not its great strength, by which it enables the trooper to escape (&#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;). "The horse," says Solomon in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>, "is equipped for the day of battle, but &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;, Jahve's is the victory," He giveth it to whomsoever He will. The ultimate ends of all things that come to pass are in His hands, and - as <a href="/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>. say, directing special attention to this important truth by &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; - the eye of this God, that is to say the final aim of His government of the world, is directed towards them that fear Him, is pointed at them that hope in His mercy (&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;). In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/33-19.htm">Psalm 33:19</a>, the object, &#1500;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;, is expanded by way of example. From His mercy or loving-kindness, not from any acts of their own, conscious of their limited condition and feebleness, they look for protection in the midst of the greatest peril, and for the preservation of their life in famine. <a href="/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a> is very similar; but the one passage sounds as independent as the other. </body></html>
