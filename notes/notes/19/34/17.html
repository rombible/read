Those will be most happy who begin the soonest to serve so good a Master. All aim to be happy. Surely this must look further than the present world; for man's life on earth consists but of few days, and those full of trouble. What man is he that would see the good of that where all bliss is perfect? Alas! few have this good in their thoughts. That religion promises best which creates watchfulness over the heart and over the tongue. It is not enough not to do hurt, we must study to be useful, and to live to some purpose; we must seek peace and pursue it; be willing to deny ourselves a great deal for peace' sake. It is the constant practice of real believers, when in distress, to cry unto God, and it is their constant comfort that he hears them. The righteous are humbled for sin, and are low in their own eyes. Nothing is more needful to true godliness than a contrite heart, broken off from every self-confidence. In this soil every grace will flourish, and nothing can encourage such a one but the free, rich grace of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The righteous are taken under the special protection of the Lord, yet they have their share of crosses in this world, and there are those that hate them. Both from the mercy of Heaven, and the malice of hell, the afflictions of the righteous must be many. But whatever troubles befal them, shall not hurt their souls, for God keeps them from sinning in troubles. No man is desolate, but he whom God has forsaken.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth - That is, one of the advantages or benefits of being righteous is the privilege of crying unto God, or of calling on his name, with the assurance that he will hear and deliver us. No one has ever yet fully appreciated the "privilege" of being permitted to call upon God; the privilege of prayer. There is no blessing conferred upon man in his present state superior to this; and no one can fully understand the force of the argument derived from this in favor of the service of God. What a world would this be - how sad, how helpless, how wretched - if there were no God to whom the guilty, the suffering, and the sorrowful might come; if God were a Being who never heard prayer at all; if he were a capricious Being who might or might not hear prayer; if He were a Being governed by fitful emotions, who would now hear the righteous, and then the wicked, and then neither, and who dispensed His favors in answer to prayer by no certain rule!<p>And delivereth them out of all their troubles - <p>(1) He often delivers them from trouble in this life in answer to prayer.<p>(2) he will deliver them literally from all trouble in the life to come.<p>The promise is not indeed, that they shall be delivered from all trouble on earth, but the idea is that God is able to rescue them from trouble here; that He often does it in answer to prayer; and that there will be, in the case of every righteous person, a sure and complete deliverance from all trouble hereafter.

The word "righteous" is not in the original text, but is rightly supplied in our version, as it is in the Targum, and by Jarchi; and so Kimchi and Ben Melech observe, that these words are not to be connected with <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a>, but with <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>; and they are indeed an amplification of the last clause of it; and the cry of the righteous is meant, to which the ears of the Lord are open; though Aben Ezra thinks that these words are to be understood of them that do evil, and of their cry to the Lord, when they turn from their evil ways; but the former sense is best; <p>and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles; their inward troubles, through the workings of corruption in their hearts; through the violent assaults of Satan, the blasphemous thoughts he injects into them, and his solicitations of them to sin; and through divine desertions, and their outward troubles; through afflictions of body, losses of estate and friends, and the reproaches and persecutions of men; out of all these the Lord sooner or later delivers his people who cry unto him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>.

The poet first of all gives a direction for fearing God. We may compare <a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a> - how thoroughly Davidic is the turn which the Psalm here takes! &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are not children in years or in understanding; but it is a tender form of address of a master experienced in the ways of God to each one and to all, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, and frequently. In <a href="/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a> he throws out the question, which he himself answers in <a href="/psalms/34-14.htm">Psalm 34:14</a>. This form of giving impressiveness to a truth by setting it forth as a solution of some question that has been propounded is a habit with David. <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/24-10.htm">Psalm 24:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/25-12.htm">Psalm 25:12</a>. In the use made of this passage from the Psalms in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-10.htm">1 Peter 3:10-12</a> ( equals <a href="/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a> of the Psalm) this form of the question is lost sight of.

We see from <a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>., where <a href="/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a> also, in its form, calls to mind the Psalm before us, why the poet gives the pre-eminence to the avoiding of sins of the tongue. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, from among what is good peace is made prominent, - peace, which not only are we not to disturb, but which we are to seek, yea, pursue it like as the hunter pursues the finest of the herds. Let us follow, says the apostle Paul also, <a href="/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a> (cf. <a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>), after those things which make for peace. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; is a relationship, harmonious and free from trouble, that is well-pleasing to the God of love. The idea of the bond of fellowship is connected with the corresponding word eiree'nee, according to its radical notion. </body></html>
