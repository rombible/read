Those will be most happy who begin the soonest to serve so good a Master. All aim to be happy. Surely this must look further than the present world; for man's life on earth consists but of few days, and those full of trouble. What man is he that would see the good of that where all bliss is perfect? Alas! few have this good in their thoughts. That religion promises best which creates watchfulness over the heart and over the tongue. It is not enough not to do hurt, we must study to be useful, and to live to some purpose; we must seek peace and pursue it; be willing to deny ourselves a great deal for peace' sake. It is the constant practice of real believers, when in distress, to cry unto God, and it is their constant comfort that he hears them. The righteous are humbled for sin, and are low in their own eyes. Nothing is more needful to true godliness than a contrite heart, broken off from every self-confidence. In this soil every grace will flourish, and nothing can encourage such a one but the free, rich grace of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The righteous are taken under the special protection of the Lord, yet they have their share of crosses in this world, and there are those that hate them. Both from the mercy of Heaven, and the malice of hell, the afflictions of the righteous must be many. But whatever troubles befal them, shall not hurt their souls, for God keeps them from sinning in troubles. No man is desolate, but he whom God has forsaken.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Come, ye children - From persons in general <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a> - from the saints and the pious <a href="/psalms/34-9.htm">Psalm 34:9</a> - the psalmist now turns to children - to the young - that he may state to them the result of his own experience, and teach them from that experience how they may find happiness and prosperity. The original word here rendered "children" properly means "sons;" but there can be no doubt that the psalmist meant to address the young in general. There is no evidence that he especially designed what is here said for his own sons. The counsel seems to have been designed for all the young. I see no reason for supposing, as Rosenmuller, DeWette, and Prof. Alexander do, that the word is here used in the sense of "disciples, scholars, learners." That the word may have such a meaning, there can be no doubt; but it is much more in accordance with the scope of the psalm to regard the word as employed in its usual sense as denoting the young. It is thus a most interesting address from an aged and experienced man of God to those who are in the morning of life - suggesting to them the way by which they may make life prosperous and happy.<p>Hearken unto me - Attend to what I have to say, as the fruit of my experience and observation.<p>I will teach you the fear of the Lord - I will show you what constitutes the true fear of the Lord, or what is the nature of true religion. I will teach you how you may so fear and serve God as to enjoy his favor and obtain length of days upon the earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. children&#8212;subjects of instruction (Pr 1:8, 10).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/34.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>11 Come ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.<p>12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?<p>13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.<p>14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.<p><a href="/psalms/34-11.htm">Psalm 34:11</a><p>"Come, ye children." Though a warrior and a king, the Psalmist was not ashamed to teach children. Teachers of youth belong to the true peerage; their work is honourable, and their reward shall be glorious. Perhaps the boys and girls of Gath had made sport of David in his seeming madness, and if so, he here aims by teaching the rising race to undo the mischief which he had done aforetime. Children are the most hopeful persons to teach - wise men who wish to propagate their principles take care to win the ear of the young. "Hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord." So far as they can be taught by word of mouth, or learned by the hearing of the ear, we are to communicate the faith and fear of God, inculcating upon the rising generation the principles and practices of piety. This verse may be the address of every Sabbath School teacher to his class, of every parent to his children. It is not without instruction in the art of teaching. We should be winning and attractive to the youngsters, bidding them "come," and not repelling them with harsh terms. We must get them away, apart from toys and sports, and try to occupy their minds with better pursuits; for we cannot well teach them while their minds are full of other things. We must drive at the main point always, and keep the fear of the Lord ever uppermost in our teachings, and in so doing we may discreetly cast our own personality into the scale by narrating our own experiences and convictions.<p><a href="/psalms/34-12.htm">Psalm 34:12</a><p>Life spent in happiness is the desire of all, and he who can give the young a receipt for leading a happy life deserves to be popular among them. Mere existence is not life; the art of living, truly, really, and joyfully living, it is not given to all men to know. To teach men how to live and how to die, is the aim of all useful religious instruction. The rewards of,virtue are the baits with which the young are to be drawn to morality. While we teach piety to God we should also dwell much upon morality towards man.<p><a href="/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a><p>"Keep thy tongue from evil." Guard with careful diligence that dangerous member, the tongue, lest it utter evil, for that evil will recoil upon thee, and mar the enjoyment of thy life. Men cannot spit forth poison without feeling some of the venom burning their own flesh. "And thy lips from speaking guile." Deceit must be very earnestly avoided by the man who desires happiness. A crafty schemer lives like a spy in the enemy's camp, in constant fear of exposure and execution. Clean and honest conversation, by keeping the conscience at ease, promotes happiness, but lying and wicked talk stuffs our pillow with thorns, and makes life a constant whirl of fear and shame. David had tried the tortuous policy, but he here denounces it, and begs others as they would live long and well to avoid with care the doubtful devices of guile.<p><a href="/psalms/34-14.htm">Psalm 34:14</a><p>"Depart from evil." Go away from it. Not merely take your hands off, but yourself off. Live not near the pest-house. Avoid the lion's lair, leave the viper's nest. Set a distance between yourself and temptation. "And do good." Be practical, active, energetic, persevering in good. Positive virtue promotes negative virtue; he who does good is sure to avoid evil. "Seek peace." Not merely prefer it, but with zeal and care endeavour to promote it. Peace with God, with thine own heart, with thy fellow man, search after this as the merchantman after a precious pearl. Nothing can more effectually promote our own happiness than peace; strife awakens passions which eat into the heart with corroding power. Anger is murder to one's own self, as well as to its objects. "And pursue it." Hunt after it, chase it with eager desire. It may soon be lost, indeed, nothing is harder to retain, but do your best, and if enmity should arise let it be no fault of yours. Follow after peace when it shuns you; be resolved not to be of a contentious spirit. The peace which you thus promote will be returned into your own bosom, and be a perennial spring of comfort to you. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">Ye children</span>; whom I love as mine own children, and who own me as your civil father, your prince; see <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/5-13.htm" title="And his servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, would you not have done it? how much rather then, when he said to you, Wash, and be clean?">2 Kings 5:13</a></span>; and as your spiritual father, a prophet; for the disciples of the prophets were called their <span class="ital">sons</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/2-3.htm" title="And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day?

This he does in two remarkable verses (vers. 13, 14); after which he proceeds, in the  remainder of the psalm, to give reasons which may incline them to the practice of it (vers. 15-22). The reasons resolve themselves into two main grounds - the tender love and care of God for the righteous (vers. 15, 17-20, 22), and his hostility to and punishment of the wicked (vers. 16, 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come, ye children, hearken unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">me</span> (comp. <a href="/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-32.htm">Proverbs 8:32</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1, 18</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">teach you the fear of the Lord;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will teach you the nature of true religion.

He longed for God and took pains to find Him (such is the meaning of &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; in distinction from &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;), and this striving, which took the form of prayer, did not remain without some actual answer (&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; is used of the being heard and the fulfilment as an answer to the petition of the praying one). The perfects, as also in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>, describe facts, one of which did not take place without the other; whereas &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; would give them the relation of antecedent and consequent. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>, his own personal experience is generalised into an experimental truth, expressed in the historical form: they look unto Him and brighten up, i.e., whosoever looketh unto Him (&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; &#1488;&#1500; of a look of intense yearning, eager for salvation, as in <a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>) brightens up. It is impracticable to make the &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; from <a href="/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a> the subject; it is an act and the experience that immediately accompanies it, that is expressed with an universal subject and in gnomical perfects. The verb &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;, here as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>, has the signification to shine, glitter (whence &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;, light). Theodoret renders it: &#x39f;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, the gracious countenance of God is reflected on their faces; to the actus directus of fides supplex succeeds the actus reflexus of fides triumphans. It never comes to pass that their countenances must be covered with shame on account of disappointed hope: this shall not and cannot be, as the sympathetic force of &#1488;&#1500; implies. In all the three dialects &#1495;&#1508;&#1512; (&#1495;&#1508;&#1512;) has the signification of being ashamed and sacred; according to Gesenius and F&#1516;rst (root &#1508;&#1512;) it proceeds from the primary signification of reddening, blushing; in reality, however, since it is to be combined, not with Arab. hmr, but with chmr (cf. Arab. kfr, &#1499;&#1508;&#1512;, Arab. gfr, gmr), it proceeds from the primary signification of covering, hiding, veiling (Arabic chafira, tachaffara, used of a woman, cf. chamara, to be ashamed, to blush, to be modest, used of both sexes), so that consequently the shame-covered countenance is contrasted with that which has a bright, bold, and free look. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>, this general truth is again individualised. By &#1494;&#1492; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; (like &#1494;&#1492; &#1505;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>) David points to himself. From the great peril in which he was placed at the court of the Philistines, from which God has rescued him, he turns his thoughts with gratitude and praise to all the deliverances which lie in the past. </body></html>
