He never said to any one, Seek ye me in vain. David's prayers helped to silence his fears; many besides him have looked unto the Lord by faith and prayer, and it has wonderfully revived and comforted them. When we look to the world, we are perplexed, and at a loss. But on looking to Christ depends our whole salvation, and all things needful thereunto do so also. This poor man, whom no man looked upon with any respect, or looked after with any concern, was yet welcome to the throne of grace; the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. The holy angels minister to the saints, and stand for them against the powers of darkness. All the glory be to the Lord of the angels. By taste and sight we both make discoveries, and have enjoyment; Taste and see God's goodness; take notice of it, and take the comfort of it. He makes all truly blessed that trust in him. As to the things of the other world, they shall have grace sufficient for the support of spiritual life. And as to this life, they shall have what is necessary from the hand of God. Paul had all, and abounded, because he was content, Php 4:11-18. Those who trust to themselves, and think their own efforts sufficient for them, shall want; but they shall be fed who trust in the Lord. Those shall not want, who with quietness work, and mind their own business.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This poor man cried - The psalmist here returns to his own particular experience. The emphasis here is on the word "this:" "This poor, afflicted, persecuted man cried." There is something much more touching in this than if he had merely said "I," or "I myself" cried. The language brings before us at once his afflicted and miserable condition. The word "poor" here - &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;  &#8219;a&#770;n&#305;&#770;y - does not mean "poor" in the sense of a want of wealth, but "poor" in the sense of being afflicted, crushed, forsaken, desolate. The word "miserable" would better express the idea than the word "poor."<p>And the Lord heard him - That is, heard in the sense of "answered."

Singling out some one person from among the humble, who was remarkably delivered; it is the common case of the people of God to be poor and afflicted, and in their afflictions they cry unto the Lord to be supported under them, and delivered out of them: or this may be understood of David himself, who was poor, not with respect to outward things, but in spirit; was much afflicted, and especially greatly distressed when in the court of Achish; at which time he cried unto the Lord, as was his usual way, and that internally, as Moses did, <a href="/exodus/14-15.htm">Exodus 14:15</a>. Some think Jesus Christ is intended by this poor man, who was poor in temporals, though rich, and Lord of all; and was greatly afflicted, both in body and soul; and who, in the days of his flesh, offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>; <p>and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles; so the Lord always heard his son Jesus Christ, and especially in the day of salvation, and delivered him out of all his troubles, both of body and soul, when he raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; and he heard David his servant, as he often did; particularly when at Gath, and made way for his escape from thence; and from whence he came safe to the cave of Adullam; and the Lord hears all his poor and afflicted ones, when they cry unto him, and in the issue saves them from all their troubles, by reason of a body of sin and death, the temptations of Satan, and the persecutions of men. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

Almost a repetition of ver. 4, but in the third person instead of the first. The "poor man" intended is David him* self, not an ideal poor man. Otherwise the demonstrative "this" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) would not have been employed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Accordingly, in this closing hexastich, the church acknowledges Him as its help, its shield, and its source of joy. Besides the passage before us, &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; occurs in only one other instance in the Psalter, viz., <a href="/psalms/106-13.htm">Psalm 106:13</a>. This word, which belongs to the group of words signifying hoping and waiting, is perhaps from the root &#1495;&#1498; (Arab. h&#803;k', h&#803;ka&#770;, firmiter constringere sc. nodum), to be firm, compact, like &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; from &#1511;&#1493;&#1492;, to pull tight or fast, cf. the German harren (to wait) and hart (hard, compact). In <a href="/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a> we still hear the echo of the primary passage <a href="/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>). The emphasis, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115-9.htm">Psalm 115:9-11</a>, rests upon &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, into which &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/33-21.htm">Psalm 33:21</a>, puts this thought, viz., He is the unlimited sphere, the inexhaustible matter, the perennial spring of our joy. The second &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; confirms this subjectively. His holy Name is His church's ground of faith, of love, and of hope; for from thence comes its salvation. It can boldly pray that the mercy of the Lord may be upon it, for it waits upon Him, and man's waiting or hoping and God's giving are reciprocally conditioned. This is the meaning of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. God is true to His word. The Te Deum laudamus of Ambrose closes in the same way. </body></html>
