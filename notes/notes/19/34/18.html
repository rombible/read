Those will be most happy who begin the soonest to serve so good a Master. All aim to be happy. Surely this must look further than the present world; for man's life on earth consists but of few days, and those full of trouble. What man is he that would see the good of that where all bliss is perfect? Alas! few have this good in their thoughts. That religion promises best which creates watchfulness over the heart and over the tongue. It is not enough not to do hurt, we must study to be useful, and to live to some purpose; we must seek peace and pursue it; be willing to deny ourselves a great deal for peace' sake. It is the constant practice of real believers, when in distress, to cry unto God, and it is their constant comfort that he hears them. The righteous are humbled for sin, and are low in their own eyes. Nothing is more needful to true godliness than a contrite heart, broken off from every self-confidence. In this soil every grace will flourish, and nothing can encourage such a one but the free, rich grace of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The righteous are taken under the special protection of the Lord, yet they have their share of crosses in this world, and there are those that hate them. Both from the mercy of Heaven, and the malice of hell, the afflictions of the righteous must be many. But whatever troubles befal them, shall not hurt their souls, for God keeps them from sinning in troubles. No man is desolate, but he whom God has forsaken.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart - Margin, as in Hebrew: "to the broken of heart." The phrase, "the Lord is nigh," means that he is ready to hear and to help. The language is, of course, figurative. As an Omnipresent Being, God is equally near to all persons at all times; but the language is adapted to our conceptions, as we feel that one who is near us can help us, or that one who is distant from us cannot give us aid. Compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/22-11.htm">Psalm 22:11</a>. The phrase, "them that are of a broken heart," occurs often in the Bible. It refers to a condition when a burden "seems" to be on the heart, and when the heart "seems" to be crushed by sin or sorrow; and it is designed to describe a consciousness of deep guilt, or the heaviest kind of affliction and trouble. Compare <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>.<p>And sayeth such as be of a contrite spirit - Margin, as in Hebrew: "contrite of spirit." The phrase here means the spirit as "crushed" or "broken down;" that is, as in the other phrase, a spirit that is oppressed by sin or trouble. The world abounds with instances of those who can fully understand this language. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17, 18.

The poet first of all gives a direction for fearing God. We may compare <a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a> - how thoroughly Davidic is the turn which the Psalm here takes! &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are not children in years or in understanding; but it is a tender form of address of a master experienced in the ways of God to each one and to all, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, and frequently. In <a href="/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a> he throws out the question, which he himself answers in <a href="/psalms/34-14.htm">Psalm 34:14</a>. This form of giving impressiveness to a truth by setting it forth as a solution of some question that has been propounded is a habit with David. <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/24-10.htm">Psalm 24:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/25-12.htm">Psalm 25:12</a>. In the use made of this passage from the Psalms in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-10.htm">1 Peter 3:10-12</a> ( equals <a href="/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a> of the Psalm) this form of the question is lost sight of. To &#1495;&#1508;&#1509; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, as being just as exclusive in sense, corresponds &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, so that consequently &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is a definition of the purpose. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; signifies days in the mass, just as &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; means long-enduring life. We see from <a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>., where <a href="/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a> also, in its form, calls to mind the Psalm before us, why the poet gives the pre-eminence to the avoiding of sins of the tongue. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, from among what is good peace is made prominent, - peace, which not only are we not to disturb, but which we are to seek, yea, pursue it like as the hunter pursues the finest of the herds. Let us follow, says the apostle Paul also, <a href="/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a> (cf. <a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>), after those things which make for peace. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; is a relationship, harmonious and free from trouble, that is well-pleasing to the God of love. The idea of the bond of fellowship is connected with the corresponding word eiree'nee, according to its radical notion. </body></html>
