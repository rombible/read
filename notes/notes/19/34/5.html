He never said to any one, Seek ye me in vain. David's prayers helped to silence his fears; many besides him have looked unto the Lord by faith and prayer, and it has wonderfully revived and comforted them. When we look to the world, we are perplexed, and at a loss. But on looking to Christ depends our whole salvation, and all things needful thereunto do so also. This poor man, whom no man looked upon with any respect, or looked after with any concern, was yet welcome to the throne of grace; the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. The holy angels minister to the saints, and stand for them against the powers of darkness. All the glory be to the Lord of the angels. By taste and sight we both make discoveries, and have enjoyment; Taste and see God's goodness; take notice of it, and take the comfort of it. He makes all truly blessed that trust in him. As to the things of the other world, they shall have grace sufficient for the support of spiritual life. And as to this life, they shall have what is necessary from the hand of God. Paul had all, and abounded, because he was content, Php 4:11-18. Those who trust to themselves, and think their own efforts sufficient for them, shall want; but they shall be fed who trust in the Lord. Those shall not want, who with quietness work, and mind their own business.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They looked unto him - That is, they who were with the psalmist. He was not alone when he fled to Abimelech; and the meaning here is, that each one of those who were with him looked to God, and found light and comfort in Him. The psalmist seems to have had his thoughts here suddenly turned from himself to those who were with him, and to have called to his remembrance how they "all" looked to God in their troubles, and how they all found relief.<p>And were lightened - Or, "enlightened." They found light. Their faces, as we should say, "brightened up," or they became cheerful. Their minds were made calm, for they felt assured that God would protect them. Nothing could better express what often occurs in the time of trouble, when the heart is sad, and when the countenance is sorrowful - a dark cloud apparently having come over all things - if one thus looks to God. The burden is removed from the heart, and the countenance becomes radiant with hope and joy. The margin here, however, is, "They flowed unto him." The Hebrew word, &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;  na&#770;har, means sometimes "to flow, to flow together," <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-44.htm">Jeremiah 51:44</a>; but it also means "to shine, to be bright;" and thence, "to be cheered, to rejoice," <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>. This is probably the idea here, for this interpretation is better suited to the connection in which the word occurs.<p>And their faces were not ashamed - That is, they were not ashamed of having put their trust in God, or they were not disappointed. They had not occasion to confess that it was a vain reliance, or that they had been foolish in thus trusting him. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-20.htm">Job 6:20</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-5.htm">Psalm 22:5</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>, note. The idea here is, that they found God to be all that they expected or hoped that he would be. They had no cause to repent of what they had done. What was true of them will be true of all who put their trust in God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-7.

That is, "the humble" ones, <a href="/psalms/34-2.htm">Psalm 34:2</a>; and so this is a reason why they should join in praising and magnifying the Lord; these "looked" up to God in prayer and by faith, when in distressed and uncomfortable circumstances, for help and deliverance, and a supply of every needful good thing; and they were "enlightened"; so the Targum renders it, "their faces were enlightened"; as Jarchi and Aben Ezra interpret it, in opposition to what follows: they must have been enlightened before they could look, but by looking to the Lord more light was gained: this chiefly designs the light of joy, peace, and comfort, which is had in a way of believing: some render the word "and flowed" (l), as a river does, that is, to the Lord, as in <a href="/jeremiah/31-12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>. So Kimchi and Ben Melech explain the word; and it denotes both the numbers of them that looked up to the Lord in their distress, and the swiftness of their motion to him, and their earnestness and fervour of mind; so faith is not only a looking to Christ, but a going forth unto him; <p>and their faces were not ashamed; having what they prayed and looked for, and what they hoped and believed they should have; namely, deliverance and salvation, and so peace and pleasure. <p>(l) "et confluunt", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Michaelis; "et instar fluvii irruerint", Piscator, Amama; "et confluxerunt", Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.</span><p>(d) They will be bold to flee to you for help, when they see your mercies toward me.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">They looked</span> &c.] The subject is to be supplied from the verb. <span class="ital">They that looked unto him looked, and were brightened</span>.

Besides the passage before us, &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; occurs in only one other instance in the Psalter, viz., <a href="/psalms/106-13.htm">Psalm 106:13</a>. This word, which belongs to the group of words signifying hoping and waiting, is perhaps from the root &#1495;&#1498; (Arab. h&#803;k', h&#803;ka&#770;, firmiter constringere sc. nodum), to be firm, compact, like &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; from &#1511;&#1493;&#1492;, to pull tight or fast, cf. the German harren (to wait) and hart (hard, compact). In <a href="/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a> we still hear the echo of the primary passage <a href="/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>). The emphasis, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115-9.htm">Psalm 115:9-11</a>, rests upon &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, into which &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/33-21.htm">Psalm 33:21</a>, puts this thought, viz., He is the unlimited sphere, the inexhaustible matter, the perennial spring of our joy. The second &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; confirms this subjectively. His holy Name is His church's ground of faith, of love, and of hope; for from thence comes its salvation. It can boldly pray that the mercy of the Lord may be upon it, for it waits upon Him, and man's waiting or hoping and God's giving are reciprocally conditioned. This is the meaning of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. God is true to His word. The Te Deum laudamus of Ambrose closes in the same way. </body></html>
