All our blessings are blessings of goodness, and are owing, not to any merit of ours, but only to God's goodness. But when God's blessings come sooner, and prove richer than we imagine; when they are given before we prayed for them, before we were ready for them, nay, when we feared the contrary; then it may be truly said that he prevented, or went before us, with them. Nothing indeed prevented, or went before Christ, but to mankind never was any favour more preventing than our redemption by Christ. Thou hast made him to be a universal, everlasting blessing to the world, in whom the families of the earth are, and shall be blessed; and so thou hast made him exceeding glad with the countenance thou hast given to his undertaking, and to him in the prosecution of it. The Spirit of prophecy rises from what related to the king, to that which is peculiar to Christ; none other is blessed for ever, much less a blessing for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He asked life of thee - An expression similar to this occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/61-5.htm">Psalm 61:5-6</a>, "For thou, O God, hast heard my vows;...Thou wilt prolong the king's life, and his years to many generations." The expression in both cases implies that there had been a prayer for "life," as if life were in danger. The expression itself would be applicable to a time of sickness, or to danger of any kind, and here it is used doubtless in reference to the exposure of life in going into battle, or in going forth to war. In this apprehended peril he prayed that God would defend him. He earnestly sought protection as he went forth to the perils of war.<p>And thou gavest it him - Thou didst hear and answer his prayer. He was saved from danger.<p>Even length of days forever and ever - Thou didst grant him more than he asked. He sought life for himself; thou bast not only granted that, but hast granted to him the assurance that he should live in his posterity to all generations. The idea is, that there would be an indefinite contination of his race. His posterity would occupy his throne, and there would be no end to his reign thus prolonged. Beyond all his petitions and his hopes, God bad given the assurance that his reign would be permanent and enduring. We cannot suppose that he understood this as if it were a promise made to him personally, that "he" would live and would occupy the throne forever; but the natural interpretation is that which would refer it to his posterity, and to the perpetuity of the reign of his family or descendants. A similar promise occurs elsewhere: <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>; compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>. It is by no means an uncommon thing that God gives us more than we asked in our prayers. The offering of prayer is not only the means of securing the blessing which we asked, but also often of securing much more important blessings which we did not ask. If the expression were allowable it might be said that the prayer "suggested" to the divine mind the conferring of all needed blessings, or it indicates such a state of mind on the part of him who prays that God "takes occasion" to confer blessings which were not asked; as a request made by a child to a parent for a specific favor is followed not only by granting "that" favor, but by bestowing others of which the child did not think. The state of mind on the part of the child was such as to "dispose" the parent to grant much larger blessings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6.

Long life was one of Jehovah’s special blessings under the old covenant. It was a natural object of desire when the hope of a future life was all but a blank.

But how can <span class="ital">length of days for ever and ever</span> be said of a mortal king? Partly in the same way as the salutation “Let the king live for ever” was used (<a href="/1_kings/1-31.htm" title="Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.">1 Kings 1:31</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-3.htm" title="And said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lies waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?">Nehemiah 2:3</a>); partly because he was regarded as living on in his posterity (<a href="/2_samuel/7-29.htm" title="Therefore now let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you: for you, O Lord GOD, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your servant be blessed for ever.">2 Samuel 7:29</a>).

We must understand the psalmist to have asked for continuance <span class="accented">in his posterity</span>, and this was guaranteed him  in the message which God sent him by Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13, 16</a>). In the full sense the promise was, of course, Messianic, being fulfilled only in Christ, the God-Man, who alone of David' s posterity "liveth for ever." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 20:7-9) While <a href="/psalms/20-2.htm">Psalm 20:2</a> were being sung the offering of the sacrifice was probably going on. Now, after a lengthened pause, there ascends a voice, probably the voice of one of the Levites, expressing the cheering assurance of the gracious acceptance of the offering that has been presented by the priest. With &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; or &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, the usual word to indicate the turning-point, the instantaneous entrance of the result of some previous process of prolonged duration, whether hidden or manifest (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/17-24.htm">1 Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-22.htm">Isaiah 29:22</a>), is introduced. howshiya` is the perfect of faith, which, in the certainty of being answered, realises the fulfilment in anticipation. The exuberance of the language in <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> corresponds to the exuberance of feeling which thus finds expression.<p>In <a href="/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a> the answer is expected out of Zion, in the present instance it is looked for from God's holy heavens; for the God who sits enthroned in Zion is enthroned for ever in the heavens. His throne on earth is as it were the vestibule of His heavenly throne; His presence in the sanctuary of Israel is no limitation of His omnipresence; His help out of Zion is the help of the Celestial One and Him who is exalted above the heaven of heavens. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; does not here mean the fulness of might (cf. <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>), but the displays of power (<a href="/psalms/106-2.htm">Psalm 106:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/150-2.htm">Psalm 150:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1-11</a> :15), by which His right hand procures salvation, i.e., victory, for the combatant. The glory of Israel is totally different from that of the heathen, which manifests itself in boastful talk.

According to the Law Israel was forbidden to have any standing army; and the law touching the king (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>) speaks strongly against his keeping many horses. It was also the same under the judges, and at this time under David; but under Solomon, who acquired for himself horses and chariots in great number (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-29</a>), it was very different. It is therefore a confession that must belong to the time of David which is here made in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a>, viz., that Israel's glory in opposition to their enemies, especially the Syrians, is the sure defence and protection of the Name of their God alone. The language of David to Goliath is very similar, <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>. The preterites in <a href="/psalms/20-9.htm">Psalm 20:9</a> are praet. confidentiae. It is, as Luther says, "a song of triumph before the victory, a shout of joy before succour." Since &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; does not mean to stand, but to rise, &#1511;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; assumes the present superiority of the enemy. But the position of affairs changes: those who stand fall, and those who are lying down rise up; the former remain lying, the latter keep the field. The Hithpa. &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491; signifies to show one's self firm, strong, courageous; like &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491;, <a href="/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/147-6.htm">Psalm 147:6</a>, to strengthen, confirm, recover, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; to be compact, firm, cogn.
