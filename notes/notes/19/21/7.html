The success with which God blessed David, was a type of the total overthrow of all Christ's enemies. Those who might have had Christ to rule and save them, but rejected him and fought against him, shall find the remembrance of it a worm that dies not. God makes sinners willing by his grace, receives them to his favour, and delivers them from the wrath to come. May he exalt himself, by his all-powerful grace, in our hearts, destroying all the strong-holds of sin and Satan. How great should be our joy and praise to behold our Brother and Friend upon the throne, and for all the blessings we may expect from him! yet he delights in his exalted state, as enabling him to confer happiness and glory on poor sinners, who are taught to love and trust in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the king - David, the author of the psalm.<p>Trusteth in the Lord - All these blessings have resulted from his confiding in God, and looking to him for his favor and protection.<p>And through the mercy of the Most High - The favor of Him who is exalted above all; the most exalted Being in the universe. The word "mercy" here is equivalent to "favor." He had already experienced God's favor; he looked for a continuance of it; and through that favor he was confident that he would never be shaken in his purposes, and that he would never be disappointed.<p>He shall not be moved - He shall be firmly established. That is, his throne would be firm; he himself would live a life of integrity, purity, and prosperity; and the promises which had been so graciously made to him, and which extended so far into the future, would all be acomplished. The truth taught here is, that however firm or prosperous our way seems to be, the continuance of our prosperity, and the completion of our hopes and our designs, depend wholly on the "mercy" or the favor of the Most High. Confiding in that, we may feel assured that whatever changes and reverses we may experience in our temporal matters, our ultimate welfare will be secure. Nothing can shake a hope of heaven that is founded on his gracious promises as made through a Saviour. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Our Lord, like a true King and leader, was a master in the use of the weapons, and could handle well the shield of faith, for he has set us a brilliant example of unwavering confidence in God. He felt himself safe in his Father's care until his hour was come, he knew that he was always heard in heaven; he committed his cause to him that judgeth right, and in his last moments he committed his spirit into the same hands. The joy expressed in the former verses was the joy of faith, and the victory achieved was due to the same precious grace. A holy confidence in Jehovah is the true mother of victories. This Psalm of triumph was composed long before our Lord's conflict began, but faith overleaps the boundaries of time, and chants her "Io triumphe," while yet she sings her battle song.<p>"Through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved." Eternal mercy secures the mediatorial throne of Jesus. He who is Most High in every sense, engages all his infinite perfections to maintain the throne of grace upon which our King in Zion reigns. He was not moved from his purpose, nor in his sufferings, nor by his enemies, nor shall he be moved from the completion of his designs. He is the same yesterday, today, and for ever. Other empires are dissolved by the lapse of years, but eternal mercy maintains his growing dominion evermore; other kings fail because they rest upon an arm of flesh, but our monarch reigns on in splendour because he trusteth in Jehovah. It is a great display of divine mercy to men that the throne of King Jesus is still among them: nothing but divine mercy could sustain it, for human malice would overturn it tomorrow if it could. We ought to trust in God for the promotion of the Redeemer's kingdom, for in Jehovah the King himself trusts: all unbelieving methods of action, and especially all reliance upon mere human ability, should be for ever discarded from a kingdom where the monarch sets the example of walking by faith in God.<p><a href="/psalms/21-8.htm">Psalm 21:8</a><p>"Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee." The destruction of the wicked is a fitting subject for joy to the friends of righteousness; hence here, and in most scriptural Songs, it is noted with calm thanksgiving. "Thou hast put down the mighty from their seats," is a note of the same song which sings, "and hast exalted them of low degree." We pity the lost for they are men, but we cannot pity them as enemies of Christ. None can escape from the wrath of the victorious King, nor is it desirable that they should. Without looking for his flying foes he will find them with his hand, for his presence is about and around them. In vain shall any hope for escape, he will find out all, and be able to punish all, and that too with the ease and rapidity which belong to the warrior's right hand. The finding out relates, we think, not only to the discovery of the hiding-places of the haters of God, but to the touching of them in their tenderest parts, so as to cause the severest suffering. When he appears to judge the world hard hearts will be subdued into terror, and proud spirits humbled into shame. He who has the key of human nature can touch all its springs at his will, and find out the means of bringing the utmost confusion and terror upon those who aforetime boastfully expressed their hatred of him.<p><a href="/psalms/21-9.htm">Psalm 21:9</a><p>"Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger." They themselves shall be an oven to themselves and so their own tormentors. Those who burned with anger against thee shall be burned by thine anger. The fire of sin will be followed by the fire of wrath. Even as the smoke of Sodom and Gomorrah went up to heaven, so shall the enemies of the Lord Jesus be utterly and terribly consumed. Some read it, "thou shalt put them as it were into a furnace of fire." Like faggots cast into an oven they shall burn furiously beneath the anger of the Lord; "they shall be cast into a furnace of fire, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." These are terrible words, and those teachers do not well who endeavour by their sophistical reasonings to weaken their force. Reader, never tolerate slight thoughts of hell, or you will soon have low thoughts of sin. The hell of sinners must be fearful beyond all conception, or such language as the present would not be used. Who would have the Son of God to be his enemy when such an overthrow awaits his foes? The expression, "the time of thine anger," reminds us that as now is the time of his grace, so there will be a set time for his wrath. The judge goes upon assize at an appointed time. There is a day of vengeance of our God; let those who despise the day of grace remember this day of wrath.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or <span class="ital">removed</span>, from his kingdom, as Saul was. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the King trusteth in the Lord,....

This is at once the ground and the result of God' s favour to him. God favours David because of his trust, and David trusts in God because of his favour. The result is that, through the mercy (or, <span class="accented">loving-kindness</span>, Revised Version) of the <span class="cmt_word">Most High he shall not be moved</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/112-6.htm">Psalm 112:6</a>). The words appear to denote a conviction, as Professor Alexander says, that David "would never be shaken from his standing in God' s favour." This conviction we may well conceive him to have felt, and to have regarded as one that might fittingly be expressed by his subjects, in whose mouth he placed it. But such a conviction is not always borne out by events, and David confesses elsewhere, that, at any rate, once in his life, after he had said, "I shall never be moved," God "hid away his face from him," and he "was troubled" (<a href="/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6, 7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 21:2-3) The Psalm begins with thanksgiving for the bodily and spiritual blessings which Jahve has bestowed and still continues to bestow upon the king, in answer to his prayer. This occupies the three opening tetrastichs, of which these verses form the first. &#1506;&#1494; (whence &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1498;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>, together with &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1498;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a>, and frequently) is the power that has been made manifest in the king, which has turned away his affliction; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is the help from above which has freed him out of his distress. The &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1500;, which follows the &#1502;&#1492; of the exclamation, is naturally shortened by the Ker&#1502; into &#1497;&#1490;&#1500; (with the retreat of the tone); cf. on the contrary <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24</a>, where &#1502;&#1492; is interrogative and, according to the sense, negative). The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1488;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; has the signification eager desire, according to the connection, the lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, and the perhaps also cognate &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, to be poor; the Arabic Arab. wrs&#780;, avidum esse, must be left out of consideration according to the laws of the interchange of consonants, whereas &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, Arab. wrt&#817;, capere, captare (cf. Arab. irt&#817;  equals  wirt&#817; an inheritance), but not &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; (vid., <a href="/psalms/34-11.htm">Psalm 34:11</a>), belongs apparently to the same root. Observe the strong negation &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;: no, thou hast not denied, but done the very opposite. The fact of the music having to strike up here favours the supposition, that the occasion of the Psalm is the fulfilment of some public, well-known prayer. </body></html>
