The success with which God blessed David, was a type of the total overthrow of all Christ's enemies. Those who might have had Christ to rule and save them, but rejected him and fought against him, shall find the remembrance of it a worm that dies not. God makes sinners willing by his grace, receives them to his favour, and delivers them from the wrath to come. May he exalt himself, by his all-powerful grace, in our hearts, destroying all the strong-holds of sin and Satan. How great should be our joy and praise to behold our Brother and Friend upon the throne, and for all the blessings we may expect from him! yet he delights in his exalted state, as enabling him to confer happiness and glory on poor sinners, who are taught to love and trust in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thine hand shall find out - That is, Thou wilt find out - the hand being that by which we execute our purposes. This verse commences a new division of the psalm (see the introduction) - in which the psalmist looks forward to the complete and final triumph of God over "all" his enemies. He looks to this in connection with what God had done for him. He infers that he who had enabled him to achieve such signal conquests over his own foes and the foes of God would not withdraw his interposition until he had secured a complete victory for the cause of truth and holiness. In connection with the promise made to him respecting his permanent reign and the reign of his successors on the throne <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>, he infers that God would ultimately subdue the enemies of truth, and would set up his kingdom over all.<p>All thine enemies - However they may attempt to conceal themselves - however they may evade the efforts to subdue them - yet they shall "all" be found out and overcome. As this was intended by the Spirit of inspiration, it undoubtedly refers to the final triumph of truth on the earth, or to the fact that the kingdom of God will be set up over all the world. All that are properly ranked among the enemies of God - all that are in any way opposed to him and to his reign - will be found out and conquered. All the worshippers of idols - all the enemies of truth - all the rejecters of revelation - all the workers of iniquity, - all that are infidels or scoffers - shall be found out and subdued. Either by being made to yield to the claims of truth, and thus becoming the friends of God, or by being cut off and punished for their sins - they will be all so overcome that God shall reign over all the earth. An important truth is further taught here, to wit, that no enemy of God can escape him. There is no place to which he can flee where God will not find him. "There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves," <a href="/job/34-22.htm">Job 34:22</a>.<p>Thy right hand - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/17-7.htm">Psalm 17:7</a>.<p>Those that hate thee - All thine enemies. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The Jews, that would not have him to reign over them, who crucified him and persecuted his apostles; the Gentiles, who were also concerned in his death; the Roman emperors, who persecuted the Christians, and are signified by the red dragon that waited to devour the man child when brought forth by the woman, the church, <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>; and also the Papists, the followers of the man of sin, who oppose Christ in his offices and grace, and are the enemies of his witnesses, and of his interest; and besides these there are many professors of religion who are enemies of Christ, either doctrinally or practically; to whom may be added, the devil and his angels, and all those who are the children of him and are influenced by him: these the hand of Christ will find out sooner or later; for the words are an address to the King Messiah, who being omniscient knows where all his enemies are, and where to find them; and being omnipotent he will lay hold upon them, and hold them, and none shall escape from him; his hand of vengeance shall fall upon them, and he shall inflict righteous and deserved punishment on them; and this shall be the case of "all" of them, none will be able to hide themselves in secret places from him. This has been in part verified in the Jewish nation at the destruction of Jerusalem, when wrath came upon that people to the uttermost for their treatment of the Messiah; and in the Pagan empire, when it was demolished, and kings and great men in vain called to the rocks and mountains to hide them from the wrath of the Lamb, <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15</a>; and will have a further accomplishment in the antichristian states and kingdoms, when the vials of God's wrath shall be poured out upon them; and especially at the battle of Armageddon, when Christ will avenge himself, and get rid of all his enemies at once; and will have its final accomplishment in all wicked men and devils at the day of judgment, when all Christ's enemies will be found out by him, whether open or secret, and receive their just punishment; <p>thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee; this is the same with the former clause, and is repeated for the further certainty and greater confirmation of the thing; and "the right hand" is mentioned as expressive of the mighty power of the Lord.

This occupies the three opening tetrastichs, of which these verses form the first. &#1506;&#1494; (whence &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1498;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>, together with &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1498;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a>, and frequently) is the power that has been made manifest in the king, which has turned away his affliction; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is the help from above which has freed him out of his distress. The &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1500;, which follows the &#1502;&#1492; of the exclamation, is naturally shortened by the Ker&#1502; into &#1497;&#1490;&#1500; (with the retreat of the tone); cf. on the contrary <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24</a>, where &#1502;&#1492; is interrogative and, according to the sense, negative). The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1488;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; has the signification eager desire, according to the connection, the lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, and the perhaps also cognate &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, to be poor; the Arabic Arab. wrs&#780;, avidum esse, must be left out of consideration according to the laws of the interchange of consonants, whereas &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, Arab. wrt&#817;, capere, captare (cf. Arab. irt&#817;  equals  wirt&#817; an inheritance), but not &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; (vid., <a href="/psalms/34-11.htm">Psalm 34:11</a>), belongs apparently to the same root. Observe the strong negation &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;: no, thou hast not denied, but done the very opposite. The fact of the music having to strike up here favours the supposition, that the occasion of the Psalm is the fulfilment of some public, well-known prayer. </body></html>
