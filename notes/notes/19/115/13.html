Wherever there is right fear of God, there may be cheerful faith in him; those who reverence his word, may rely upon it. He is ever found faithful. The greatest need his blessing, and it shall not be denied to the meanest that fear him. God's blessing gives an increase, especially in spiritual blessings. And the Lord is to be praised: his goodness is large, for he has given the earth to the children of men for their use. The souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens of the flesh, are still praising him; but the dead body cannot praise God: death puts an end to our glorifying him in this world of trial and conflict. Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their service, therefore we will seek to do the more for God. We will not only do it ourselves, but will engage others to do it; to praise him when we are gone. Lord, thou art the only object for faith and love. Help us to praise thee while living and when dying, that thy name may be the first and last upon our lips: and let the sweet savour of thy name refresh our souls for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/115.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He will bless them that fear the Lord - Compare <a href="/psalms/115-11.htm">Psalm 115:11</a>.<p>Both small and great - Margin, as in Hebrew, with.

Israel's God is in the heavens, and is therefore supramundane in nature and life, and the absolutely unlimited One, who is able to do all things with a freedom that is conditioned only by Himself: quod vult, valet (<a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>  equals  <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135-6.htm">Psalm 135:6</a>, Wisd. 12:18, and frequently).

It cannot be proved with <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:16</a> that &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501; are equivalent to &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;.

It is said once again in <a href="/psalms/115-7.htm">Psalm 115:7</a> that speech is wanting to them; for the other negations only deny life to them, this at the same time denies all personality. The author might know from his own experience how little was the distinction made by the heathen worship between the symbol and the thing symbolized. Accordingly the worship of idols seems to him, as to the later prophets, to be the extreme of self-stupefaction and of the destruction of human consciousness; and the final destiny of the worshippers of false gods, as he says in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115-8.htm">Psalm 115:8</a>, is, that they become like to their idols, that is to say, being deprived of their consciousness, life, and existence, they come to nothing, like those their nothingnesses (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>). This whole section of the Psalm is repeated in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135.htm">Psalm 135</a> (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115-6.htm">Psalm 115:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/115-15.htm">Psalm 115:15</a>). </body></html>
