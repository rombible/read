Why the psalmist should suddenly be struck with the dreadful thought that death broke the covenant relationship, and silenced prayer and praise, is not easy to see. Was the psalm first chanted after some victory? and was this suggested by the sight of the slain, who, though they had helped to win the triumph, could yet have no share in the praises that were ascending to Jehovah?<p>(17) <span class= "bld">Silence.</span>—The land of silence is, of course, Sheôl, the under-world.

Wherever there is right fear of God, there may be cheerful faith in him; those who reverence his word, may rely upon it. He is ever found faithful. The greatest need his blessing, and it shall not be denied to the meanest that fear him. God's blessing gives an increase, especially in spiritual blessings. And the Lord is to be praised: his goodness is large, for he has given the earth to the children of men for their use. The souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens of the flesh, are still praising him; but the dead body cannot praise God: death puts an end to our glorifying him in this world of trial and conflict. Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their service, therefore we will seek to do the more for God. We will not only do it ourselves, but will engage others to do it; to praise him when we are gone. Lord, thou art the only object for faith and love. Help us to praise thee while living and when dying, that thy name may be the first and last upon our lips: and let the sweet savour of thy name refresh our souls for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/115.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The dead praise not the Lord - The meaning of this is, that as those who are dead cannot praise God, or cannot worship him, this should be done while we are in the land of the living. This opportunity, like all other opportunities, will be cut off in the grave, and hence, we should be faithful in this duty, and should avail ourselves of this privilege, while life lasts. In regard to the sentiment here expressed, and the grounds on which that sentiment was entertained, see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18-19</a>; notes at <a href="/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>.<p>Neither any that go down into silence - Into the grave - the land of silence. <a href="/psalms/94-17.htm">Psalm 94:17</a>. Nothing is more impressive in regard to the grave than its utter silence. Not a voice, not a sound, is heard there - of birds or human beings - of song or conversation - of the roaring of the sea, the sighing of the breeze, the fury of the storm, the tumult of battle. Perfect stillness reigns there; and the first sound that shall be heard there will be the archangel's trump. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/115.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-17.

They cannot unite in the Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with which the church delights to adore her Lord. The preacher cannot magnify the Lord from his coffin, nor the Christian worker further manifest the power of divine grace by daily activity while he lies in the grave. "Neither any that go down into silence." The tomb sends forth no voice; from mouldering bones and flesh-consuming worms there arises no sound of gospel ministry nor of gracious song. One by one the singers in the consecrated choir of saints steal away from us, and we miss their music. Thank God, they have gone above to swell the harmonies of the skies, but as far as we are concerned, we have need to sing all the more earnestly because so many songsters have left our choirs.<p><a href="/psalms/115-18.htm">Psalm 115:18</a><p>"But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore." We who are still living will take care that the praises of God shall not fail among the sons of men. Our afflictions and depressions of spirit shall not cause us to suspend our praises; neither shall old age, and increasing infirmities damp the celestial fires, nay, nor shall even death itself cause us to cease from the delightful occupation. The spiritually dead cannot praise God, but the life within us constrains us to do so. The ungodly may abide in silence, but we will lift up our voices to the praise of Jehovah. Even though for a time he may work no miracle, and we may see no peculiar interposition of his power, yet on the strength of what he has done in ages past we will continue to laud his name "until the day break, and the shadows flee away," when he shall once more shine forth as the sun to gladden the faces of his children. The present time is auspicious for commencing a life of praise, since to-day he bids us hear his voice of mercy. "From this time forth" is the suggestion of wisdom, for this duty ought not to be delayed; and it is the dictate of gratitude, for there are pressing reasons for prompt thankfulness. Once begin praising God and we have entered upon an endless service. Even eternity cannot exhaust the reasons why God should be glorified. "Praise the Lord," or Hallelujah. Though the dead cannot, and the wicked will not, and the careless do not praise God, yet we will shout "Hallelujah" for ever and ever. Amen. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/115.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The dead; </span> such as we shall suddenly be, if thou dost not succour us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Into silence; </span> into the place of silence, the grave. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/115.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The dead praise not the Lord,.... Not the dead in sin; such as the makers of idols, and those that trust in them, who are like unto them; men must be made spiritually alive, ere they can show forth the praises of God: nor the dead corporeally. The souls of departed saints can and do praise the Lord: these die not with their bodies, nor sleep in the grave; they go immediately to God and Christ, and are employed in the service of God continually; particularly in praising him, as do the angels with whom they join; they sing the song of Moses and of the Lamb, of providence and grace; especially the song of redeeming love, with which they always praise the Lord: but they cannot praise him with their bodily organs until the resurrection, which by death are rendered useless; they can praise him no more among men on earth, as they have before done; there is no work of this kind in the grave. <p>Neither any that go down in silence; the grave, so called, because everything is mute and silent there (c); the instruments of speech are no more used on any account; no noise and clamour there from wicked men; there the wicked cease from troubling; and no songs of praise from good men, all still and quiet there. So the Targum, <p>"not any that go down to the house of the grave of the earth;'' <p>or the earthly grave. And therefore save us, O Lord, suffer not the enemy to destroy us; for, should he, we shall no more be capable of praising thee, as we have done and desire to do; for no such service is to be done in the grave, see <a href="/psalms/6-4.htm">Psalm 6:4</a>. <p>(c) "Silet rex ipsa silentum", Virgil.

The threefold division into Israel, the house of Aaron, and those who fear Jahve is the same as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-2.htm">Psalm 118:2-4</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135.htm">Psalm 135</a> the "house of Levi" is further added to the house of Aaron. Those who fear Jahve, who also stand in the last passage, are probably the proselytes (in the Acts of the Apostles &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, or merely &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>(Note: The appellation &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; does not however occur, if we do not bring <a href="/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2</a> in here; but in Latin inscriptions in Orelli-Hentzen No. 2523, and in Auer in the Zeitschrift fr katholische Theologie 1852, S. 80, the proselyte (religionis Judaicae) is called metuens.))<p>at any rate these are included even if Israel in <a href="/psalms/115-9.htm">Psalm 115:9</a> is meant to signify the laity, for the notion of "those who fear Jahve" extends beyond Israel. The fact that the threefold refrain of the summons does not run, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a>, our help and shield is He, is to be explained from its being an antiphonal song. In so far, however, as the Psalm supplicates God's protection and help in a campaign the declaration of confident hope, their help and shield is He, may, with Hitzig, be referred to the army that is gone or is going forth. It is the same voice which bids Israel to be of good courage and announces to the people the well-pleased acceptance of the sacrifice with the words "Jahve hath been mindful of us" (&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;, cf. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>), perhaps simultaneously with the presentation of the memorial portion (&#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1492;) of the meat-offering (<a href="/psalms/38-1.htm">Psalm 38:1</a>). The &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; placed at the head is particularized threefold, corresponding to the threefold summons. The special promise of blessing which is added in <a href="/psalms/115-14.htm">Psalm 115:14</a> is an echo of <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-11.htm">Deuteronomy 1:11</a>, as in <a href="/2_samuel/24-3.htm">2 Samuel 24:3</a>. The contracted future &#1497;&#1505;&#1507; we take in a consolatory sense; for as an optative it would be too isolated here. In spite of all oppression on the part of the heathen, God will make His people ever more numerous, more capable of offering resistance, and more awe-inspiring. </body></html>
