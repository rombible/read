All the good we do, is done by the power of his grace; and all the good we have, is the gift of his mere mercy, and he must have all the praise. Are we in pursuit of any mercy, and wrestling with God for it, we must take encouragement in prayer from God only. Lord, do so for us; not that we may have the credit and comfort of it, but that they mercy and truth may have the glory of it. The heathen gods are senseless things. They are the works of men's hands: the painter, the carver, the statuary, can put no life into them, therefore no sense. The psalmist hence shows the folly of the worshippers of idols.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/115.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore should the heathen say - The nations; they who worshipped idols, and who claimed that those idols were true gods. Why should we, thy people, be so left, so forsaken, so afflicted, as to lead these idolaters to suppose that we worship a false God, or that the God whom we adore is destitute of power or faithfulness; either that he does not exist, or that he cannot be relied on. It is evident that they were now in circumstances which would give some plausibility to the question here asked.<p>Where is now their God? - They seem to be forsaken. God, the God whom they worship, does not come forth for their defense. If he exists at all, he is destitute of power, or he is not true to the people who worship him, and he cannot be trusted.

The nations about Israel, the nations of the world; the Gentiles in any age; the Papists in ours, sometimes called the Heathen, <a href="/psalms/10-16.htm">Psalm 10:16</a>. The church expostulates with the Lord why those should be suffered to say, in a reproachful, insulting, manner, and by way of triumph, <p>where is now their God? that they have boasted of would help them; in whom they have put their trust and confidence; why does not he help them, as he has promised, and they expect? Thus the church suggests, that if the Lord did not appear for them, his own glory lay at stake.

The lxx, and just so the Targum, renders &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (from the Sanscrit barbaras, just as onomatopoetic as balbus, cf. Fleischer in Levy's Chaldisches Wrterbuch, i. 420). The redeemed nation is called Judah, inasmuch as God made it His sanctuary (&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;) by setting up His sanctuary (&#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>) in the midst of it, for Jerusalem (el k&#803;uds) as Benjamitish Judaean, and from the time of David was accounted directly as Judaean. In so far, however, as He made this people His kingdom (&#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, an amplificative plural with Mem pathachatum), by placing Himself in the relation of King (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>) to the people of possession which by a revealed law He established characteristically as His own, it is called Israel. 1 The predicate takes the form &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;, for peoples together with country and city are represented as feminine (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a>). The foundation of that new beginning in connection with the history of redemption was laid amidst majestic wonders, inasmuch as nature was brought into service, co-operating and sympathizing in the work (cf. <a href="/psalms/77-15.htm">Psalm 77:15</a>.). The dividing of the sea opens, and the dividing of the Jordan closes, the journey through the desert to Canaan. The sea stood aside, Jordan halted and was dammed up on the north in order that the redeemed people might pass through. And in the middle, between these great wonders of the exodus from Egypt and the entrance into Canaan, arises the not less mighty wonder of the giving of the Law: the skipping of the mountains like rams, of the ills like &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, i.e., lambs (Wisd. 19:9), depicts the quaking of Sinai and its environs (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, cf. supra <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>, and on the figure <a href="/psalms/29-6.htm">Psalm 29:6</a>). </body></html>
