Wherever there is right fear of God, there may be cheerful faith in him; those who reverence his word, may rely upon it. He is ever found faithful. The greatest need his blessing, and it shall not be denied to the meanest that fear him. God's blessing gives an increase, especially in spiritual blessings. And the Lord is to be praised: his goodness is large, for he has given the earth to the children of men for their use. The souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens of the flesh, are still praising him; but the dead body cannot praise God: death puts an end to our glorifying him in this world of trial and conflict. Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their service, therefore we will seek to do the more for God. We will not only do it ourselves, but will engage others to do it; to praise him when we are gone. Lord, thou art the only object for faith and love. Help us to praise thee while living and when dying, that thy name may be the first and last upon our lips: and let the sweet savour of thy name refresh our souls for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/115.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord hath been mindful of us - This would be especially appropriate if the psalm was written, as is commonly supposed, after the return from the captivity of Babylon. In such circumstances it would be every way proper to bring before the mind of the people the fact that God had remembered them and had delivered them.<p>He will bless us - Our past experience furnishes the fullest evidence that he will continue to bless us. He who has delivered us from so great calamities, and who has restored us to our native land after so long and so painful a captivity, will not forsake us now. There can be now no circumstances in which he cannot bestow on us all the blessings which we need; there will be none when we may not hope that he will bless us. If he could save us from such troubles, be can save us from all; if he did thus interpose, we may argue that he will always grant us his help when we need it.<p>He will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron - Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115-9.htm">Psalm 115:9-10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/115.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-13.

The Targum is, <p>"the Word of the Lord hath remembered us for good.'' <p>And is another reason why his people should trust in him: he has been mindful of his covenant with them and promises to them, and has kept them; he remembered them in their low estate, and sent redemption to them; goodness and mercy have followed them all their days. Past experiences of divine favour should encourage trust in the Lord, as well as promises of future blessings, as follow: <p>he will bless us; with all kind of blessings, temporal and spiritual; with blessings indeed, solid and substantial: it is certain and may be depended upon; he has promised it, and swore to it, that in blessing he will bless. Kimchi interprets it as a wish, "let him bless": the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions, render it in the past tense, "he hath blessed"; but the Targum as we: and as it follows, <p>he will bless the house of Israel; with whom he has made his new covenant; the household of faith, the family named of Christ, the whole Israel of God. <p>He will bless the house of Aaron; his priests, his ministers, all that offer up spiritual sacrifices to him; he will bless them with an increase of gifts and grace, and with his presence and Spirit, and therefore they should trust in him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/115.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless <i>us</i>; he <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.</span><p>(h) That is, he will continue his graces toward his people.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/115.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>.

Israel's God is in the heavens, and is therefore supramundane in nature and life, and the absolutely unlimited One, who is able to do all things with a freedom that is conditioned only by Himself: quod vult, valet (<a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>  equals  <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135-6.htm">Psalm 135:6</a>, Wisd. 12:18, and frequently).

It cannot be proved with <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:16</a> that &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501; are equivalent to &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;.

The author might know from his own experience how little was the distinction made by the heathen worship between the symbol and the thing symbolized. Accordingly the worship of idols seems to him, as to the later prophets, to be the extreme of self-stupefaction and of the destruction of human consciousness; and the final destiny of the worshippers of false gods, as he says in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115-8.htm">Psalm 115:8</a>, is, that they become like to their idols, that is to say, being deprived of their consciousness, life, and existence, they come to nothing, like those their nothingnesses (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>). This whole section of the Psalm is repeated in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135.htm">Psalm 135</a> (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115-6.htm">Psalm 115:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/115-15.htm">Psalm 115:15</a>). </body></html>
