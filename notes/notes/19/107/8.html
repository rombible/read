Dr. Hammond remarks very properly, that “this is a Psalm of answering, or of parts, to be sung alternately; having a double burden, or intercalary verse, oft recurring:” see <a href="/psalms/107-6.htm" title="Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.">Psalm 107:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/107-13.htm" title="Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.">Psalm 107:13</a>, &c. This, indeed, is apparent upon the most transient view of it. We may suppose one side of the choir to have begun with the first of the parts, and then the other side to have taken the second, and so on. The 9th verse evidently belongs to the first part, for the 10th begins quite another subject.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/107.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>107:1-9 In these verses there is reference to the deliverance from Egypt, and perhaps that from Babylon: but the circumstances of travellers in those countries are also noted. It is scarcely possible to conceive the horrors suffered by the hapless traveller, when crossing the trackless sands, exposed to the burning rays of the sum. The words describe their case whom the Lord has redeemed from the bondage of Satan; who pass through the world as a dangerous and dreary wilderness, often ready to faint through troubles, fears, and temptations. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, after God, and communion with him, shall be filled with the goodness of his house, both in grace and glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness - More literally, "Let such - or, let these - praise the Lord for his goodness," the word "men" having been supplied by our translators. Yet it is not improper to suppose that a wider range is intended than would be denoted if it were confined to those who had then been delivered. It was evidently designed to impress the minds of those who might use this psalm in their devotions; and the idea is, that the deliverance then vouchsafed to the people of God in their troubles should lead all to praise and adore him. Such a surprising interposition suggested an important lesson in regard to God, applicable to all people; and should lead all to praise him in view of the trait of character thus manifested, as that of a God who hears prayer when his people are in trouble, and who can make a straight path before them when they are in danger of being lost, and who can conduct them through the wilderness - the waste places - of this world, as he did his people across the pathless sands of the desert. The true use of all history is to teach us lessons about God.<p>And for his wonderful works to the children of men - His doings as suited to excite wonder and admiration. His dealings with his people in the desert furnished one illustration of this; the world is full of such illustrations. The desire expressed in this verse suggests the great lesson of the psalm. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/107.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8, 9.

This verse is repeated at the close of each of the instances produced; in which the goodness of God appears to persons in distress, and who being delivered, ought to acknowledge it, and be thankful for it: or "confess": that is, declare to God his goodness, and to the children of men his wonderful works; so the Targum. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/107.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/107.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>.

The Psalm carries the marks of its deutero-Isaianic character on the very front of it, viz.: "the redeemed of Jahve," taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/62-12.htm">Isaiah 62:12</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/63-4.htm">Psalm 63:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-9.htm">Psalm 35:9</a>.; &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1509; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/56-8.htm">Isaiah 56:8</a>, and frequently; "from the north and from the sea," as in <a href="/isaiah/49-12.htm">Isaiah 49:12</a> : "the sea" (&#1497;&#1501;) here (as perhaps there also), side by side with east, west, and north, is the south, or rather (since &#1497;&#1501; is an established usus loquendi for the west) the south-west, viz., the southern portion of the Mediterranean washing the shores of Egypt. With this the poet associates the thought of the exiles of Egypt, as with &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; the exiles of the islands, i.e., of Asia Minor and Europe; he is therefore writing at a period in which the Jewish state newly founded by the release of the Babylonian exiles had induced the scattered fellow-countrymen in all countries to return home. Calling upon the redeemed ones to give thanks to God the Redeemer in order that the work of the restoration of Israel may be gloriously perfected amidst the thanksgiving of the redeemed ones, he forthwith formulates the thanksgiving by putting the language of thanksgiving of the ancient liturgy (<a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>) into their mouth. The nation, now again established upon the soil of the fatherland, has, until it had acquired this again, seen destruction in every form in a strange land, and can tell of the most manifold divine deliverances. The call to sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving is expanded accordingly into several pictures portraying the dangers of the strange land, which are not so much allegorical, personifying the Exile, as rather exemplificative. </body></html>
