So the vessel, with the mariners on board, seems to stagger and reel in the storm.<p>And are at their wit's end - Margin, as in Hebrew, "All their wisdom is swallowed up." That is, They have no skill to guide the vessel. All that has been done by the wisdom of naval architecture in constructing it, and all that has been derived from experience in navigating the ocean, seems now to be useless. They are at the mercy of the winds and waves; they are dependent wholly on God; they can now only cry to him to save them. Often this occurs in a storm at sea, when the most skillful and experienced seaman feels that he can do no more. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/107.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. are &#8230; end&#8212;literally, "all their wisdom swallows up itself," destroys itself by vain and contradictory devices, such as despair induces.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/107.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Stagger like a drunken man; </span> not so much from the giddiness of their heads, which is not usual in persons accustomed to the sea, as through the violent and various motions of the sea and the ship. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/107.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,....

It is one who insanely lives only for the passing hour, and ruins health, calling, family, and in short himself and everything belonging to him. Those who were thus minded, the poet begins by saying, were obliged to suffer by reason of (in consequence of) their wicked course of life. The cause of their days of pain and sorrow is placed first by way of emphasis; and because it has a meaning that is related to the past &#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; thereby comes all the more easily to express that which took place simultaneously in the past. The Hithpa. in <a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a> signifies to suffer willingly or intentionally; here: to be obliged to submit to suffering against one's will. Hengstenberg, for example, construes it differently: "Fools because of their walk in transgression (more than 'because of their transgression'), and those who because of their iniquities were afflicted - all food," etc. But &#1502;&#1503; beside &#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; has the assumption in its favour of being an affirmation of the cause of the affliction. In <a href="/psalms/107-18.htm">Psalm 107:18</a> the poet has the Book of Job (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-20.htm">Job 33:20</a>, <a href="/job/33-22.htm">Job 33:22</a>) before his eye.

But <a href="/lamentations/4-20.htm">Lamentations 4:20</a> is against this. From &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492; is formed a noun &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;) in the signification a hollow place (<a href="/proverbs/28-10.htm">Proverbs 28:10</a>), the collateral form of which, &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;), is inflected like &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, plur. &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; with a retention of the substantival termination.
