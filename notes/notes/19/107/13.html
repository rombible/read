In the eastern prisons the captives were and are treated with much severity. Afflicting providences must be improved as humbling providences; and we lose the benefit, if our hearts are unhumbled and unbroken under them. This is a shadow of the sinner's deliverance from a far worse confinement. The awakened sinner discovers his guilt and misery. Having struggled in vain for deliverance, he finds there is no help for him but in the mercy and grace of God. His sin is forgiven by a merciful God, and his pardon is accompanied by deliverance from the power of sin and Satan, and by the sanctifying and comforting influences of God the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble - Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>.

According to <a href="/psalms/107-40.htm">Psalm 107:40</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>, it appears that <a href="/psalms/107-4.htm">Psalm 107:4</a> ought to be read &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; (Olshausen, Baur, and Thenius); but the line is thereby lengthened inelegantly. The two words, joined by Munach, stand in the construct state, like &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, <a href="/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a> : a waste of a way  equals  &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a> (Ewald, Hitzig), which is better suited to the poetical style than that &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, as in &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507;p, and the like, should be an accusative of nearer definition (Hengstenberg). In connection with &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; the poet, who is fond of this combination (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-7.htm">Psalm 107:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-36.htm">Psalm 107:36</a>, cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, <a href="/leviticus/25-29.htm">Leviticus 25:29</a>), means any city whatever which might afford the homeless ones a habitable, hospitable reception. With the perfects, which describe what has been experienced, alternates in <a href="/psalms/107-5.htm">Psalm 107:5</a> the imperfect, which shifts to the way in which anything comes about: their soul in them enveloped itself (vid., <a href="/psalms/61-3.htm">Psalm 61:3</a>), i.e., was nigh upon extinction. With the fut. consec. then follows in <a href="/psalms/107-6.htm">Psalm 107:6</a> the fact which gave the turn to the change in their misfortune. Their cry for help, as the imperfect &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501; implies, was accompanied by their deliverance, the fact of which is expressed by the following fut. consec. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;. Those who have experienced such things are to confess to the Lord, with thanksgiving, His loving-kindness and His wonderful works to the children of men. It is not to be rendered: His wonders (supply &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;) towards the children of men (Luther, Olshausen, and others). The two &#1500; coincide: their thankful confession of the divine loving-kindness and wondrous acts is not to be addressed alone to Jahve Himself, but also to men, in order that out of what they have experienced a wholesome fruit may spring forth for the multitude. &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1511;&#1511;&#1492; (part. Polel, the e&#772; of which is retained as a pre-tonic vowel in pause, cf. <a href="/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a> and on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-27.htm">Job 20:27</a>, Ew. 188, b) is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>, the thirsting soul (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, Arab. sa&#770;q, to urge forward, of the impulse and drawing of the emotions, in Hebrew to desire ardently). The preterites are here an expression of that which has been experienced, and therefore of that which has become a fact of experience. In superabundant measure does God uphold the languishing soul that is in imminent danger of languishing away. </body></html>
