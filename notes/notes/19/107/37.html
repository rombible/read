Let the present desolate state of Judea, and of other countries, explain this. If we look abroad in the world, we see many greatly increase, whose beginning was small. We see many who have thus suddenly risen, as suddenly brought to nothing. Worldly wealth is uncertain; often those who are filled with it, ere they are aware, lose it again. God has many ways of making men poor. The righteous shall rejoice. It shall fully convince all those who deny the Divine Providence. When sinners see how justly God takes away the gifts they have abused, they will not have a word to say. It is of great use to us to be fully assured of God's goodness, and duly affected with it. It is our wisdom to mind our duty, and to refer our comfort to him. A truly wise person will treasure in his heart this delightful psalm. From it, he will fully understand the weakness and wretchedness of man, and the power and loving-kindness of God, not for our merit, but for his mercy's sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And sow the fields, and plant vineyards - Cultivate the earth.

And so raise a sufficient supply of corn and wine for the support of themselves and families. In a spiritual sense the "fields" are the world, and the seed which is sown is the word; the persons that sow it are the ministers of the Gospel, which, by a divine blessing, brings forth fruit, in some thirty, some sixty, and some an hundred fold: the "vineyards" are the churches, planted by Christ and by his ministers, as his instruments; believers are the pleasant plants in them, and young converts are the tender grapes <p>Which may yield fruits of increase; or "fruit" and "increase"; the fields yield all sorts of grain for food, and the vineyards wine for drink. So the seed of the word being sown, and churches planted, they increase with the increase of God, and bring forth fruits of righteousness to the glory of his name. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/107.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> increase.</span><p>(r) Continual increase and yearly.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/107.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">37</span>.

Without any allegory (Hengstenberg) it speaks of those who by reason of their calling traverse (which is expressed by &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; because the surface of the sea lies below the dry land which slopes off towards the coast) the sea in ships (read boo&#774;nijoth without the article), and that not as fishermen, but (as Luther has correctly understood the choice of the word) in commercial enterprises. These have seen the works and wonders of God in the eddying deep, i.e., they have seen with their own eyes what God can do when in His anger He calls up the powers of nature, and on the other hand when He compassionately orders them back into their bounds. God's mandate (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-31.htm">Psalm 105:31</a>, <a href="/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a>) brought it to pass that a stormy wind arose (cf. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, <a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>), and it drove its (the sea's) waves on high, so that the seafarers at one time were tossed up to the sky and then hurled down again into deep abysses, and their soul melted &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, in an evil, anxious mood, i.e., lost all its firmness.

The poet here writes under the influence of <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/19-14.htm">Isaiah 19:14</a>.

The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1511; in relation to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is the stronger word, like &#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; in relation to &#1495;&#1512;&#1501; in the history of the Flood. Those who have been thus marvellously rescued are then called upon thankfully to praise God their Deliverer in the place where the national church assembles, and where the chiefs of the nation sit in council; therefore, as it seems, in the Temple and in the Forum.<p>(Note: In exact editions like Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer's, before <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-24.htm">Psalm 107:24</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-27.htm">Psalm 107:27</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-28.htm">Psalm 107:28</a>, and <a href="/psalms/107-40.htm">Psalm 107:40</a> there stand reversed Nuns (&#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1492;&#1508;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, in the language of the Masora &#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1504;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;), as before <a href="/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a> and between <a href="/numbers/10-36.htm">Numbers 10:36</a> and <a href="/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1</a> (nine in all). Their signification is unknown.)<p>Now follow two more groups without the two beautiful and impressive refrains with which the four preceding groups are interspersed. The structure is less artistic, and the transitions here and there abrupt and awkward. One might say that these two groups are inferior to the rest, much as the speeches of Elihu are inferior to the rest of the Book of Job. That they are, however, nevertheless from the hand of the very same poet is at once seen from the continued dependence upon the Book of Job and Isaiah. Hengstenberg sees in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33-42</a> "the song with which they exalt the Lord in the assembly of the people and upon the seat of the elders." but the materia laudis is altogether different from that which is to be expected according to the preceding calls to praise. Nor is it any the more clear to us that <a href="/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33</a>. refer to the overthrow of Babylon, and <a href="/psalms/107-35.htm">Psalm 107:35</a>. to the happy turn of affairs that took place simultaneously for Israel; <a href="/psalms/107-35.htm">Psalm 107:35</a> does not suit Canaan, and the expressions in <a href="/psalms/107-36.htm">Psalm 107:36</a>. would be understood in too low a sense. No, the poet goes on further to illustrate the helpful government of God the just and gracious One, inasmuch as he has experiences in his mind in connection therewith, of which the dispersion of Israel in all places can sing and speak. </body></html>
