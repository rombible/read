It is one who insanely lives only for the passing hour, and ruins health, calling, family, and in short himself and everything belonging to him. Those who were thus minded, the poet begins by saying, were obliged to suffer by reason of (in consequence of) their wicked course of life. The cause of their days of pain and sorrow is placed first by way of emphasis; and because it has a meaning that is related to the past &#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; thereby comes all the more easily to express that which took place simultaneously in the past. The Hithpa. in <a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a> signifies to suffer willingly or intentionally; here: to be obliged to submit to suffering against one's will. Hengstenberg, for example, construes it differently: "Fools because of their walk in transgression (more than 'because of their transgression'), and those who because of their iniquities were afflicted - all food," etc. But &#1502;&#1503; beside &#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; has the assumption in its favour of being an affirmation of the cause of the affliction. In <a href="/psalms/107-18.htm">Psalm 107:18</a> the poet has the Book of Job (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-20.htm">Job 33:20</a>, <a href="/job/33-22.htm">Job 33:22</a>) before his eye.

But <a href="/lamentations/4-20.htm">Lamentations 4:20</a> is against this. From &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492; is formed a noun &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;) in the signification a hollow place (<a href="/proverbs/28-10.htm">Proverbs 28:10</a>), the collateral form of which, &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;), is inflected like &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, plur. &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; with a retention of the substantival termination. The "pits" are the deep afflictions into which they were plunged, and out of which God caused them to escape. The suffix of &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1501; avails also for &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;, as in <a href="/genesis/27-5.htm">Genesis 27:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/30-31.htm">Genesis 30:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-5.htm">Isaiah 46:5</a>. </body></html>
