It is scarcely possible to conceive the horrors suffered by the hapless traveller, when crossing the trackless sands, exposed to the burning rays of the sum. The words describe their case whom the Lord has redeemed from the bondage of Satan; who pass through the world as a dangerous and dreary wilderness, often ready to faint through troubles, fears, and temptations. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, after God, and communion with him, shall be filled with the goodness of his house, both in grace and glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/106-1.htm">Psalm 106:1</a>.<p>For his mercy endureth for ever - He is unchanging in his mercy. It is an attribute of his very nature. He is constantly manifesting it. The word rendered "mercy" here, however - &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;  chesed - is more general in its signification than our word "mercy." Our word means "favor shown to the guilty;" the Hebrew word means kindness, goodness, benignity in general. It is this which is celebrated in the psalm before us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/107.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 107<p>Ps 107:1-43. Although the general theme of this Psalm may have been suggested by God's special favor to the Israelites in their restoration from captivity, it must be regarded as an instructive celebration of God's praise for His merciful providence to all men in their various emergencies. Of these several are given&#8212;captivity and bondage, wanderings by land and sea, and famine; some as evidences of God's displeasure, and all the deliverances as evidence of His goodness and mercy to them who humbly seek Him.<p>1, 2. This call for thankful praise is the burden or chorus (compare Ps 107:8, 15, &c.).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/107.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy endureth forever.<p>2 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;<p>3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.<p><a href="/psalms/107-1.htm">Psalm 107:1</a><p>"O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good." It is all we can give him, and the least we can give; therefore let us diligently render to him our thanksgiving. The Psalmist is in earnest in the exhortation, hence the use of the interjection "O" to intensify his words: let us be at all times thoroughly fervent in the praises of the Lord, both with our lips and with our lives, by thanksgiving and thanksgiving. JEHOVAH, for that is the name here used, is not to be worshipped with groans and cries, but with thanks, for he is good; and these thanks should be heartily rendered, for his is no common goodness: he is good by nature, and essence, and proven to be good in all the acts of his eternity. Compared with him there is none good, no, not one: but he is essentially, perpetually, superlatively, infinitely good. We are the perpetual partakers of his goodness, and therefore ought above all his creatures to magnify his name. Our praise should be increased by the fact that the divine goodness is not a transient thing, but in the attribute of mercy abides for ever the same, "for his mercy endureth for ever." The word endureth has been properly supplied by the translators, but yet it somewhat restricts the sense, which will be better seen if we read it, "for his mercy for ever." That mercy had no beginning, and shall never know an end. Our sin required that goodness should display itself to us in the form of mercy, and it has done so, and will do so evermore; let us not be slack in praising the goodness which thus adapts itself to our fallen nature.<p><a href="/psalms/107-2.htm">Psalm 107:2</a><p>"Let the redeemed of the Lord say so." Whatever others may think or say, the redeemed have overwhelming reasons for declaring the goodness of the Lord. Theirs is a peculiar redemption, and for it they ought to render peculiar praise. The Redeemer is so glorious, the ransom price so immense, and the redemption so complete, that they are under sevenfold obligations to give thanks unto the Lord, and to exhort others to do so. Let them not only feel so but say so; let them both sing and bid their fellows sing. "Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy." Snatched by superior power away from fierce oppressions, they are bound above all men to adore the Lord, their Liberator. Theirs is a divine redemption, "he hath redeemed" them, and no one else has done it. His own unaided arm has wrought out their deliverance. Should not emancipated slaves be grateful to the hand which set them free? What gratitude can suffice for a deliverance from the power of sin, death, and hell? In heaven itself there is no sweeter hymn than that whose burden is, "Thou hast redeemed us unto God by thy blood."<p><a href="/psalms/107-3.htm">Psalm 107:3</a><p>"And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south." Gathering follows upon redeeming. The captives of old were restored to their own land from every quarter of the earth, and even from beyond the sea; for the word translated south is really the sea. No matter what divides, the Lord will gather his own into one body, and first on earth by "one Lord, one faith, and one baptism," and then in heaven by one common bliss they shall be known to be the one people of the One God. What a glorious Shepherd must he be who thus collects the blood-bought flock from the remotest regions, guides them through countless perils, and at last makes them to lie down in the green pastures of Paradise. Some have wandered one way and some another, they have all left Immanuel's land and strayed as far as they could, and great are the grace and power by which they are all collected into one flock by the Lord Jesus. With one heart and voice let the redeemed praise the Lord who gathers them into one. <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The most of the Psalms have a peculiar respect unto the church or people of God, or to some eminent members thereof; but there are some few Psalms which have a more general respect to all nations, of which number this is one; wherein the psalmist discourseth of the merciful providence of God towards all mankind, and of his readiness to help them in all their distresses, some few particular instances whereof he mentioneth, and leaveth the rest to be understood, there being the same reason of all. But withal he takes notice also of God’s judgments upon wicked persons and people. And by this representation of God’s mercies and judgments, he invites all nations to an acknowledgment of the true God, to praise him for his favours, and to tremble at his judgments, which is their just duty and reasonable service. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>An exhortation to the redeemed to praise and celebrate the Lord, and to observe his manifold providences, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/107-1.htm" title="O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endures for ever....">Psalm 107:1-3</a></span>; to strangers and captives, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/107-4.htm" title="They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in....">Psalm 107:4-16</a></span>; to sick, and sea-men, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/107-17.htm" title="Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted....">Psalm 107:17-32</a></span>; and to all others, commending them that carefully observe this, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/107-33.htm" title="He turns rivers into a wilderness, and the springs into dry ground;...">Psalm 107:33-43</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This whole verse occurs also <span class="bld"><span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/106-1.htm" title="Praise you the LORD.

Since they did not execute this command (vid., <a href="/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>), that which it was intended to prevent came to pass: the heathen became to them a snare (mowqeesh), <a href="/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>. They intermarried with them, and fell into the Canaanitish custom in which the abominations of heathenism culminate, viz., the human sacrifice, which Jahve abhorreth (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>), and only the demons (&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>) delight in.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/106-40.htm">Psalm 106:40-43</a> the poet (as in <a href="/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a>.) sketches the alternation of apostasy, captivity, redemption, and relapse which followed upon the possession of Canaan, and more especially that which characterized the period of the judges. God's "counsel" was to make Israel free and glorious, but they leaned upon themselves, following their own intentions (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1501;); wherefore they perished in their sins. The poet uses &#1502;&#1499;&#1498; (to sink down, fall away) instead of the &#1504;&#1502;&#1511; (to moulder, rot) of the primary passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>, retained in <a href="/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-10.htm">Ezekiel 33:10</a>, which is no blunder (Hitzig), but a deliberate change. </body></html>
