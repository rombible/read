Sinners are fools. They hurt their bodily health by intemperance, and endanger their lives by indulging their appetites. This their way is their folly. The weakness of the body is the effect of sickness. It is by the power and mercy of God that we are recovered from sickness, and it is our duty to be thankful. All Christ's miraculous cures were emblems of his healing diseases of the soul. It is also to be applied to the spiritual cures which the Spirit of grace works. He sends his word, and heals souls; convinces, converts them, makes them holy, and all by the word. Even in common cases of recovery from sickness, God in his providence speaks, and it is done; by his word and Spirit the soul is restored to health and holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/107.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then they cry unto the Lord... - See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-6.htm">Psalm 107:6</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-13.htm">Psalm 107:13</a>, note. The meaning here is, that if the "sick" cry to the Lord, he hears them, and delivers them. This cannot mean that it "always" occurs, but it occurs "so often" as to show that God can and does interpose to save; "so often" as to encourage us thus to call upon him when we are sick; "so often" as to lay a proper foundation for praise. Many persons - very many - can recall such instances in their own lives, when they seemed to all human appearance to be drawing near to the gates of death, and when, in connection with prayer, their disease took a favorable turn, and they were restored again to health.

A time of affliction is a time of trouble, and a proper season for prayer; and by it persons are brought to the throne of grace, when humbled under the mighty hand of God, to seek for relief. Hezekiah in his affliction prayed to the Lord, though Asa sought to the physicians only, and not to the Lord; this is to be understood of such who are convinced of their folly, brought to a sense of sin and danger, and therefore cry to the Lord for his sparing mercy, and pardoning grace. <p>And he saveth them out of their distresses: their afflictions, which were distressing to them, by removing their disorders and restoring them to health again; as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/107.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/107.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he sayeth them out of their distresses</span> (see above, vers. 6 and 13). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/107.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Others suffered imprisonment and bonds; but through Him who had decreed this as punishment for them, they also again reached the light of freedom. Just as in the first strophe, here, too, as far as &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-15.htm">Psalm 107:15</a>, is all a compound subject; and in view of this the poet begins with participles. "Darkness and the shadow of death" (vid., <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>) is an Isaianic expression, <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a> (where &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; is construed with &#1489;), <a href="/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a> (where &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; is construed as here, cf. <a href="/genesis/4-20.htm">Genesis 4:20</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>), just as "bound in torture and iron" takes its rise from <a href="/job/36-8.htm">Job 36:8</a>. The old expositors call it a hendiadys for "torturing iron" (after <a href="/psalms/105-18.htm">Psalm 105:18</a>); but it is more correct to take the one as the general term and the other as the particular: bound in all sorts of affliction from which they could not break away, and more particularly in iron bonds (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;, like the Arabic firzil, an iron fetter, vid., on <a href="/psalms/105-18.htm">Psalm 105:18</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-11.htm">Psalm 107:11</a>, which calls to mind <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>, and with respect to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-12.htm">Psalm 107:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8</a>, the double play upon the sound of the words is unmistakeable. By &#1506;&#1510;&#1492; is meant the plan in accordance with which God governs, more particularly His final purpose, which lies at the basis of His leadings of Israel. Not only had they nullified this purpose of mercy by defiant resistance (&#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;) against God's commandments (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;, Arabic awa&#770;mir, a&#770;mireh) on their part, but they had even blasphemed it; &#1504;&#1488;&#1509;, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-19.htm">Deuteronomy 32:19</a>, and frequently, or &#1504;&#1488;&#1509; (prop. to pierce, then to treat roughly), is an old Mosaic designation of blasphemy, <a href="/deuteronomy/31-20.htm">Deuteronomy 31:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>, <a href="/numbers/14-23.htm">Numbers 14:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30</a>. Therefore God thoroughly humbled them by afflictive labour, and caused them to stumble (&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;). But when they were driven to it, and prayed importunately to Him, He helped them out of their straits. The refrain varies according to recognised custom. Twice the expression is &#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1506;&#1511;&#1493;, twice &#1493;&#1497;&#1494;&#1506;&#1511;&#1493;; once &#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;, then twice &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1501;, and last of all &#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1501;, which follows here in <a href="/psalms/107-14.htm">Psalm 107:14</a> as an alliteration. The summary condensation of the deliverance experienced (<a href="/psalms/107-16.htm">Psalm 107:16</a>) is moulded after <a href="/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45:2</a>. The Exile, too, may be regarded as such like a large jail (vid., e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/42-22.htm">Isaiah 42:22</a>); but the descriptions of the poet are not pictures, but examples. </body></html>
