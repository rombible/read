It is scarcely possible to conceive the horrors suffered by the hapless traveller, when crossing the trackless sands, exposed to the burning rays of the sum. The words describe their case whom the Lord has redeemed from the bondage of Satan; who pass through the world as a dangerous and dreary wilderness, often ready to faint through troubles, fears, and temptations.

He gives them food and drink, so that their needs are met. The "particular" reference here, however, in the word rendered "longing" is to "thirst," as contradistinguished from the other member of the verse, where the reference is to "hunger." So the word is used in <a href="/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a>.<p>And filleth the hungry soul with goodness - Supplies the needs of the hungry with "good;" that is, with that which is "good" for it; which meets its needs, and imparts strength and happiness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/107.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8, 9.

The Psalm carries the marks of its deutero-Isaianic character on the very front of it, viz.: "the redeemed of Jahve," taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/62-12.htm">Isaiah 62:12</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/63-4.htm">Psalm 63:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-9.htm">Psalm 35:9</a>.; &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1509; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/56-8.htm">Isaiah 56:8</a>, and frequently; "from the north and from the sea," as in <a href="/isaiah/49-12.htm">Isaiah 49:12</a> : "the sea" (&#1497;&#1501;) here (as perhaps there also), side by side with east, west, and north, is the south, or rather (since &#1497;&#1501; is an established usus loquendi for the west) the south-west, viz., the southern portion of the Mediterranean washing the shores of Egypt. With this the poet associates the thought of the exiles of Egypt, as with &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; the exiles of the islands, i.e., of Asia Minor and Europe; he is therefore writing at a period in which the Jewish state newly founded by the release of the Babylonian exiles had induced the scattered fellow-countrymen in all countries to return home. Calling upon the redeemed ones to give thanks to God the Redeemer in order that the work of the restoration of Israel may be gloriously perfected amidst the thanksgiving of the redeemed ones, he forthwith formulates the thanksgiving by putting the language of thanksgiving of the ancient liturgy (<a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>) into their mouth. The nation, now again established upon the soil of the fatherland, has, until it had acquired this again, seen destruction in every form in a strange land, and can tell of the most manifold divine deliverances. The call to sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving is expanded accordingly into several pictures portraying the dangers of the strange land, which are not so much allegorical, personifying the Exile, as rather exemplificative. </body></html>
