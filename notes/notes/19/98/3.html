Converts sing a new song, very different from what they had sung. If the grace of God put a new heart into our breasts, it will put a new song into our mouths. Let this new song be sung to the praise of God, in consideration of the wonders he has wrought. The Redeemer has overcome all difficulties in the way of our redemption, and was not discouraged by the services or sufferings appointed him. Let us praise him for the discoveries made to the world of the work of redemption; his salvation and his righteousness fulfilling the prophecies and promises of the Old Testament. In pursuance of this design, God raised up his Son Jesus to be not only a Light to lighten the Gentiles, but the glory of his people Israel. Surely it behoves us to inquire whether his holy arm hath gotten the victory in our hearts, over the power of Satan, unbelief, and sin? If this be our happy case, we shall exchange all light songs of vanity for songs of joy and thanksgiving; our lives will celebrate the Redeemer's praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/98.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He hath remembered his mercy - Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/1-54.htm">Luke 1:54-55</a> (note), <a href="/luke/1-72.htm">Luke 1:72</a> (note), where this passage in the Psalms was not improbably referred to by Mary and Zacharias. The idea is, that God had called to mind his promise of mercy to his people; that he had not suffered it to pass out of his recollection; that he had kept his word.<p>And his truth - He has kept his promise; he has shown that he is a God of truth.<p>Toward the house of Israel - Toward his people.<p>All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God - This appears to have been quoted from <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>. See the notes at that passage. The resemblance in the language is so strong as to make it probable that the psalm was composed after the times of Isaiah, and not improbably to be used (as remarked above) in the dedication of the temple after the captivity. The whole psalm would be appropriate to celebrate that deliverance; while, at the same time, like the language in Isaiah, it would be adapted to celebrate a higher deliverance - under the Messiah - of which that was an emblem. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/98.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.
