See the notes at <a href="/psalms/95-1.htm">Psalm 95:1</a>.<p>All the earth - All lands. The event is of sufficient importance to be celebrated by all nations. It is a matter of universal exultation and joy.<p>Make a loud noise - The word used here - &#1508;&#1510;&#1495;  pa&#770;tsach - means properly to break in pieces; then, to break forth, as a shout of triumph or joy, as if the joy could be no longer confined or repressed. See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/14-7.htm">Isaiah 14:7</a>. The word occurs only in the following places (besides that which is before us), in all of which it is rendered "break forth." <a href="/isaiah/14-7.htm">Isaiah 14:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-13.htm">Isaiah 49:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-9.htm">Isaiah 52:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a> - (except in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>, where it it is rendered "break"). It is expressive of irrepressible joy.<p>Rejoice and sing praise - This very combination of the words, "Break forth into joy, sing together" - the same words in Hebrew as here - occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/52-9.htm">Isaiah 52:9</a>, showing, as above remarked, that the psalm was composed after the times of Isaiah, and probably had reference to the same event. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/98.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6. make a loud noise&#8212;or, "burst forth" (Isa 14:7; 44:23).<p>before &#8230; King&#8212;hail Him as your sovereign; and while, with every aid to demonstrate zeal and joy, intelligent creatures are invited to praise, as in Ps 96:11-13, inanimate nature is also summoned to honor Him who triumphs and rules in righteousness and equity.   <a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/98.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>4 Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth; make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.<p>5 Sing unto the Lord with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a Psalm.<p>6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the Lord, the King.<p>In these three verses we are taught how to praise the Lord.<p><a href="/psalms/98-4.htm">Psalm 98:4</a><p>"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth." Every tongue must applaud, and that with the vigour which joy of heart alone can arouse to action. As men shout when they welcome a king, so must we. Loud hosannas, full of happiness, must be lifted up. If ever men shout for joy it should be when the Lord comes among them in the proclamation of his gospel reign. John Wesley said to his people, "Sing lustily, and with a good courage. Beware of singing as if you were half dead or half asleep; but lift up your voice with strength. Be no more afraid of your voice now, nor more ashamed of its being heard, than when you sung the songs of Satan." "Make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise;" or "Burst forth, and sing, and play." Let every form of exultation be used, every kind of music pressed into the service till the accumulated praise causes the skies to echo the joyful tumult. There is no fear of our being too hearty in magnifying the God of our salvation, only we must take care that the song comes from the heart, otherwise the music is nothing but a noise in his ears, whether it be caused by human throats, or organ pipes, or far-resounding trumpets. Loud let our hearts ring out the honours of our conquering Saviour; with all our might let us extol the Lord who has vanquished all our enemies, and led our captivity captive. He will do this best who is most in love with Jesus: - <p>"I've found the pearl of greatest price,<p>My heart doth sing for joy;<p>And sing I must, a Christ Ihave,<p>Oh, what a Christ have!"<p><a href="/psalms/98-5.htm">Psalm 98:5</a><p>"Sing unto the Lord with the harp."
