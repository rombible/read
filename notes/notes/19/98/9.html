The different orders of rational creatures in the universe, seem to be described in figurative language in the reign of the great Messiah. The kingdom of Christ will be a blessing to the whole creation. We expect his second coming to begin his glorious reign. Then shall heaven and earth rejoice, and the joy of the redeemed shall be full. But sin and its dreadful effects will not be utterly done away, till the Lord come to judge the world in righteousness. Seeing then that we look for such things, let us give diligence that we may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/98.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before the Lord, for he cometh to judge the earth ... - This verse is essentially the same as <a href="/psalms/96-13.htm">Psalm 96:13</a>. See the notes at that verse. The psalm calls for universal praise. The very "reading" of the psalm - so joyous - so jubilant - so animated - so exulting - is suited to awaken the mind to praise; to rouse it to thankfulness; to fill it with joy. One cannot read the psalm without being a happier man; without being lifted above the world; without lofty views of God; without a feeling that he is worthy of this universal praise; without recognizing that we are in a world where the mind should be joyful; that we are under the dominion of a God whose reign should fill the mind with gladness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/98.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6. make a loud noise&#8212;or, "burst forth" (Isa 14:7; 44:23).<p>before &#8230; King&#8212;hail Him as your sovereign; and while, with every aid to demonstrate zeal and joy, intelligent creatures are invited to praise, as in Ps 96:11-13, inanimate nature is also summoned to honor Him who triumphs and rules in righteousness and equity.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/98.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/98.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Before the Lord, for he cometh to judge the earth,....
