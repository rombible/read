The first words of the complaint were used by Christ himself upon the cross; the first words of the triumph are expressly applied to him, Heb 2:12. All our praises must refer to the work of redemption. The suffering of the Redeemer was graciously accepted as a full satisfaction for sin. Though it was offered for sinful men, the Father did not despise or abhor it for our sakes. This ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. All humble, gracious souls should have a full satisfaction and happiness in him. Those that hunger and thirst after righteousness in Christ, shall not labour for that which satisfies not. Those that are much in praying, will be much in thanksgiving. Those that turn to God, will make conscience of worshipping before him. Let every tongue confess that he is Lord. High and low, rich and poor, bond and free, meet in Christ. Seeing we cannot keep alive our own souls, it is our wisdom, by obedient faith, to commit our souls to Christ, who is able to save and keep them alive for ever. A seed shall serve him. God will have a church in the world to the end of time. They shall be accounted to him for a generation; he will be the same to them that he was to those who went before them. His righteousness, and not any of their own, they shall declare to be the foundation of all their hopes, and the fountain of all their joys. Redemption by Christ is the Lord's own doing. Here we see the free love and compassion of God the Father, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, for us wretched sinners, as the source of all grace and consolation; the example we are to follow, the treatment as Christians we are to expect, and the conduct under it we are to adopt. Every lesson may here be learned that can profit the humbled soul. Let those who go about to establish their own righteousness inquire, why the beloved Son of God should thus suffer, if their own doings could atone for sin? Let the ungodly professor consider whether the Saviour thus honoured the Divine law, to purchase him the privilege of despising it. Let the careless take warning to flee from the wrath to come, and the trembling rest their hopes upon this merciful Redeemer. Let the tempted and distressed believer cheerfully expect a happy end of every trial.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My praise shall be of thee - That is, I will praise thee.

That is, he would keep the vows which in his afflictions he had made, that he would praise and serve God. These vows or promises were of the nature of a "debt" which he says he would remember to pay. Of the Redeemer, this need not be understood personally, but it means that as the result of his prayer having been heard, the worship of God would be celebrated by those who feared him. The solemn worship of the people of God - the praises which they offer to the Most High - may be regarded as worship paid by the Redeemer himself, for he does it in the persons and services of those whom he redeemed. All the praises which proceed from their hearts and lips are the fruit of his "vows," of his fidelity, and his prayers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25, 26. My praise shall be of thee&#8212;or, perhaps better, "from thee," that is, God gives grace to praise Him. With offering praise, he further evinces his gratitude by promising the payment of his vows, in celebrating the usual festival, as provided in the law (De 12:18; 16:11), of which the pious or humble, and they that seek the Lord (His true worshippers) shall partake abundantly, and join him in praise [Ps 22:26]. In the enthusiasm produced by his lively feelings, he addresses such in words, assuring them of God's perpetual favor [Ps 22:26].

In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a>, with &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; the looks of the sufferer, in the face of his manifold torments, concentrate themselves all at once upon Jahve. He calls Him &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; nom. abstr. from &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/88-5.htm">Psalm 88:5</a> : the very essence of strength, as it were the idea, or the ideal of strength; le&#775;&#8219;ezra&#772;thi has the accent on the penult., as in <a href="/psalms/71-12.htm">Psalm 71:12</a> (cf. on the other hand <a href="/psalms/38-23.htm">Psalm 38:23</a>), in order that two tone syllables may not come together. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>, &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; means the deadly weapon of the enemy and is used exemplificatively. In the expression &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;, &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491; is not merely equivalent to &#1502;&#1503;, but &#1497;&#1491; is, according to the sense, equivalent to "paw" (cf. &#1499;&#1468;&#1507;, <a href="/leviticus/11-27.htm">Leviticus 11:27</a>), as &#1508;&#1468;&#1497; is equivalent to jaws; although elsewhere not only the expression "hand of the lion and of the bear," <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>, but also "hands of the sword," <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>, and even "hand of the flame," <a href="/isaiah/47-14.htm">Isaiah 47:14</a> are used, inasmuch as &#1497;&#1491; is the general designation of that which acts, seizes, and subjugates, as the instrument of the act. Just as in connection with the dog &#1497;&#1491;, and in connection with the lion &#1508;&#1497; (cf. however, <a href="/daniel/6-28.htm">Daniel 6:28</a>) is mentioned as its weapon of attack, the horns, not the horn (also not in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>), are mentioned in connection with antilopes, &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (a shorter form, occurring only in this passage, for &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/psalms/29-6.htm">Psalm 29:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>). Nevertheless, Luther following the lxx and Vulgate, renders it "rescue me from the unicorns" (vid., thereon on <a href="/psalms/29-6.htm">Psalm 29:6</a>). &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;, as the parallel member here and in <a href="/psalms/35-17.htm">Psalm 35:17</a> shows, is an epithet of &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;. The lxx in both instances renders it correctly &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, Vulg. unicam meam, according to <a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>, the one soul besides which man has no second, the one life besides which man has no second to lose, applied subjectively, that is, soul or life as the dearest and most precious thing, cf. Homer's fi'lon kee'r. It is also interpreted according to <a href="/psalms/25-16.htm">Psalm 25:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a> : my solitary one, solitarium, the soul as forsaken by God and man, or at least by man, and abandoned to its own self (Hupfeld, Kamphausen, and others). But the parallel &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, and the analogy of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; ( equals  &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;), stamp it as an universal name for the soul: the single one, i.e., that which does not exist in duplicate, and consequently that which cannot be replaced, when lost. The praet. &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497; might be equivalent to &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, provided it is a perf. consec. deprived of its Waw convers. in favour of the placing of &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; first for the sake of emphasis; but considering the turn which the Psalm takes in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-23.htm">Psalm 22:23</a>, it must be regarded as perf. confidentiae, inasmuch as in the very midst of his supplication there springs up in the mind of the suppliant the assurance of being heard and answered. To answer from the horns of the antilope is equivalent to hearing and rescuing from them; cf. the equally pregnant expression &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, perhaps also <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>.<p>(Note: Thrupp in his Emendations on the Psalms (Journal of Classic and Sacred Philology, 1860) suggests &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, my poverty (my poor soul), instead of &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;.) </body></html>
