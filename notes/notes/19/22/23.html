The first words of the complaint were used by Christ himself upon the cross; the first words of the triumph are expressly applied to him, Heb 2:12. All our praises must refer to the work of redemption. The suffering of the Redeemer was graciously accepted as a full satisfaction for sin. Though it was offered for sinful men, the Father did not despise or abhor it for our sakes. This ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. All humble, gracious souls should have a full satisfaction and happiness in him. Those that hunger and thirst after righteousness in Christ, shall not labour for that which satisfies not. Those that are much in praying, will be much in thanksgiving. Those that turn to God, will make conscience of worshipping before him. Let every tongue confess that he is Lord. High and low, rich and poor, bond and free, meet in Christ. Seeing we cannot keep alive our own souls, it is our wisdom, by obedient faith, to commit our souls to Christ, who is able to save and keep them alive for ever. A seed shall serve him. God will have a church in the world to the end of time. They shall be accounted to him for a generation; he will be the same to them that he was to those who went before them. His righteousness, and not any of their own, they shall declare to be the foundation of all their hopes, and the fountain of all their joys. Redemption by Christ is the Lord's own doing. Here we see the free love and compassion of God the Father, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, for us wretched sinners, as the source of all grace and consolation; the example we are to follow, the treatment as Christians we are to expect, and the conduct under it we are to adopt. Every lesson may here be learned that can profit the humbled soul. Let those who go about to establish their own righteousness inquire, why the beloved Son of God should thus suffer, if their own doings could atone for sin? Let the ungodly professor consider whether the Saviour thus honoured the Divine law, to purchase him the privilege of despising it. Let the careless take warning to flee from the wrath to come, and the trembling rest their hopes upon this merciful Redeemer. Let the tempted and distressed believer cheerfully expect a happy end of every trial.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye that fear the Lord - A phrase denoting those who are pious.<p>Praise him - This is language which may be supposed to be addressed by the speaker in the great congregation.

In the animal name &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, figuratively descriptive of character, beside shamelessness and meanness, special prominence is given to the propensity for biting and worrying, i.e., for persecuting; hence Symmachus and Theodotion render it &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;.

(to do anything in a circle, to surround by forming a circle round, a climactic synonym, like &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512; to &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;) either per attractionem (cf. <a href="/psalms/140-10.htm">Psalm 140:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4</a>), or on account of the collective &#1506;&#1491;&#1492;. Tertullian renders it synagoga maleficorum, Jerome concilium pessimorum. But a faction gathered together for some evil purpose is also called &#1506;&#1491;&#1492;, e.g., &#1506;&#1491;&#1514; &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;. In <a href="/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a> the meaning of &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;, instar leonis, is either that, selecting a point of attack, they make the rounds of his hands and feet, just as a lion does its prey upon which it springs as soon as its prey stirs; or, that, standing round about him like lions, they make all defence impossible to his hands, and all escape impossible to his feet. But whether we take this &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1493;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; as accusative of the members beside the accusative of the person (vid., <a href="/psalms/17-11.htm">Psalm 17:11</a>), or as the object of the &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; to be supplied from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>, it still remains harsh and drawling so far as the language is concerned. Perceiving this, the Masora on <a href="/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a> observes, that &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;, in the two passages in which it occurs (<a href="/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>), occurs in two different meanings (&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;); just as the Midrash then also understands &#1499;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; in the Psalm as a verb used of marking with conjuring, magic characters.<p>(Note: Hupfeld suspects this Masoretic remark (&#1511;&#1502;&#1510;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; &#1489;) as a Christian interpolation, but it occurs in the alphabetical Masoreth register &#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503; &#1489;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489; &#1489;. Even Elias Levita speaks of it with astonishment (in his &#1502;&#1505;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1512;&#1514; [ed. Ginsburg, p. 253]) without doubting its genuineness, which must therefore have been confirmed, to his mind, by MS authority. Heidenheim also cites it in his edition of the Pentateuch, `ynym m'wr, on <a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>; and down to the present time no suspicion has been expressed on the part of Jewish critics, although all kinds of unsatisfactory attempts have been made to explain this Masoretic remark (e.g., in the periodical Biccure ha-'Ittim).)<p>Is the meaning of the Masora that &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;, in the passage before us, is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;? If so the form would be doubly Aramaic: both the participial form &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; (which only occurs in Hebrew in verbs med. E) and the apocopated plural, the occurrence of which in Hebrew is certainly, with Gesenius and Ewald, to be acknowledged in rare instances (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>, and compare on the other hand <a href="/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44</a>), but which would here be a capricious form of expression most liable to be misapprehended. If &#1499;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; is to be understood as a verb, then it ought to be read &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;. Tradition is here manifestly unreliable. Even in MSS the readings &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; are found. The former is attested both by the Masora on <a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a> and by Jacob ben Chajim in the Masora finalis as the MS Chethb.<p>(Note: The authenticity of this statement of the Masora &#1499;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1493;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; &#1499;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493; &#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489; may be disputed, especially since Jacob ben Chajim became a convert to Christianity, and other Masoretic testimonies do not mention a &#1511;&#1512;&#1497; &#1493;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489; to &#1499;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;; nevertheless, in this instance, it would be premature to say that this statement is interpolated. Ant. Hulsius in his edition of the Psalter (1650) has written &#1499;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493; in the margin according to the text of the Complutensis.)<p>Even the Targum, which renders mordent sicut leo manus et pedes meos, bears witness to the ancient hesitancy between the substantival and verbal rendering of the &#1499;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;. The other ancient versions have, without any doubt, read &#1499;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;. Aquila in the 1st edition of his translation rendered it &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#837;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; (from the Aramaic and Talmudic &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; to soil, part. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, dirty, nasty); but this is not applicable to hands and feet, and therefore has nothing to stand upon. In the 2nd edition of his translation the same Aquila had instead of this, like Symmachus, "they have bound," <p>(Note: Also in Jerome's independent translation the reading vinxerunt is found by the side of fixerunt, just as Abraham of Zante paraphrases it in his paraphrase of the Psalter in rhyme &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1493;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; &#1488;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;. The want of a verb is too perceptible. Saadia supplies it in a different way "they compass me as a lion, to crush my hands and feet.")<p>after &#1499;&#1512;, Arab. krr, to twist, lace; but this rendering is improbable since the Hebrew has other words for "to bind," constringere. On the other hand nothing of any weight can be urged against the rendering of the lxx &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; (Peshto &#1489;&#1494;&#1506;&#1493;, Vulg. foderunt, Jer. fixerunt); for (1) even if we do not suppose any special verb &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; ,&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; can be expanded from &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;)  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;) just in the same manner as &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a> from &#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, cf. &#1511;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; <a href="/daniel/7-16.htm">Daniel 7:16</a>. And (2) that &#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; can signify not merely to dig out and dig into, engrave, but also to dig through, pierce, is shown, - apart from the derivative &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1492; (the similarity of the sound of which to &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; from the root &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;, maksh, mraksh, is only accidental), - by the double meaning of the verbs &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (e.g., &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; Herod. i. 174), fodere (hast); the lxx version of <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a> would also support this meaning, if &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; (from &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;) in that passage had been the original reading instead of &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;. If &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; be read, then <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>, applied to David, perhaps under the influence of the figure of the attacking dogs (Bhl), says that the wicked bored into his hands and feet, and thus have made him fast, so that he is inevitably abandoned to their inhuman desires. The fulfilment in the nailing of the hands and (at least, the binding fast) of the feet of the Crucified One to the cross is clear. This is not the only passage in which it is predicated that the future Christ shall be murderously pierced; but it is the same in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a> where He is said to be pierced (&#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1500;) on account of our sins, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, where Jahve describes Himself as &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; in Him.<p>Thus, therefore, the reading &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; might at least have an equal right to be recognised with the present recepta, for which Hupfeld and Hitzig demand exclusive recognition; while Bttcher, - who reads &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;, and gives this the meaning"springing round about (after the manner of dogs), - regards the sicut leo as "a production of meagre Jewish wit;" and also Thenius after taking all possible pains to clear it up gives it up as hopeless, and with Meier, adopting a different division of the verse, renders it: "a mob of the wicked has encompassed me like lions. On my hands and feet I can count all my bones." But then, how &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; comes limping on after the rest! And how lamely does &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1493;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; precede <a href="/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a>! How unnaturally does it limit &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, with which one chiefly associates the thought of the breast and ribs, to the hands and feet! &#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; is potientialis. Above in <a href="/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a> he has said that his bones are out of joint.  There is no more reason for regarding this "I can count etc." as referring to emaciation from grief, than there is for regarding the former as referring to writing with agony. He can count them because he is forcibly stretched out, and thereby all his bones stand out. In this condition he is a mockery to his foes. &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; signifies the turning of one's gaze to anything, &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468; the fixing of one's sight upon it with pleasure. In <a href="/psalms/22-19.htm">Psalm 22:19</a> a new feature is added to those that extend far beyond David himself: they part my garments among them.... It does not say they purpose doing it, they do it merely in their mind, but they do it in reality. This never happened to David, or at least not in the literal sense of his words, in which it has happened to Christ. In Him <a href="/psalms/22-19.htm">Psalm 22:19</a> and <a href="/psalms/22-19.htm">Psalm 22:19</a> are literally fulfilled. The parting of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; by the soldiers dividing his &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; among them into four parts; the casting lots upon the &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; by their not dividing the &#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, but casting lots for it, <a href="/john/19-23.htm">John 19:23</a>. &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; is the garment which is put on the body that it may not be bare; &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; the clothes, which one wraps around one's self for a covering; hence &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; is punningly explained in B. Sabbath 77b by &#1500;&#1488; &#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (with which one has no need to be ashamed of being naked) in distinction from &#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1488;, a mantle (that through which one appears &#1499;&#1490;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, because it conceals the outline of the body). In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-7.htm">Job 24:7</a>, and frequently, &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; is an undergarment, or shirt, what in Arabic is called absolutely Arab. t&#817;wb, tho&#770;b "the garment," or expressed according to the Roman distinction: the tunica in distinction from the toga, whose exact designation is &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500;. With <a href="/psalms/22-19.htm">Psalm 22:19</a> of this Psalm it is exactly as with <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, cf. <a href="/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>; in this instance also, the fulfilment has realised that which, in both phases of the synonymous expression, is seemingly identical.<p>(Note: On such fulfilments of prophecy, literal beyond all expectation, vid., Saat auf Hoffnung iii., 3, 47-51.) </body></html>
