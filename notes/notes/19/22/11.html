by which we are directed to look for crosses, and to look up to God under them. The very manner of Christ's death is described, though not in use among the Jews. They pierced his hands and his feet, which were nailed to the accursed tree, and his whole body was left so to hang as to suffer the most severe pain and torture. His natural force failed, being wasted by the fire of Divine wrath preying upon his spirits. Who then can stand before God's anger? or who knows the power of it? The life of the sinner was forfeited, and the life of the Sacrifice must be the ransom for it. Our Lord Jesus was stripped, when he was crucified, that he might clothe us with the robe of his righteousness. Thus it was written, therefore thus it behoved Christ to suffer. Let all this confirm our faith in him as the true Messiah, and excite our love to him as the best of friends, who loved us, and suffered all this for us. Christ in his agony prayed, prayed earnestly, prayed that the cup might pass from him. When we cannot rejoice in God as our song, yet let us stay ourselves upon him as our strength; and take the comfort of spiritual supports, when we cannot have spiritual delights. He prays to be delivered from the Divine wrath. He that has delivered, doth deliver, and will do so. We should think upon the sufferings and resurrection of Christ, till we feel in our souls the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be not far from me - Do not withdraw from me; do not leave or forsake me.<p>For trouble is near - Near, in the sense that deep sorrow has come upon me; near, in the sense that I am approaching a dreadful death.<p>For there is none to help - Margin, as in Hebrew, "not a helper." There were those who would have helped, but they could not; there were those who could have helped, but they would not.

We need much grace that while reading we may have fellowship with his sufferings. May the blessed Spirit conduct us into a most clear and affecting sight of our Redeemer's woes.<p><a href="/psalms/22-11.htm">Psalm 22:11</a><p>"Be not far from me." This is the petition for which he has been using such varied and powerful pleas. His great woe was that God had forsaken him, his great prayer is that he would be near him. A lively sense of the divine presence is a mighty stay to the heart in times of distress. "For trouble is near; for there is none to help." There are two "fors," as though faith gave a double knock at mercy's gate; that is a powerful prayer which is full of holy reasons and thoughtful arguments. The nearness of trouble is a weighty motive for divine help; this moves our heavenly Father's heart, and brings down his helping hand. It is his glory to be our very present help in trouble. Our Substitute had trouble in his inmost heart, for he said, "the waters have come in, even unto my soul;" well might he cry, "be not far from me." The absence of all other helpers is another telling plea. In our Lord's case none either could or would help him, it was needful that he should tread the winepress alone; yet was it a sore aggravation to find that all his disciples had forsaken him, and lover and friend were put far from him. There is an awfulness about absolute friendlessness which is crushing to the human mind, for man was not made to be alone, and is like a dismembered limb when he has to endure heart-loneliness.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Be not far from me, </span> to wit, as to affection and succour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Trouble is near</span> <span class="ital">at hand</span>, and ready to swallow me up; and therefore if thou dost not speedily deliver me, it will be too late; which is an argument that David oft useth, as <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/6-5.htm" title="For in death there is no remembrance of you: in the grave who shall give you thanks?">Psalm 6:5</a> 88:11</span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">There is none to help; </span> thy help therefore will be the more seasonable, because it is most hecessary, and thou wilt have the more of glory by it, because it will appear that it is thy work alone. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Be not far from me,.... Who had been so near unto him, as to take him out of the womb, and to take the care of him ever since; this is to be understood not with respect to the omnipresence of God, who is everywhere, and is not far from any of us; but of his presence, which was now withdrawn from Christ, and he was filled with a sense of divine wrath, and with sorrow and distress; and also of his powerful and assisting presence which he had promised, and Christ expected, and believed he should have, as he had: the reasons for it follow: <p>for trouble is near; Satan was marching towards him with his principalities and powers, to attack him in the garden and on the cross; Judas, one of his own disciples, was at hand to betray him; a multitude with swords and staves were about to seize him; the sins and chastisement of his people were just going to be laid upon him; the sword of justice was awaked against him, ready to give the blow; the hour of death was near, he was brought to the dust of it, as in <a href="/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a>. A second reason is given, <p>for there is none to help; none among his disciples: one of them was to betray him, another to deny him, and all to forsake him and flee from him, as they did; nor any among the angels in heaven; for though they ministered to him in the wilderness, and strengthened him in the garden, there were none near him on the cross, that it might be manifest that salvation was wrought out alone by him, <a href="/isaiah/63-5.htm">Isaiah 63:5</a>; and, indeed, if any of these had been willing to have helped him, it was not in their power to do it, none but God could; and therefore he applies to him, who had promised and was as good as his word, <a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Be not far from me</span>] The expostulation of <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/22-1.htm" title="My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?">Psalm 22:1</a></span> is turned into a prayer, again repeated in <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/22-19.htm" title="But be not you far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste you to help me.">Psalm 22:19</a></span>.

The considerations dwelt upon in vers. 3-5, and again in veto. 9, 10, have removed the sense of desertion expressed in vex. 1; and the Sufferer can now confidently call on God to help him.

He had  always had friends and followers. Under Saul's persecution he had a friend in Jonathan; he was supported by his father and his brethren (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>); in a short time he found himself at the head of four hundred (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>), and then of six hundred men (<a href="/1_samuel/25-13.htm">1 Samuel 25:13</a>). In Absalom's rebellion there remained faithful to him the priestly tribe (<a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24</a>) and the Gibborim (<a href="/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>), and others to the number of some thousands (<a href="/2_samuel/18-4.htm">2 Samuel 18:4</a>). But he whom David prefigured, his Antitype, was desexed, was alone - "All the disciples forsook him and fled" (<a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>) - he was truly one that "had no helper." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 22:4-6) The sufferer reminds Jahve of the contradiction between the long season of helplessness and His readiness to help so frequently and so promptly attested. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; opens an adverbial clause of the counterargument: although Thou art...Jahve is &#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, absolutely pure, lit., separated (root &#1511;&#1491;, Arab. qd, to cut, part, just as t&#803;ahur, the synonym of k&#803;adusa, as the intransitive of t&#803;ahara  equals  ab&#8219;ada, to remove to a distance, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; pure, clean, radically distinct from p-rus, goes back to &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512; to sever), viz., from that which is worldly and common, in one word: holy. Jahve is holy, and has shown Himself such as the &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; of Israel solemnly affirm, upon which or among which He sits enthroned. &#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; are the songs of praise offered to God on account of His attributes and deeds, which are worthy of praise (these are even called &#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>), and in fact presented in His sanctuary (<a href="/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10</a>). The combination &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (with the accusative of the verbs of dwelling and tarrying) is like &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>. The songs of praise, which resounded in Israel as the memorials of His deeds of deliverance, are like the wings of the cherubim, upon which His presence hovered in Israel. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-5.htm">Psalm 22:5</a>, the praying one brings to remembrance this graciously glorious self-attestation of God, who as the Holy One always, from the earliest times, acknowledged those who fear Him in opposition to their persecutors and justified their confidence in Himself. In <a href="/psalms/22-5.htm">Psalm 22:5</a> trust and rescue are put in the connection of cause and effect; in <a href="/psalms/22-6.htm">Psalm 22:6</a> in reciprocal relation. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496; and &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496; are only distinguished by the harder and softer sibilants, cf. <a href="/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a> with <a href="/psalms/116-4.htm">Psalm 116:4</a>. It need not seem strange that such thoughts were at work in the soul of the Crucified One, since His divine-human consciousness was, on its human side, thoroughly Israelitish; and the God of Israel is also the God of salvation; redemption is that which He himself determined, why, then, should He not speedily deliver the Redeemer?  </body></html>
