The very manner of Christ's death is described, though not in use among the Jews. They pierced his hands and his feet, which were nailed to the accursed tree, and his whole body was left so to hang as to suffer the most severe pain and torture. His natural force failed, being wasted by the fire of Divine wrath preying upon his spirits. Who then can stand before God's anger? or who knows the power of it? The life of the sinner was forfeited, and the life of the Sacrifice must be the ransom for it. Our Lord Jesus was stripped, when he was crucified, that he might clothe us with the robe of his righteousness. Thus it was written, therefore thus it behoved Christ to suffer. Let all this confirm our faith in him as the true Messiah, and excite our love to him as the best of friends, who loved us, and suffered all this for us. Christ in his agony prayed, prayed earnestly, prayed that the cup might pass from him. When we cannot rejoice in God as our song, yet let us stay ourselves upon him as our strength; and take the comfort of spiritual supports, when we cannot have spiritual delights. He prays to be delivered from the Divine wrath. He that has delivered, doth deliver, and will do so. We should think upon the sufferings and resurrection of Christ, till we feel in our souls the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I may tell all my bones - That is, I may count them. They are so prominent, so bare, that I can see them and count their number. The idea here is that of emaciation from continued suffering or from some other cause. As applied to the Redeemer, it would denote the effect of long protracted suffering and anxiety on his frame, as rendering it crushed, weakened, emaciated. Compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2-3</a>. No one can prove that an effect such as is here referred to may not have been produced by the sufferings of the Redeemer.<p>They look and stare upon me - That is, either my bones - or, my enemies that stand around me. The most obvious construction would refer it to the former - to his bones - as if they stood out prominently and stared him in the face. Rosenmuller understands it in the latter sense, as meaning that his enemies gazed with wonder on such an object. Perhaps this, on the whole, furnishes the best interpretation, as there is something unnatural in speaking of a man's own bones staring or gazing upon him, and as the image of his enemies standing and looking with wonder on one so wretched, so crushed, so broken, is a very striking one. This, too, will better agree with the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14</a>, "Many were astonished at thee;" and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2-3</a>, "He hath no form nor comeliness, and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him;" "we hid, as it were, our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not." It accords also better with the statement in the following verse; "they," that is, the same persons referred to, "part my garments amoung them." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. His emaciated frame, itself an item of his misery, is rendered more so as the object of delighted contemplation to his enemies. The verbs, "look" and "stare," often occur as suggestive of feelings of satisfaction (compare Ps 27:13; 54:7; 118:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I may tell all my bones; </span> partly through my leanness, caused by excessive grief, which is much more credible of Christ than of David; and partly by my being stretched out upon the cross. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They look and stare upon me, </span> to wit, with delight and complacency in my calamities, as this phrase is used, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/35-21.htm" title="Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye has seen it.">Psalm 35:21</a> 37:34 54:7 59:10 <a href="/obadiah/1-12.htm" title="But you should not have looked on the day of your brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither should you have spoken proudly in the day of distress.">Obadiah 1:12</a></span>.

For what with the stretching out of his body on the cross, when it was fastened to it as it lay on the ground, and with the jolt of the cross when, being reared up, it was fixed in the ground, and with the weight of the body hanging upon it, all his bones were disjointed and started out; so that, could he have seen them, he might have told them, as they might be told by the spectators who were around him; and so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions render it, "they have numbered all my bones"; that is, they might have done if: the Targum is, "I will number all the scars of my members", made by the blows, scourges, and wounds he received; <p>they look and stare upon me; meaning not his bones, but his enemies; which may be understood either by way of contempt, as many Jewish interpreters explain it: so the Scribes and elders of the people, and the people themselves, looked and stared at him on the cross, and mocked at him, and insulted him; or by way of rejoicing, saying, "Aha, aha, our eye hath seen", namely, what they desired and wished for, <a href="/psalms/35-21.htm">Psalm 35:21</a>; a sight as was enough to have moved an heart of stone made no impression on them; they had no sympathy with him, no compassion on him, but rejoiced at his misery: this staring agrees with their character as dogs. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">I may tell</span>] i.e. I can count.

With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; he establishes the reality of the loving relationship in which he stands to God, at which his foes mock. The intermediate thought, which is not expressed, "and so it really is," is confirmed; and thus &#1499;&#1497; comes to have an affirmative signification. The verb &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;) signifies both intransitive: to break forth (from the womb), <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8</a>, and transitive: to push forward (cf. Arab. jchcha), more especially, the fruit of the womb, <a href="/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>. It might be taken here in the first signification: my breaking forth, equivalent to "the cause of my breaking forth" (Hengstenberg, Baur, and others); but there is no need for this metonymy. &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; is either part. equivalent to &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;, my pusher forth, i.e., he who causes me to break forth, or, - since &#1490;&#1493;&#1495; in a causative signification cannot be supported, and participles like &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505; stamping and &#1500;&#1493;&#1496; veiling (Ges. 72, rem. 1) are nowhere found with a suffix, - participle of a verb &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;&#1468;, to draw forth (Hitz.), which perhaps only takes the place, per metaplasmum, of the Pil. &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1495; with the uneuphonic &#1502;&#1490;&#1495;&#1495;&#1497; (Ewald S. 859, Addenda). <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71.htm">Psalm 71</a> has &#1490;&#1493;&#1494;&#1497; (<a href="/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>) instead of &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;, just as it has &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1497; (<a href="/psalms/71-5.htm">Psalm 71:5</a>) instead of &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;. The Hiph. &#1492;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1495; does not merely mean to make secure (Hupf.), but to cause to trust. According to biblical conception, there is even in the new-born child, yea in the child yet unborn and only living in the womb, a glimmering consciousness springing up out of the remotest depths of unconsciousness (Psychol. S. 215; transl. p. 254). Therefore, when the praying one says, that from the womb he has been cast<p>(Note: The Hoph. has o, not u, perhaps in a more neuter sense, more closely approximating the reflexive (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19</a> with <a href="/ezekiel/32-32.htm">Ezekiel 32:32</a>), rather than a purely passive. Such is apparently the feeling of the language, vid., B. Megilla 13a (and also the explanation in Tosefoth).)<p>upon Jahve, i.e., directed to go to Him, and to Him alone, with all his wants and care (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>), that from the womb onwards Jahve was his God, there is also more in it than the purely objective idea, that he grew up into such a relationship to God. Twice he mentions his mother. Throughout the Old Testament there is never any mention made of a human father, or begetter, to the Messiah, but always only of His mother, or her who bare Him. And the words of the praying one here also imply that the beginning of his life, as regards its outward circumstances, was amidst poverty, which likewise accords with the picture of Christ as drawn both in the Old and New Testaments. On the ground of his fellowship with God, which extends so far back, goes forth the cry for help (<a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>), which has been faintly heard through all the preceding verses, but now only comes to direct utterance for the first time. The two &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; are alike. That the necessity is near at hand, i.e., urgent, refers back antithetically to the prayer, that God would not remain afar off; no one doth, nor can help except He alone. Here the first section closes. </body></html>
