We have a sorrowful complaint of God's withdrawings. This may be applied to any child of God, pressed down, overwhelmed with grief and terror. Spiritual desertions are the saints' sorest afflictions; but even their complaint of these burdens is a sign of spiritual life, and spiritual senses exercised. To cry our, My God, why am I sick? why am I poor? savours of discontent and worldliness. But, Why hast thou forsaken me? is the language of a heart binding up its happiness in God's favour. This must be applied to Christ. In the first words of this complaint, he poured out his soul before God when he was upon the cross, Mt 27:46. Being truly man, Christ felt a natural unwillingness to pass through such great sorrows, yet his zeal and love prevailed. Christ declared the holiness of God, his heavenly Father, in his sharpest sufferings; nay, declared them to be a proof of it, for which he would be continually praised by his Israel, more than for all other deliverances they received. Never any that hoped in thee, were made ashamed of their hope; never any that sought thee, sought thee in vain. Here is a complaint of the contempt and reproach of men. The Saviour here spoke of the abject state to which he was reduced. The history of Christ's sufferings, and of his birth, explains this prophecy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him - Margin, "He rolled himself on the Lord." The margin expresses the true sense of the Hebrew word. The idea is that of being under the pressure of a heavy burden, and of rolling it off, or casting it on another. Hence, the word is often used in the sense of committing to another; entrusting anything to another; confiding in another. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>, "commit thy way unto the Lord;" Margin, as in Hebrew: "Roll thy way upon the Lord." <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>, "commit thy works unto the Lord," Margin, as in Hebrew: "Roll." The language here is the taunting language of his enemies, and the meaning is that he had professed to commit himself to the Lord as if he were his friend; he had expressed confidence in God, and he believed that his cause was sate in His hand. This, too, was actually fulfilled in the ease of the Saviour. <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/27-43.htm">Matthew 27:43</a>, "he trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him." It is one of the most remarkable instances of blindness and infatuation that has ever occurred in the world, that the Jews should have used this language in taunting the dying Redeemer, without even suspecting that they were fulfilling the prophecies, and demonstrating at the very time when they were reviling him that he was the true Messiah.<p>Let him deliver him - Let him come and save him. Since he professes to belong to God; since he claims that God loves him and regards him as his friend, let him come now and rescue one so dear to him. He is hopelessly abandoned by men. If God chooses to have one so abject, so despised, so forsaken, so helpless, let him come now and take him as his own. We will not rescue him; we will do nothing to save him, for we do not need him. If God wants him, let him come and save him. What blasphemy! What an exhibition of the dreadful depravity of the human heart was manifested in the crucifixion of the Redeemer!<p>Seeing he delighted in him - Margin, "if he delight in him." The correct rendering is," for he delighted in him." That is, it was claimed by the sufferer that God delighted in him. If this is so, say they, let him come and rescue one so dear to himself. Let him show his friendship for this vagrant, this impostor, this despised and worthless man <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. trusted on the Lord&#8212;literally, "rolled"&#8212;that is, his burden (Ps 37:5; Pr 16:3) on the Lord.

St. Matthew has put it on record that this text was actually cited by the scribes and elders who witnessed the Crucifixion, and applied to our Lord in scorn (<a href="/matthew/27-43.htm">Matthew 27:43</a>). They quoted apparently from the Septuagint, but with an inaccuracy common at the time, when books were scarce, and persons had to depend on their memory of what they had occasionally heard read. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 22:2-3) In the first division, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a>, the disconsolate cry of anguish, beginning here in <a href="/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a> with the lamentation over prolonged desertion by God, struggles through to an incipient, trustfully inclined prayer. The question beginning with &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (instead of &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; before the guttural, and perhaps to make the exclamation more piercing, vid., on <a href="/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>) is not an expression of impatience and despair, but of alienation and yearning. The sufferer feels himself rejected of God; the feeling of divine wrath has completely enshrouded him; and still he knows himself to be joined to God in fear and love; his present condition belies the real nature of his relationship to God; and it is just this contradiction that urges him to the plaintive question, which comes up from the lowest depths: Why hast Thou forsaken me? But in spite of this feeling of desertion by God, the bond of love is not torn asunder; the sufferer calls God &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; (my God), and urged on by the longing desire that God again would grant him to feel this love, he calls Him, &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;. That complaining question: why hast Thou forsaken me? is not without example even elsewhere in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/88-15.htm">Psalm 88:15</a>, cf. <a href="/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14</a>. The forsakenness of the Crucified One, however, is unique; and may not be judged by the standard of David or of any other sufferers who thus complain when passing through trial. That which is common to all is here, as there, this, viz., that behind the wrath that is felt, is hidden the love of God, which faith holds fast; and that he who thus complains even on account of it, is, considered in itself, not a subject of wrath, because in the midst of the feeling of wrath he keeps up his communion with God. The Crucified One is to His latest breath the Holy One of God; and the reconciliation for which He now offers himself is God's own eternal purpose of mercy, which is now being realised in the fulness of times. But inasmuch as He places himself under the judgment of God with the sin of His people and of the whole human race, He cannot be spared from experiencing God's wrath against sinful humanity as though He were himself guilty. And out of the infinite depth of this experience of wrath, which in His case rests on no mere appearance, but the sternest reality, <p>(Note: Eusebius observes on <a href="/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a> of this Psalm, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c9;&#787;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, and: &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;, &#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#837; &#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;.)<p>comes the cry of His complaint which penetrates the wrath and reaches to God's love, &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;, which the evangelists, omitting the additional &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;<p>(Note: Vid., Jerome's Ep. ad Pammachium de optimo genere interpretandi, where he cries out to his critics, sticklers for tradition, Reddant rationem, cur septuaginta translatores interposuerunt "respice in me!")<p>of the lxx, render: &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3b5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;.

He says it in Aramaic, not in order that all may understand it-for such a consideration was far from His mind at such a time-but because the Aramaic was His mother tongue, for the same reason that He called God &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488; doG dellac in prayer. His desertion by God, as <a href="/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a> says, consists in God's help and His cry for help being far asunder. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1490;&#1492;, prop. of the roar of the lion (Aq. &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;), is the loud cry extorted by the greatest agony, <a href="/psalms/38-9.htm">Psalm 38:9</a>; in this instance, however, as &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; shows, it is not an inarticulate cry, but a cry bearing aloft to God the words of prayer. &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; is not to be taken as an apposition of the subject of &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;: far from my help, (from) the words of my crying (Riehm); for &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1490;&#1514;&#1497; would then also, on its part, in connection with the non-repetition of the &#1502;&#1503;, be in apposition to &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;. But to this it is not adapted on account of its heterogeneousness; hence Hitzig seeks to get over the difficulty by the conjecture &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497; ("from my cry, from the words of my groaning"). Nor can it be explained, with Olshausen and Hupfeld, by adopting Aben-Ezra's interpretation, "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me, far from my help? are the words of my crying." This violates the structure of the verse, the rhythm, and the custom of the language, and gives to the Psalm a flat and unlyrical commencement. Thus, therefore, &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; in the primary form, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-155.htm">Psalm 119:155</a>, according to Ges. 146, 4, will by the predicate to &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; and placed before it: far from my salvation, i.e., far from my being rescued, are the words of my cry; there is a great gulf between the two, inasmuch as God does not answer him though he cries unceasingly.<p>In <a href="/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a> the reverential name of God &#1488;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497; takes the place of &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; the name that expresses His might; it is likewise vocative and accordingly marked with Rebia magnum. It is not an accusative of the object after <a href="/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a> (Hitzig), in which case the construction would be continued with &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;. That it is, however, God to whom he calls is implied both by the direct address &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, and by &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, since he from whom one expects an answer is most manifestly the person addressed. His uninterrupted crying remains unanswered, and unappeased. The clause &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; is parallel to &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, and therefore does not mean: without allowing me any repose (<a href="/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-49.htm">Lamentations 3:49</a>), but: without any rest being granted to me, without my complaint being appeased or stilled. From the sixth to the ninth hour the earth was shrouded in darkness. About the ninth hour Jesus cried, after a long and more silent struggle, &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;, &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;. The &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#837;, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>, and also the &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769; of Hebr. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>, which does not refer exclusively to the scene in Gethsemane, calls to mind the &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1490;&#1514;&#1497; of <a href="/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a>. When His passion reached its climax, days and nights of the like wrestling had preceded it, and what then becomes audible was only an outburst of the second David's conflict of prayer, which grows hotter as it draws near to the final issue. </body></html>
