but, alas, few attempt to worship him in the beauty of holiness. When we come before him as the Redeemer of sinners, in repentance faith, and love, he will accept our defective services, pardon the sin that cleaves to them, and approve of that measure of holiness which the Holy Spirit enables us to exercise. We have here the nature of religious worship; it is giving to the Lord the glory due to his name. We must be holy in all our religious services, devoted to God, and to his will and glory. There is a beauty in holiness, and that puts beauty upon all acts of worship. The psalmist here sets forth God's dominion in the kingdom of nature. In the thunder, and lightning, and storm, we may see and hear his glory. Let our hearts be thereby filled with great, and high, and honourable thoughts of God, in the holy adoring of whom, the power of godliness so much consists. O Lord our God, thou art very great! The power of the lightning equals the terror of the thunder. The fear caused by these effects of the Divine power, should remind us of the mighty power of God, of man's weakness, and of the defenceless and desperate condition of the wicked in the day of judgment. But the effects of the Divine word upon the souls of men, under the power of the Holy Spirit, are far greater than those of thunder storms in the nature world. Thereby the stoutest are made to tremble, the proudest are cast down, the secrets of the heart are brought to light, sinners are converted, the savage, sensual, and unclean, become harmless, gentle, and pure. If we have heard God's voice, and have fled for refuge to the hope set before us, let us remember that children need not fear their Father's voice, when he speaks in anger to his enemies. While those tremble who are without shelter, let those who abide in his appointed refuge bless him for their security, looking forward to the day of judgment without dismay, safe as Noah in the ark.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The voice of the Lord is powerful - Margin, as in Hebrew: "in power."

If the poet wrote the Psalm at one sitting then at this point the certainty of being answered dawns upon him. But it is even possible that he added this second part later on, as a memorial of the answer he experienced to his prayer (Hitzig, Ewald). It sounds, at all events, like the record of something that has actually taken place. Jahve is his defence and shield. The conjoined perfects in <a href="/psalms/28-7.htm">Psalm 28:7</a> denote that which is closely united in actual realisation; and in the fut. consec., as is frequently the case, e.g., in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>, the historical signification retreats into the background before the more essential idea of that which has been produced. In &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;, the song is conceived as the spring whence the &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; bubble forth; and instead of &#1488;&#1493;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; we have the more impressive form &#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="/psalms/45-18.htm">Psalm 45:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/116-6.htm">Psalm 116:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>, the syncope being omitted. From suffering (Leid) springs song (Lied), and from song springs the praise (Lob) of Him, who has "turned" the suffering, just as it is attuned in <a href="/psalms/28-6.htm">Psalm 28:6</a> and <a href="/psalms/28-8.htm">Psalm 28:8</a>.<p>(Note: There is a play of words and an alliteration in this sentence which we cannot fully reproduce in the English. - Tr.)<p>The &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, who are intended by &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-8.htm">Psalm 28:8</a>, are those of Israel, as in <a href="/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-2.htm">Isaiah 33:2</a> (Hitzig). The lxx (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;) reads &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-11.htm">Psalm 29:11</a>, which is approved by B&#1510;ttcher, Olshausen and Hupfeld; but &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; yields a similar sense. First of all David thinks of the people, then of himself; for his private character retreats behind his official, by virtue of which he is the head of Israel. For this very reason his deliverance is the deliverance of Israel, to whom, so far as they have become unfaithful to His anointed, Jahve has not requited this faithlessness, and to whom, so far as they have remained true to him, He has rewarded this fidelity. Jahve is a &#1506;&#1494; a si evhaJ to them, inasmuch as He preserves them by His might from the destruction into which they would have precipitated themselves, or into which others would have precipitated them; and He is the &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; of His anointed inasmuch as He surrounds him as an inaccessible place of refuge which secures to him salvation in all its fulness instead of the destruction anticipated. Israel's salvation and blessing were at stake; but Israel is in fact God's people and God's inheritance - may He, then, work salvation for them in every future need and bless them. Apostatised from David, it was a flock in the hands of the hireling - may He ever take the place of shepherd to them and carry them in His arms through the destruction. The &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1501; coupled with &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1501; (thus it is to be pointed according to Ben-Asher) calls to mind <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>, "Jahve carried Israel as a man doth carry his son," and <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>, "as on eagles' wings." The Piel, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>, is used of carrying the weak, whom one lifts up and thus removes out of its helplessness and danger. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/3-1.htm">Psalm 3:1-8</a> closes just in the same way with an intercession; and the close of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1-11</a> is similar, but promissory, and consequently it is placed next to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1-9</a>. </body></html>
