The poet calls on the grand forces of nature themselves to offer praise to their Divine Master, for the glory which they have been commissioned to reveal. It is they who at the beginning and end alike of the psalm sing the praises of Him, who summoned them to speak to men in His name, and make His voice to be heard. The Prayer Book version, “bring young rams,” comes from the LXX. and Vulg. The reading probably arose from a marginal gloss.

Now, in this holy place, says the psalmist, worship Jehovah; here, and only here, will he accept your prayers, praises, and oblations. So he exhorts them to turn proselytes to the Jewish religion; which was their duty and interest. Or he speaks of the <span class="ital">manner </span>of worship. We must be holy in all our religious performances, that is, devoted to God, and to his will and glory. There is a beauty in holiness, and it is that which puts an acceptable beauty upon all the acts of worship.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:1-11 Exhortation to give glory to God. - The mighty and honourable of the earth are especially bound to honour and worship him; but, alas, few attempt to worship him in the beauty of holiness. When we come before him as the Redeemer of sinners, in repentance faith, and love, he will accept our defective services, pardon the sin that cleaves to them, and approve of that measure of holiness which the Holy Spirit enables us to exercise. We have here the nature of religious worship; it is giving to the Lord the glory due to his name. We must be holy in all our religious services, devoted to God, and to his will and glory. There is a beauty in holiness, and that puts beauty upon all acts of worship. The psalmist here sets forth God's dominion in the kingdom of nature. In the thunder, and lightning, and storm, we may see and hear his glory. Let our hearts be thereby filled with great, and high, and honourable thoughts of God, in the holy adoring of whom, the power of godliness so much consists. O Lord our God, thou art very great! The power of the lightning equals the terror of the thunder. The fear caused by these effects of the Divine power, should remind us of the mighty power of God, of man's weakness, and of the defenceless and desperate condition of the wicked in the day of judgment. But the effects of the Divine word upon the souls of men, under the power of the Holy Spirit, are far greater than those of thunder storms in the nature world. Thereby the stoutest are made to tremble, the proudest are cast down, the secrets of the heart are brought to light, sinners are converted, the savage, sensual, and unclean, become harmless, gentle, and pure. If we have heard God's voice, and have fled for refuge to the hope set before us, let us remember that children need not fear their Father's voice, when he speaks in anger to his enemies. While those tremble who are without shelter, let those who abide in his appointed refuge bless him for their security, looking forward to the day of judgment without dismay, safe as Noah in the ark.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give unto the Lord - Ascribe unto Yahweh; or, recognize Him as entitled to what is here ascribed to Him. The word cannot be understood, as it is commonly with us, to denote the imparting to another, or granting to another what he does not now possess - for God is always in possession of what is here ascribed to Him.<p>O ye mighty - Margin, as in Hebrew, "ye sons of the mighty." The Hebrew word used here - &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  'E&#770;liym - is the plural form of one of the names of God - &#1488;&#1500;  'E&#770;l. The word means properly "strong, mighty, a mighty one, a hero;" then, "strength, might, power;" and then it is applied to God as "the Mighty One," the Almighty. ("Gesenius.") In the plural form, the word means "mighty ones, heroes, gods:" <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-11.htm">Exodus 18:11</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>. The phrase "sons of the mighty" is used only here and in <a href="/psalms/89-6.htm">Psalm 89:6</a>. The allusion is undoubtedly to the angels as being in an eminent sense the sons of God, or of the mighty ones; and they are referred to here under that appellation as being themselves endowed with power or strength. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>, "Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength;" margin: "mighty in strength." In view of the wonderful exhibitions of God's power in the storm - exhibitions far above the power of the most exalted of His creatures, the psalmist calls upon the angels, the most exalted of them, to acknowledge the existence of a power so much beyond their own.<p>Glory and strength - Majesty and might. Acknowledge Him as the God of glory; as endowed with power. That is, learn from the manifestations of the power evinced in the storm how great is the power and the glory of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 29<p>Ps 29:1-11.

Neither men nor angels can confer anything upon Jehovah, but they should recognise his glory and might, and ascribe it to him in their songs and in their hearts. "Unto the Lord," and unto him alone, must honour be given. Natural causes, as men call them, are God in action, and we must not ascribe power to them, but to the infinite Invisible who is the true source of all. "O ye mighty." Ye great ones of earth and of heaven, kings and angels, join in rendering worship to the blessed and only Potentate; ye lords among men need thus to be reminded, for ye often fail where humbler men are ardent; but fail no longer, bow your heads at once, and loyally do homage to the King of kings. How frequently do grandees and potentates think it beneath them to fear the Lord; but, when they have been led to extol Jehovah, their piety has been the greatest jewel in their crowns. "Give unto the Lord glory and strength," both of which men are too apt to claim for themselves, although they are the exclusive prerogatives of the self-existent God. Let crowns and swords acknowledge their dependence upon God. Not to your arms, O kings, give ye the glory, nor look for strength to your host of warriors, for all your pomp is but as a fading flower, and your might is as a shadow which declineth. When shall the day arrive when kings and princes shall count it their delight to glorify their God? "All worship be to God only," let this be emblazoned on every coat of arms.<p><a href="/psalms/29-2.htm">Psalm 29:2</a><p>"Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name." A third time the admonition is given, for men are backward in glorifying God, and especially great men, who are often too much swollen with their own glory to spare time to give God his rightful praise, although nothing more is asked of them than is most just and right. Surely men should not need so much pressing to give what is due, especially when the payment is so pleasant. Unbelief and distrust, complaining and murmuring, rob God of his honour; in this respect, even the saints fail to give due glory to their King. "Worship the Lord," bow before him with devout homage and sacred awe, and let your worship be such as he appoints. Of old, worship was cumbered with ceremonial, and men gathered around one dedicated building, whose solemn pomp was emblematic of "the beauty of holiness;" but now our worship is spiritual, and the architecture of the house and the garments of the worshippers are matters of no importance; the spiritual beauty of inward purity and outward holiness being far more precious in the eyes of our thrice holy God. O for grace ever to worship with holy motives and in a holy manner, as becometh saints! The call to worship in these two verses chimes in with the loud pealing thunder, which is the church bell of the universe ringing kings and angels, and all the sons of earth to their devotions. <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is supposed that this Psalm was made upon the occasion of some terrible tempest of thunder and rain; which God might possibly send in the time of battle to assist David, and discomfit his enemies; as he had done formerly upon like occasions.

Most commentators suggest the holy angels (Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, 'Speaker's Commentary,' ' Four Friends,' Professor Alexander, Cheyne, etc.); but some think the heathen (Michaelis, Kay); and others, the mighty ones of the earth generally (Koster), to be meant. <span class="cmt_word">Give</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord glory and strength;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. </span>praise his Name, <span class="accented">ascribe</span> to him glory and strength and every other excellency. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This first half of the Psalm (<a href="/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>) is supplicatory. The preposition &#1502;&#1503; in connection with the verbs &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to be deaf, dumb, and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, to keep silence, is a pregnant form of expression denoting an aversion or turning away which does not deign to give the suppliant an answer. Jahve is his &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, his ground of confidence; but if He continues thus to keep silence, then he who confides in Him will become like those who are going down (<a href="/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>), or are gone down (<a href="/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>) to the pit. The participle of the past answers better to the situation of one already on the brink of the abyss. In the double sentence with &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;, the chief accent falls upon the second clause, for which the first only paratactically opens up the way (cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>); in Latin it would be ne, te mihi non respondente, similis fiam. Olshausen, and Baur with him, believes that because &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; has not the accent on the ultima as being perf. consec., it must be interpreted according to the accentuation thus, "in order that Thou mayst no longer keep silence, whilst I am already become like..." But this ought to be &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, or at least &#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;. And if &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; were to be taken as a real perfect, it would then rather have to be rendered "and I should then be like." But, notwithstanding &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is Milel, it is still perf. consecuticum ("and I am become like"); for if, in a sentence of more than one member following upon &#1508;&#1503;, the fut., as is usually the case (vid., on <a href="/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>), goes over into the perf., then the latter, in most instances, has the tone of the perf. consec. (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-25.htm">Judges 18:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/5-9.htm">Proverbs 5:9-12</a>, <a href="/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a>), but not always. The penultima-accentuation is necessarily retained in connection with the two great pausal accents, Silluk and Athnach, <a href="/deuteronomy/8-12.htm">Deuteronomy 8:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a>; in this passage in connection with Rebia mugrash, just as we may say, in general, the perf. consec. sometimes retains its penultima-accentuation in connection with distinctives instead of being accented on the ultima; e.g., in connection with Rebia mugrash, <a href="/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a>; with Rebia, <a href="/proverbs/19-14.htm">Proverbs 19:14</a> (cf. <a href="/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a> with <a href="/ezekiel/14-17.htm">Ezekiel 14:17</a>); with Zakeph. <a href="/1_samuel/29-8.htm">1 Samuel 29:8</a>; and even with Tiphcha Obad. Oba 1:10, <a href="/joel/3-21.htm">Joel 3:21</a>. The national grammarians are ignorant of any law on this subject.<p>(Note: Aben-Ezra (Moznajim 36b) explains the perfect accented on the penult. in <a href="/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a> from the conformity of sound, and Kimchi (Michlol 6b) simply records the phenomenon.)<p>The point towards which the psalmist stretches forth his hands in prayer is Jahve's holy &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;. Such is the word (after the form &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, &#1506;&#1496;&#1497;&#1503;) used only in the Books of Kings and Chronicles, with the exception of this passage, to denote the Holy of Holies, not as being &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (Aquila and Symmachus), or &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, oraculum (Jerome), as it were, Jahve's audience chamber (Hengstenberg) - a meaning that is not in accordance with the formation of the word, - but as the hinder part of the tent, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, Arabic dabara, to be behind, whence dubr (Talmudic &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;), that which is behind (opp. kubl. kibal, that which is in the front), cf. Jesurun p. 87f. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-3.htm">Psalm 28:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/28-4.htm">Psalm 28:4</a> the prayer is expanded. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; (instead of which we find &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; in <a href="/psalms/26-9.htm">Psalm 26:9</a>), to draw any one down forcibly to destruction, or to drag him to the place of judgment, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-20.htm">Ezekiel 32:20</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>; <a href="/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a>. The delineation of the ungodly David borrows from his actual foes, Should he succumb to them, then his fate would be like that which awaits them, to whom he is conscious that he is radically unlike. He therefore prays that God's recompensing justice may anticipate him, i.e., that He may requite them according to their desert, before he succumbs, to whom they have feigned &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, a good understanding, or being on good terms, whereas they cherished in their heart the &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; that is now unmasked (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>). &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, used of an official adjudication, as in <a href="/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>. The epanaphora of &#1514;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1500;&#1492;&#1501; is like <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>.<p>(Note: This repetition, at the end, of a significant word that has been used at the beginning of a verse, is a favourite custom of Isaiah's (Comment. S. 387; transl. ii.134).)<p>The phrase &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;), which occurs frequently in the prophets, signifies to recompense or repay to any one his accomplishing, his manifestation, that is to say, what he has done and merited; the thoughts and expression call to mind more particularly <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8-11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>. The right to pray for recompense (vengeance) is grounded, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>, upon their blindness to God's just and merciful rule as it is to be seen in human history (cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>). The contrast of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1495;&#1512;&#1505;, to pull down (with a personal object, as in <a href="/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a>), is like Jeremiah's style (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-10.htm">Psalm 42:10</a>, cf. 1:10; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, and frequently, Sir. 49:7). In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>, the prominent thought in David's mind is, that they shamefully fail to recognise how gloriously and graciously God has again and again acknowledged him as His anointed one. He has (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>) received the promise, that God would build him a house, i.e., grant perpetual continuance to his kingship. The Absolomites are in the act of rebellion against this divine appointment. Hence they shall experience the very reverse of the divine promise given to David: Jahve will pull them down and not build them up, He will destroy, at its very commencement, this dynasty set up in opposition to God. </body></html>
