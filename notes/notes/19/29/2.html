When we come before him as the Redeemer of sinners, in repentance faith, and love, he will accept our defective services, pardon the sin that cleaves to them, and approve of that measure of holiness which the Holy Spirit enables us to exercise. We have here the nature of religious worship; it is giving to the Lord the glory due to his name. We must be holy in all our religious services, devoted to God, and to his will and glory. There is a beauty in holiness, and that puts beauty upon all acts of worship. The psalmist here sets forth God's dominion in the kingdom of nature. In the thunder, and lightning, and storm, we may see and hear his glory. Let our hearts be thereby filled with great, and high, and honourable thoughts of God, in the holy adoring of whom, the power of godliness so much consists. O Lord our God, thou art very great! The power of the lightning equals the terror of the thunder. The fear caused by these effects of the Divine power, should remind us of the mighty power of God, of man's weakness, and of the defenceless and desperate condition of the wicked in the day of judgment. But the effects of the Divine word upon the souls of men, under the power of the Holy Spirit, are far greater than those of thunder storms in the nature world. Thereby the stoutest are made to tremble, the proudest are cast down, the secrets of the heart are brought to light, sinners are converted, the savage, sensual, and unclean, become harmless, gentle, and pure. If we have heard God's voice, and have fled for refuge to the hope set before us, let us remember that children need not fear their Father's voice, when he speaks in anger to his enemies. While those tremble who are without shelter, let those who abide in his appointed refuge bless him for their security, looking forward to the day of judgment without dismay, safe as Noah in the ark.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name - Margin: "the honor of his name." The honor of His name is that which is due to it, or which properly belongs to it. The "name" is put here, as it often is, for God Himself; and the meaning is, "Ascribe to God the honor that is properly his due." This is a claim addressed to the angels; it is a claim certainly not less binding on people. It is practically a call upon all creatures in the universe to ascribe due honor to God.<p>Worship the Lord - This exhortation is made particularly in view of the manifestations of His power in the storm. The idea is, that one who is capable of putting forth such power as is displayed in a tempest, has a claim to adoration and praise.<p>In the beauty of holiness - Margin, "in his glorious sanctuary." The Hebrew phrase would properly mean "holy beauty." Some have supposed that it means "in holy adorning," or in such consecrated vestments as were worn by priests in the sacred services of the sanctuary, or when they came into the presence of Yahweh. So DeWette understands it. But the more probable interpretation is that which refers it to the state of the heart - the "internal" ornament - with which we should approach God - to a holy and pure state of mind - that beauty or appropriateness of the soul which consists in holiness or purity. Of this the external clothing of the priesthood was itself but an emblem, and this is that which God desires in those who approach Him in an act of worship. It may be added that there is no "beauty" like this; that there is no external comeliness, no charm of person or complexion, no adorning of costly robes, that can be compared with this. It is this which God seeks, and with this He will be pleased, whether under a less or more attractive external form; whether under rich and costly raiment, or under the plain and decent clothing of poverty. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. name&#8212;as (Ps 5:11; 8:1).<p>beauty of holiness&#8212;the loveliness of a spiritual worship, of which the perceptible beauty of the sanctuary worship was but a type.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The glory due unto his name, </span> i.e. the honour which he deserves; which is to prefer him before all other gods, and to forsake all others, and to own him as the Almighty, and the only true God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the beauty of holiness; </span> or, <span class="ital">of the sanctuary</span>, which is commonly called by this name; in his holy and beautiful house, as it is called, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/64-11.htm" title="Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.">Isaiah 64:11</a></span>, the only place where he will receive worship.

This is generally explained as an exhortation to worship God in beautiful vestments, or with all the accessories of a beautiful ceremonial; but Dr. Alexander rightly questions whether the Beauty inherent in holiness itself is not meant. The apostle speaks of "the <span class="accented">ornament</span> of a meek and quiet spirit" (<a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>). And in goodness and holiness of every kind there is a sweetness and grace which may well be called "beauty," seeing that it has a close analogy with the beautiful in external nature and in art.

The preposition &#1502;&#1503; in connection with the verbs &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to be deaf, dumb, and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, to keep silence, is a pregnant form of expression denoting an aversion or turning away which does not deign to give the suppliant an answer. Jahve is his &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, his ground of confidence; but if He continues thus to keep silence, then he who confides in Him will become like those who are going down (<a href="/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>), or are gone down (<a href="/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>) to the pit. The participle of the past answers better to the situation of one already on the brink of the abyss. In the double sentence with &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;, the chief accent falls upon the second clause, for which the first only paratactically opens up the way (cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>); in Latin it would be ne, te mihi non respondente, similis fiam. Olshausen, and Baur with him, believes that because &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; has not the accent on the ultima as being perf. consec., it must be interpreted according to the accentuation thus, "in order that Thou mayst no longer keep silence, whilst I am already become like..." But this ought to be &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, or at least &#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;. And if &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; were to be taken as a real perfect, it would then rather have to be rendered "and I should then be like." But, notwithstanding &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is Milel, it is still perf. consecuticum ("and I am become like"); for if, in a sentence of more than one member following upon &#1508;&#1503;, the fut., as is usually the case (vid., on <a href="/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>), goes over into the perf., then the latter, in most instances, has the tone of the perf. consec.

The right to pray for recompense (vengeance) is grounded, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>, upon their blindness to God's just and merciful rule as it is to be seen in human history (cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>).

In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>, the prominent thought in David's mind is, that they shamefully fail to recognise how gloriously and graciously God has again and again acknowledged him as His anointed one. He has (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>) received the promise, that God would build him a house, i.e., grant perpetual continuance to his kingship. The Absolomites are in the act of rebellion against this divine appointment. Hence they shall experience the very reverse of the divine promise given to David: Jahve will pull them down and not build them up, He will destroy, at its very commencement, this dynasty set up in opposition to God. </body></html>
