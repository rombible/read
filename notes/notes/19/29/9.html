When we come before him as the Redeemer of sinners, in repentance faith, and love, he will accept our defective services, pardon the sin that cleaves to them, and approve of that measure of holiness which the Holy Spirit enables us to exercise. We have here the nature of religious worship; it is giving to the Lord the glory due to his name. We must be holy in all our religious services, devoted to God, and to his will and glory. There is a beauty in holiness, and that puts beauty upon all acts of worship. The psalmist here sets forth God's dominion in the kingdom of nature. In the thunder, and lightning, and storm, we may see and hear his glory. Let our hearts be thereby filled with great, and high, and honourable thoughts of God, in the holy adoring of whom, the power of godliness so much consists. O Lord our God, thou art very great! The power of the lightning equals the terror of the thunder. The fear caused by these effects of the Divine power, should remind us of the mighty power of God, of man's weakness, and of the defenceless and desperate condition of the wicked in the day of judgment. But the effects of the Divine word upon the souls of men, under the power of the Holy Spirit, are far greater than those of thunder storms in the nature world. Thereby the stoutest are made to tremble, the proudest are cast down, the secrets of the heart are brought to light, sinners are converted, the savage, sensual, and unclean, become harmless, gentle, and pure. If we have heard God's voice, and have fled for refuge to the hope set before us, let us remember that children need not fear their Father's voice, when he speaks in anger to his enemies. While those tremble who are without shelter, let those who abide in his appointed refuge bless him for their security, looking forward to the day of judgment without dismay, safe as Noah in the ark.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve - The deer. The object of the psalmist here is to show the effects of the storm in producing consternation, especially on the weak and timid animals of the forest. The effect here adverted to is that of fear or consternation in bringing on the throes of parturition. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-1.htm">Job 39:1</a>, <a href="/job/39-3.htm">Job 39:3</a>. No one can doubt that the effect here described may occur in the violence of a tempest; and perhaps no image could more vividly describe the terrors of the storm than the consternation thus produced. The margin here is, "to be in pain." The Hebrew means "to bring forth," referring to the pains of parturition.<p>And discovereth the forests - The word used here means "to strip off, to uncover;" and, as used here, it means to strip off the leaves of the forest; to make the trees bare - referring to an effect which is often produced by a violent storm.<p>And in his temple doth every one speak of his glory - Margin, "every whit of it uttereth," etc. The word here rendered "temple" does not refer in this place to the tabernacle, or to the temple at Jerusalem, but rather "to the world itself," considered as the residence or dwelling-place of God. Perhaps the true translation would be, "And in his temple everything says, Glory!" That is, in the dwelling-place of God - the world of nature - the sky, the earth, the forests, the waters, everything in the storm, echoes "glory, glory!" All these things declare the glory of God; all these wonders - the voice of God upon the waters; the thunder; the crash of the trees upon the hills; the shaking of the wilderness; the universal consternation; the leaves stripped from the trees and flying in every direction - all proclaim the majesty and glory of Yahweh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

The All-glorious One makes Himself heard in the language (<a href="/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3</a>.) of the thunder, and reveals Himself in the storm. There are fifteen lines, which naturally arrange themselves into three five-line strophes. The chief matter with the poet, however, is the sevenfold &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1492;. Although &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; is sometimes used almost as an ejaculatory "Hark!" (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>), this must not, with Ewald (286, f), be applied to the &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1492; of the Psalm before us, the theme of which is the voice of God, who announced Himself from heaven - a voice which moves the world. The dull sounding &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; serves not merely to denote the thunder of the storm, but even the thunder of the earthquake, the roar of the tempest, and in general, every low, dull, rumbling sound, by which God makes Himself audible to the world, and more especially from the wrathful side of His doxa. The waters in <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a> are not the lower waters. Then the question arises what are they? Were the waters of the Mediterranean intended, they would be more definitely denoted in such a vivid description. It is, however, far more appropriate to the commencement of this description to understand them to mean the mass of water gathered together in the thick, black storm-clouds (vid., <a href="/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>). The rumbling<p>(Note: The simple rendering of &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; by "voice" has been retained in the text of the Psalm, as in the Authorised Version.

The lightning makes these mountains bound (Luther, lecken, i.e., according to his explanation: to spring, skip) like young antelopes. &#1512;&#1488;&#1501;,<p>(Note: On Arab. r'm vid., Seetzen's Reisen iii. 339 and also iv. 496.)<p>like &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, is a generic name of the antelope, and of the buffalo that roams in herds through the forests beyond the Jordan even at the present day; for there are antelopes that resemble the buffalo and also (except in the formation of the head and the cloven hoofs) those that resemble the horse, the lxx renders: &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. Does this mean the unicorn Germ. one-horn depicted on Persian and African monuments? Is this unicorn distinct from the one horned antelope? Neither an unicorn nor an one horned antelope have been seen to the present day by any traveller. Both animals, and consequently also their relation to one another, are up to the present time still undefinable from a scientific point of view.<p>(Note: By &#1512;&#1488;&#1501; Ludolf in opposition to Bochart understands the rhinoceros; but this animal, belonging to the swine tribe, is certainly not meant, or even merely associated with it. Moreover, the rhinoceros Germ. nose-horn is called in Egypt charnin (from Arab. chrn  equals  qrn), but the unicorn, charnit. "In the year 1862 the French archaeologist, M. Waddington, was with me in Damascus when an antiquary brought me an ancient vessel on which a number of animals were engraved, their names being written on their bellies. Among the well known animals there was also an unicorn, exactly like a zebra or a horse, but with a long horn standing out upon its forehead; on its body was the word Arab. chrn&#305;&#770;t. M. Waddington wished to have the vessel and I gave it up to him; and he took it with him to Paris. We talked a good deal about this unicorn, and felt obliged to come to the conclusion that the form of the fabulous animal might have become known to the Arabs at the time of the crusades, when the English coat of arms came to Syria." - Wetzstein.)<p>Each peal of thunder is immediately followed by a flash of lightning; Jahve's thunder cleaveth flames of fire, i.e., forms (as it were &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;) the fire-matter of the storm-clouds into cloven flames of fire, into lightnings that pass swiftly along; in connection with which it must be remembered that &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1492; denotes not merely the thunder as a phenomenon, but at the same time it denotes the omnipotence of God expressing itself therein. The brevity and threefold division of <a href="/psalms/29-7.htm">Psalm 29:7</a> depicts the incessant, zigzag, quivering movement of the lightning (tela trisulca, ignes trisulci, in Ovid). From the northern mountains the storm sweeps on towards the south of Palestine into the Arabian desert, viz., as we are told in <a href="/psalms/29-8.htm">Psalm 29:8</a> (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-5.htm">Psalm 29:5</a>, according to the schema of "parallelism by reservation"), the wilderness region of Kadesh (Kadesh Barnea), which, however we may define its position, must certainly have lain near the steep western slope of the mountains of Edom toward the Arabah. Jahve's thunder, viz., the thunderstorm, puts this desert in a state of whirl, inasmuch as it drives the sand (&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;) before it in whirlwinds; and among the mountains it, viz., the strong lightning and thundering, makes the hinds to writhe, inasmuch as from fright they bring forth prematurely. both the Hiph. &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500; and the Pil. &#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; are used with a causative meaning (root &#1495;&#1493;, &#1495;&#1497;, to move in a circle, to encircle). The poet continues with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507;, since he makes one effect of the storm to develope from another, merging as it were out of its chrysalis state. &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is a poetical plural form; and &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507; describes the effect of the storm which "shells" the woods, inasmuch as it beats down the branches of the trees, both the tops and the foliage. While Jahve thus reveals Himself from heaven upon the earth in all His irresistible power, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;, in His heavenly palace (<a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>), &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; (note how &#1489;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493; resolves this &#1499;&#1500;&#1493; out of itself), i.e., each of the beings therein, says: &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;. That which the poet, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>, has called upon them to do, now takes place. Jahve receives back His glory, which is immanent in the universe, in the thousand-voiced echo of adoration. </body></html>
