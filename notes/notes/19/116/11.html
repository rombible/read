Yet there may be true faith where there are workings of unbelief; but then faith will prevail; and being humbled for our distrust of God's word, we shall experience his faithfulness to it. What can the pardoned sinner, or what can those who have been delivered from trouble or distress, render to the Lord for his benefits? We cannot in any way profit him. Our best is unworthy of his acceptance; yet we ought to devote ourselves and all we have to his service. I will take the cup of salvation; I will offer the drink-offerings appointed by the law, in token of thankfulness to God, and rejoice in God's goodness to me. I will receive the cup of affliction; that cup, that bitter cup, which is sanctified to the saints, so that to them it is a cup of salvation; it is a means of spiritual health. The cup of consolation; I will receive the benefits God bestows upon me, as from his hand, and taste his love in them, as the portion not only of mine inheritance in the other world, but of my cup in this. Let others serve what masters they will, truly I am thy servant. Two ways men came to be servants. By birth. Lord, I was born in thy house; I am the son of thine handmaid, and therefore thine. It is a great mercy to be children of godly parents. By redemption. Lord, thou hast loosed my bonds, thou hast discharged me from them, therefore I am thy servant. The bonds thou hast loosed shall tie me faster unto thee. Doing good is sacrifice, with which God is well pleased; and this must accompany giving thanks to his name. Why should we offer that to the Lord which cost us nothing? The psalmist will pay his vows now; he will not delay the payment: publicly, not to make a boast, but to show he is not ashamed of God's service, and to invite others to join him. Such are true saints of God, in whose lives and deaths he will be glorified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/116.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I said in my haste - The Hebrew word used here means to flee in haste; to be in alarm and trepidation; and the idea seems to be, that the assertion referred to was made under the influence of excitement - or that it was not the result of sober reflection, but of an agitated state of mind. It does not necessarily imply that that which was said was false, for many true statements may be made when the mind is agitated and excited; but the meaning is, that he was then in such a state of mind as to suggest the belief, and to cause the assertion that all people are liars. Whether calm reflection would, or would not, confirm this impression of the moment would be a fair question after the excitement was over.<p>All men are liars - Are false; no one is to be relied on. This was said in the time of his affliction, and this added much to his affliction. The meaning is that, in those circumstances of distress, no one came to his aid; no one sympathized with him; there was no one to whom he could unbosom himself; no one seemed to feel any interest in him. There were relatives on whom he might have supposed that he could rely; there may have been those to whom he had shown kindness in similar circumstances; there may have been old friends whose sympathy he might have had reason to expect; but all failed. No one came to help him. No one shed a tear over his sorrows. No one showed himself true to friendship, to sympathy, to gratitude. All people seemed to be false; and he was shut up to God alone. A similar thing is referred to in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/41-5.htm">Psalm 41:5-9</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-18.htm">Psalm 88:18</a>; compare also <a href="//biblehub.com/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13-17</a>. This is not an unnatural feeling in affliction. The mind is then sensitive. We need friends then. We expect our friends to show their friendship then. If they do not do this, it seems to us that the entire world is false. It is evident from the whole course of remark here that the psalmist on reflection felt that he had said this without due thought, under the influence of excitement - and that he was disposed, when his mind was restored to calmness, to think better of mankind than he did in the day of affliction and trouble. This also is not uncommon. The world is much better than we think it is when our own minds are morbid and our nerves are unstrung; and bad as the world is, our opinion of it is not unfrequently the result rather of our own wrong feeling than of just reflection on the real character of mankind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/116.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. in my haste&#8212;literally, "terror," or "agitation," produced by his affliction (compare Ps 31:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/116.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I said; </span> yet once I confess I spake very unadvisedly. <span class="ital">In my haste</span>; through hastiness and precipitation of my mind, for want of due consideration, as the same phrase is used, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/31-22.htm" title="For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before your eyes: nevertheless you heard the voice of my supplications when I cried to you.">Psalm 31:22</a></span>.

All men, God’s own prophets not excepted, are liable to mistakes by the condition of their nature, as they are men, and therefore may easily deceive others; and this might be the case of Samuel in his promise of the kingdom to me. Thus he questions the truth of God’s promises, yet so as he doth not strike directly at God, but only reflects upon the instrument. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/116.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I said in my haste, all men are liars. The sin of lying is common to man; there is a natural proneness and propensity to it: men go astray from the womb, speaking lies; yet such who have received the grace of God "put it off" with the rest of "the deeds of the old man", and are "children that will not lie". Wherefore, though the greater part of mankind might deserve this character, yet all and every individual of them did not. However degenerate the age was in which David lived, and the faithful among men were few; yet there were some to whom this imputation did not belong; and therefore, on cool reflection, he owned it was said "in haste"; not with thought and deliberation, but rashly and precipitately, unadvisedly, in a passion, and under a temptation, and when off of his guard; and which he acknowledged and repented of. The Targum is, <p>"I said in my flight;'' <p>when he made haste and fled from Saul, whom he might call a liar and dissembler, pretending respect to him when he had none; and also his courtiers; nay, even Samuel himself, who had anointed him, and assured him he should be king; and yet now he thought he had deceived him, and he should perish by the hand of Saul, and never come to the kingdom, <a href="/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1</a>; or when he fled from his son Absalom, whom he might call a liar, who had deceived him with the pretence of a vow; and also Ahithophel and others, who proved treacherous and unfaithful to him. Some take the words in a quite different sense, as an instance of his great faith; that when he was so greatly afflicted, and obliged to fly, yet declared that every man that should say he should not come to the kingdom was a liar; so Kimchi: and others think his meaning is, that every man is a liar in comparison of God, who is true and faithful to his promises, and not a man, that he should lie. Men of both high and low degree are a lie and vanity, and not to be trusted and depended upon; but a man may safely put confidence in the Lord; to this agrees <a href="/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>; where the apostle seems to have some respect to this passage. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/116.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I said in my <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> haste, All men <i>are</i> liars.</span><p>(g) In my great distress I thought God would not regard man, who is but lies and vanity, yet I overcame this temptation and felt the contrary.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/116.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I said in my haste, All men are liars</span>.

His love is turned especially toward the simple (lxx &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, cf. <a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>), who stand in need of His protection and give themselves over to it. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>, is a mode of writing blended out of &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;. The poet also has experienced this love in a time of impotent need. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; is accented on the ultima here, and not as in <a href="/psalms/142-7.htm">Psalm 142:7</a> on the penult. The accentuation is regulated by some phonetic or rhythmical law that has not yet been made clear (vid., on <a href="/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>).<p>(Note: The national grammarians, so far as we are acquainted with them, furnish no explanation. De Balmis believes that these Milra forms &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, and the like, must be regarded as infinitives, but at the same time confirms the difference of views existing on this point.)<p>&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; is a resolved Hiphil form, the use of which became common in the later period of the language, but is not alien to the earlier period, especially in poetry (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-18.htm">Psalm 45:18</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/81-6.htm">Psalm 81:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>). In <a href="/psalms/116-7.htm">Psalm 116:7</a> we hear the form of soliloquy which has become familiar to us from <a href="/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497; is Milra here, as also in two other instances. The plural &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; signifies full, complete rest, as it is found only in God; and the suffix in the address to the soul is ajchi for ajich, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3-5</a>. The perfect &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; states that which is a matter of actual experience, and is corroborated in <a href="/psalms/116-8.htm">Psalm 116:8</a> in retrospective perfects. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/116-8.htm">Psalm 116:8-9</a> we hear <a href="/psalms/56-14.htm">Psalm 56:14</a> again amplified; and if we add <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, then we see as it were to the bottom of the origin of the poet's thoughts. &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492; belongs still more decidedly than &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; to the resolved forms which multiply in the later period of the language. In <a href="/psalms/116-9.htm">Psalm 116:9</a> the poet declares the result of the divine deliverance. The Hithpa. &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; denotes a free and contented going to and fro; and instead of "the land of the living," <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, the expression here is "the lands (&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;), i.e., the broad land, of the living." There he walks forth, with nothing to hinder his feet or limit his view, in the presence of Jahve, i.e., having his Deliverer from death ever before his eyes. </body></html>
