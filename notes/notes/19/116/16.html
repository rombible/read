Yet there may be true faith where there are workings of unbelief; but then faith will prevail; and being humbled for our distrust of God's word, we shall experience his faithfulness to it. What can the pardoned sinner, or what can those who have been delivered from trouble or distress, render to the Lord for his benefits? We cannot in any way profit him. Our best is unworthy of his acceptance; yet we ought to devote ourselves and all we have to his service. I will take the cup of salvation; I will offer the drink-offerings appointed by the law, in token of thankfulness to God, and rejoice in God's goodness to me. I will receive the cup of affliction; that cup, that bitter cup, which is sanctified to the saints, so that to them it is a cup of salvation; it is a means of spiritual health. The cup of consolation; I will receive the benefits God bestows upon me, as from his hand, and taste his love in them, as the portion not only of mine inheritance in the other world, but of my cup in this. Let others serve what masters they will, truly I am thy servant. Two ways men came to be servants. By birth. Lord, I was born in thy house; I am the son of thine handmaid, and therefore thine. It is a great mercy to be children of godly parents. By redemption. Lord, thou hast loosed my bonds, thou hast discharged me from them, therefore I am thy servant. The bonds thou hast loosed shall tie me faster unto thee. Doing good is sacrifice, with which God is well pleased; and this must accompany giving thanks to his name. Why should we offer that to the Lord which cost us nothing? The psalmist will pay his vows now; he will not delay the payment: publicly, not to make a boast, but to show he is not ashamed of God's service, and to invite others to join him. Such are true saints of God, in whose lives and deaths he will be glorified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/116.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O Lord, truly I am thy servant - In view of thy mercy in delivering me from death, I feel the obligation to give myself to thee. I see in the fact that thou hast thus delivered me, evidence that I am thy servant - that I am so regarded by thee; and I recognize the obligation to live as becomes one who has had this proof of favor and mercy.<p>The son of thine handmaid - Of a pious mother. I see now the result of my training. I call to my recollection the piety of a mother. I rememberer how she served thee; how she trained me up for thee; I see now the evidence that her prayers were heard, and that her efforts were blessed in endeavoring to train me up for thee. The psalmist saw now that, under God, he owed all this to the pious efforts of a mother, and that God had been pleased to bless those efforts in making him his child, and in so guiding him that it was not improper for him to speak. of himself as possessing and carrying out the principles of a sainted mother. It is not uncommon - and in such cases it is proper - that all the evidence which we may have that we are pious - that we are living as we ought to live, that we are receiving special favors from God - recalls to our minds the instructions of early years, the counsels and prayers of a holy father or mother.<p>Thou hast loosed my bonds - The bonds of disease; the fetters which seemed to have made me a prisoner to Death.

But how does it now proceed? The lxx renders &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;, which the apostle makes use of in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-13.htm">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>, without our being therefore obliged with Luther to render: I believe, therefore I speak; &#1499;&#1497; does not signify &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#768;. Nevertheless &#1499;&#1497; might according to the sense be used for &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, if it had to be rendered with Hengstenberg: "I believed, therefore I spake,hy but I was very much plagued." But this assertion does not suit this connection, and has, moreover, no support in the syntax. It might more readily be rendered: "I have believed that I should yet speak, i.e., that I should once more have a deliverance of God to celebrate;" but the connection of the parallel members, which is then only lax, is opposed to this. Hitzig's attempted interpretation, "I trust, when (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; as in <a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>) I should speak: I am greatly afflicted," i.e., "I have henceforth confidence, so that I shall not suffer myself to be drawn away into the expression of despondency," does not commend itself, since <a href="/psalms/116-10.htm">Psalm 116:10</a> is a complaining, but not therefore as yet a desponding assertion of the reality. Assuming that &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; and &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a> stand on the same line in point of time, it seems that it must be interpreted I had faith, for I spake (was obliged to speak); but &#1488;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, separated from &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497; by &#1499;&#1497;, is opposed to the colouring relating to the contemporaneous past. Thus <a href="/psalms/116-10.htm">Psalm 116:10</a> will consequently contain the issue of that which has been hitherto experienced: I have gathered up faith and believe henceforth, when I speak (have to speak, must speak): I am deeply afflicted (&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-67.htm">Psalm 119:67</a>, cf. Arab. &#8219;na&#770;, to be bowed down, more particularly in captivity, whence Arab. 'l-&#8219;na&#770;t, those who are bowed down). On the other hand, <a href="/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a> is manifestly a retrospect. He believes now, for he is thoroughly weaned from putting trust in men: I said in my despair (taken from <a href="/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>), the result of my deeply bowed down condition: All men are liars (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, <a href="/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>). Forsaken by all the men from whom he expected succour and help, he experienced the truth and faithfulness of God. Striding away over this thought, he asks in <a href="/psalms/116-12.htm">Psalm 116:12</a> how he is to give thanks to God for all His benefits. &#1502;&#1492; is an adverbial accusative for &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/44-16.htm">Genesis 44:16</a>, and the substantive &#1514;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, in itself a later formation, has besides the Chaldaic plural suffix o&#770;hi, which is without example elsewhere in Hebrew. The poet says in <a href="/psalms/116-13.htm">Psalm 116:13</a> how alone he can and will give thanks to his Deliverer, by using a figure taken from the Passover (<a href="/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27</a>), the memorial repast in celebration of the redemption out of Egypt. The cup of salvation is that which is raised aloft and drunk amidst thanksgiving for the manifold and abundant salvation (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;) experienced. &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1492; is the usual expression for a solemn and public calling upon and proclamation of the Name of God. In <a href="/psalms/116-14.htm">Psalm 116:14</a> this thanksgiving is more minutely designated as &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497; &#1504;&#1491;&#1512;, which the poet now discharges. A common and joyous eating and drinking in the presence of God was associated with the shelamim. &#1504;&#1488; (vid., <a href="/psalms/115-2.htm">Psalm 115:2</a>) in the freest application gives a more animated tone to the word with which it stands. Because he is impelled frankly and freely to give thanks before the whole congregation, &#1504;&#1488; stands beside &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, and &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, moreover, has the intentional ah. </body></html>
