When a poor sinner is awakened to a sense of his state, and fears that he must soon sink under the just wrath of God, then he finds trouble and sorrow. But let all such call upon the Lord to deliver their souls, and they will find him gracious and true to his promise. Neither ignorance nor guilt will hinder their salvation, when they put their trust in the Lord. Let us all speak of God as we have found him; and have we ever found him otherwise than just and good? It is of his mercies that we are not consumed. Let those who labour and are heavy laden come to him, that they may find rest to their souls; and if at all drawn from their rest, let them haste to return, remembering how bountifully the Lord has dealt with them. We should deem ourselves bound to walk as in his presence. It is a great mercy to be kept from being swallowed up with over-much sorrow. It is a great mercy for God to hold us by the right hand, so that we are not overcome and overthrown by a temptation. But when we enter the heavenly rest, deliverance from sin and sorrow will be complete; we shall behold the glory of the Lord, and walk in his presence with delight we cannot now conceive.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/116.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Return unto thy rest, O my soul - Luther, "Be thou again joyful, O my soul." The meaning seems to be, "Return to thy former tranquility and calmness; thy former freedom from fear and anxiety." He had passed through a season of great danger. His soul had been agitated and terrified. That danger was now over, and he calls upon his soul to resume its former tranquility, calmness, peace, and freedom from alarm. The word does not refer to God considered as the "rest" of the soul, but to what the mind of the psalmist had been, and might now be again.<p>For the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/13-6.htm">Psalm 13:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/116.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-8.

To a quiet and tranquil state after much distress (k); a soliloquy, an address to his own soul to return to God his resting place, as Kimchi; or to Christ, whose rest is glorious, and which lies in a cessation from a man's own works; not from doing them, but from depending on them, or from labouring for life by them; in a deliverance from the bondage of the law, its curse and condemnation, and from the dominion and tyranny of sin, and from the distressing guilt of it on the conscience; in spiritual peace and joy, arising from the application of the blood of Christ, and from a view of his righteousness and justification by it, and of his sacrifice, and of the expiation of sin by that; which is enjoyed in the ways and ordinances of Christ, and oftentimes amidst afflictions and tribulations: this is sometimes broke in upon and interrupted, through the prevalence of sin, the temptations of Satan, and divine desertions; but may be returned to again, as Noah's dove returned to the ark when it could find rest nowhere else; as the believer can find none but in Christ, and therefore after he has wandered from him he returns to him again, encouraged by the following reason. <p>For the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee; in times past, even in an eternity past, having loved him with an everlasting love, chosen him in Christ, made a covenant with him in him, blessed him with all spiritual blessings in him, and made unto him exceeding great and precious promises; provided a Redeemer and Saviour for him, whom he had made known unto him, having enlightened, quickened, and converted him; and had laid up good things for him to come, and had done many great things for him already; all which might serve to encourage his faith and hope in him.

If Hezekiah is the writer, the "bountiful dealing" will be the addition of fifteen years to his life (<a href="/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5</a>). If a poet just re turned from the Captivity, the return and the reoccupation of the Holy Land will be especially in his thoughts (comp. <a href="/psalms/85-1.htm">Psalm 85:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/116.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Not only is &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; "I love (like, am well pleased) that," like &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#834; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, Thucydides vi. 36, contrary to the usage of the language, but the thought, "I love that Jahve answereth me," is also tame and flat, and inappropriate to the continuation in <a href="/psalms/116-2.htm">Psalm 116:2</a>. Since <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/116-3.htm">Psalm 116:3-4</a> have come from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5-17</a>, &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is to be understood according to &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1498; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, so that it has the following &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; as its object, not it is true grammatically, but logically. The poet is fond of this pregnant use of the verb without an expressed object, cf. &#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/116-2.htm">Psalm 116:2</a>, and &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/116-10.htm">Psalm 116:10</a>. The Pasek after &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is intended to guard against the blending of the final a&#8219; with the initial 'a of &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1-13</a> :18; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/5-2.htm">Psalm 5:2</a>, in Baer). In <a href="/psalms/116-1.htm">Psalm 116:1</a> the accentuation prevents the rendering vocem orationis meae (Vulgate, lxx) by means of Mugrash. The &#305;&#770; of &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497; will therefore no more be the archaic connecting vowel (Ew. 211, b) than in <a href="/leviticus/26-42.htm">Leviticus 26:42</a>; the poet has varied the genitival construction of <a href="/psalms/28-6.htm">Psalm 28:6</a> to the permutative. The second &#1499;&#1497;, following close upon the first, makes the continuation of the confirmation retrospective. "In my days" is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/39-8.htm">Isaiah 39:8</a>, Bar. 4:20, cf. &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>, and frequently, equivalent to "so long as I live." We even here hear the tone of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a> (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>), which is continued in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3-4</a> as a freely borrowed passage. Instead of the "bands" (of Hades) there, the expression here is &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;, angustiae, plural of meetsar, after the form &#1502;&#1505;&#1489; in <a href="/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-3.htm">Lamentations 1:3</a> (Bttcher, De inferis, 423); the straitnesses of Hades are deadly perils which can scarcely be escaped. The futures &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; and &#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, by virtue of the connection, refer to the contemporaneous past. &#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (viz., &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, i.e., in a suppliant sense) is written with He instead of Aleph here and in five other instances, as the Masora observes. It has its fixed Metheg in the first syllable, in accordance with which it is to be pronounced a&#772;nna (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, ba&#772;ttim), and has an accented ultima not merely on account of the following &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; (vid., on <a href="/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>), but in every instance; for even where (the Metheg having been changed into a conjunctive) it is supplied with two different accents, as in <a href="/genesis/50-17.htm">Genesis 50:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-31.htm">Exodus 32:31</a>, the second indicates the tone-syllable.<p>(Note: Kimchi, mistaking the vocation of the Metheg, regards &#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (&#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;) as Milel. But the Palestinian and the Babylonian systems of pointing coincide in this, that the beseeching &#1488;&#1504;&#1488; (&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;) is Milra, and the interrogatory &#1488;&#1504;&#1492; Milel (with only two exceptions in our text, which is fixed according to the Palestinian Masora, viz., <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>, where the following word begins with Aleph), and these modes of accenting accord with the origin of the two particles. Pinsker (Einleitung, S. xiii.) insinuates against the Palestinian system, that in the cases where &#1488;&#1504;&#1488; has two accents the pointing was not certain of the correct accentuation, only from a deficient knowledge of the bearings of the case.)<p>Instead now of repeating "and Jahve answered me," the poet indulges in a laudatory confession of general truths which have been brought vividly to his mind by the answering of his prayer that he has experienced. </body></html>
