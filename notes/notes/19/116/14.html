Yet there may be true faith where there are workings of unbelief; but then faith will prevail; and being humbled for our distrust of God's word, we shall experience his faithfulness to it. What can the pardoned sinner, or what can those who have been delivered from trouble or distress, render to the Lord for his benefits? We cannot in any way profit him. Our best is unworthy of his acceptance; yet we ought to devote ourselves and all we have to his service. I will take the cup of salvation; I will offer the drink-offerings appointed by the law, in token of thankfulness to God, and rejoice in God's goodness to me. I will receive the cup of affliction; that cup, that bitter cup, which is sanctified to the saints, so that to them it is a cup of salvation; it is a means of spiritual health. The cup of consolation; I will receive the benefits God bestows upon me, as from his hand, and taste his love in them, as the portion not only of mine inheritance in the other world, but of my cup in this. Let others serve what masters they will, truly I am thy servant. Two ways men came to be servants. By birth. Lord, I was born in thy house; I am the son of thine handmaid, and therefore thine. It is a great mercy to be children of godly parents. By redemption. Lord, thou hast loosed my bonds, thou hast discharged me from them, therefore I am thy servant. The bonds thou hast loosed shall tie me faster unto thee. Doing good is sacrifice, with which God is well pleased; and this must accompany giving thanks to his name. Why should we offer that to the Lord which cost us nothing? The psalmist will pay his vows now; he will not delay the payment: publicly, not to make a boast, but to show he is not ashamed of God's service, and to invite others to join him. Such are true saints of God, in whose lives and deaths he will be glorified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/116.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will pay my vows ... - I will perform or execute. The word vows here refers probably to the solemn promise which he had made in his sickness - the promise to devote himself to God, should he be restored to health. Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-15.htm">Isaiah 38:15</a>, notes at <a href="/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a>. Such promises are commonly made in sickness, and, alas! almost as commonly disregarded and forgotten on a restoration to health. Yet such vows should be sacredly observed, for<p>(a) They are right and proper;<p>(b) they are made in most solemn circumstances;<p>(c) they are usually sincere;<p>(d) they are of the nature of a covenant with God;<p>(e) they are made when we are in the best position to take just views of life - of this life, and of the life to come;<p>(f) the subsequent life would be happier and better if they were faithfully carried out.<p>Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-25.htm">Psalm 22:25</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-13.htm">Psalm 66:13-14</a>, notes.<p>In the presence of all his people - Publicly. The vows were made in private; on the sick bed; when alone; in the silence of the night-watches; when no eye was upon him who made them but the eye of God. There is a propriety, however, that the expression of thanksgiving should be public. Compare <a href="/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a>. Indeed, nothing is more proper than public thanks for a restoration from sickness; and as in our public assemblies prayer is often specially offered for the sick at their own request, so it would be equally proper that, at their request, public thanks should be rendered for their recovery. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/116.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. now&#8212;(compare Ps 115:2).

Praise ye the Lord.<p><a href="/psalms/116-14.htm">Psalm 116:14</a><p>"I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people." The Psalmist has already stated his third resolution, to devote himself to the worship of God evermore, and here he commences the performance of that resolve. The vows which he had made in anguish, he now determines to fulfil: "I will pay my vows unto the Lord." He-does so at once, "now," and that publicly, "in the presence of all his people." Good resolutions cannot be carried out too speedily; vows become debts, and debts should be paid. It is well to have witnesses to the payment of just debts, and we need not be ashamed to have witnesses to the fulfilling of holy vows, for this will show that we are not ashamed of our Lord, and it may be a great benefit to those who look on and hear us publicly sounding forth the praises of our prayer-hearing God. How can those do this who have never with their mouth confessed their Saviour? O secret disciples, what say you to this verse! Be encouraged to come into the light and own your Redeemer. If, indeed, you have been saved, come forward and declare it in his own appointed way.<p><a href="/psalms/116-15.htm">Psalm 116:15</a><p>"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints," and therefore he did not suffer the Psalmist to die, but delivered his soul from death. This seems to indicate that the song was meant to remind Jewish families of the mercies received by any one of the household, supposing him to have been sore sick and to have been restored to health, for the Lord values the lives of his saints, and often spares them where others perish. They shall not die prematurely; they shall be immortal till their work is done; and when their time shall come to die, then their deaths shall be precious. The Lord watches over their dying beds, smooths their pillows, sustains their hearts, and receives their souls. Those who are redeemed with precious blood are so dear to God that even their deaths are precious to him. The death-beds of saints are very precious to the church, she often learns much from them; they are very precious to all believers, who delight to treasure up the last words of the departed; but they are most of all precious to the Lord Jehovah himself, who view the triumphant deaths of his gracious ones with sacred delight. If we have walked before him in the land of the living, we need not fear to die before him when the hour of our departure is at hand.<p><a href="/psalms/116-16.htm">Psalm 116:16</a><p>The man of God in paying his vows re-dedicates himself unto God; the offering which he brings is himself, as he cries, "O Lord, truly I am thy servant," "rightfully, really, heartily, constantly, I own that I am thine, for thou hast delivered and redeemed me." "I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid," a servant born in thy house, born of a servant and so born a servant, and therefore doubly thine. My mother was thine handmaid, and I, her son, confess that I am altogether thine by claims arising out of my birth. O that children of godly parents would thus judge; but, alas, there are many who are the sons of the Lord's handmaids, but they are not themselves his servants. They give sad proof that grace does not run in the blood. David's mother was evidently a gracious woman, and he is glad to remember that fact, and to see in it a fresh obligation to devote himself to God. "Thou hast loosed my bonds," - freedom from bondage binds me to thy service, He who is loosed from the bonds of sin, death, and hell should rejoice to wear the easy yoke of the great Deliverer. Note how the sweet singer delights to dwell upon his belonging to the Lord; it is evidently his glory, a thing of which he is proud, a matter which causes him intense satisfaction. Verily, it ought to create rapture in our souls if we are able to call Jesus Master, and are acknowledged by him as his servants.<p><a href="/psalms/116-17.htm">Psalm 116:17</a><p>"I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving." Being thy servant, I am bound to sacrifice to thee, and having received spiritual blessings at thy hands I will not bring bullock or goat, but I will bring that which is more suitable, namely, the thanksgiving of my heart. My inmost soul shall adore thee in gratitude. "And will call upon the name of the Lord," that is to say, I will bow before thee reverently, lift up my heart in love to thee, think upon thy character, and adore thee as thou dost reveal thyself. He is fond of this occupation, and several times in this Psalm declares that "he will call upon the name of the Lord," while at the same time he rejoices that he had done so many a time before. Good feelings and actions bear repeating: the more of hearty callings upon God the better.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/116.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My vows; </span> the praises and sacrifices which I vowed to God in the time of my distress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the presence of all his people; </span> that they who heard my vows, or understood them by the report of others, might be witnesses of my payment of them, and not be scandalized by my unfaithfulness in that matter. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/116.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I will pay my vows unto the Lord now, in the presence of all his people.

We are not told in Isaiah or 2 Kings that Hezekiah made any vows when he lay on his sick bed, but he may probably have done so. He certainly intended, as soon as his cure was complete, to "go up to the house of the Lord" (<a href="/2_kings/20-8.htm">2 Kings 20:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-22.htm">Isaiah 38:22</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/116.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With "gracious" and "compassionate" is here associated, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>, the term "righteous," which comprehends within itself everything that Jahve asserts concerning Himself in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>. from the words "and abundant in goodness and truth" onwards. His love is turned especially toward the simple (lxx &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, cf. <a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>), who stand in need of His protection and give themselves over to it. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>, is a mode of writing blended out of &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;. The poet also has experienced this love in a time of impotent need. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; is accented on the ultima here, and not as in <a href="/psalms/142-7.htm">Psalm 142:7</a> on the penult. The accentuation is regulated by some phonetic or rhythmical law that has not yet been made clear (vid., on <a href="/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>).<p>(Note: The national grammarians, so far as we are acquainted with them, furnish no explanation. De Balmis believes that these Milra forms &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, and the like, must be regarded as infinitives, but at the same time confirms the difference of views existing on this point.)<p>&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; is a resolved Hiphil form, the use of which became common in the later period of the language, but is not alien to the earlier period, especially in poetry (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-18.htm">Psalm 45:18</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/81-6.htm">Psalm 81:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>). In <a href="/psalms/116-7.htm">Psalm 116:7</a> we hear the form of soliloquy which has become familiar to us from <a href="/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497; is Milra here, as also in two other instances. The plural &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; signifies full, complete rest, as it is found only in God; and the suffix in the address to the soul is ajchi for ajich, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3-5</a>. The perfect &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; states that which is a matter of actual experience, and is corroborated in <a href="/psalms/116-8.htm">Psalm 116:8</a> in retrospective perfects. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/116-8.htm">Psalm 116:8-9</a> we hear <a href="/psalms/56-14.htm">Psalm 56:14</a> again amplified; and if we add <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, then we see as it were to the bottom of the origin of the poet's thoughts. &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492; belongs still more decidedly than &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; to the resolved forms which multiply in the later period of the language. In <a href="/psalms/116-9.htm">Psalm 116:9</a> the poet declares the result of the divine deliverance. The Hithpa. &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; denotes a free and contented going to and fro; and instead of "the land of the living," <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, the expression here is "the lands (&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;), i.e., the broad land, of the living." There he walks forth, with nothing to hinder his feet or limit his view, in the presence of Jahve, i.e., having his Deliverer from death ever before his eyes. </body></html>
