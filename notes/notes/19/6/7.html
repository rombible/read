Sickness brought sin to his remembrance, and he looked upon it as a token of God's displeasure against him. The affliction of his body will be tolerable, if he has comfort in his soul. Christ's sorest complaint, in his sufferings, was of the trouble of his soul, and the want of his Father's smiles. Every page of Scripture proclaims the fact, that salvation is only of the Lord. Man is a sinner, his case can only be reached by mercy; and never is mercy more illustrious than in restoring backsliders. With good reason we may pray, that if it be the will of God, and he has any further work for us or our friends to do in this world, he will yet spare us or them to serve him. To depart and be with Christ is happiest for the saints; but for them to abide in the flesh is more profitable for the church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mine eye is consumed - The word here rendered "consumed" - &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;  &#8219;a&#770;she&#770;sh - means properly to fall in, to fall away, and is applied here to the "eye" as pining or wasting away from care, anxiety, and sorrow. Tears were poured forth from the eye, and it seemed to be exhausting itself in this manner. The meaning is, that it had grown "dim," or that its sight began to fail, like that of an old man, on account of his troubles. Many have understood the word here rendered "eye" as referring to the "countenance;" but it is doubtful whether the word ever has this signification; and at any rate the common signification, referring it to the "eye," best suits this connection.<p>It waxeth old - It seems to grow old; it experiences the effects commonly produced by age in blunting the power of vision. This is not an uncommon effect of grief and sadness. Even while I am writing this I am called in my pastoral visitations to attend on a young lady lying on a bed of languishing, and probably of death, one of whose symptoms is a quite diminished, and indeed almost total loss of vision, as the effect of trouble and disease.<p>Because of all mine enemies - From the trouble which they have brought upon me. The reference here, according to the interpretation proposed of the psalm, is to Absalom and those who were associated with him. Their conduct had been such as to bring upon David this overwhelming tide of sorrows. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. consumed&#8212;or, "has failed," denoting general debility (Ps 13:3; 38:10).<p>waxeth old&#8212;or, "dim."<p>grief&#8212;mingled with indignation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Consumed; </span> or, <span class="ital">grown dim</span> or <span class="ital">dull</span>, through plenty of salt tears which I shed; or through the decay of my spirits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because of grief, </span> i.e. my grief arising from mine enemies, as the next clause interprets it, and from the consideration of their multitude, and rage, and falseness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Mine eye is consumed because of grief,....

How often has it not been noted that nothing so much ages a man as grief! <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 6:2-4) There is a chastisement which proceeds from God's love to the man as being pardoned and which is designed to purify or to prove him, and a chastisement which proceeds from God's wrath against the man as striving obstinately against, or as fallen away from, favour, and which satisfies divine justice. <a href="/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-17.htm">Psalm 118:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a>. speak of this loving chastisement. The man who should decline it, would act against his own salvation. Accordingly David, like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/10-24.htm">Jeremiah 10:24</a>), does not pray for the removal of the chastisement but of the chastisement in wrath, or what is the same thing, of the judgment proceeding from wrath [Zorngericht]. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1498; stand in the middle, between &#1488;&#1500; and the verbs, for the sake of emphasis. Hengstenberg indeed finds a different antithesis here. He says: "The contrast is not that of chastisement in love with chastisement in wrath, but that of loving rescue in contrast with chastisement, which always proceeds from the principle of wrath." If what is here meant is, that always when God chastens a man his wrath is the true and proper motive, it is an error, for the refutation of which one whole book of the Bible, viz., the Book of Job, has been written. For there the friends think that God is angry with Job; but we know from the prologue that, so far from being angry with him, he on the contrary glories in him. Here, in this Psalm, assuming David to be its author, and his adultery the occasion of it, it is certainly quite otherwise. The chastisement under which David is brought low, has God's wrath as its motive: it is punitive chastisement and remains such, so long as David remains fallen from favour. But if in sincere penitence he again struggles through to favour, then the punitive becomes a loving chastisement: God's relationship to him becomes an essentially different relationship. The evil, which is the result of his sin and as such indeed originates in the principle of wrath, becomes the means of discipline and purifying which love employs, and this it is that he here implores for himself. And thus Dante Alighieri<p>(Note: Provided he is the author of I stte Salmi Penitenziali trasportati alla volgar poesia, vid., Dante Alighieri's Lyric poems, translated and annotated by Kannegiesser and Witte (1842) i. 203f., ii.208f.)<p>correctly and beautifully paraphrases the verse:<p>Signor, non mi riprender con furore,<p>E non voler correggermi con ira,<p>Ma con dolcezza e con perfetto amore.<p>In &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; David prays God to let him experience His loving-kindness and tender mercy in place of the punishment He has a right to inflict; for anguish of soul has already reduced him to the extreme even of bodily sickness: he is withered up and weary. &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; has Pathach, and consequently seems to be the 3 pers. Pul. as in <a href="/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a>; but this cannot be according to the rules of grammar. It is an adjective, like &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503;, with the passive pointing. The formation &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; (from &#1488;&#1502;&#1500; Arab. aml, with the primary meaning to stretch out lengthwise) is analogous to the IX and XI forms of the Arabic verb which serve especially to express colours and defects (Caspari 59). The two words &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; have the double accent Mercha-Mahpach together, and according to the exact mode of writing (vid., Baer in my Psalter ii. 492) the Mahpach, (the sign resembling Mahpach or rather Jethib), ought to stand between the two words, since it at the same time represents the Makkeph. The principal tone of the united pair, therefore, lies on aani; and accordingly the adj. &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; is shortened to &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; (cf. &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498;, &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1505;, and the like) - a contraction which proves that &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; is not treated as part. Pul. ( equals  &#1502;&#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;), for its characteristic a4 is unchangeable. The prayer for healing is based upon the plea that his bones (<a href="/job/4-14.htm">Job 4:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>) are affrighted. We have no German word exactly corresponding to this &#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500; which (from the radical notion "to let go," cogn. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;) expresses a condition of outward overthrow and inward consternation, and is therefore the effect of fright which disconcerts one and of excitement that deprives one of self-control.<p>(Note: We have translated Dr. Delitzsch's word erschrecht literally - the vexed of the Authorized Version seems hardly equal to the meaning.)<p>His soul is still more shaken than his body. The affliction is therefore not a merely bodily ailment in which only a timorous man loses heart. God's love is hidden from him. God's wrath seems as though it would wear him completely away. It is an affliction beyond all other afflictions. Hence he enquires: And Thou, O Jahve, how long?! Instead of &#1488;&#1514;&#1492; it is written &#1488;&#1514;, which the Ker says is to be read &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, while in three passages (<a href="/numbers/11-15.htm">Numbers 11:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-24.htm">Deuteronomy 5:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-14.htm">Ezekiel 28:14</a>) &#1488;&#1514;&#1468; is admitted as masc. </body></html>
