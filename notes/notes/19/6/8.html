Having made his request known to God, the psalmist is confident that his sorrow will be turned into joy. By the workings of God's grace upon his heart, he knew his prayer was accepted, and did not doubt but it would, in due time, be answered. His prayers will be accepted, coming up out of the hands of Christ the Mediator. The word signifies prayer made to God, the righteous Judge, as the God of his righteousness, who would plead his cause, and right his wrongs. A believer, through the blood and righteousness of Christ, can go to God as a righteous God, and plead with him for pardon and cleansing, who is just and faithful to grant both. He prays for the conversion of his enemies, or foretells their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity - Referring, by the "workers of iniquity," to his enemies, as if they now surrounded him, and calling on them "now" to leave him, since God had heard his prayer, and they could not be successful in their purposes. This is an indirect but most emphatic way of saying that God had heard his prayer; and the sentiment in this verse is strongly in contrast with the desponding state of feeling - the deep and dreadful sorrow - indicated in the previous verses. Light broke in suddenly upon him; his prayer had come up before God, and, in some way, he was assured that it would be answered. Already he sees his enemies scattered, and his own cause triumphant; and in this exulting feeling he addresses his foes, and commands them to leave him. This is, therefore, a remarkable and striking proof that prayer may be heard, even while we are speaking to God (compare <a href="/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>); that the assurance may be conveyed suddenly to the mind that God will hear and answer the prayer which is addressed to him; and also a beautiful illustration of the effect of this on a mind overwhelmed with trouble and sorrow, in giving it calmness and peace.<p>For the Lord hath heard - That is, my prayer has ascended before him, and I am certain that he regards it favorably, and will answer it. "In what way" he had this assurance he does not inform us. As he was an inspired man, we may suppose that the assurance was given to him directly by the Holy Spirit. "We" are not to expect the "same kind" of assurance that our prayers are heard; we are to look for no revelation to that effect; but there may be "as real" an intimation to the mind that our prayers are heard - as real "evidence" - as in this case. There may be a firm confidence of the mind that God is a hearer of prayer now coming to the soul with the freshness of a new conviction of that truth; and there may be, in trouble and sorrow, a sweet calmness and peace breathed through the soul - an assurance that all will be right and well, as if the prayer were heard, and such as there would be if we were assured by direct revelation that it is heard. The Spirit of God can produce this in our case as really as he did in the case of David.<p>The voice of my weeping - The voice of prayer that accompanied my weeping, or the voice of the weeping itself - the cry of anguish and distress which was in itself of the nature of prayer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8, 9.

Get ye up, get ye up, from your dunghills! Cast aside your sackcloth and ashes! Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.<p>David has found peace, and rising from his knees he begins to sweep his house of the wicked. "Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity." The best remedy for us against an evil man is a long space between us both. "Get ye gone; I can have no fellowship with you." Repentance is a practical thing. It is not enough to bemoan the desecration of the temple of the heart, we must scourge out the buyers and sellers, and overturn the tables of the money changers. A pardoned sinner will hate the sins which cost the Saviour his blood. Grace and sin are quarrelsome neighbours, and one or the other must go to the wall.<p>"For the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping, "What a fine Hebraism, and what grand poetry it is in English! "He hath heard the voice of my weeping." Is there a voice in weeping? Does weeping speak? In what language doth it utter its meaning? Why, in that universal tongue which is known and understood in all the earth, and even in heaven above. When a man weeps, whether he be a Jew or Gentile, Barbarian, Scythian, bond or free, it has the same meaning in it. Weeping is the eloquence of sorrow. It is an unstammering orator, needing no interpreter, but understood of all. Is it not sweet to believe that our tears are understood even when words fail! Let us learn to think of tears as liquid prayers, and of weeping as a constant dropping of importunate intercession which will wear its way right surely into the very heart of mercy, despite the stony difficulties which obstruct the way. My God, I will "weep" when I cannot plead, for thou hearest the voice of my weeping.<p><a href="/psalms/6-9.htm">Psalm 6:9</a><p>"The Lord hath heard my supplication." The Holy Spirit had wrought into the Psalmist's mind the confidence that his prayer was heard. This is frequently the privilege of the saints. Praying the prayer of faith, they are often infallibly assured that they have prevailed with God. We read of Luther that, having on one occasion wrestled hard with God in prayer, he came leaping out of his closet crying, "Vicimus, vicimus;" that is, "We have conquered, we have prevailed with God." Assured confidence is no idle dream, for when the Holy Ghost bestows it upon us, we know its reality, and could not doubt it, even though all men should deride our boldness. "The Lord will receive my prayer." Here is past experience used for future encouragement. He hath, he will. Note this, O believer, and imitate its reasoning.<p><a href="/psalms/6-10.htm">Psalm 6:10</a><p>"Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed." This is rather a prophecy than an imprecation, it may be read in the future. "All my enemies shall be ashamed and sore vexed." They shall return and be ashamed instantaneously, - in a moment - their doom shall come upon them suddenly. Death's day is doom's day, and both are sure and may be sudden. The Romans were wont to say, "The feet of the avenging Deity are shod with wool." With noiseless footsteps vengeance nears its victim, and sudden and overwhelming shall be its destroying stroke. If this were an imprecation, we must remember that the language of the old dispensation is not that of the new. We pray for our enemies, not against them. God have mercy on them, and bring them into the right way.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Depart from me; </span> I advise you for your own sakes to cease from opposing or molesting me, or insulting over me, or approaching to me with design of deceiving and betraying me; for all your labour will be lost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All ye workers of iniquity; </span> all you wicked enemies of mine. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Lord hath heard, </span> i.e. he will hear, the past time being put for the future, as is usual in prophetical passages, such as this was; David having received by the Spirit of God particular assurance that God would hear and deliver him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The voice of my weeping, </span> i.e. of my fervent prayers joined with my tears. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity,.... The psalmist being fully assured that God had heard his prayer, that he should recover from his disorder, or be delivered out of his calamities, whether corporeal or spiritual, has on a sudden a spring of joy, faith, and comfort; as sometimes there is a quick transition from comfortable to uncomfortable frames; see <a href="/psalms/30-7.htm">Psalm 30:7</a>; so on the contrary, there is as quick a passage from uncomfortable to comfortable ones; see <a href="/lamentations/3-18.htm">Lamentations 3:18</a>; who may be called "workers of iniquity" See Gill on <a href="/psalms/5-5.htm">Psalm 5:5</a>; and these were either his open enemies, as Saul and his men, or Absalom and the conspirators with him, whom he bids to cease from following and pursuing after him; or his secret ones, hypocritical courtiers, that were about him, who were wishing and hoping for his death. It is the lot of God's people to be among the workers of iniquity; Lot was among the Sodomites, David was in Meshech and in the tents of Kedar, Isaiah was among men of unclean lips; Christ's lily is among thorns, and his sheep among goats; and though in some respects a civil conversation with wicked men cannot be avoided, for then good men must needs go out of the world; yet as little company should be kept with them as can be, and no fellowship should be had with them in sinful practices, nor in superstitious worship; and though there will not be a full and final separation from them in the present state of things, there will be hereafter, when these very words will be used by David's antitype, the Lord Jesus Christ; not only to profane sinners, but to carnal professors of religion, who have herded themselves with the people of God, <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>. The reason why the psalmist took heart and courage, and ordered his wicked persecutors, or sycophants, to be gone from him, was his assurance of being heard by the Lord; <p>for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping; referring to what is said <a href="/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>; he had not only lifted up his voice in prayer, but he had wept and made supplication, as Jacob did, <a href="/hosea/12-4.htm">Hosea 12:4</a>; sometimes God brings his people to the throne of grace weeping, and with supplications leads them, <a href="/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>; and then hears their cry and answers them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{e}</span> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.</span><p>(e) God sends comfort and boldness in affliction, that we may triumph over our enemies.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity</span>] Words used by our Lord, <a href="/matthew/7-23.htm" title="And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.">Matthew 7:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8–10</span>. The cloud breaks. Heaviness is turned to joy. With a sudden inspiration of faith the Psalmist realises that his prayer is heard, and predicts the speedy confusion of his enemies.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity!</span> Note the sudden change of tone, very characteristic of the Davidical psalms. The psalmist, having offered his prayer, is so certain of its acceptance that he at once turns upon his adversaries with words of reproach, and almost of menace. "Depart from me!" he exclaims; "get ye gone! do not dare any more to persecute me or plot against me! Your efforts are in vain." <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping</span>. David speaks from an inward conviction. He knows that he has prayed sincerely and fervently. He is certain, therefore, that his prayer is heard and accepted. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 6:2-4) There is a chastisement which proceeds from God's love to the man as being pardoned and which is designed to purify or to prove him, and a chastisement which proceeds from God's wrath against the man as striving obstinately against, or as fallen away from, favour, and which satisfies divine justice. <a href="/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-17.htm">Psalm 118:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a>. speak of this loving chastisement. The man who should decline it, would act against his own salvation. Accordingly David, like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/10-24.htm">Jeremiah 10:24</a>), does not pray for the removal of the chastisement but of the chastisement in wrath, or what is the same thing, of the judgment proceeding from wrath [Zorngericht]. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1498; stand in the middle, between &#1488;&#1500; and the verbs, for the sake of emphasis. Hengstenberg indeed finds a different antithesis here. He says: "The contrast is not that of chastisement in love with chastisement in wrath, but that of loving rescue in contrast with chastisement, which always proceeds from the principle of wrath." If what is here meant is, that always when God chastens a man his wrath is the true and proper motive, it is an error, for the refutation of which one whole book of the Bible, viz., the Book of Job, has been written. For there the friends think that God is angry with Job; but we know from the prologue that, so far from being angry with him, he on the contrary glories in him. Here, in this Psalm, assuming David to be its author, and his adultery the occasion of it, it is certainly quite otherwise. The chastisement under which David is brought low, has God's wrath as its motive: it is punitive chastisement and remains such, so long as David remains fallen from favour. But if in sincere penitence he again struggles through to favour, then the punitive becomes a loving chastisement: God's relationship to him becomes an essentially different relationship. The evil, which is the result of his sin and as such indeed originates in the principle of wrath, becomes the means of discipline and purifying which love employs, and this it is that he here implores for himself. And thus Dante Alighieri<p>(Note: Provided he is the author of I stte Salmi Penitenziali trasportati alla volgar poesia, vid., Dante Alighieri's Lyric poems, translated and annotated by Kannegiesser and Witte (1842) i. 203f., ii.208f.)<p>correctly and beautifully paraphrases the verse:<p>Signor, non mi riprender con furore,<p>E non voler correggermi con ira,<p>Ma con dolcezza e con perfetto amore.<p>In &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; David prays God to let him experience His loving-kindness and tender mercy in place of the punishment He has a right to inflict; for anguish of soul has already reduced him to the extreme even of bodily sickness: he is withered up and weary. &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; has Pathach, and consequently seems to be the 3 pers. Pul. as in <a href="/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a>; but this cannot be according to the rules of grammar. It is an adjective, like &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503;, with the passive pointing. The formation &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; (from &#1488;&#1502;&#1500; Arab. aml, with the primary meaning to stretch out lengthwise) is analogous to the IX and XI forms of the Arabic verb which serve especially to express colours and defects (Caspari 59). The two words &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; have the double accent Mercha-Mahpach together, and according to the exact mode of writing (vid., Baer in my Psalter ii. 492) the Mahpach, (the sign resembling Mahpach or rather Jethib), ought to stand between the two words, since it at the same time represents the Makkeph. The principal tone of the united pair, therefore, lies on aani; and accordingly the adj. &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; is shortened to &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; (cf. &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498;, &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1505;, and the like) - a contraction which proves that &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; is not treated as part. Pul. ( equals  &#1502;&#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;), for its characteristic a4 is unchangeable. The prayer for healing is based upon the plea that his bones (<a href="/job/4-14.htm">Job 4:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>) are affrighted. We have no German word exactly corresponding to this &#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500; which (from the radical notion "to let go," cogn. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;) expresses a condition of outward overthrow and inward consternation, and is therefore the effect of fright which disconcerts one and of excitement that deprives one of self-control.<p>(Note: We have translated Dr. Delitzsch's word erschrecht literally - the vexed of the Authorized Version seems hardly equal to the meaning.)<p>His soul is still more shaken than his body. The affliction is therefore not a merely bodily ailment in which only a timorous man loses heart. God's love is hidden from him. God's wrath seems as though it would wear him completely away. It is an affliction beyond all other afflictions. Hence he enquires: And Thou, O Jahve, how long?! Instead of &#1488;&#1514;&#1492; it is written &#1488;&#1514;, which the Ker says is to be read &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, while in three passages (<a href="/numbers/11-15.htm">Numbers 11:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-24.htm">Deuteronomy 5:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-14.htm">Ezekiel 28:14</a>) &#1488;&#1514;&#1468; is admitted as masc. </body></html>
