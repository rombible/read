Having made his request known to God, the psalmist is confident that his sorrow will be turned into joy. By the workings of God's grace upon his heart, he knew his prayer was accepted, and did not doubt but it would, in due time, be answered. His prayers will be accepted, coming up out of the hands of Christ the Mediator. The word signifies prayer made to God, the righteous Judge, as the God of his righteousness, who would plead his cause, and right his wrongs. A believer, through the blood and righteousness of Christ, can go to God as a righteous God, and plead with him for pardon and cleansing, who is just and faithful to grant both. He prays for the conversion of his enemies, or foretells their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord hath heard my supplication - Repeating the sentiment in the previous verse, to express his assurance and his joy.

Which he had presented to him, <a href="/psalms/6-1.htm">Psalm 6:1</a>; in which he deprecates his anger and hot displeasure; entreats his free favour, grace, and mercy; desires healing for soul or body, or both; prays a return of his gracious presence; and deliverance and salvation out of all his troubles, from all his enemies, and from death itself. The word (h) used properly signifies petitions for grace and mercy, which the psalmist put up under the influence of the spirit of grace and supplication, and which were heard; <p>the Lord will receive my prayer; instead of a burnt offering, as Aben Ezra glosses it; as sweet incense, as what is grateful and delightful, coming up out of the hands of Christ the Mediator, perfumed with the sweet incense of his mediation: the word (i) signifies prayer made to God as the righteous Judge, as the God of his righteousness, who would vindicate his cause and right his wrongs; and a believer, through the blood and righteousness of Christ, can go to God as a righteous God, and plead with him even for pardon and cleansing, who is just and faithful to grant both unto him. The psalmist three times expresses his confidence of his prayers being heard and received, which may be either in reference to his having prayed so many times for help, as the Apostle Paul did, <a href="/2_corinthians/12-8.htm">2 Corinthians 12:8</a>; and as Christ his antitype did, <a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>; or to express the certainty of it, the strength of his faith in it, and the exuberance of his joy on account of it. <p>(h) "supplices pro gratia preces meas", Michaelis: so Ainsworth.

The threefold repetition marks the absoluteness of the psalmist's conviction. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 6:2-4) There is a chastisement which proceeds from God's love to the man as being pardoned and which is designed to purify or to prove him, and a chastisement which proceeds from God's wrath against the man as striving obstinately against, or as fallen away from, favour, and which satisfies divine justice. <a href="/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-17.htm">Psalm 118:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a>. speak of this loving chastisement. The man who should decline it, would act against his own salvation. Accordingly David, like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/10-24.htm">Jeremiah 10:24</a>), does not pray for the removal of the chastisement but of the chastisement in wrath, or what is the same thing, of the judgment proceeding from wrath [Zorngericht]. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1498; stand in the middle, between &#1488;&#1500; and the verbs, for the sake of emphasis. Hengstenberg indeed finds a different antithesis here. He says: "The contrast is not that of chastisement in love with chastisement in wrath, but that of loving rescue in contrast with chastisement, which always proceeds from the principle of wrath." If what is here meant is, that always when God chastens a man his wrath is the true and proper motive, it is an error, for the refutation of which one whole book of the Bible, viz., the Book of Job, has been written. For there the friends think that God is angry with Job; but we know from the prologue that, so far from being angry with him, he on the contrary glories in him. Here, in this Psalm, assuming David to be its author, and his adultery the occasion of it, it is certainly quite otherwise. The chastisement under which David is brought low, has God's wrath as its motive: it is punitive chastisement and remains such, so long as David remains fallen from favour. But if in sincere penitence he again struggles through to favour, then the punitive becomes a loving chastisement: God's relationship to him becomes an essentially different relationship. The evil, which is the result of his sin and as such indeed originates in the principle of wrath, becomes the means of discipline and purifying which love employs, and this it is that he here implores for himself. And thus Dante Alighieri<p>(Note: Provided he is the author of I stte Salmi Penitenziali trasportati alla volgar poesia, vid., Dante Alighieri's Lyric poems, translated and annotated by Kannegiesser and Witte (1842) i. 203f., ii.208f.)<p>correctly and beautifully paraphrases the verse:<p>Signor, non mi riprender con furore,<p>E non voler correggermi con ira,<p>Ma con dolcezza e con perfetto amore.<p>In &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; David prays God to let him experience His loving-kindness and tender mercy in place of the punishment He has a right to inflict; for anguish of soul has already reduced him to the extreme even of bodily sickness: he is withered up and weary. &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; has Pathach, and consequently seems to be the 3 pers. Pul. as in <a href="/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a>; but this cannot be according to the rules of grammar. It is an adjective, like &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503;, with the passive pointing. The formation &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; (from &#1488;&#1502;&#1500; Arab. aml, with the primary meaning to stretch out lengthwise) is analogous to the IX and XI forms of the Arabic verb which serve especially to express colours and defects (Caspari 59). The two words &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; have the double accent Mercha-Mahpach together, and according to the exact mode of writing (vid., Baer in my Psalter ii. 492) the Mahpach, (the sign resembling Mahpach or rather Jethib), ought to stand between the two words, since it at the same time represents the Makkeph. The principal tone of the united pair, therefore, lies on aani; and accordingly the adj. &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; is shortened to &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; (cf. &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498;, &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1505;, and the like) - a contraction which proves that &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500; is not treated as part. Pul. ( equals  &#1502;&#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;), for its characteristic a4 is unchangeable. The prayer for healing is based upon the plea that his bones (<a href="/job/4-14.htm">Job 4:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>) are affrighted. We have no German word exactly corresponding to this &#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500; which (from the radical notion "to let go," cogn. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;) expresses a condition of outward overthrow and inward consternation, and is therefore the effect of fright which disconcerts one and of excitement that deprives one of self-control.<p>(Note: We have translated Dr. Delitzsch's word erschrecht literally - the vexed of the Authorized Version seems hardly equal to the meaning.)<p>His soul is still more shaken than his body. The affliction is therefore not a merely bodily ailment in which only a timorous man loses heart. God's love is hidden from him. God's wrath seems as though it would wear him completely away. It is an affliction beyond all other afflictions. Hence he enquires: And Thou, O Jahve, how long?! Instead of &#1488;&#1514;&#1492; it is written &#1488;&#1514;, which the Ker says is to be read &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, while in three passages (<a href="/numbers/11-15.htm">Numbers 11:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-24.htm">Deuteronomy 5:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-14.htm">Ezekiel 28:14</a>) &#1488;&#1514;&#1468; is admitted as masc. </body></html>
