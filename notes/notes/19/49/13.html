A man may have wealth, and may have his heart enlarged in love, thankfulness, and obedience, and may do good with it. Therefore it is not men's having riches that proves them to be worldly, but their setting their hearts upon them as the best things. Worldly men have only some floating thoughts of the things of God, while their fixed thoughts, their inward thoughts, are about the world; that lies nearest the heart. But with all their wealth they cannot save the life of the dearest friend they have. This looks further, to the eternal redemption to be wrought out by the Messiah. The redemption of the soul shall cost very dear; but, being once wrought, it shall never need to be repeated. And he, the Redeemer, shall rise again before he sees corruption, and then shall live for evermore, Re 1:18. This likewise shows the folly of worldly people, who sell their souls for that which will never buy them. With all their wealth they cannot secure themselves from the stroke of death. Yet one generation after another applaud their maxims; and the character of a fool, as drawn by heavenly Wisdom itself, Lu 12:16-21, continues to be followed even among professed Christians. Death will ask the proud sinner, Where is thy wealth, thy pomp? And in the morning of the resurrection, when all that sleep in the dust shall awake, the upright shall be advanced to the highest honour, when the wicked shall be filled with everlasting shame and contempt, Da 12:2. Let us now judge of things as they will appear in that day. The beauty of holiness is that alone which the grave cannot touch, or damage.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This their way is their folly - This might be rendered, "This is their way or course of life. It is their folly;" or, such is their folly. On the word "way," see the notes at <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>. The idea is, that it is folly for a man to cherish these hopes; to feel that wealth is of so much importance; to imagine that it can deliver from the grave; to suppose that he can perpetuate his own name, and secure his possessions in his own family upon the earth. And yet the world is still full of people as foolish as were those in the time of the psalmist; people who will not be admonished by the suggestions of reason, or by the experience of 6,000 years in the past. This is one thing in which the world makes no progress - in which it learns nothing from the experience of the past; and as the beaver under the influence of instinct builds his house and his home now in the same way that the first beaver did his, and as the brutes all act in the same manner from generation to generation, accumulating no knowledge, and making no advances from the experience of the past, so it is with people in their desire to grow rich. On other points the world accumulates knowledge, and profits from experience, garnering up the lessons taught by past experiment and observation, and thus becoming wiser in all other respects; but in regard to the desire of wealth, it makes no progress, gains no knowledge, derives no advantage, from the generations of fools that have lived and died in past ages. They now engage in the pursuit of gold with the same zeal, and the same expectation and hope which were evinced in the first ages of the world, and "as if" their own superior skill and wisdom could set at nought all the lessons taught by the past.<p>Yet their posterity - The coming generation is as confident and as foolish as the one that went before.<p>Approve their sayings - Margin, "delight in their mouth." That is, they delight or take pleasure in what proceeds from their mouth; in what they say; in their views of things. They adopt "their" principles, and act on "their" maxims; and, attaching the same importance to wealth which "they" did, seek as "they" sought to perpetuate their names upon the earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

Their life-path is essential folly. They are fools ingrain. From first to last brutishness is their characteristic, grovelling stupidity the leading trait of their conduct. "Yet their posterity approve their sayings." Those who follow them in descent follow them in folly, quote their worldly maxims, and accept their mad career as the most prudent mode of life. Why do they not see by their fathers' failure their fathers' folly? No, the race transmits its weakness. Grace is not hereditary, but sordid worldliness goes from generation to generation. The race of fools never dies out. No need of missionaries to teach men to be earthworms, they crawl naturally to the dust. "Selah."

Those who have to endure suffering from rich sinners have no need to fear, for the might and splendour of their oppressors is hastening towards destruction. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506; are days in which one experiences evil, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-13.htm">Psalm 94:13</a>, cf. <a href="/amos/6-3.htm">Amos 6:3</a>. The genitive r` is continued in <a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a> in a clause that is subordinate to the &#1489;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; of <a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a> (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/25-15.htm">1 Samuel 25:15</a>; <a href="/job/29-2.htm">Job 29:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-15.htm">Psalm 90:15</a>). The poet calls his crafty and malicious foes &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;. There is no necessity for reading &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497; as Bttcher does, since without doubt a participial noun &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, supplantator, can be formed from &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, supplantare; and although in its branchings out it coincides with &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, planta, its meaning is made secure by the connection. To render the passage: "when wickedness surrounds me about my heels," whether with or without changing &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; into &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; (Hupfeld, von Ortenberg), is proved on all sides to be inadmissible: it ought to have been &#1506;&#1493;&#1500; instead of &#1506;&#1493;&#1503;; but even then it would still be an awkward expression, "to surround any one's heels," <p>(Note: This might be avoided if it were possible for &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497; to mean "the sin that follows my heels, that follows me at the heels;" but apart from &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; being unsuitable with this interpretation, an impossible meaning is thereby extorted from the genitive construction. This, however, is perhaps what is meant by the expression of the lxx, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, so much spoken of in the Greek Church down to the present day.)<p>and the &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, which follows, would be unconnected with what precedes. This last word comes after &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;, giving minuteness to the description, and is then continued quite regularly in <a href="/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7</a> by the finite verb. Up to this point all is clear enough; but now the difficulties accumulate. One naturally expects the thought, that the rich man is not able to redeem himself from death. Instead of this it is said, that no man is able to redeem another from death. Ewald, Bttcher, and others, therefore, take &#1488;&#1495;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/18-10.htm">Ezekiel 18:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-20.htm">Ezekiel 21:20</a> (vid., Hitzig), to be a careless form of writing for &#1488;&#1498;, and change &#1497;&#1508;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; into the reflexive &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;; but the thought that is sought thus to be brought to is only then arrived at with great difficulty: the words ought to be &#1488;&#1498; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1508;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;. The words as they stand assert: a brother (&#1488;&#1495;, as a prominently placed object, with Rebia magnum,  equals  &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-18.htm">Ezekiel 18:18</a>; <a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>) can a man by no means redeem, i.e., men cannot redeem one another. Hengstenberg and Hitzig find the thought that is to be expected in <a href="/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>: the rich ungodly man can with all his riches not even redeem another (&#1488;&#1495;), much less then can he redeem himself, offer a &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; for himself. But if the poet meant to be so understood, he must have written &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;. <a href="/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a> and <a href="/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a> bear no appearance of referring to different persons; the second clause is, on the contrary, the necessary supplement of the first: Among men certainly it is possible under some circumstances for one who is delivered over to death to be freed by money, but no &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; ( equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/exodus/21-30.htm">Exodus 21:30</a> and frequently) can be given to God (&#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;).<p>All idea of the thought one would most naturally look for must therefore be given up, so far as it can be made clear why the poet has given no direct expression to it. And this can be done. The thought of a man's redeeming himself is far from the poet's mind; and the contrast which he has before his mind is this: no man can redeem another, Elohim only can redeem man. That one of his fellow-men cannot redeem a man, is expressed as strongly as possible by the words &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1508;&#1491;&#1492; &#1497;&#1508;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;; the negative in other instances stands after the intensive infinitive, but here, as in <a href="/genesis/3-4.htm">Genesis 3:4</a>; <a href="/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-28.htm">Isaiah 28:28</a>, before it. By an easy flight of irony, <a href="/psalms/49-9.htm">Psalm 49:9</a> says that the lu'tron which is required to be paid for the souls of men is too precious, i.e., exorbitant, or such as cannot be found, and that he (whoever might wish to lay it down) lets it alone (is obliged to let it alone) for ever  Thus much is clear enough, so far as the language is concerned (&#1493;&#1495;&#1491;&#1500; according to the consec. temp.  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;), and, although somewhat fully expressed, is perfectly in accordance with the connection. But how is <a href="/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a> attached to what precedes? Hengstenberg renders it, "he must for ever give it up, that he should live continually and not see the grave." But according to the syntax, &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; cannot be attached to &#1493;&#1495;&#1491;&#1500;, but only to the futures in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>, ranking with which the voluntative &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;, ut vivat (Ew. 347, a). Thus, therefore, nothing remains but to take <a href="/psalms/49-9.htm">Psalm 49:9</a> (which von Ortenberg expunges as a gloss upon <a href="/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>) as a parenthesis; the principal clause affirms that no man can give to God a ransom that shall protect another against death, so that this other should still continue (&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;) to live, and that without end (&#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495;), without seeing the grave, i.e., without being obliged to go down into the grave. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a> is now confirmatory of what is denied by its opposite; it is, therefore, according to the sense, imo (cf. <a href="/1_kings/21-15.htm">1 Kings 21:15</a>): ...that he may not see the grave - no indeed, without being able to interpose and alter it, he must see how all men, without distinction, succumb to death. Designedly the word used of the death of wise men is &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, and of the death of the fool and the stupid man, &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;. Kurtz renders: "together with the fool and the slow of understanding;"; but &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; as a proposition cannot be supported; moreover, &#1493;&#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; would then have "the wise" as its subject, which is surely not the intention of the poet. Everything without distinction, and in mingled confusion, falls a prey to death; the rich man must see it, and yet he is at the same time possessed by the foolish delusion that he, with his wealth, is immortal.<p>The reading &#1511;&#1489;&#1512;&#1501; (lxx, Targ., Syr.), preferred by Ewald, and the conjecture &#1511;&#1489;&#1512;&#1501;, adopted by Olshausen and Riehm, give a thought that is not altogether contrary to the connection, viz., the narrow grave is the eternal habitation of those who called broad lands their own; but this thought appears here, in view of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a>, too early. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; denotes the inward part, or that which is within, described according to that which encircles or contains it: that which is within them is, "their houses (pronounce ba&#772;tte&#772;mo) are for ever" (Hengstenberg, Hitzig); i.e., the contents of their inward part is the self-delusion that their houses are everlasting, and their habitations so durable that one generation after another will pass over them; cf. the similar style of expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>, <a href="/esther/5-7.htm">Esther 5:7</a>. Hitzig further renders: men celebrate their names in the lands; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, to call with a name  equals  solemnly to proclaim it, to mention any one's name with honour (<a href="/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a>). But it is unlikely that the subject of &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; should now again be any other than the rich men themselves; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; is contrary to the usage of the language. &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; is the earth as tillage, &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (only in this passage) in this connection, fields, estates, lands; the proclaiming of names is, according to <a href="/2_samuel/12-28.htm">2 Samuel 12:28</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-43.htm">1 Kings 8:43</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>, equivalent to the calling of the lands or estates after their (the possessors') names (B&#1510;ttcher, Hupfeld, Kurtz). The idea of the rich is, their houses and dwelling-places (and they themselves who have grown up together with them) are of eternal duration; accordingly they solemnly give their own names to their lands, as being the names of immortals. But, adds the poet, man &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512;, in the pomp of his riches and outward show, abideth not (non pernoctat  equals  non permanet). &#1489;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512; is the complement of the subject, although it logically (cf. <a href="/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13</a>) also belongs to &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;. Bttcher has shown the impropriety of reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; here according to <a href="/psalms/49-20.htm">Psalm 49:20</a>. There are other instances also of refrains that are not exact repetitions; and this correction is moreover at once overthrown by the fact that &#1489;&#1500; will not suit &#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;, it would stamp each man of rank, as such, as one deficient in intelligence. On the other hand, this emotional negative &#1489;&#1500; is admirably suitable to &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;: no indeed, he has no abiding. He is compared (&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; like the New Testament &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;), of like kind and lot, to cattle (&#1499;&#1468; as in <a href="/job/30-19.htm">Job 30:19</a>). &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; is an attributive clause to &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;: like heads of cattle which are cut off or destroyed. The verb is so chosen that it is appropriate at the same time to men who are likened to the beasts (<a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-7.htm">Hosea 10:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-15.htm">Hosea 10:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). </body></html>
