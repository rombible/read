The distinction of men's outward conditions, how great soever in life, makes none at death; but the difference of men's spiritual states, though in this life it may seem of small account, yet at and after death is very great. The soul is often put for the life. The God of life, who was its Creator at first, can and will be its Redeemer at last. It includes the salvation of the soul from eternal ruin. Believers will be under strong temptation to envy the prosperity of sinners. Men will praise thee, and cry thee up, as having done well for thyself in raising an estate and family. But what will it avail to be approved of men, if God condemn us? Those that are rich in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, have something of which death cannot strip them, nay, which death will improve; but as for worldly possessions, as we brought nothing into the world, so it is certain that we shall carry nothing out; we must leave all to others. The sum of the whole matter is, that it can profit a man nothing to gain the whole world, to become possessed of all its wealth and all its power, if he lose his own soul, and is cast away for want of that holy and heavenly wisdom which distinguishes man from the brutes, in his life and at his death. And are there men who can prefer the lot of the rich sinner to that of poor Lazarus, in life and death, and to eternity? Assuredly there are. What need then we have of the teaching of the Holy Ghost; when, with all our boasted powers, we are prone to such folly in the most important of all concerns!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be not thou afraid when one is made rich - Do not dread the power derived from wealth; do not fear anything which a man can do merely because he is rich. The original is, "when a "man" becomes rich." The allusion is not necessarily to a bad man, though that is implied in the whole passage, since there is no reason for fearing a "good" man, whether he is rich or poor. The only thing that seems to have been apprehended in the mind of the psalmist was that power of doing injury to others, or of employing means to injure others, which wealth confers on a bad man. The psalmist here changes the form of the expression, no longer referring to himself, and to his own feelings, as in the former part of the psalm, but making an application of the whole course of thought to others, showing them, as the result of his own reflection and observation, that no man had any real cause for dread and alarm when riches increased in the hands of the wicked. The reasons why this power should not be feared are stated in the following verses.<p>When the glory of his house is increased - Rich people often lavish much of their wealth on their dwellings; on the dwelling itself; on the furniture; on the grounds and appendages of their habitation. This is evidently referred to here as "the "glory" of their house;" as that which would be adapted to make an impression of the power and rank of its possessor. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-19. applies this instruction.

"Be not thou afraid when one is made rich." Let it not give thee any concern to see the godless prosper. Raise no questions as to divine justice; suffer no foreboding to cloud thy mind. Temporal prosperity is too small a matter to be worth fretting about; let the dogs have their bones, and the swine their draft. "When the glory of his house is increased." Though the sinner and his family are in great esteem, and stand exceedingly high, never mind; all things will be righted in due time. Only those whose judgment is worthless will esteem men the more because their lands are broader; those who are highly estimated for such unreasonable reasons will find their level ere long, when truth and righteousness come to the fore.<p><a href="/psalms/49-17.htm">Psalm 49:17</a><p>"For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away." He has but a leasehold of his acres, and death ends his tenure. Through the river of death man must pass naked. Not a rag of all his raiment, not a coin of all his treasure, not a jot of all his honour, can the dying worldling carry with him. Why then fret ourselves about so fleeting a prosperity? "His glory shall not descend after him." As he goes down, down, down for ever, none of his honours or possessions will follow him. Patents of nobility are invalid in the sepulchre. His worship, his honour, his lordship, and his grace, will alike find their titles ridiculous in the tomb. Hell knows no aristocracy. Your dainty and delicate sinners shall find that eternal burnings have no respect for their affectations and refinements.<p><a href="/psalms/49-18.htm">Psalm 49:18</a><p>"Though while he lived he blessed his soul." He pronounced himself happy. He had his good things in this life. His chief end and aim were to bless himself. He was charmed with the adulations of flatterers. "Men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself." The generality of men worship success, however it may be gained. The colour of the winning horse is no matter; it is the winner, and that is enough. "Take care of Number One," is the world's proverbial philosophy, and he who gives good heed to it is "a clever fellow," "a fine man of business," "a shrewd common-sense tradesman," "a man with his head put on the right way," Get money, and you will be "respectable," "a substantial man," and your house will be "an eminent firm in the city," or "one of our best county families." To do good wins fame in heaven, but to do good to yourself is the prudent thing among men of the world. Yet not a whisper of worldly congratulation can follow the departing millionaire; they say he died worth a mint of money, but what charm has that fact to the dull cold ear of death? The banker rots as fast as the shoe-black, and the peer becomes as putrid as the pauper. Alas! poor wealth, thou art but the rainbow colouring of the bubble, the tint which yellows the morning mist, but adds no substance to it.<p><a href="/psalms/49-19.htm">Psalm 49:19</a><p>"He shall go to the generation of his fathers." Where the former generations lie, the present shall also slumber. The sires beckon to their sons to come to the land of forgetfulness. Mortal fathers beget not immortal children. As our ancestors have departed, so also must we. "They shall never see light." To this upper region the dead worldling shall never return again to possess his estates, and enjoy his dignities. Among the dead he must lie in the thick darkness, where no joy or hope can come to him. Of all his treasures their remains not enough to furnish him one poor candle; the blaze of his glory is out forever, and not a spark remains to cheer him. How then can we look with fear or envy upon a wretch doomed to such unhappiness?<p><a href="/psalms/49-20.htm">Psalm 49:20</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/49.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Afraid, </span> i.e. discouraged or dejected.

Those who have to endure suffering from rich sinners have no need to fear, for the might and splendour of their oppressors is hastening towards destruction. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506; are days in which one experiences evil, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-13.htm">Psalm 94:13</a>, cf. <a href="/amos/6-3.htm">Amos 6:3</a>. The genitive r` is continued in <a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a> in a clause that is subordinate to the &#1489;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; of <a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a> (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/25-15.htm">1 Samuel 25:15</a>; <a href="/job/29-2.htm">Job 29:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-15.htm">Psalm 90:15</a>). The poet calls his crafty and malicious foes &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;. There is no necessity for reading &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497; as Bttcher does, since without doubt a participial noun &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, supplantator, can be formed from &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, supplantare; and although in its branchings out it coincides with &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, planta, its meaning is made secure by the connection. To render the passage: "when wickedness surrounds me about my heels," whether with or without changing &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; into &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; (Hupfeld, von Ortenberg), is proved on all sides to be inadmissible: it ought to have been &#1506;&#1493;&#1500; instead of &#1506;&#1493;&#1503;; but even then it would still be an awkward expression, "to surround any one's heels," <p>(Note: This might be avoided if it were possible for &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497; to mean "the sin that follows my heels, that follows me at the heels;" but apart from &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; being unsuitable with this interpretation, an impossible meaning is thereby extorted from the genitive construction. This, however, is perhaps what is meant by the expression of the lxx, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, so much spoken of in the Greek Church down to the present day.)<p>and the &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, which follows, would be unconnected with what precedes. This last word comes after &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;, giving minuteness to the description, and is then continued quite regularly in <a href="/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7</a> by the finite verb. Up to this point all is clear enough; but now the difficulties accumulate. One naturally expects the thought, that the rich man is not able to redeem himself from death. Instead of this it is said, that no man is able to redeem another from death. Ewald, Bttcher, and others, therefore, take &#1488;&#1495;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/18-10.htm">Ezekiel 18:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-20.htm">Ezekiel 21:20</a> (vid., Hitzig), to be a careless form of writing for &#1488;&#1498;, and change &#1497;&#1508;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; into the reflexive &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;; but the thought that is sought thus to be brought to is only then arrived at with great difficulty: the words ought to be &#1488;&#1498; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1508;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;. The words as they stand assert: a brother (&#1488;&#1495;, as a prominently placed object, with Rebia magnum,  equals  &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-18.htm">Ezekiel 18:18</a>; <a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>) can a man by no means redeem, i.e., men cannot redeem one another. Hengstenberg and Hitzig find the thought that is to be expected in <a href="/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>: the rich ungodly man can with all his riches not even redeem another (&#1488;&#1495;), much less then can he redeem himself, offer a &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; for himself. But if the poet meant to be so understood, he must have written &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;. <a href="/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a> and <a href="/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a> bear no appearance of referring to different persons; the second clause is, on the contrary, the necessary supplement of the first: Among men certainly it is possible under some circumstances for one who is delivered over to death to be freed by money, but no &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; ( equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/exodus/21-30.htm">Exodus 21:30</a> and frequently) can be given to God (&#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;).<p>All idea of the thought one would most naturally look for must therefore be given up, so far as it can be made clear why the poet has given no direct expression to it. And this can be done. The thought of a man's redeeming himself is far from the poet's mind; and the contrast which he has before his mind is this: no man can redeem another, Elohim only can redeem man. That one of his fellow-men cannot redeem a man, is expressed as strongly as possible by the words &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1508;&#1491;&#1492; &#1497;&#1508;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;; the negative in other instances stands after the intensive infinitive, but here, as in <a href="/genesis/3-4.htm">Genesis 3:4</a>; <a href="/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-28.htm">Isaiah 28:28</a>, before it. By an easy flight of irony, <a href="/psalms/49-9.htm">Psalm 49:9</a> says that the lu'tron which is required to be paid for the souls of men is too precious, i.e., exorbitant, or such as cannot be found, and that he (whoever might wish to lay it down) lets it alone (is obliged to let it alone) for ever  Thus much is clear enough, so far as the language is concerned (&#1493;&#1495;&#1491;&#1500; according to the consec. temp.  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;), and, although somewhat fully expressed, is perfectly in accordance with the connection. But how is <a href="/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a> attached to what precedes? Hengstenberg renders it, "he must for ever give it up, that he should live continually and not see the grave." But according to the syntax, &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; cannot be attached to &#1493;&#1495;&#1491;&#1500;, but only to the futures in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>, ranking with which the voluntative &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;, ut vivat (Ew. 347, a). Thus, therefore, nothing remains but to take <a href="/psalms/49-9.htm">Psalm 49:9</a> (which von Ortenberg expunges as a gloss upon <a href="/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>) as a parenthesis; the principal clause affirms that no man can give to God a ransom that shall protect another against death, so that this other should still continue (&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;) to live, and that without end (&#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495;), without seeing the grave, i.e., without being obliged to go down into the grave. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a> is now confirmatory of what is denied by its opposite; it is, therefore, according to the sense, imo (cf. <a href="/1_kings/21-15.htm">1 Kings 21:15</a>): ...that he may not see the grave - no indeed, without being able to interpose and alter it, he must see how all men, without distinction, succumb to death. Designedly the word used of the death of wise men is &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, and of the death of the fool and the stupid man, &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;. Kurtz renders: "together with the fool and the slow of understanding;"; but &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; as a proposition cannot be supported; moreover, &#1493;&#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; would then have "the wise" as its subject, which is surely not the intention of the poet. Everything without distinction, and in mingled confusion, falls a prey to death; the rich man must see it, and yet he is at the same time possessed by the foolish delusion that he, with his wealth, is immortal.<p>The reading &#1511;&#1489;&#1512;&#1501; (lxx, Targ., Syr.), preferred by Ewald, and the conjecture &#1511;&#1489;&#1512;&#1501;, adopted by Olshausen and Riehm, give a thought that is not altogether contrary to the connection, viz., the narrow grave is the eternal habitation of those who called broad lands their own; but this thought appears here, in view of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a>, too early. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; denotes the inward part, or that which is within, described according to that which encircles or contains it: that which is within them is, "their houses (pronounce ba&#772;tte&#772;mo) are for ever" (Hengstenberg, Hitzig); i.e., the contents of their inward part is the self-delusion that their houses are everlasting, and their habitations so durable that one generation after another will pass over them; cf. the similar style of expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>, <a href="/esther/5-7.htm">Esther 5:7</a>. Hitzig further renders: men celebrate their names in the lands; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, to call with a name  equals  solemnly to proclaim it, to mention any one's name with honour (<a href="/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a>). But it is unlikely that the subject of &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; should now again be any other than the rich men themselves; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; is contrary to the usage of the language. &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; is the earth as tillage, &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (only in this passage) in this connection, fields, estates, lands; the proclaiming of names is, according to <a href="/2_samuel/12-28.htm">2 Samuel 12:28</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-43.htm">1 Kings 8:43</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>, equivalent to the calling of the lands or estates after their (the possessors') names (B&#1510;ttcher, Hupfeld, Kurtz). The idea of the rich is, their houses and dwelling-places (and they themselves who have grown up together with them) are of eternal duration; accordingly they solemnly give their own names to their lands, as being the names of immortals. But, adds the poet, man &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512;, in the pomp of his riches and outward show, abideth not (non pernoctat  equals  non permanet). &#1489;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512; is the complement of the subject, although it logically (cf. <a href="/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13</a>) also belongs to &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;. Bttcher has shown the impropriety of reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; here according to <a href="/psalms/49-20.htm">Psalm 49:20</a>. There are other instances also of refrains that are not exact repetitions; and this correction is moreover at once overthrown by the fact that &#1489;&#1500; will not suit &#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;, it would stamp each man of rank, as such, as one deficient in intelligence. On the other hand, this emotional negative &#1489;&#1500; is admirably suitable to &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;: no indeed, he has no abiding. He is compared (&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; like the New Testament &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;), of like kind and lot, to cattle (&#1499;&#1468; as in <a href="/job/30-19.htm">Job 30:19</a>). &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; is an attributive clause to &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;: like heads of cattle which are cut off or destroyed. The verb is so chosen that it is appropriate at the same time to men who are likened to the beasts (<a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-7.htm">Hosea 10:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-15.htm">Hosea 10:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). </body></html>
