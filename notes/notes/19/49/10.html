A man may have wealth, and may have his heart enlarged in love, thankfulness, and obedience, and may do good with it. Therefore it is not men's having riches that proves them to be worldly, but their setting their hearts upon them as the best things. Worldly men have only some floating thoughts of the things of God, while their fixed thoughts, their inward thoughts, are about the world; that lies nearest the heart. But with all their wealth they cannot save the life of the dearest friend they have. This looks further, to the eternal redemption to be wrought out by the Messiah. The redemption of the soul shall cost very dear; but, being once wrought, it shall never need to be repeated. And he, the Redeemer, shall rise again before he sees corruption, and then shall live for evermore, Re 1:18. This likewise shows the folly of worldly people, who sell their souls for that which will never buy them. With all their wealth they cannot secure themselves from the stroke of death. Yet one generation after another applaud their maxims; and the character of a fool, as drawn by heavenly Wisdom itself, Lu 12:16-21, continues to be followed even among professed Christians. Death will ask the proud sinner, Where is thy wealth, thy pomp? And in the morning of the resurrection, when all that sleep in the dust shall awake, the upright shall be advanced to the highest honour, when the wicked shall be filled with everlasting shame and contempt, Da 12:2. Let us now judge of things as they will appear in that day. The beauty of holiness is that alone which the grave cannot touch, or damage.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he seeth that wise men die - He must see this; he does see it. He perceives that no one can be saved from death. It comes on all alike - the wise and the unwise. Nothing saves from it. The allusion is here especially to the "rich," whether "they" are wise or whether they are fools and "brutish." The simple fact, as stated, is that no matter what may be the character of the man of wealth, whether wise or foolish, he must certainly die His wealth cannot save him from the grave. The possessor of wealth himself "sees" this. It cannot be concealed from him.<p>Likewise the fool - The rich man who is a fool, or who is destitute of wisdom. He who is rich and who is wise - wise in the things of this life and wise unto salvation - (or who is gifted with a high degree of intelligence and who evinces wisdom in respect to the higher matters of existence) - and the rich man who is a fool - (who is regardless of his highest interests, and who evinces no special intelligence, though possessed of wealth) - all, all die alike.<p>And the brutish person - The rich man who is stupid and dull; who lives like a brute; who lives to eat and drink; who lives for gross sensuality - "he" dies as well as he who is wise. Wealth cannot in either case save from death. Whether connected with wisdom or folly - whether carefully husbanded or lavishly spent - whether a man employs it in the highest and noblest manner in which it can be devoted, or in the indulgence of the most low and debasing enjoyments - it is alike powerless in saving people from the grave.<p>And leave their wealth to others - It all passes into other hands. It "must" be so left. It cannot be carried away by its possessor when he goes into the eternal world. It not only cannot save him from the grave, but he cannot even take it with him. All his houses, his lands, his title-deeds, his silver, his gold, his parks, gardens, horses, hounds - all that he had accumulated with so much care, and worshipped with so idolatrous an affection, is not even his own in the sense that he can take it with him. The title passes absolutely into other hands, and even if he could come back to earth again, he could no longer claim it, for when he dies it ceases to be his forever. How powerless, then, is wealth in reference to the great purposes of human existence! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

This is a reason convincing the rich man, that with all his riches he cannot redeem his brother from death; since he must see, by daily and constant experience, that none are exempted from dying, no, not even the wise man; and therefore, not the rich, since wisdom is better than riches, and is said to give life, <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>; and yet wise men die, yea, Solomon, the wisest of men, died. Worldly wise men, such who are wiser in their generation than the children of light, know how, to get money and estates, and to provide for futurity, and yet cannot secure themselves from death: men that are wise in natural things, know the secrets of nature, the constitution of human bodies, what is proper to preserve health and life, as philosophers and physicians, and yet cannot deliver themselves from death: wise politicians, prudent magistrates, instructors of mankind in all the branches of useful knowledge, who are profitable to themselves and others, and are the most deserving to live because of usefulness, yet these die as well as others: such as are spiritually wise, wise unto salvation, who know themselves, and know Christ, whom to know is life eternal; and the wisest among them, such as are capable of teaching others the hidden and mysterious wisdom of God; even these wise men and prophets do not live for ever. The Targum interprets this of wicked wise men, condemned to hell; or as it is in the king's Bible, <p>"the wicked wise men, who die the second death;'' <p>see <a href="/revelation/2-11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>; and are condemned to hell; <p>likewise the fool and the brutish person perish; the worldly fool, who trusts in his riches, and boasts of them; his soul is at once required of him. The atheistical fool, who says there is no God, no judgment, no future state; has made a covenant with death, and with hell is at an agreement; this covenant does not stand, he dies, and finds himself dreadfully mistaken: the fool that is so immorally, who makes a mock at sin, a jest of religion, and puts away the evil day far from him; his great wickedness, to which he is given, shall not deliver him from death. Every man is become brutish in his knowledge; but there are some among the people more brutish than others, who are as natural brute beasts, and shall utterly perish in their own corruptions. The wise good man dies, but perishes not; he inherits eternal life; but the wicked fool and brute not only perish by death, but are punished with everlasting destruction in soul and body; <p>and leave their wealth to others; they cannot carry it with them, so that it will be of no service to them after death any more than at it: if the Judge could be bribed by gold, as he cannot, they will not have it with them to do it; they came into the world naked, and so they will go out, and carry nothing with them, but leave all behind them; either to their babes, their children, and heirs, <a href="/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a>; or to strangers, they know not who; and if they do, they do not know whether they will be wise men or fools, or what use they will make of it, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/49.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he seeth <i>that</i> wise men <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> others.</span><p>(f) In that that death makes no difference between the persons.<p>(g) That is, not to their children, but to strangers.

The point of course is not that they can pass on their property to their heirs, but that they must themselves surrender it. Wealth can neither prolong life, nor be retained by its owner at death.

No one is redeemed from death, in the sense of escaping "the first death." Not only do "the fool and the brutish person" perish, but the fate of "the wise" is the same.

Very similarly do the elder (in the reign of Jehoshaphat) and the younger Micha (Micah) introduce their prophecies (<a href="/1_kings/22-28.htm">1 Kings 22:28</a>; <a href="/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a>); and Elihu in the Book of Job his didactic discourses (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-2.htm">Psalm 34:2</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>). It is an universal theme which the poet intends to take up, hence he calls upon all peoples and all the inhabitants of the &#1495;&#1500;&#1491;. Such is the word first of all for this temporal life, which glides by unnoticed, them for the present transitory world itself (vid., on <a href="/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a>). It is his intention to declare to the rich the utter nothingness or vanity of their false ground of hope, and to the poor the superiority of their true ground of hope; hence he wishes to have as hearers both &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, children of the common people, who are men and have otherwise nothing distinctive about them, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, children of men, i.e., of rank and distinction (vid., on <a href="/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>) - rich and poor, as he adds to make his meaning more clear. For his mouth will, or shall, utter &#1492;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, not: all sorts of wise teachings, but: weighty wisdom. Just in like manner &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; signifies profound insight or understanding; cf. plurals like &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/27-11.htm">Isaiah 27:11</a>, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, <a href="/psalms/42-12.htm">Psalm 42:12</a> and frequently, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="/jeremiah/22-21.htm">Jeremiah 22:21</a>. The parallel word &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; in the passage before us, and the plural predicate in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/24-7.htm">Proverbs 24:7</a>, show that &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, here and in <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>, is not to be regarded, with Hitzig, Olshausen, and others, as another form of the singular &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;.
