Let all hear this with application to ourselves. The poor are in danger from undue desire toward the wealth of the world, as rich people from undue delight in it. The psalmist begins with applying it to himself, and that is the right method in which to treat of Divine things. Before he sets down the folly of carnal security, he lays down, from his own experience, the benefit and comfort of a holy, gracious security, which they enjoy who trust in God, and not in their worldly wealth. In the day of judgment, the iniquity of our heels, or of our steps, our past sins, will compass us. In those days, worldly, wicked people will be afraid; but wherefore should a man fear death who has God with him?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear this, all ye people - That is, What I am about; to utter is worthy of universal attention; it pertains equally to all mankind.

All are called to hear what interests all.<p>world&#8212;literally, "duration of life," the present time.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/49.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world;<p>2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.<p>3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.<p>4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.<p>In these four verses the poet-prophet calls universal humanity to listen to his didactic hymn.<p><a href="/psalms/49-1.htm">Psalm 49:1</a><p>"Hear this, all ye people." All men are concerned in the subject, it is of them, and therefore to them that the Psalmist would speak. It is not a topic which men delight to consider, and therefore he who would instruct them must press them to give ear. Where, as in this case, the theme claims to be wisdom and understanding, attention is very properly demanded; and when the style combines the sententiousness of the proverb with the sweetness of poesy, interest is readily excited. "Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world." "He that hath ears to hear let him hear." Men dwelling in all climes are equally concerned in the subject, for the laws of providence are the same in all lands. It is wise for each one to feel I am a man, and therefore everything which concerns mortals has a personal interest to me. We must all appear before the judgment-seat, and therefore we all should give earnest heed to holy admonition which may help us to prepare for that dread event. He who refuses to receive instruction by the ear, will not be able to escape receiving destruction by it when the Judge shall say, "Depart, ye cursed."<p><a href="/psalms/49-2.htm">Psalm 49:2</a><p>"Both low and high, rich and poor, together." Sons of great men, and children of mean men, men of large estate, and ye who pine in poverty, ye are all bidden to hear the inspired minstrel as he touches his harp to a mournful but instructive lay. The low will be encouraged, the high will be warned, the rich will be sobered, the poor consoled, there will be a useful lesson for each if they are willing to learn it. Our preaching ought to have a voice for all classes, and all should have an ear for it. To suit our word to the rich alone is wicked sycophancy, and to aim only at pleasing the poor is to act the part of a demagogue. Truth may be so spoken as to command the ear of all, and wise men seek to learn that acceptable style. Rich and poor must soon meet together in the grave, they may well be content to meet together now. In the congregation of the dead all differences of rank will be obliterated, they ought not now to be obstructions to united instructions.<p><a href="/psalms/49-3.htm">Psalm 49:3</a><p>"My mouth shall speak of wisdom." Inspired and therefore lifted beyond himself, the prophet is not praising his own attainments, but extolling the divine Spirit which spoke in him. He knew that the Spirit of truth and wisdom spoke through him. He who is not sure that his matter is good has no right to ask a hearing. "And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding." The same Spirit who made the ancient seers eloquent, also made them thoughtful. The help of the Holy Ghost was never meant to supersede the use of our own mental powers. The Holy Spirit does not make us speak as Balaam's ass, which merely uttered sounds, but never meditated; but he first leads us to consider and reflect, and then he gives us the tongue of fire to speak with power.<p><a href="/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a><p>"I will incline mine ear to a parable." He who would have others hear, begins by hearing himself. As the minstrel leans his ear to his harp, so must the preacher give his whole soul to his ministry. The truth came to the Psalmist as a parable, and he endeavoured to unriddle it for popular use; he would not leave the truth in obscurity, but he listened to its voice till he so well understood it as to be able to interpret and translate it into the common language of the multitude. Still of necessity it would remain a problem, and a dark saying to the unenlightened many, but this would not be the songster's fault, for, saith he, "I will open my dark saying upon the harp." The writer was no mystic, delighting in deep and cloudy things, yet he was not afraid of the most profound topics; he tried to open the treasures of darkness, and to uplift pearls from the deep. To win attention he cast his proverbial philosophy into the form of song, and tuned his harp to the solemn tone of his subject. Let us gather round the minstrel of the King of kings, and hear the Psalm which erst was led by the chief musician, as the chorus of the sons of Korah lifted up their voices in the temple. <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm is penned upon the same occasion with <span class="bld">Psalm 39 Psa 73</span>, to wit, upon the contemplation of the afflictions of God’s people and of the prosperity and glory of ungodly men The design is to justify God’s providence in this dark dispensation, and to show that, all things being considered, good men have no cause for immoderate dejection of spirit, nor wicked men for glorying in their present felicities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The psalmist having stirred up all men to attention, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/49-1.htm" title="Hear this, all you people; give ear, all you inhabitants of the world:...">Psalm 49:1-5</a></span>, showeth their vain trust in riches, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/psalms/49-6.htm" title="They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;...">Psalm 49:6-14</a></span>; and the contrary trust of the faithful in God, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/49-15.htm" title="But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me.
