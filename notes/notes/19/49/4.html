Let all hear this with application to ourselves. The poor are in danger from undue desire toward the wealth of the world, as rich people from undue delight in it. The psalmist begins with applying it to himself, and that is the right method in which to treat of Divine things. Before he sets down the folly of carnal security, he lays down, from his own experience, the benefit and comfort of a holy, gracious security, which they enjoy who trust in God, and not in their worldly wealth. In the day of judgment, the iniquity of our heels, or of our steps, our past sins, will compass us.

Compare <a href="/psalms/5-1.htm">Psalm 5:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/17-1.htm">Psalm 17:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/39-12.htm">Psalm 39:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>.

Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/13-12.htm">Job 13:12</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/27-1.htm">Job 27:1</a>, note. The word properly means similitude; then, a sentence, sententious saying, apophthegm; then, a proverb; then, a song or poem. There is usually found in the word some idea of "comparison," and hence, usually something that is to be illustrated "by" a comparison or a story. The reference here would seem to be to some dark or obscure subject which needed to be illustrated; which it was not easy to understand; which had given the writer, as well as others, perplexity and difficulty. He proposed now, with a view to understand and explain it, to place his ear, as it were, "close to the matter," that he might clearly comprehend it. The matter was difficult, but he felt assured he could explain it - as when one unfolds the meaning of an enigma. The "problem" - the "parable" - the difficult point - related to the right use, or the proper value, of wealth, or the estimate in which it should be held by those who possessed it, and by those who did not. It was very evident to the author of the psalm that the views of people were not right on the subject; he therefore proposed to examine the matter carefully, and to state the exact truth.<p>I will open - I will explain; I will communicate the result of my careful inquiries.<p>My dark saying - The word used here - &#1495;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;  ch&#305;&#770;yda&#770;h - is rendered "dark speeches" in <a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>; "riddle," in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12-19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2</a>; "hard questions" in <a href="/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-1.htm">2 Chronicles 9:1</a>; "dark saying" (as here) in <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/1-6.htm">Proverbs 1:6</a>; "dark sentences," in <a href="/daniel/8-23.htm">Daniel 8:23</a>; and "proverb" in <a href="/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>. It does not elsewhere occur. It means properly "something entangled, intricate;" then, a trick or stratagem; then art intricate speech, a riddle; then, a sententious saying, a maxim; then a parable, a poem, a song, a proverb. The idea here is, that the point was intricate or obscure; it was not well understood, and he purposed "to lay it open," and to make it plain.<p>Upon the harp - On the meaning of the word used here, see the notes at <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>. The idea here is, that he would accompany the explanation with music, or would so express it that it might be accompanied with music; that is, he would give it a poetic form - a form such that the sentiment might be used in public worship, and might be impressed upon the mind by all the force and power which music would impart. Sentiments of purity and truth, and sentiments of pollution and falsehood also, are always most deeply imbedded in the minds of people, and are made most enduring and effective, when they are connected with music. Thus the sentiments of patriotism are perpetuated and impressed in song; and thus sentiments of sensuality and pollution owe much of their permanence and power to the fact that they are expressed in corrupt verse, and that they are perpetuated in exquisite poetry, and are accompanied with song. Scenes of revelry, as well as acts of devotion, are kept up by song. Religion proposes to take advantage of this principle in our nature by connecting the sentiments of piety with the sweetness of verse, and by impressing and perpetuating those sentiments through associating them with all that is tender, pure, and inspiriting in music. Hence, music, both vocal and that which is produced by instruments, has always been found to be an invaluable auxiliary in securing the proper impression of truth on the minds of people, as well as in giving utterance to the sentiments of piety in devotion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. incline&#8212;to hear attentively (Ps 17:6; 31:2).<p>parable&#8212;In Hebrew and Greek "parable" and "proverb" are translations of the same word. It denotes a comparison, or form of speech, which under one image includes many, and is expressive of a general truth capable of various illustrations. Hence it may be used for the illustration itself. For the former sense, "proverb" (that is, one word for several) is the usual English term, and for the latter, in which comparison is prominent, "parable" (that is, one thing laid by another). The distinction is not always observed, since here, and in Ps 78:2; "proverb" would better express the style of the composition (compare also Pr 26:7, 9; Hab 2:6; Joh 16:25, 29). Such forms of speech are often very figurative and also obscure (compare Mt 13:12-15). Hence the use of the parallel word&#8212;<p>dark saying&#8212;or, "riddle" (compare Eze 17:2).<p>open&#8212;is to explain.<p>upon the harp&#8212;the accompaniment for a lyric.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/49.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I will incline mine ear:</span> this is another argument to persuade them to hearken to him: I will hearken what God by his Spirit speaks to me, and that and nothing else will I now speak to you; and therefore it is well worth your hearing.

Baba kamma 81b, to cut through (a vineyard in a part where there is no way leading through it); the signification "to take to pieces and examine, to contemplate piece by piece," has no support in the usage of the language, and the signification "to extol" (erhhen, Luther following Jewish tradition) rests upon a false deduction from the name &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;.

The rendering of Mendelssohn, Stier, and others, "over death" i.e., beyond death (Syriac), would be better; more accurately: beyond dying  equals  destruction (Bunsen, Bibelwerk, Th. i. S. clxi.). but the expression does not admit of this extension, and the thought comes upon one unexpectedly and as a surprise in this Psalm belonging to the time before the Exile. The Jerusalem Talmud, Megilla, ch. ii.((fol. 73, col. b, ed. Venet.), present a choice of the following interpretations: (1) &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, in youthfulness, adopting which, but somewhat differently applied, the Targum renders, "in the days of youth;" (2) &#1499;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, like virgins, with which Luther's rendering coincides: like youth (wie die Jugent); (3) according to the reading &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, which the lxx also reproduces: in this and the future world, noting at the same time that Akilas (Aquila) translates the word by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;: "in a world where there is no death." But in connection with this last rendering one would rather expect to find &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="/proverbs/12-28.htm">Proverbs 12:28</a>) instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;. &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, however, as equivalent to &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; is Mishnic, not Biblical; and a Hebrew word &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;) in the sense of the Aramaic &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468; cannot be justified elsewhere. We see from the wavering of the MSS, some of which give &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, and others &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, and from the wavering of expositors, what little success is likely to follow any attempt to gain for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, as a substantial part of the Psalm, any sense that is secure and in accordance both with the genius of the language and with the context. Probably it is a marginal note of the melody, an abbreviation for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, <a href="/psalms/9-1.htm">Psalm 9:1</a>. And either this note, as in <a href="/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a> &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, stands in an exceptional manner at the end instead of the beginning (Hitzig, Reggio), or it belongs to the &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495; of the following Psalm, and is to be inserted there (Bttcher, De inferis, 371). If, however, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; does not belong to the Psalm itself, then it must be assumed that the proper closing words are lost. The original close was probably more full-toned, and somewhat like <a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>. </body></html>
