Not only he should be superior to all the kings of the earth, but he then existed in glory as the eternal Son of God. Sitting is a resting posture: after services and sufferings, to give law, to give judgment. It is a remaining posture: he sits like a king for ever. All his enemies are now in a chain, but not yet made his footstool. And his kingdom, being set up, shall be kept up in the world, in despite of all the powers of darkness. Christ's people are a willing people. The power of the Spirit, going with the power of the world, to the people of Christs, is effectual to make them willing. They shall attend him in the beautiful attire of holiness; which becomes his house for ever. And he shall have many devoted to him. The dew of our youth, even in the morning of our days, ought to be consecrated to our Lord Jesus. Christ shall not only be a King, but a Priest. He is God's Minister to us, and our Advocate with the Father, and so is the Mediator between God and man. He is a Priest of the order of Melchizedek, which was before that of Aaron, and on many accounts superior to it, and a more lively representation of Christ's priesthood. Christ's sitting at the right hand of God, speaks as much terror to his enemies as happiness to his people. The effect of this victory shall be the utter ruin of his enemies. We have here the Redeemer saving his friends, and comforting them. He shall be humbled; he shall drink of the brook in the way. The wrath of God, running in the curse of the law, may be considered as the brook in the way of his undertaking. Christ drank of the waters of affliction in his way to the throne of glory. But he shall be exalted. What then are we? Has the gospel of Christ been to us the power of God unto salvation? Has his kingdom been set up in our hearts? Are we his willing subjects? Once we knew not our need of his salvation, and we were not willing that he should reign over us. Are we willing to give up every sin, to turn from a wicked, insnaring world, and rely only on his merits and mercy, to have him for our Prophet, Priest, and King? and do we desire to be holy? To those who are thus changed, the Saviour's sacrifice, intercession, and blessing belong.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/110.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord hath sworn - He has confirmed the appointment of the Messiah by a solemn oath, or as by an oath. That is, It is as sure and fixed as if he had taken an oath. Compare <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>. The "time," so to speak, if the word time can be applied to transactions in a past eternity, was that when he was designated in the divine purpose as Messiah; in the eternal counsels of God. Compare <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>.<p>And will not repent - Will not change his purpose.<p>Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek - The word rendered "order" here means properly a word, a thing, a matter; hence, a way or manner. The meaning here is, that he would be a priest "after the manner" of Melchizedek; or, such a priest as he was. He would not be of the tribe of Levi; he would not be in the regular line of the priesthood, but he would resemble, in the characteristics of his office, this ancient priest-king, combining in himself the two functions of priest and king; as a priest, standing alone; not deriving his authority from any line of predecessors; and having no successors. See this verse explained at length, in its application to the Messiah, in the notes at <a href="/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6</a> (note), <a href="/hebrews/5-10.htm">Hebrews 5:10</a> (note); <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1-3</a> (note). The passage as it stands here, and as looked at without any reference to the use made of it in the New Testament, would imply these things:<p>(1) That he who was spoken of would be, in a proper sense, a priest.<p>(2) that he would have a perpetual or permanent priesthood - "forever."<p>(3) that he would not be of the established line of priests in the tribe of Levi, but that his appointment would be unusual and extraordinary.<p>(4) that the appointment would come directly from God, and would not be "derived" from those who went before him.<p>(5) that as a priest he would "resemble" Melchizedek, according to the record which was found of Melchizedek in Genesis.<p>(6) that as Melchizedek was a priest of the Most High God, so he would be.<p>(7) that as Melchizedek combined in himself the functions of both priest and king, so these would be found in him.<p>(8) that as Melchizedek had no successors in office, so he would have none.<p>How far these things were applicable to the Lord Jesus Christ, and with what propriety the passage might be applied to him, may be seen by examining the Epistle to the Hebrews, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5-7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/110.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

Our Lord Jesus is a Priest-King by the ancient oath of Jehovah: "he glorified not himself to be made a high priest," but was ordained thereunto from of old, and was called of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. It must be a solemn and a sure matter which leads the Eternal to swear, and with him an oath fixes and settles the decree for ever; but in this case, as if to make assurance a thousand times sure, it is added, "and will not repent." It is done, and done for ever and ever; Jesus is sworn in to be the priest of his people, and he must abide so even to the end, because his commission is sealed by the unchanging oath of the immutable Jehovah. If his priesthood could be revoked, and his authority removed, it would be the end of all hope and life for the people whom he loves; but this sure rock is the basis of our security - the oath of God establishes our glorious Lord both in his priesthood and in his throne. It is the Lord who has constituted him a priest for ever, he has done it by oath, that oath is without repentance, is taking effect now, and will stand throughout all ages: hence our security in him is placed beyond all question.<p>The declaration runs in the present tense as being the only time with the Lord, and comprehending all other times. "Thou art," i.e., thou wast and art, and art to come, in all ages a priestly King. The order of Melchizedek's priesthood was the most ancient and primitive, the most free from ritual and ceremony, the most natural and simple, and at the same time the most honourable. That ancient patriarch was the father of his people, and at the same time ruled and taught them; he swayed both the sceptre and the censer, reigned in righteousness, and offered sacrifice before the Lord. There has never arisen another like to him since his days, for whenever the kings of Judah attempted to seize the sacerdotal office they were driven back to their confusion; God would have no king-priest save his son. Melchizedek's office was exceptional; none preceded or succeeded him; he comes upon the page of history mysteriously; no pedigree is given, no date of birth, or mention of death; he blesses Abraham, receives tithe, and vanishes from the scene amid honours which show that he was greater than the founder of the chosen nation. He is seen but once, and that once suffices. Aaron and his seed came and went; their imperfect sacrifice continued for many generations, because it had no finality in it, and could never make the comers thereunto perfect. Our Lord Jesus, like Melchizedek, stands forth before us as a priest of divine ordaining; not made a priest by fleshly birth, as the sons of Aaron; he mentions neither father, mother, nor descent, as his right to the sacred office; he stands upon his personal merits, by himself alone; as no man came before him in his work, so none can follow after; his order begins and ends in his own person, and in himself it is eternal, "having neither beginning of days nor end of years." The King-priest has been here and left his blessing upon the believing seed, and now he sits in glory in his complete character, atoning for us by the merit of his blood, and exercising all power on our behalf.<p>"O may we ever hear thy voice<p>In mercy to us speak,<p>And in our Priest we will rejoice,<p>Thou great Melchizedek." <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/110.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hath sworn; </span> which he did not in the Aaronical priesthood, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/7-21.htm" title="(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said to him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)">Hebrews 7:21</a></span>, but did it here, partly because the thing was new and strange, and might seem incredible, because God had already erected another, and that <span class="ital">an everlasting priesthood</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/25-13.htm" title="And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.">Numbers 25:13</a></span>, and given it to Aaron and his posterity for ever, and therefore this needed all possible assurance; and partly that his priesthood might be established upon better promises, as is said, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a></span>, and made sure and irrevocable, and such that God neither could nor would repent of it, as it follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou art, </span> to wit, by my order and constitution; thou shalt be so, and I do hereby make thee so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A Priest, </span> as well as a King.

This word plainly discovers that this Psalm cannot be understood of David, as some of the Jews would have it, but only of the Messias.

What he swore about, and did not repent of, was the priesthood of Christ, as follows; and which shows the importance of it, since when Jehovah swears, as it is by himself, because he can swear by no greater; so it is about matters of great moment only that are sworn to by the Lord, as this of the priesthood of Christ was; which was concerned in things pertaining to God and his glory, as well as in making reconciliation for the sins of his people: and it shows the truth, and was for the confirmation of it; since doubts might arise whether the Aaronic priesthood was changed, seeing it was given to Phinehas for an everlasting priesthood; and since so great a person as the Son of God is said to be a priest; and since, in the human nature, he was of the tribe of Judah, of which tribe nothing was said concerning the priesthood: and this oath was not so much for Christ's sake, to establish the priesthood with him, and assure him of it, as for the sake of his people; who, by two immutable things, the word and oath of God, might have strong consolation from it; and it clearly shows the validity of his priesthood; that he was called of God to this office, and invested with it, and consecrated in it with an oath; and which is expressive of the singularity of it, and of the dignity and preference of the priesthood of Christ to that of Aaron's, <a href="/hebrews/7-20.htm">Hebrews 7:20</a>. What follows was said, and this oath was made, in the council of peace, when Christ was called to this office, and he accepted of it, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>, and of this the Lord never repented; as he never does of any of his acts of grace, <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>. <p>Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek; or, "according to the word of Melchizedek" (z); that is, according to what is said of him; there being an agreement between the things said of one and of the other; so the Syriac version, "according to the likeness of Melchizedek", see <a href="/hebrews/7-15.htm">Hebrews 7:15</a> of him no mention is made elsewhere, but in <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a> and in the epistle to the Hebrews. Various are the opinions of men concerning him: some think he was not a man, but an angel that appeared to Abraham: others, a divine power, superior to Christ, who were called "Melchizedecians": and others, that he was the Holy Ghost; and others, the Son of God himself, in an human form. On the other hand, some take him to be a mere man. The general notion of the Jews is, that he was Shem, the son of Noah; others, that he was a Canaanitish king, of the posterity of Ham: but others do not think it proper or lawful to inquire who he was, or from whom he descended; this being purposely hidden from men, that he might be more clearly a type of Christ. That there is a likeness between them is certain; the signification of his name, a title of office, King of righteousness, and King of peace, agrees with Christ the Lord, our righteousness and our peace: his being without father, mother, descent, beginning of days, and end of life, agree with the divinity, humanity, and eternity of Christ; and who is likewise King and Priest, as he was; and who blesses his people, as he did Abraham; and refreshes them with bread and wine, as he did Abraham's soldiers; See Gill on <a href="/hebrews/7-2.htm">Hebrews 7:2</a>. See Gill on <a href="/hebrews/7-3.htm">Hebrews 7:3</a>. Now Christ is a Priest like him; whose office is to offer sacrifice, which he has done, even himself, for the atonement of the sins of his people; to make intercession for them, which he ever lives to do; to introduce their persons to his Father, and present their petitions to him; and to call for every blessing for them, and answer all charges against them: in which office he continues for ever; there never will be any change in his priesthood, as there has been in Aaron's; nor will he ever have any successor: his priesthood is unchangeable, or does not pass from one to another, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24</a>, the efficacy of his blood and sacrifice always continues, and intercession is ever made by him, and the glory of his mediation is ever given him. The apostle produces this passage in proof of the change of the Aaronic priesthood, and so of the law, <a href="/hebrews/7-11.htm">Hebrews 7:11</a> and about the time Christ appeared as the high priest, the legal priesthood sensibly declined, and which the Jews themselves own; for they say, <p>"after the death of Ishmael Ben Phabi, the splendour of the priesthood ceased (a);'' <p>which man was made priest by Valerius Gratus, governor of Judea, under Tiberius Caesar (b), <p>(z)  "super meum verbum", Montanus; "juxta verbum", Vatablus.

The priesthood of the king.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jehovah <span class="ital">hath sworn, and will not repent</span>] The king is also priest by an immutable Divine decree. The immutability of this decree is affirmed in the most solemn manner possible. The ‘oath’ of Him who cannot lie is no stronger than His word; He who knows all things from the beginning cannot repent or change His purpose (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm" title="God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-29.htm" title="And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.">1 Samuel 15:29</a>), though man’s failure or change may necessitate a temporary interruption of His purpose which appears to finite man in the light of a ‘repentance.’ But He who is absolutely true and unchanging condescends for man’s sake to confirm His word by an oath. Cp. <a href="/amos/6-8.htm" title="The Lord GOD has sworn by himself, said the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.">Amos 6:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-11.htm" title="The LORD has sworn in truth to David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of your body will I set on your throne.">Psalm 132:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Thou</span> art <span class="ital">a priest for ever after the order</span> (or, <span class="ital">manner</span>) <span class="ital">of Melchizedek</span>] Melchizedek, king of Salem, and priest of God Most High (<span class="ital">El Elyôn</span>), appears in <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm" title="And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.">Genesis 14:18</a> ff. as the representative of a true faith in the primitive world. He was a type of that union of civil and religious life, which must be the ideal of the perfect state. The thought here affirmed is that the new king of Jerusalem must hold a position in no way inferior to that of the ancient king of Salem. As the representative of “a kingdom of priests and an holy nation” (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a>) he had a priestly character. As the representative of God to the people and of the people to God he had a mediatorial office. David, when he brought up the Ark into the city of David, laid aside his royal robes and wore the dress of a priest (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm" title="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.">2 Samuel 6:14</a>): both he and Solomon exercised priestly functions in offering sacrifice, or at least in directing the sacrifices, if they did not actually offer them (<a href="/context/2_samuel/6-17.htm" title="And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the middle of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD....">2 Samuel 6:17-18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-62.htm" title="And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.">1 Kings 8:62</a> ff.), and in blessing the people (<a href="/2_samuel/6-18.htm" title="And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.">2 Samuel 6:18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-14.htm" title="And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)">1 Kings 8:14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-55.htm" title="And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,">1 Kings 8:55</a>); Solomon deposed and appointed a high-priest (<a href="/1_kings/2-27.htm" title="So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.">1 Kings 2:27</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm" title="And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.">1 Kings 2:35</a>). David’s sons, in whatever sense the term may have been used, were styled priests (<a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.">2 Samuel 8:18</a>). But the priesthood of the king is here implicitly distinguished from the hereditary priesthood of the family of Aaron, as a priesthood ‘after the manner of Melchizedek.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">For ever</span>, as applied to an individual, may be a relative term, as in <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/14-41.htm" title="Also that the Jews and priests were well pleased that Simon should be their governor and high priest for ever, until there should arise a faithful prophet;">1Ma 14:41</a>, quoted above, p. 663. Cp. <a href="/1_samuel/1-22.htm" title="But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.">1 Samuel 1:22</a>. But the promise of an eternal priesthood corresponds rather to the promise of eternal dominion in <a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm" title="He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.">2 Samuel 7:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-10.htm" title="Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,">2 Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-25.htm" title="And now, O LORD God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as you have said.">2 Samuel 7:25</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-29.htm" title="Therefore now let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you: for you, O Lord GOD, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your servant be blessed for ever.">2 Samuel 7:29</a>. Made to an individual, it is realised in his descendants. Jeremiah speaks of the priestly right of access to God which is to be conferred upon the Messianic prince (<a href="/jeremiah/30-21.htm" title="And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the middle of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach to me? said the LORD.">Jeremiah 30:21</a>); and the union of civil and religious life was symbolised under the altered circumstances of the return from Babylon by the coronation of Joshua (<a href="/context/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:...">Zechariah 6:12-13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews dwells upon this verse in his exposition of the typical significance of the priesthood of Melchizedek, quoting it to illustrate the divine appointment of Christ to his high-priestly office, and the eternal duration and unique character of that office (<a href="/hebrews/5-6.htm" title="As he said also in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-17.htm" title="For he testifies, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 7:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-21.htm" title="(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said to him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)">Hebrews 7:21</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/110.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent</span>. "A fresh revelation" (Cheyne). David, admitted into the councils of the Most High, has been made aware that the Messiah is, by God's decree, to be both King and Priest. God has "sworn" this, and will certainly not draw back from his oath. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek</span>. Not, like ordinary priests, a priest for a few years, or for a lifetime, but a priest forever and ever (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dd;</span>) - seeing "he ever liveth to make intercession for us" (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). And a priest "after the order of Melchizedek." Not, that is, after the order of Aaron, who was a priest and nothing more, but after that of Melchizedek, the elder priesthood, which combined the offices of priest and king (see <a href="/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6-10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1-10, 20-28</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/109.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The cry for help is renewed in the closing strophe, and the Psalm draws to a close very similarly to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, with a joyful prospect of the end of the affliction. In <a href="/psalms/109-27.htm">Psalm 109:27</a> the hand of God stands in contrast to accident, the work of men, and his own efforts. All and each one will undeniably perceive, when God at length interposes, that it is His hand which here does that which was impossible in the eyes of men, and that it is His work which has been accomplished in this affliction and in the issue of it. He blesses him whom men curse: they arise without attaining their object, whereas His servant can rejoice in the end of his affliction. The futures in <a href="/psalms/109-29.htm">Psalm 109:29</a> are not now again imprecations, but an expression of believingly confident hope. In correct texts &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; has Mem raphatum. The "many" are the "congregation" (vid., <a href="/psalms/22-23.htm">Psalm 22:23</a>). In the case of the marvellous deliverance of this sufferer the congregation or church has the pledge of its own deliverance, and a bright mirror of the loving-kindness of its God. The sum of the praise and thanksgiving follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-31.htm">Psalm 109:31</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; signifies quod, and is therefore allied to the &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; recitativum (cf. <a href="/psalms/22-25.htm">Psalm 22:25</a>). The three Good Friday Psalms all sum up the comfort that springs from David's affliction for all suffering ones in just such a pithy sentence (<a href="/psalms/22-25.htm">Psalm 22:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-34.htm">Psalm 69:34</a>). Jahve comes forward at the right hand of the poor, contending for him (cf. <a href="/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>), to save (him) from those who judge (<a href="/psalms/37-33.htm">Psalm 37:33</a>), i.e., condemn, his soul. The contrast between this closing thought and <a href="/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>. is unmistakeable. At the right hand of the tormentor stands Satan as an accuser, at the right hand of the tormented one stands God as his vindicator; he who delivered him over to human judges is condemned, and he who was delivered up is "taken away out of distress and from judgment" (<a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>) by the Judge of the judges, in order that, as we now hear in the following Psalm, he may sit at the right hand of the heavenly King. &#x395;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;...&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#837;!
