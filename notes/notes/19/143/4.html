David, before he prays for the removal of his trouble, prays for the pardon of his sin, and depends upon mercy alone for it. He bemoans the weight upon his mind from outward troubles. But he looks back, and remembers God's former appearance for his afflicted people, and for him in particular. He looks round, and notices the works of God. The more we consider the power of God, the less we shall fear the face or force of man. He looks up with earnest desires towards God and his favour. This is the best course we can take, when our spirits are overwhelmed. The believer will not forget, that in his best actions he is a sinner. Meditation and prayer will recover us from distresses; and then the mourning soul strives to return to the Lord as the infant stretches out its hands to the indulgent mother, and thirsts for his consolations as the parched ground for refreshing rain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/143.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/77-3.htm">Psalm 77:3</a>.

Everywhere, whithersoever he has to go (cf. on <a href="/psalms/143-8.htm">Psalm 143:8</a>), the snares of craftily calculating foes threaten him. Even God's all-seeing eye will not discover any one who would right faithfully and carefully interest himself in him. &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496;, look! is a graphic hybrid form of &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496; and &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496;, the usual and the rare imperative form; cf. &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; <a href="/1_samuel/20-40.htm">1 Samuel 20:40</a> (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/17-18.htm">Jeremiah 17:18</a>), and the same modes of writing the inf. absol. in <a href="/judges/1-28.htm">Judges 1:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>, and the fut. conv. in <a href="/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>. &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/2-19.htm">Ruth 2:19</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10.htm">Psalm 10</a>, one who looks kindly upon any one, a considerate (cf. the phrase &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;) well-wisher and friend. Such an one, if he had one, would be &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; or &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; (<a href="/psalms/16-8.htm">Psalm 16:8</a>), for an open attack is directed to the arms-bearing right side (<a href="/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>), and there too the helper in battle (<a href="/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>) and the defender or advocate (<a href="/psalms/109-31.htm">Psalm 109:31</a>) takes his place in order to cover him who is imperilled (<a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>). But then if God looks in that direction, He will find him, who is praying to Him, unprotected. Instead of &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; one would certainly have sooner expected &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; or &#1499;&#1497; as the form of introducing the condition in which he is found; but Hitzig's conjecture, &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; &#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, "looking for days and seeing," gives us in the place of this difficulty a confusing half-Aramaism in &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;  equals  &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; in the sense of &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>. Ewald's rendering is better: "though I look to the right hand and see (&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;), yet no friend appears for me;" but this use of the inf. absol. with an adversative apodosis is without example. Thus therefore the pointing appears to have lighted upon the correct idea, inasmuch as it recognises here the current formula &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496; &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, e.g., <a href="/job/35-5.htm">Job 35:5</a>; <a href="/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1</a>. The fact that David, although surrounded by a band of loyal subjects, confesses to having no true fiend, is to be understood similarly to the language of Paul when he says in <a href="/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20</a> : "I have no man like-minded." All human love, since sin has taken possession of humanity, is more or less selfish, and all fellowship of faith and of love imperfect; and there are circumstances in life in which these dark sides make themselves felt overpoweringly, so that a man seems to himself to be perfectly isolated and turns all the more urgently to God, who alone is able to supply the soul's want of some object to love, whose love is absolutely unselfish, and unchangeable, and unbeclouded, to whom the soul can confide without reserve whatever burdens it, and who not only honestly desires its good, but is able also to compass it in spite of every obstacle. Surrounded by bloodthirsty enemies, and misunderstood, or at least not thoroughly understood, by his friends, David feels himself broken off from all created beings. On this earth every kind of refuge is for him lost (the expression is like <a href="/job/11-20.htm">Job 11:20</a>). There is no one there who should ask after or care for his soul, and should right earnestly exert himself for its deliverance. Thus, then, despairing of all visible things, he cries to the Invisible One. He is his "refuge" (<a href="/psalms/91-9.htm">Psalm 91:9</a>) and his "portion" (<a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>), i.e., the share in a possession that satisfies him. To be allowed to call Him his God - this it is which suffices him and outweighs everything. For Jahve is the Living One, and he who possesses Him as his own finds himself thereby "in the land of the living" (<a href="/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>). He cannot die, he cannot perish. </body></html>
