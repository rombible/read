When Christ comes for the salvation of his people , he redeems them from the power of sin and Satan, separates them from an ungodly world, forms them to be his people, and becomes their King. There is no sea, no Jordan, so deep, so broad, but, when God's time is come, it shall be divided and driven back. Apply this to the planting the Christian church in the world. What ailed Satan and his idolatries, that they trembled as they did? But especially apply it to the work of grace in the heart. What turns the stream in a regenerate soul? What affects the lusts and corruptions, that they fly back; that prejudices are removed, and the whole man becomes new? It is at the presence of God's Spirit. At the presence of the Lord, not only mountains, but the earth itself may well tremble, since it has lain under a curse for man's sin. As the Israelites were protected, so they were provided for by miracles; such was that fountain of waters into which the flinty rock was turned, and that rock was Christ. The Son of God, the Rock of ages, gave himself to death, to open a fountain to wash away sins, and to supply believers with waters of life and consolation; and they need not fear that any blessing is too great to expect from his love. But let sinners fear before their just and holy Judge. Let us now prepare to meet our God, that we may have boldness before him at his coming.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/114.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The mountains skipped like rams - As flocks in their gambols.

The movement of the thoughts in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/113-8.htm">Psalm 113:8</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/113-1.htm">Psalm 113:1</a>, follows the model of the epizeuxis. Together with the song of Hannah the poet has before his eye Hannah's exaltation out of sorrow and reproach. He does not, however, repeat the words of her song which have reference to this (<a href="/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>), but clothes his generalization of her experience in his own language. If he intended that &#1506;&#1511;&#1512;&#1514; should be understood out of the genitival relation after the form &#1506;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514;, why did he not write &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;? &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; would then be equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a>. &#1506;&#1511;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is the expression for a woman who is a wife, and therefore housewife, &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;) &#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, but yet not a mother. Such an one has no settled position in the house of the husband, the firm bond is wanting in her relationship to her husband. If God gives her children, He thereby makes her then thoroughly at home and rooted-in in her position. In the predicate notion &#1488;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1492; the definiteness attaches to the second member of the string of words, as in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30</a> (cf. the reverse instance in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-26.htm">Jeremiah 23:26</a>, &#1504;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;, those prophesying that which is false), therefore: a mother of the children. The poet brings the matter so vividly before him, that he points as it were with his finger to the children with which God blesses her. </body></html>
