Here is a prayer put into the hands of the afflicted; let them present it to God. Even good men may be almost overwhelmed with afflictions. It is our duty and interest to pray; and it is comfort to an afflicted spirit to unburden itself, by a humble representation of its griefs. We must say, Blessed be the name of the Lord, who both gives and takes away.

It had become less distinct and clear, and it would soon vanish.

Or, "that is stretched out" (s), which, though it may appear long, is soon at an end; as it does appear longer when the sun sets (t), and departs from the earth: he reckons his life not by months and years, but by days; and these he compares to a "shadow", which has no substance in it; his age being as nothing before the Lord, and has much darkness and obscurity in it; his days being days of darkness, affliction, and trouble, and quickly gone, as man's life is; there is no abiding; see <a href="/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>.

The psalmist, like his nation, is old before his time; the shades of evening have come upon him, when he should have been in his midday brightness. And I am withered like grass (comp. ver. 4).

The reading &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; &#1511;&#1491; (in the Karaite Ben-Jerucham) enriches the lexicon in the same sense with a word which has scarcely had any existence. &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1491; (Arabic mauk&#803;id) signifies here, as in other instances, a hearth. &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>, Niphal: my bones are heated through with a fever-heat, as a hearth with the smouldering fire that is on it. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/psalms/94-21.htm">Psalm 94:21</a>) is used exactly as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-16.htm">Hosea 9:16</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>.

On the cleaving of the bones to the flesh from being baked, i.e., to the skin (Arabic bas&#780;ar, in accordance with the radical signification, the surface of the body  equals  the skin, from &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, to brush along, rub, scrape, scratch on the surface), cf. <a href="/job/19-20.htm">Job 19:20</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>. &#1500; (&#1488;&#1500;) with &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1511; is used just like &#1489;&#1468;.
