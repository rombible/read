When we consider our own vileness, our darkness and deadness, and the manifold defects in our prayers, we have cause to fear that they will not be received in heaven; but we are here assured of the contrary, for we have an Advocate with the Father, and are under grace, not under the law. Redemption is the subject of praise in the Christian church; and that great work is described by the temporal deliverance and restoration of Israel.

The people of the Exile are called in <a href="/psalms/102-18.htm">Psalm 102:18</a> &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1506;&#1512;, from &#1506;&#1512;&#1512;, to be naked: homeless, powerless, honourless, and in the eyes of men, prospectless.
