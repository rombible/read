Here is a prayer put into the hands of the afflicted; let them present it to God. Even good men may be almost overwhelmed with afflictions. It is our duty and interest to pray; and it is comfort to an afflicted spirit to unburden itself, by a humble representation of its griefs. We must say, Blessed be the name of the Lord, who both gives and takes away.

See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/90-7.htm">Psalm 90:7-9</a>.<p>For thou hast lifted me up - In former times.

Compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/30-7.htm">Psalm 30:7</a>. The passage, however, is susceptible of another interpretation: "Thou hast lifted me up, and cast me away." That is, Thou hast lifted me from the ground as a storm or tempest takes up a light thing, and hast whirled me away. This idea occurs in <a href="/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a>. See the notes at that passage.

This was the burden of his complaint, what gave him the greatest uneasiness; not so much the reproach of his enemies, and his other outward afflictions, as the sense he had of God's wrath and indignation. The people of God are as deserving of his wrath as others; and when they are awakened to a sense of sin and danger, or the law enters into their consciences, it works wrath there, and leaves nothing but a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, till comfort is given; and under afflictive providences they are very ready to conclude, that the wrath of God is upon them; but this is only their apprehension of things; it is not in reality: for God has not appointed them to wrath, and has swore he will not be wroth with them; Christ has bore it for them, in their room and stead; and being justified by his blood and righteousness, they are saved from it; but then the sense they have of it is very terrible, and there is no rest, peace, and comfort in their souls, while under the apprehensions of it: <p>for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down; as a man that, in wrestling, has the advantage of his antagonist, lifts him up as high as he can, that he may throw him with the greater force upon the ground; in like manner the psalmist thought the Lord was dealing with him: or this may express his changeable state and condition, sometimes lifted up, and sometimes cast down, and which is the case of every believer, more or less; all have their liftings up, and their castings down: when God first calls them by his grace, he raises them from a low estate, lifts them up out of an horrible pit, takes them from the dunghill, sets them among princes to inherit the throne of glory: when he comforts them with the consolations of his Spirit, he is the lifter up of their heads; when he grants his presence, and lifts up the light of his countenance: when he discovers his love, and makes their mountain to stand strong; when he shows them their interest in himself, as their covenant God, in Christ, as their Redeemer and Saviour, and grants them the communion of the Holy Ghost; and when their graces are in lively exercise, then is it a time of lifting up: and they are cast down when corruptions prevail, when grace is weak, when God hides his face, and when afflictions lie heavy on them: this was now the case of the psalmist, and perhaps the remembrance of his liftings up in former times was an aggravation of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/102.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because of thine <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</span><p>(h) He shows that not only the afflictions moved him, but chiefly the feeling of God's displeasure.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/102.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. This suffering is the punishment of sin. The storm of God’s wrath has swept Israel away from its own land, and flung it down helpless in the land of exile. <span class="ital">Thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down</span> (A.V.) has been taken to mean that the bitterness of Israel’s present humiliation is intensified by the recollection of its past exaltation (cp. <a href="/lamentations/2-1.htm" title="How has the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!">Lamentations 2:1</a>), but it suits the context better to render For thou hast taken me up and flung me away, a metaphor from a hurricane. Cp. <a href="/job/27-21.htm" title="The east wind carries him away, and he departs: and as a storm hurles him out of his place.">Job 27:21</a>; <a href="/job/30-22.htm" title="You lift me up to the wind; you cause me to ride on it, and dissolve my substance.">Job 30:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm" title="But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.">Isaiah 64:6</a>. The same word is used of the banishment of Israel in <a href="/jeremiah/7-15.htm" title="And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, even the whole seed of Ephraim.">Jeremiah 7:15</a>, &c.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/102.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because of thine indignation and thy wrath.</span> "The bitterest ingredient of our cup of sorrow," says Dean Johnson, "is to know that it is owing to Jehovah's wrath and fierce anger for sin." <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</span> "Elevated me," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "only to cast me down, and so make my affliction the greater." The allusion is probably to the former prosperity of the speaker, and of Israel generally, in their own land, and their present misery in Babylon (compare, however, <a href="/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>; <a href="/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/102.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From this point onward the Psalm becomes original.

The reading &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; &#1511;&#1491; (in the Karaite Ben-Jerucham) enriches the lexicon in the same sense with a word which has scarcely had any existence. &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1491; (Arabic mauk&#803;id) signifies here, as in other instances, a hearth. &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>, Niphal: my bones are heated through with a fever-heat, as a hearth with the smouldering fire that is on it. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/psalms/94-21.htm">Psalm 94:21</a>) is used exactly as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-16.htm">Hosea 9:16</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>. The heart is said to dry up when the life's blood, of which it is the reservoir, fails. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1495; is followed by &#1502;&#1503; of dislike. On the cleaving of the bones to the flesh from being baked, i.e., to the skin (Arabic bas&#780;ar, in accordance with the radical signification, the surface of the body  equals  the skin, from &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, to brush along, rub, scrape, scratch on the surface), cf. <a href="/job/19-20.htm">Job 19:20</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>. &#1500; (&#1488;&#1500;) with &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1511; is used just like &#1489;&#1468;.

Continuous straining of the voice, especially in connection with persevering prayer arising from inward conflict, does really make the body waste away. </body></html>
