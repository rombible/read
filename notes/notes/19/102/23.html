Israel doubts not of God’s veracity, but fears lest his heavy hand should crush the generation then in being, before they should behold the expiration of their troubles. They were <span class="ital">in the way, </span>but their strength was so <span class="ital">weakened, </span>and their <span class="ital">days shortened, </span>that they almost despaired of holding out to their journey’s end.” Bishop Patrick, however, supposes that the psalmist spake of himself personally, and interprets the passage thus: “I had hopes to have lived to see this blessed time, (namely, of the redemption from Babylon, and the accession of the Gentile nations to the church of God, spoken of in the preceding verses,) “and thought I had been in the way to it, <a href="/ezra/3-8.htm" title="Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.">Ezra 3:8</a>.

We must own God's hand in it; and must reconcile this to his love, for often those that have used their strength well, have it weakened; and those who, as we think, can very ill be spared, have their days shortened. It is very comfortable, in reference to all the changes and dangers of the church, to remember that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. And in reference to the death of our bodies, and the removal of friends, to remember that God is an everlasting God. Do not let us overlook the assurance this psalm contains of a happy end to all the believer's trials. Though all things are changing, dying, perishing, like a vesture folding up and hastening to decay, yet Jesus lives, and thus all is secure, for he hath said, Because I live ye shall live also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/102.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He weakened my strength in the way - Margin, as in Hebrew, "afflicted." The idea is, that God had taken his strength away; he had weakened him - humbled him - brought him low by sorrow. The word "way" refers to the course which he was pursuing. In his journey of life God had thus afflicted - humbled - prostrated him. The psalmist here turns from the exulting view which he had of the future <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/102-21.htm">Psalm 102:21-22</a>, and resumes his complaint - the remembrance of his troubles and sorrows <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/102-3.htm">Psalm 102:3-11</a>. He speaks, doubtless, in the name of his people, and describes troubles which were common to them all. Perhaps the allusion to his troubles here may be designed, as such a recollection should do, to heighten his sense of the goodness and mercy of God in the anticipated blessings of the future.<p>He shortened my days - Compare <a href="/job/21-21.htm">Job 21:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-45.htm">Psalm 89:45</a>. That is, He seemed to be about to cut me off from life, and to bring me to the grave. The psalmist felt so confident that he would die - that he could not endure these troubles, but must sink under them, that he spoke as if it were already done. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/6-4.htm">Psalm 6:4-5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/102.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23-28. The writer, speaking for the Church, finds encouragement in the midst of all his distresses. God's eternal existence is a pledge of faithfulness to His promises.<p>in the way&#8212;of providence.<p>weakened&#8212;literally, "afflicted," and made fearful of a premature end, a figure of the apprehensions of the Church, lest God might not perform His promise, drawn from those of a person in view of the dangers of early death (compare Ps 89:47). Paul (Heb 1:10) quotes Ps 102:26-28 as addressed to Christ in His divine nature. The scope of the Psalm, as already seen, so far from opposing, favors this view, especially by the sentiments of Ps 102:12-15 (compare Isa 60:1). The association of the Messiah with a day of future glory to the Church was very intimate in the minds of Old Testament writers; and with correct views of His nature it is very consistent that He should be addressed as the Lord and Head of His Church, who would bring about that glorious future on which they ever dwelt with fond delightful anticipations.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/102.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He, </span> to wit, God, to whom he ascribes these calamities, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/102-10.htm" title="Because of your indignation and your wrath: for you have lifted me up, and cast me down.">Psalm 102:10</a></span>; to whom therefore he addresseth himself for relief. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the way; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

And the psalmist here speaks (as other sacred writers do elsewhere, and as all sorts of writers frequently do) of the whole commonwealth as of one man, and of its continuance as of the life of one man. And so this seems to be the matter of his complaint and humble expostulation with God: O Lord, thou didst choose us out of all the world to be thy peculiar people, and didst plant us in Canaan, and cause a glorious temple to be built to thy name, to be the only place of thy public and solemn worship in the world, and didst make great and glorious promises, that thine <span class="ital">eyes</span> and <span class="ital">heart</span> should be upon it perpetually, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me: I have hallowed this house, which you have built, to put my name there for ever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.">1 Kings 9:3</a></span>, and that thy people should be planted in thy land, so as not to be moved any more or afflicted, as they had been in the days of the judges, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/7-10.htm" title="Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,">2 Samuel 7:10</a>,11</span>; from whence we promised to ourselves a long and settled prosperity. But, alas, how soon were our hopes blasted! not long after the beginning of our settlement, in Rehoboam’s time, and so successively in the course of our affairs under the following kings, till at last thou didst give us up to ruin and desolation, as at this day. And this he doth not allege to accuse God, or excuse himself or his people, but only that he might move the Divine Majesty to show them some pity, considering the shortness of their days, and his own eternity, as he pursues the argument in the following verses. <span class="ital">My days</span>; the days of my life, or of my prosperous state, as above, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/102-1.htm" title="Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come to you.">Psalm 102:1</a></span>; for adversity is a kind of death, and is frequently so called. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/102.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He weakened my strength in the way,....
