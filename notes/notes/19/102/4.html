It is our duty and interest to pray; and it is comfort to an afflicted spirit to unburden itself, by a humble representation of its griefs.

Can there be any more appropriate motto for it than what is said of Jahve's government in <a href="/psalms/99-4.htm">Psalm 99:4</a>? In respect of this passage of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1-9</a>, to which <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/100-1.htm">Psalm 100:1-5</a> is the finale, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/101-1.htm">Psalm 101:1-8</a> seems to be appended as an echo out of the heart of David. The appropriateness of the words &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491; &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512; (the position of the words is as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1-10</a>; 40; 109:1-110:7; 139) is corroborated by the form and contents. Probably the great historical work from which the chronicler has taken excerpts furnished the post-exilic collector with a further gleaning of Davidic songs, or at least songs that were ascribed to David. The Psalm before us belongs to the time during which the Ark was in the house of Obed-Edom, where David had left it behind through terror at the misfortune of Uzzah. David said at that time: "How shall the Ark of Jahve come to me (the unholy one)?" <a href="/2_samuel/6-8.htm">2 Samuel 6:8</a>. He did not venture to bring the Ark of the Fearful and Holy One within the range of his own house. In our Psalm, however, he gives utterance to his determination as king to give earnest heed to the sanctity of his walk, of his rule, and of his house; and this resolve he brings before Jahve as a vow, to whom, in regard to the rich blessing which the Ark of God diffuses around it (<a href="/2_samuel/6-11.htm">2 Samuel 6:11</a>.), he longingly sighs: "When wilt Thou come to me?!" This contemporaneous reference has been recognised by Hammond and Venema. From the fact that Jahve comes to David, Jerusalem becomes "the city of Jahve," <a href="/psalms/101-8.htm">Psalm 101:8</a>; and to defend the holiness of this the city of His habitation in all faithfulness, and with all his might, is the thing to which David here pledges himself.<p>The contents of the first verse refer not merely to the Psalm that follows as an announcement of its theme, but to David's whole life: graciousness and right, the self-manifestations united ideally and, for the king who governs His people, typically in Jahve, shall be the subject of his song. Jahve, the primal source of graciousness and of right, it shall be, to whom he consecrates his poetic talent, as also his playing upon the harp. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; is condescension which flows from the principle of free love, and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; legality which binds itself impartially and uncapriciously to the rule (norm) of that which is right and good. They are two modes of conduct, mutually tempering each other, which God requires of every man (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, cf. <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a> : &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), and more especially of a king. Further, he has resolved to give heed, thoughtfully and with an endeavour to pursue it (&#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468; as in <a href="/daniel/9-13.htm">Daniel 9:13</a>), unto the way of that which is perfect, i.e., blameless. What is further said might now be rendered as a relative clause: when Thou comest to me. But not until then?! Hitzig renders it differently: I will take up the lot of the just when it comes to me, i.e., as often as it is brought to my knowledge. But if this had been the meaning, &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; would have been said instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/18-16.htm">Exodus 18:16</a>, <a href="/exodus/18-19.htm">Exodus 18:19</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-12.htm">2 Samuel 19:12</a> [11]); for, according to both its parts, the expression &#1491;&#1493;&#1498; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is an ethical notion, and is therefore not used in a different sense from that in <a href="/psalms/101-6.htm">Psalm 101:6</a>. Moreover, the relative use of the interrogative &#1502;&#1514;&#1497; in Hebrew cannot be supported, with the exception, perhaps, of <a href="/proverbs/23-35.htm">Proverbs 23:35</a>. Athanasius correctly interprets: &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, &#x3c9;&#787;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. It is a question of strong yearning: when wilt Thou come to me? is the time near at hand when Thou wilt erect Thy throne near to me? If his longing should be fulfilled, David is resolved to, and will then, behave himself as he further sets forth in the vows he makes. He pledges himself to walk within his house, i.e., his palace, in the innocence or simplicity of his heart (<a href="/psalms/78-72.htm">Psalm 78:72</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-7.htm">Proverbs 20:7</a>), without allowing himself to be led away from this frame of mind which has become his through grace. He will not set before his eyes, viz., as a proposition or purpose (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/10-10.htm">Exodus 10:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-10.htm">1 Samuel 29:10</a>, lxx), any morally worthless or vile matter whatsoever (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/41-8.htm">Psalm 41:8</a>, cf. concerning &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>).
