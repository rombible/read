The tongue is a little member, but it boasts great things. The upright man is the mark at which the wicked aim, they cannot speak peaceably either of him or to him. There is no guard against a false tongue. It is bad to do wrong, but worse to encourage ourselves and one another in it. It is a sign that the heart is hardened to the greatest degree, when it is thus fully set to do evil. A practical disbelief of God's knowledge of all things, is at the bottom of every wickedness. The benefit of a good cause and a good conscience, appears most when nothing can help a man against his enemies, save God alone, who is always a present help.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who whet their tongue like a sword - Who sharpen their tongue; that is, they utter words that will cut deep, or penetrate the soul.

Calumny was what David especially feared, and what actually brought about his downfall (see <a href="/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2-6</a>). The "bitterness" of his enemies is further emphasized by the speeches and curses of Shimei (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-13</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/63.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This strophe again takes up the &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; (<a href="/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a>): thus ardently longing, for all time to come also, is he set towards God, with such fervent longing after God will he bless Him in his life, i.e., entirely filling up his life therewith (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; as in <a href="/psalms/104-33.htm">Psalm 104:33</a>; <a href="/psalms/146-2.htm">Psalm 146:2</a>; cf. Baruch 4:20, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), and in His name, i.e., invoking it and appealing to it, will he lift up his hands in prayer. The being occupied with God makes him, even though as now in the desert he is obliged to suffer bodily hunger, satisfied and cheerful like the fattest and most marrowy food: velut adipe et pinguedine satiatur anima mea. From <a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-25.htm">Leviticus 7:25</a>, Grussetius and Frisch infer that spiritualies epulae are meant. And certainly the poet cannot have had the sacrificial feasts (Hupfeld) in his mind; for the &#1495;&#1500;&#1489; of the shelamim is put upon the altar, and is removed from the part to be eaten. Moreover, however, even the Tra does not bind itself in its expression to the letter of that prohibition of the fat of animals, vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/31-14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a>. So here also the expression "with marrow and fat" is the designation of a feast prepared from well-fed, noble beasts. He feels himself satisfied in his inmost nature just as after a feast of the most nourishing and dainty meats, and with lips of jubilant songs (accus. instrum. according to Ges. 138, rem. 3), i.e., with lips jubilant and attuned to song, shall his mouth sing praise. What now follows in <a href="/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a> we no longer, as formerly, take as a protasis subsequently introduced (like <a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>.): "when I remembered...meditated upon Thee," but so that <a href="/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a> is the protasis and <a href="/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a> the apodosis, cf. <a href="/psalms/21-12.htm">Psalm 21:12</a>; <a href="/job/9-16.htm">Job 9:16</a> (Hitzig): When I remember Thee (meminerim, Ew. 355, b) upon my bed (stratis meis, as in <a href="/psalms/132-3.htm">Psalm 132:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>, cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>) - says he now as the twilight watch is passing gradually into the morning - I meditate upon Thee in the night-watches (Symmachus, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8; &#787; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;), or during, throughout the night-watches (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>); i.e., it is no passing remembrance, but it so holds me that I pass a great part of the night absorbed in meditation on Thee. He has no lack of matter for his meditation; for God has become a help (auxilio, vid., on <a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>) to him: He has rescued him in this wilderness, and, well concealed under the shadow of His wings (vid., on <a href="/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/57-2.htm">Psalm 57:2</a>), which affords him a cool retreat in the heat of conflict and protection against his persecutors, he is able to exult (&#1488;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503;, the potential). Between himself and God there subsists a reciprocal relationship of active love. According to the schema of the crosswise position of words (Chiasmus), &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; intentionally jostle close against one another: he depends upon God, following close behind Him, i.e., following Him everywhere and not leaving Him when He wishes to avoid him; and on the other side God's right hand holds him fast, not letting him go, not abandoning him to his foes. </body></html>
