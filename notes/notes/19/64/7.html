In the moment of their imagined success, their deeply-laid schemes just on the point of ripening, a sudden Divine retribution overtakes the wicked, and all their calumnies, invented with such cunning, fall back on their own heads. But the construction is most perplexing. The text presents a tangled maze of abrupt clauses, which, arranged according to the accents, run: <span class= "ital">And God shoots an arrow, sudden are their wounds, and they make it </span>(or <span class= "ital">him</span>)<span class= "ital"> fall on themselves their tongue. </span>The last clause seems to pronounce the law which obtains in Divine judgment. While God orders the retribution it is yet the recoil of their own evil on the guilty. In these cases,<p>“We still have judgment here, that we but teach<p>Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return<p>To plague the inventor; this evenhanded justice<p>Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice<p>To our own lips.”<p>SHAKSPEARE: <span class= "ital">Macbeth.</span><p><span class= "bld">Flee away.</span>—The verb (<span class= "ital">nādad</span>) properly means <span class= "ital">to flutter the wings like a bird </span>(<a href="/isaiah/10-14.htm" title="And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathers eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.">Isaiah 10:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/psalms/64.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/64-7.htm" title="But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.">Psalm 64:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">But God shall shoot at them — </span>Though I can neither search out nor prevent their subtle devices, yet God can, and will certainly do it, for <span class="ital">he ordains his arrows against persecutors, </span><a href="/psalms/7-13.htm" title="He has also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordains his arrows against the persecutors.">Psalm 7:13</a>, and his arrows will hit more surely, and fly more swiftly, and pierce more deeply than theirs do or can.

Those who love cursing, it shall come upon them. Those who behold this shall understand, and observe God's hand in all; unless we do so, we are not likely to profit by the dispensations of Providence. The righteous shall be glad in the Lord; not glad of the misery and ruin of their fellow-creatures, but glad that God is glorified, and his word fulfilled, and the cause of injured innocence pleaded effectually. They rejoice not in men, nor in themselves, nor in any creature, or creature enjoyments, nor in their wisdom, strength, riches, or righteousness; but in Christ, in whom all the seed of Israel are justified and glory, and in what he is to them, and has done for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But God shall shoot at them with an arrow - That is, Instead of their being able to carry out their purposes of shooting the arrows which they had prepared against others, God will shoot his arrows against them. The tables will be turned. They themselves will experience what they had intended to inflict on others. God will deal with them as they intended to deal with others. The sentiment here is substantially the same as in <a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>; see the notes at that passage. It is also in accordance with what we often find in the writings of David, when in the close of a psalm he expresses a confident expectation that the prayer which he had offered in the beginning would be heard, or rejoices in the assurance that he had been heard. The idea, also, is involved in this part of the psalm that God will deal with men as they purpose to deal with others; that is, according to their true character. Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25-26</a>.<p>Suddenly shall they be wounded - Margin, their wound shall be. The Hebrew is, "Suddenly shall be their wounds." The idea is, that the wounds in the case would be theirs; and would be inflicted suddenly. The blows which they thought to give to others would come on themselves, and this would occur at an unexpected moment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/64.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

They shoot, and shall be shot. A greater archer than they are shall take sure aim at their hearts. One of his arrows shall be enough, for he never misses his aim. The Lord turns the fables on his adversaries, and defeats them at their own weapons. "Suddenly shall they be wounded." They were looking to, surprise the saint, but, lo! they are taken at unawares themselves; they desired to inflict deadly wounds, and are smitten themselves with wounds which none can heal. While they were bending their bows, the great Lord had prepared his bow already, and he let slip the shaft when least they looked for such an unsparing messenger of justice. "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." The righteous need not learn the arts of self-defence or of attack, their avenge went is in better hands than their own.<p><a href="/psalms/64-8.htm">Psalm 64:8</a><p>"So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves." Their slander shall recoil. Their curses shall come home to roost. Their tongue shall cut their throats. It was both sword, and bow and arrow; it shall be turned against them, and bring home to them full punishment. "All that see them shall flee away." Afraid, both of them and their overthrow, their former friends shall give them wide space, lest they perish with them. Who cares to go near to Herod when the worms are eating him? or to be in the same chariot with Pharaoh when the waves roar round him? Those who crowded around a powerful persecutor, and cringed at his feet, are among the first to desert him in the day of wrath. Woe unto you, ye liars! Who will desire fellowship with you in your seething lake of fire?<p><a href="/psalms/64-9.htm">Psalm 64:9</a><p>"And all men shall fear." They shall be filled with awe by the just judgments of God, as the Canaanites were by the overthrow of Pharaoh at the Red Sea. Those who might have been bold in sin shall be made to tremble and to stand in awe of the righteous Judge. "And shall declare the work of God." It shall become the subject of general conversation. So strange, so pointed, so terrible shall be the Lord's overthrow of the malicious, that it shall be spoken of in all companies. They sinned secretly, but their punishment shall be wrought before the face of the sun. "For they shall wisely consider of his doing." The judgments of God are frequently so clear and manifest that men cannot mis-read them, and if they have any thought at all, they must extract the true teaching from them. Some of the divine judgments are a great deep, but in the case of malicious persecutors the matter is plain enough, and the most illiterate can understand.<p><a href="/psalms/64-10.htm">Psalm 64:10</a><p>"The righteous shall be glad in the Lord." Admiring his justice and fully acquiescing in its displays, they shall also rejoice at the rescue of injured innocence yet, their joy shall not be selfish or sensual, but altogether in reference to the Lord. "And shall trust in him." Their observation of providence shall increase their faith; since he who fulfils his threatenings will not forget his promises. "And all the upright in heart shall glory." The victory of the oppressed shall be the victory of all upright men; the whole host of the elect shall rejoice in the triumph of virtue. While strangers fear, the children are glad in view of their Father's power and justice. That which alarms the evil, cheers the good.

The infinitive noun &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; signifies a complaint, expressed not by the tones of pain, but in words. The rendering of the lxx (here and in <a href="/psalms/55-3.htm">Psalm 55:3</a>) is too general, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;. The "terror" of the enemy is that proceeding from him (gen. obj. as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-15.htm">Deuteronomy 2:15</a>, and frequently). The generic singular &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; is at once particularized in a more detailed description with the use of the plural. &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; is a club or clique; &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (Targumic  equals  &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/30-10.htm">Ezekiel 30:10</a>) a noisy crowd.
