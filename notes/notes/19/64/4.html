The tongue is a little member, but it boasts great things. The upright man is the mark at which the wicked aim, they cannot speak peaceably either of him or to him. There is no guard against a false tongue. It is bad to do wrong, but worse to encourage ourselves and one another in it. It is a sign that the heart is hardened to the greatest degree, when it is thus fully set to do evil. A practical disbelief of God's knowledge of all things, is at the bottom of every wickedness. The benefit of a good cause and a good conscience, appears most when nothing can help a man against his enemies, save God alone, who is always a present help.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That they may shoot in secret - From an unobserved quarter; from a place where they are so concealed that it cannot be known where the arrows come from.

Meaning himself, who though not without sin, and far from perfection in himself, in the sight of God and with respect to his righteous law, which was exceeding broad; and therefore he saw an end of all perfection, and desired that God would not enter into judgment with him; but yet, in the case of Saul, he was quite clear and innocent, and without fault. Likewise the Messiah, of whom David was a type, may be meant; who has all the perfections of the divine and human nature in him, and is without sin, holy, harmless, pure, and undefiled: and it may be applied to the church and people of God, who, though they are not perfect in themselves, far from it, sin being in them, and their graces weak; unless it be in a comparative sense; yet they are perfect in Christ Jesus, their souls being clothed with his righteousness, and so are the spirits of just men made perfect. And this character may also respect the truth and sincerity of grace in them, and the uprightness of their hearts and conversation; and such as these wicked men level their arrows at, and direct their spite and venom against, and that in the most private and secret manner; <p>suddenly do they shoot at him; as unseen by him, so unawares to him; <p>and fear not; neither God nor judgment to come. Though some understand this of the perfect who, though shot at in this manner are intrepid and courageous, and have no fear of their enemies; but the former sense seems best, which describes persons that neither fear God, nor regard man. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/64.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> fear not.</span><p>(e) To be without fear of God and reverence of man, is a sign of reprobation.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/64.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">That</span> they <span class="ital">may shoot</span>] Cp. <a href="/psalms/11-2.htm" title="For, see, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow on the string, that they may privately shoot at the upright in heart.">Psalm 11:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in secret</span>] R.V., in secret places, as <a href="/psalms/10-8.htm" title="He sits in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places does he murder the innocent: his eyes are privately set against the poor.">Psalm 10:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/17-12.htm" title="Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.">Psalm 17:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the perfect</span>] The upright, blameless man, an epithet often applied to Job (<a href="/job/1-1.htm" title="There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.">Job 1:1</a>, &c.).

It is open to question whether &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492; is intended to be referred, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-17.htm">Psalm 35:17</a>, to the persecuted one (to destroy my life), or, with Hupfeld, to the persecutors (to their own destruction, they themselves for destruction). If the former reference to the persecuted be adopted, we ought, in order to give prominence to the evidently designed antithesis to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-9.htm">Psalm 63:9</a>, to translate: those, however, who..., shall go down into the depths of the earth (Bttcher, and others); a rendering which is hazardous as regards the syntax, after &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; and in connection with this position of the words. Therefore translate: On the other hand, those, to (their own) ruin do they seek my soul. It is true this ought properly to be expressed by &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1501;, but the absence of the suffix is less hazardous than the above relative rendering of &#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;. What follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-10.htm">Psalm 63:10-11</a> is the expansion of &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;. The futures from &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; onwards are to be taken as predictive, not as imprecatory; the former accords better with the quiet, gentle character of the whole song.

The enallage is like <a href="/psalms/5-10.htm">Psalm 5:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/7-2.htm">Psalm 7:2</a>., and frequently: the singular refers to each individual of the homogeneous multitude, or to this multitude itself as a concrete persona moralis. The king, however, who is now banished from Jerusalem to the habitation of jackals, will, whilst they become a portion (&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;  equals  &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;), i.e., prey, of the jackals (vid., the fulfilment in <a href="/2_samuel/18-7.htm">2 Samuel 18:7</a>.), rejoice in Elohim. Every one who sweareth by Him shall boast himself. Theodoret understands this of swearing &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;. Hengstenberg compares the oath &#1495;&#1497; &#1508;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="/genesis/42-15.htm">Genesis 42:15</a>. Ewald also (217, f) assumes this explanation to be unquestionable. But the Israelite is to swear by the name of Jahve and by no other, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>, cf. <a href="/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>. If the king were meant, why was it not rather expressed by &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; &#1500;&#1493;, he who swears allegiance to him? The syntax does not help us to decide to what the &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; refers. Neinrich Moeller (1573) says of the &#1489;&#1493; as referred to the king: peregrinum est et coactum; and A. H. Franke in his Introductio in Psalterium says of it as referred to Elohim: coactum est. So far as the language is concerned, both references are admissible; but as regards the subject-matter, only the latter. The meaning, as everywhere else, is a searing by God. He who, without allowing himself to turn from it, swore by Elohim, the God of Israel, the God of David His anointed, and therefore acknowledged Him as the Being exalted above all things, shall boast himself or "glory," inasmuch as it shall be practically seen how well-founded and wise was this recognition. He shall glory, for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped, forcibly closed, viz., those who, together with confidence in the Christ of God, have by falsehood also undermined the reverence which is due to God Himself. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/64-1.htm">Psalm 64:1-10</a> closes very similarly, and hence is placed next in order. </body></html>
