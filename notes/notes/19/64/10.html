They rejoice at the vengeance executed on the wicked; but then their joy centres in the Lord: it is not at the ruin of the wicked, simply considered, but because of the glory of God's justice displayed therein, and of his grace and mercy to them. They rejoice in the Lord, because of what he is unto them, and because of what he has done for them; because of his righteousness they are clothed with, from whence they are denominated righteous ones; and because of the salvation he has wrought out for them; and they are the more affected with it when they see the calamities, woes, and destruction of wicked men; See Gill on <a href="/psalms/32-11.htm">Psalm 32:11</a>; <p>and shall trust in him; who is known by his judgments he executes on the wicked; and the more he is known, be it in what way it will, the more is he trusted in, <a href="/psalms/9-10.htm">Psalm 9:10</a>.

The infinitive noun &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; signifies a complaint, expressed not by the tones of pain, but in words. The rendering of the lxx (here and in <a href="/psalms/55-3.htm">Psalm 55:3</a>) is too general, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;. The "terror" of the enemy is that proceeding from him (gen. obj. as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-15.htm">Deuteronomy 2:15</a>, and frequently). The generic singular &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; is at once particularized in a more detailed description with the use of the plural. &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; is a club or clique; &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (Targumic  equals  &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/30-10.htm">Ezekiel 30:10</a>) a noisy crowd. The perfects after &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; affirm that which they now do as they have before done; cf. <a href="/psalms/140-4.htm">Psalm 140:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a>, where, as in this passage, the treading or bending of the bow is transferred to the arrow. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1502;&#1512; is the interpretation added to the figure, as in <a href="/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7</a>. That which is bitter is called &#1502;&#1512;, root &#1502;&#1512;, stringere, from the harsh astringent taste; here it is used tropically of speech that wounds and inflicts pain (after the manner of an arrow or a stiletto), &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;. With the Kal &#1500;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="/psalms/11-2.htm">Psalm 11:2</a>) alternates the Hiph. &#1497;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;.
