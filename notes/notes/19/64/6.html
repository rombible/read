The tongue is a little member, but it boasts great things. The upright man is the mark at which the wicked aim, they cannot speak peaceably either of him or to him. There is no guard against a false tongue. It is bad to do wrong, but worse to encourage ourselves and one another in it. It is a sign that the heart is hardened to the greatest degree, when it is thus fully set to do evil. A practical disbelief of God's knowledge of all things, is at the bottom of every wickedness. The benefit of a good cause and a good conscience, appears most when nothing can help a man against his enemies, save God alone, who is always a present help.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They search out iniquities - They search deep; they examine plans; they rack their invention to accomplish it. The original word - &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;  cha&#770;phas&#769; - is a word which is used to denote the act of exploring - as when one searches for treasure, or for anything that is hidden or lost - implying a deep and close attention of the mind to the subject. So here they examined every plan, or every way which was suggested to them, by which they could hope to accomplish their purpose.<p>They accomplish - This would be better translated by rendering it, "We have perfected it!" That is, We have found it out; it is complete; meaning that they had found a plan to their liking. It is the language of self-congratulatlon.<p>A diligent search - Or rather, "The search is a deep search." In other words, "The plan is a consummate plan; it is just to our mind; it is exactly what we have sought to find." This, too, is language of self-congratulation and satisfaction at the plan which they had thought of, and which was so exactly to their mind.<p>Both the inward thought - literally, the inside; that is, the hidden design.<p>And the heart - The plan formed in the heart; the secret purpose.<p>Is deep - A deep-laid scheme; a plan that indicates profound thought; a purpose that is the result of consummate sagacity. This is the language of the author of the psalm. He admitted that there had been great talent and skill in the formation of the plan. Hence, it was that he cried so earnestly to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/64.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

It is open to question whether &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492; is intended to be referred, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-17.htm">Psalm 35:17</a>, to the persecuted one (to destroy my life), or, with Hupfeld, to the persecutors (to their own destruction, they themselves for destruction). If the former reference to the persecuted be adopted, we ought, in order to give prominence to the evidently designed antithesis to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-9.htm">Psalm 63:9</a>, to translate: those, however, who..., shall go down into the depths of the earth (Bttcher, and others); a rendering which is hazardous as regards the syntax, after &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; and in connection with this position of the words. Therefore translate: On the other hand, those, to (their own) ruin do they seek my soul. It is true this ought properly to be expressed by &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1501;, but the absence of the suffix is less hazardous than the above relative rendering of &#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;. What follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-10.htm">Psalm 63:10-11</a> is the expansion of &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;. The futures from &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; onwards are to be taken as predictive, not as imprecatory; the former accords better with the quiet, gentle character of the whole song.

The enallage is like <a href="/psalms/5-10.htm">Psalm 5:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/7-2.htm">Psalm 7:2</a>., and frequently: the singular refers to each individual of the homogeneous multitude, or to this multitude itself as a concrete persona moralis. The king, however, who is now banished from Jerusalem to the habitation of jackals, will, whilst they become a portion (&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;  equals  &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;), i.e., prey, of the jackals (vid., the fulfilment in <a href="/2_samuel/18-7.htm">2 Samuel 18:7</a>.), rejoice in Elohim. Every one who sweareth by Him shall boast himself. Theodoret understands this of swearing &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;. Hengstenberg compares the oath &#1495;&#1497; &#1508;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="/genesis/42-15.htm">Genesis 42:15</a>. Ewald also (217, f) assumes this explanation to be unquestionable. But the Israelite is to swear by the name of Jahve and by no other, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>, cf. <a href="/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>. If the king were meant, why was it not rather expressed by &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; &#1500;&#1493;, he who swears allegiance to him? The syntax does not help us to decide to what the &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; refers. Neinrich Moeller (1573) says of the &#1489;&#1493; as referred to the king: peregrinum est et coactum; and A. H. Franke in his Introductio in Psalterium says of it as referred to Elohim: coactum est. So far as the language is concerned, both references are admissible; but as regards the subject-matter, only the latter. The meaning, as everywhere else, is a searing by God. He who, without allowing himself to turn from it, swore by Elohim, the God of Israel, the God of David His anointed, and therefore acknowledged Him as the Being exalted above all things, shall boast himself or "glory," inasmuch as it shall be practically seen how well-founded and wise was this recognition. He shall glory, for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped, forcibly closed, viz., those who, together with confidence in the Christ of God, have by falsehood also undermined the reverence which is due to God Himself. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/64-1.htm">Psalm 64:1-10</a> closes very similarly, and hence is placed next in order. </body></html>
