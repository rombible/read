Some think this was fulfilled in the death of Saul, when not only his army was dispersed, but the inhabitants of the neighbouring country were so terrified with his fall, and with that of his three sons, that they quitted their cities and fled, <a href="/1_samuel/31-7.htm" title="And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelled in them.">1 Samuel 31:7</a>. <span class="ital">And all men shall fear</span> — A great number of those who shall see this event shall be affected with a holy awe of God upon the consideration of it, and shall fear and tremble because of his judgments; shall fear being found persecutors of God’s people. <span class="ital">And shall declare the work of God — </span>His admirable work of divine wisdom, power, and faithfulness; they shall speak one to another, and to all about them, of the justice of God in punishing persecutors. <span class="ital">For they shall wisely consider of his doing — </span>Learning wisdom by the folly and misery of these persecutors, and avoiding those evil courses which brought ruin upon them. There is need of consideration and serious thought, rightly to take up such a matter of fact, and need of wisdom to put a true interpretation upon it. What God does is well worth our considering, <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm" title="Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>.

Those who love cursing, it shall come upon them. Those who behold this shall understand, and observe God's hand in all; unless we do so, we are not likely to profit by the dispensations of Providence. The righteous shall be glad in the Lord; not glad of the misery and ruin of their fellow-creatures, but glad that God is glorified, and his word fulfilled, and the cause of injured innocence pleaded effectually. They rejoice not in men, nor in themselves, nor in any creature, or creature enjoyments, nor in their wisdom, strength, riches, or righteousness; but in Christ, in whom all the seed of Israel are justified and glory, and in what he is to them, and has done for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves - In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/64-3.htm">Psalm 64:3</a>, their tongue is represented as a sword; and here, keeping up the figure, the tongue, as a sword, is represented as falling on them, or as inflicting the wound on themselves which they had intended to inflict on others. This might be rendered, "And they have cast him down; upon them is their own tongue;" or, "Upon them their own tongue has come." That is, someone would cast them down, and they would fall as if smitten by their own tongue like a sword. It is not said who would do this, but the most natural interpretation is that it would be done by God. The idea is, that the instrument which they had employed to injure others would be the means of their own ruin.<p>All that see them shall flee away - Compare <a href="/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a>. That is, they shall flee in consternation from those who are so fearfully overthrown. They shall see that God is just, and that He will punish the wicked; and they will desire to escape from a ruin so dreadful as that which comes upon the ungodly. The idea is, that when God punishes sinners, the effect on others is, and should be, to lead them to wish not to be associated with such people, but to escape from a doom so fearful. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/64.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. their &#8230; tongue to fall, &c.&#8212;that is, the consequences of their slanders, &c.

The evil things they have wished for, threatened unto, and imprecated on others, shall come upon themselves; the curses they have cursed others with shall come upon themselves; the pit they have dug for others, they fall into. So Haman, to whom some apply the psalm, was hanged on the gallows he made for Mordecai; and the accusers of Daniel, to whom others apply it, were cast into the same den of lions they procured for him; and Babylon, who has been drunk with the blood of the saints, shall have blood given her to drink. <p>all that see them shall flee away; not being able to help them, nor to bear the horrible sight, and fearing the same judgments should fall on themselves; see <a href="/numbers/16-34.htm">Numbers 16:34</a>. Or, "they shall move themselves" (d); shake their heads in a way of derision, as Jarchi interprets it; or skip for joy, as the word is rendered in <a href="/jeremiah/48-27.htm">Jeremiah 48:27</a>; and then it must be understood of the righteous; who, seeing the vengeance on the wicked, rejoice, as in <a href="/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a>; though, as they are afterwards particularly mentioned, others seem to be designed. The word is used for lamenting and bemoaning one's self, in <a href="/jeremiah/31-18.htm">Jeremiah 31:18</a>; and so may be applied to the friends of the wicked lamenting and bemoaning their ruin, and their being bereaved of them, <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9</a>. <p>(d) "amovebunt se", Montanus; "commovebuntur", Vatablus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/64.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> flee away.</span><p>(h) To see God's heavy judgments against them, and how he has caught them in their own snares.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/64.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves</span>] An untenable rendering of an obscure sentence.

Selah.">Psalm 57:6</a>. Their tongue, the weapon with which they sought to destroy others, is turned against themselves. Ahithophel’s fate may serve for illustration. Possible, but less satisfactory, is the rendering of R.V. marg.: <span class="ital">So shall they against whom their tongue was make them to stumble</span>.
