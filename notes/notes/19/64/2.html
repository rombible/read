The tongue is a little member, but it boasts great things. The upright man is the mark at which the wicked aim, they cannot speak peaceably either of him or to him. There is no guard against a false tongue. It is bad to do wrong, but worse to encourage ourselves and one another in it. It is a sign that the heart is hardened to the greatest degree, when it is thus fully set to do evil. A practical disbelief of God's knowledge of all things, is at the bottom of every wickedness. The benefit of a good cause and a good conscience, appears most when nothing can help a man against his enemies, save God alone, who is always a present help.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hide me - Or, more literally, thou wilt hide me. There is both an implied prayer that this might be done, and a confident belief that it would be done. The idea is, Protect me; guard me; make me safe - as one is who is hidden or concealed so that his enemies cannot find him.<p>From the secret counsel - The word used here - &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;  so&#770;d - means properly couch, cushion; and then, a divan, a circle of friends sitting together on couches for familiar conversation, or for counsel. See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-14.htm">Psalm 55:14</a>, note; compare <a href="/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>; <a href="/job/29-4.htm">Job 29:4</a>. Here the reference is to the consultations of his enemies for the purpose of doing him wrong. Of course, as they took this counsel together, he could not know it, and the word secret is not improperly applied to it. The idea here is, that although he did not know what that counsel or purpose was, or what was the result of their consultations, yet God knew, and he could guard him against it.<p>Of the wicked - Not the wicked in general, but his particular foes who were endeavoring to destroy him. Luther renders this, "from the assembling of the wicked."<p>From the insurrection - The word used here - &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;  rigsha&#770;h - means properly a "noisy crowd, a multitude." The allusion is to such a crowd, such a disorderly and violent rabble, as constituted a mob. He was in danger not only from the secret purposes of the more calm and thoughtful of his enemies who were plotting against him, but from the excited passions of the multitude, and thus his life was in double danger. If he escaped the one, he had no security that he would escape the other. So the Redeemer was exposed to a double danger. There was the danger arising from the secret plottings of the Scribes and Pharisees assembled in council, and there was also the danger arising from the infuriated passions of the multitude. The former calmly laid the plan for putting him to death by a judicial trial; the others took up stones to stone him, or cried, "Crucify him, crucify him!" The word insurrection here does not well express the idea. The word tumult would better represent the meaning of the original.<p>Of the workers of iniquity - That is, of those who were arrayed against him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/64.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. insurrection&#8212;literally, "uproar," noisy assaults, as well as their secret counsels.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/64.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">From the secret counsel, </span> i.e. from the ill effects of their plots against me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/64.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked,.... The word used denotes both the place where wicked men meet together for consultation; see <a href="/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6</a>; and the counsel itself they there take; from the bad effects of which the psalmist desired to be hid and preserved. So Saul and his courtiers secretly took counsel against David, and the Jews against Christ, and that very privily and secretly; see <a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3</a>; <p>from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity; their noise, rage, and tumult; see <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>. The former phrase denotes their secret machinations and designs, and this their open violence; and the persons that entered into such measures are no other than evildoers and workers of iniquity; though they might be under a profession of religion, as David's enemies, and the Jews, who were Christ's enemies, were, <a href="/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>; and who are further described in the next verses. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/64.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hide me from the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> secret counsel of the wicked; from the <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> insurrection of the workers of iniquity:</span><p>(b) That is, from their secret malice.<p>(c) That is, their outward violence.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/64.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>.

The first danger is from secret plots, which David knows to be going on against his authority (<a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-12</a>). The second, and greater danger, will be from open insurrection (<a href="/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1-14</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/63.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This strophe again takes up the &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; (<a href="/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a>): thus ardently longing, for all time to come also, is he set towards God, with such fervent longing after God will he bless Him in his life, i.e., entirely filling up his life therewith (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; as in <a href="/psalms/104-33.htm">Psalm 104:33</a>; <a href="/psalms/146-2.htm">Psalm 146:2</a>; cf. Baruch 4:20, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), and in His name, i.e., invoking it and appealing to it, will he lift up his hands in prayer. The being occupied with God makes him, even though as now in the desert he is obliged to suffer bodily hunger, satisfied and cheerful like the fattest and most marrowy food: velut adipe et pinguedine satiatur anima mea. From <a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-25.htm">Leviticus 7:25</a>, Grussetius and Frisch infer that spiritualies epulae are meant. And certainly the poet cannot have had the sacrificial feasts (Hupfeld) in his mind; for the &#1495;&#1500;&#1489; of the shelamim is put upon the altar, and is removed from the part to be eaten. Moreover, however, even the Tra does not bind itself in its expression to the letter of that prohibition of the fat of animals, vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/31-14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a>. So here also the expression "with marrow and fat" is the designation of a feast prepared from well-fed, noble beasts. He feels himself satisfied in his inmost nature just as after a feast of the most nourishing and dainty meats, and with lips of jubilant songs (accus. instrum. according to Ges. 138, rem. 3), i.e., with lips jubilant and attuned to song, shall his mouth sing praise. What now follows in <a href="/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a> we no longer, as formerly, take as a protasis subsequently introduced (like <a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>.): "when I remembered...meditated upon Thee," but so that <a href="/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a> is the protasis and <a href="/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a> the apodosis, cf. <a href="/psalms/21-12.htm">Psalm 21:12</a>; <a href="/job/9-16.htm">Job 9:16</a> (Hitzig): When I remember Thee (meminerim, Ew. 355, b) upon my bed (stratis meis, as in <a href="/psalms/132-3.htm">Psalm 132:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>, cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>) - says he now as the twilight watch is passing gradually into the morning - I meditate upon Thee in the night-watches (Symmachus, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8; &#787; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;), or during, throughout the night-watches (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>); i.e., it is no passing remembrance, but it so holds me that I pass a great part of the night absorbed in meditation on Thee. He has no lack of matter for his meditation; for God has become a help (auxilio, vid., on <a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>) to him: He has rescued him in this wilderness, and, well concealed under the shadow of His wings (vid., on <a href="/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/57-2.htm">Psalm 57:2</a>), which affords him a cool retreat in the heat of conflict and protection against his persecutors, he is able to exult (&#1488;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503;, the potential). Between himself and God there subsists a reciprocal relationship of active love. According to the schema of the crosswise position of words (Chiasmus), &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; intentionally jostle close against one another: he depends upon God, following close behind Him, i.e., following Him everywhere and not leaving Him when He wishes to avoid him; and on the other side God's right hand holds him fast, not letting him go, not abandoning him to his foes. </body></html>
