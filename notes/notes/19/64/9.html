Those who love cursing, it shall come upon them. Those who behold this shall understand, and observe God's hand in all; unless we do so, we are not likely to profit by the dispensations of Providence. The righteous shall be glad in the Lord; not glad of the misery and ruin of their fellow-creatures, but glad that God is glorified, and his word fulfilled, and the cause of injured innocence pleaded effectually. They rejoice not in men, nor in themselves, nor in any creature, or creature enjoyments, nor in their wisdom, strength, riches, or righteousness; but in Christ, in whom all the seed of Israel are justified and glory, and in what he is to them, and has done for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/64.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And all men shall fear - That is, a deep impression would be made, not only on the associates and companions of the wicked, but on all that should hear of what was done. People, in view of the just punishment of the wicked, would learn to reverence God, and to stand in awe of One so powerful and so just. Judgments, punishment, wrath, are adapted and designed to make a deep impression on mankind. On this principle, the final punishment of the wicked will make a deep and salutary impression on the universe forever.<p>And shall declare the work of God - Shall make it known to others. It will become a subject of conversation, or they will talk about it, as illustrating the divine perfections and character. Such should always be the effect of the judgments of God, for they illustrate his true character; they make known his attributes; they convey to the world lessons of the utmost importance. Nothing is more proper than to talk about the judgments of God, and to endeavor to derive from them the instructions which they are adapted to convey about the divine nature, and the principles of the administration under which the universe is placed. Wars, pestilences, famines, earthquakes, conflagrations, inundations, diseases, all teach important lessons about God; and each one bears its own special message to mankind.<p>For they shall wisely consider of his doing - They shall attentively and carefully consider it; they shall endeavor to derive such lessons from his dealings as they are suited to convey. In other words, an attentive consideration of his doings will contribute to maintain a just knowledge of world in subjection to him. God is thus always speaking to human beings; and nothing is more proper for human beings than to give their minds to a careful consideration of what is really intended to be taught us by the events which are occurring in his providential dealings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/64.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10.

The infinitive noun &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; signifies a complaint, expressed not by the tones of pain, but in words. The rendering of the lxx (here and in <a href="/psalms/55-3.htm">Psalm 55:3</a>) is too general, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;. The "terror" of the enemy is that proceeding from him (gen. obj. as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-15.htm">Deuteronomy 2:15</a>, and frequently). The generic singular &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; is at once particularized in a more detailed description with the use of the plural. &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; is a club or clique; &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (Targumic  equals  &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/30-10.htm">Ezekiel 30:10</a>) a noisy crowd. The perfects after &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; affirm that which they now do as they have before done; cf. <a href="/psalms/140-4.htm">Psalm 140:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a>, where, as in this passage, the treading or bending of the bow is transferred to the arrow. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1502;&#1512; is the interpretation added to the figure, as in <a href="/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7</a>. That which is bitter is called &#1502;&#1512;, root &#1502;&#1512;, stringere, from the harsh astringent taste; here it is used tropically of speech that wounds and inflicts pain (after the manner of an arrow or a stiletto), &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;.
