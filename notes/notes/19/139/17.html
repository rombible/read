With these in his mind he lay down at night, and when he awoke in the morning his thoughts naturally recurred to the pleasing theme.

We cannot think how many mercies we have received from him. It would help to keep us in the fear of the Lord all the day long, if, when we wake in the morning, our first thoughts were of him: and how shall we admire and bless our God for his precious salvation, when we awake in the world of glory! Surely we ought not to use our members and senses, which are so curiously fashioned, as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin. But our immortal and rational souls are a still more noble work and gift of God. Yet if it were not for his precious thoughts of love to us, our reason and our living for ever would, through our sins, prove the occasion of our eternal misery. How should we then delight to meditate on God's love to sinners in Jesus Christ, the sum of which exceeds all reckoning! Sin is hated, and sinners lamented, by all who fear the Lord. Yet while we shun them we should pray for them; with God their conversion and salvation are possible. As the Lord knows us thoroughly, and we are strangers to ourselves, we should earnestly desire and pray to be searched and proved by his word and Spirit. if there be any wicked way in me, let me see it; and do thou root it out of me. The way of godliness is pleasing to God, and profitable to us; and will end in everlasting life. It is the good old way. All the saints desire to be kept and led in this way, that they may not miss it, turn out of it, or tire in it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/139.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! - On the word "thoughts," see the notes at <a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>. Compare <a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23</a>. The remark is made here doubtless in view of the numberless "thoughts" involved in planning and forming a frame so wondrous, and in the care necessary to bring it to perfection; to develop it; to provide for it; to guard and defend it. How many "thoughts" of a parent are employed in behalf of his children, in providing for them; teaching them; counseling them; anticipating their needs. How manymore thoughts are needful on the part of God in reference to each one of us: for there are numberless things necessary for us which cannot occupy the mind of a parent, since he cannot accomplish these things for us; they do not lie within his province, or in his power.<p>How great is the sum of them - literally, "How strong are the heads of them." That is, The heading of them, or the summing of them up, would be a task beyond the power of man. And who "could" estimate the number of the "thoughts" necessarily bestowed on himself by his Maker in all the care exercised over him; all the arrangements for his development and growth; all that is done to defend him from danger; all that is indispensable in providing for his needs; all that was necessary to secure the salvation of his soul!

The word (r) signifies that which is scarce and rare, and not to be attained and enjoyed; see <a href="/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>; the thoughts and counsels of God are impenetrable and unsearchable; he knows our thoughts, as Aben Ezra observes, but we do not know his, <a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>; as well as it likewise signifies the worth and value of them; God's thoughts are infinitely beyond ours, and infinitely more valuable and more important, and are concerning our welfare and happiness: it is marvellous that God should think of us at all; it is more so that his thoughts should not be thoughts of evil, to bring that evil upon its we deserve, but thoughts of peace and reconciliation in and by his Son, in whom he was reconciling the world to himself; thoughts of salvation and eternal life, and of the way and means of bringing it about; thoughts to provide for our present supply in this world, and to lay up for us for the world to come; see <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>. It may be interpreted of the thoughts which David had of God in his meditations of him, which were sweet, precious, and comfortable to him; of his lovingkindness to him, covenant grace, precious promises, and gracious dealings with him; but the former sense seems best.

Pennae aurorae, Eugubinus observes (1548), est velocissimus aurorae per omnem mundum decursus. It is therefore to be rendered: If I should lift wings (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1499;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-16.htm">Ezekiel 10:16</a>, and frequently) such as the dawn of the morning has, i.e., could I fly with the swiftness with which the dawn of the morning spreads itself over the eastern sky, towards the extreme west and alight there. Heaven and Hades, as being that which is superterrestrial and subterrestrial, and the east and west are set over against one another. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497;&#1501; is the extreme end of the sea (of the Mediterranean with the "isles of the Gentiles"). In <a href="/psalms/139-10.htm">Psalm 139:10</a> follows the apodosis: nowhere is the hand of God, which governs everything, to be escaped, for dextera Dei ubique est. &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (not &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, <a href="/ezekiel/13-15.htm">Ezekiel 13:15</a>), "therefore I spake," also has the value of a hypothetical protasis: quodsi dixerim. &#1488;&#1498; and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; belongs together: merae tenebrae (vid: <a href="/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a>.); but &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; is obscure. The signification secured to it of conterere, contundere, in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>, which is followed by the lxx (Vulgate) &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, is inappropriate to darkness. The signification inhiare, which may be deduced as possible from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, suits relatively better, yet not thoroughly well (why should it not have been &#1497;&#1489;&#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;?). The signification obvelare, however, which one expects to find, and after which the Targum, Symmachus, Jerome, Saadia, and others render it, seems only to be guessed at from the connection, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; has not this signification in any other instance, and in favour of it we cannot appeal either to &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507; - whence &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;, which belongs together with &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, and &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; - or to &#1506;&#1496;&#1507;, the root of which is &#1506;&#1514; (&#1506;&#1514;&#1492;), or to &#1510;&#1506;&#1507;, whence &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1507;, which does not signify to cover, veil, but according to Arab. d&#803;&#8219;f, to fold, fold together, to double. We must therefore either assign to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; the signification operiat me without being able to prove it, or we must put a verb of this signification in its place, viz., &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497; (Ewald) or &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; (Bttcher), which latter is the more commendable here, where darkness (&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, synon. &#1506;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;) is the subject: and if I should say, let nothing but darkness cover me, and as night (the predicate placed first, as in <a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>) let the light become about me, i.e., let the light become night that shall surround and cover me (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, poetic for &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>) -  the darkness would spread abroad no obscurity (<a href="/psalms/105-28.htm">Psalm 105:28</a>) that should extend beyond (&#1502;&#1503;) Thy piercing eye and remove me from Thee. In the word &#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512;, too, the Hiphil signification is not lost: the night would give out light from itself, as if it were the day; for the distinction of day and night has no conditioning influence upon God, who is above and superior to all created things (der Uebercreatrliche), who is light in Himself. The two &#1499; are correlative, as e.g., in <a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4</a>. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492; (with a superfluous Jod) is an old word, but &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; (cf. Aramaic &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;) is a later one. </body></html>
