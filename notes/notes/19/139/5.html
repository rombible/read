It is more profitable to meditate on Divine truths, applying them to our own cases, and with hearts lifted to God in prayer, than with a curious or disputing frame of mind. That God knows all things, is omniscient; that he is every where, is omnipresent; are truths acknowledged by all, yet they are seldom rightly believed in by mankind. God takes strict notice of every step we take, every right step and every by step. He knows what rule we walk by, what end we walk toward, what company we walk with. When I am withdrawn from all company, thou knowest what I have in my heart. There is not a vain word, not a good word, but thou knowest from what thought it came, and with what design it was uttered. Wherever we are, we are under the eye and hand of God. We cannot by searching find how God searches us out; nor do we know how we are known. Such thoughts should restrain us from sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/139.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast beset me behind and before - The word rendered "beset" - &#1510;&#1493;&#1512;  tsu&#770;r - means properly to press; to press upon; to compress. It has reference commonly to the siege of a city, or to the pressing on of troops in war; and then it comes to mean to besiege, hem in, closely surround, so that there is no way of escape. This is the idea here - that God was on every side of him; that he could not escape in any direction. He was like a garrison besieged in a city so that there was no means of escape. There is a transition here (not an unnatural one), from the idea of the Omniscience of God to that of His Omnipresence, and the remarks which follow have a main reference to the latter.<p>And laid thine hand upon me - That is, If I try to escape in any direction I find thine band laid upon me there. Escape is impossible. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/139.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 139<p>Ps 139:1-24. After presenting the sublime doctrines of God's omnipresence and omniscience, the Psalmist appeals to Him, avowing his innocence, his abhorrence of the wicked, and his ready submission to the closest scrutiny. Admonition to the wicked and comfort to the pious are alike implied inferences from these doctrines.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast beset me behind and before, </span> with thine all-seeing and all-disposing providence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And laid thine hand upon me; </span> thou keepest me, as it were, with a strong hand, in thy sight and under thy power. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/139.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou hast beset me behind and before,.... Art on every side of me, all around me, like one besieged in a strait place; so that there is nothing I can think, say, or do, but what is known unto thee. The two Kimchis, father and son, render the word, "thou hast formed me": and interpret it of the formation of his body, of which, in <a href="/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a>; see <a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a> but it denotes how God compasses men with his presence and providence, so that nothing escapes his knowledge; <p>and laid thine hand upon me; not his afflicting hand, which sometimes presses hard; though the Targum thus paraphrases it, <p>"and stirred against me the stroke of thine hand:'' <p>but rather his hand of power and providence, to preserve, protect, and defend him. Or it signifies that he was so near to him that his hand was upon him, and he was perfectly known; as anything is that is before a man, and he has his hand upon. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/139.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> hand upon me.</span><p>(d) You so guide me with your hand, that I can turn no way, but where you appoint me.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/139.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">beset me</span>] The word is used of besieging a town.

The beginning of this strophe calls <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a> to mind. Though his way may lead through the midst of heart - oppressing trouble, Jahve will loose these bands of death and quicken him afresh (&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; as in <a href="/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a>, and frequently). Though his enemies may rage, Jahve will stretch forth His hand threateningly and tranquillizingly over their wrath, and His right hand will save him. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498; is the subject according to <a href="/psalms/139-10.htm">Psalm 139:10</a> and other passages, and not (for why should it be supposed to be this?) accus. instrumenti (vid., <a href="/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a>). In <a href="/psalms/138-8.htm">Psalm 138:8</a> &#1497;&#1490;&#1502;&#1512; is intended just as in <a href="/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a> : the word begun He will carry out, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>); and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; (according to its meaning, properly: covering me) is the same as &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; in that passage (cf. <a href="/psalms/13-6.htm">Psalm 13:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/142-8.htm">Psalm 142:8</a>). The pledge of this completion is Jahve's everlasting mercy, which will not rest until the promise is become perfect truth and reality. Thus, therefore, He will not leave, forsake the works of His hands (vid., <a href="/psalms/90-16.htm">Psalm 90:16</a>.), i.e., as Hengstenberg correctly explains, everything that He has hitherto accomplished for David, from his deliverance out of the hands of Saul down to the bestowment of the promise - He will not let one of His works stand still, and least of all one that has been so gloriously begun. &#1492;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; (whence &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1507;) signifies to slacken, to leave slack, i.e., leave uncarried out, to leave to itself, as in <a href="/nehemiah/6-3.htm">Nehemiah 6:3</a>. &#1488;&#1500; expresses a negation with a measure of inward excitement. </body></html>
