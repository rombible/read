We cannot think how many mercies we have received from him. It would help to keep us in the fear of the Lord all the day long, if, when we wake in the morning, our first thoughts were of him: and how shall we admire and bless our God for his precious salvation, when we awake in the world of glory! Surely we ought not to use our members and senses, which are so curiously fashioned, as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin. But our immortal and rational souls are a still more noble work and gift of God. Yet if it were not for his precious thoughts of love to us, our reason and our living for ever would, through our sins, prove the occasion of our eternal misery. How should we then delight to meditate on God's love to sinners in Jesus Christ, the sum of which exceeds all reckoning! Sin is hated, and sinners lamented, by all who fear the Lord. Yet while we shun them we should pray for them; with God their conversion and salvation are possible. As the Lord knows us thoroughly, and we are strangers to ourselves, we should earnestly desire and pray to be searched and proved by his word and Spirit. if there be any wicked way in me, let me see it; and do thou root it out of me. The way of godliness is pleasing to God, and profitable to us; and will end in everlasting life. It is the good old way. All the saints desire to be kept and led in this way, that they may not miss it, turn out of it, or tire in it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/139.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I hate them with perfect hatred - With no approval whatever of their conduct; with no sympathy for the evil they do; with no words of apology for their sinful acts; with entire disapprobation.<p>I count them mine enemies - As they are the enemies of God, so I regard them as my enemies.

After presenting the sublime doctrines of God's omnipresence and omniscience, the Psalmist appeals to Him, avowing his innocence, his abhorrence of the wicked, and his ready submission to the closest scrutiny. Admonition to the wicked and comfort to the pious are alike implied inferences from these doctrines.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I am no less grieved with their enmity against thee, than if they directed it against myself. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/139.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I hate them with perfect hatred,....

The energy of the Psalmist’s indignation seems to many readers to be a jarring note: yet it is but the limited and imperfect form in which he expresses his intense hatred of evil. “The duty of keeping alive in the human heart the sense of burning indignation against moral evil—against selfishness, against injustice, against untruth, in ourselves as well as in others,—that is as much a part of the Christian as of the Jewish dispensation.” Stanley, <span class="ital">Lect. on Jewish Church</span>, 1. p. 216 (Lect. xi), quoted by Kay.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/139.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I hate them with perfect hatred</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. with pure, absolute, intense hatred - a hatred commensurate with the love that he felt towards all God's saints<span class="cmt_word">.

(Psychology, S. 209ff., tr. pp. 247f.). On the words in libro tuo Bellarmine makes the following correct observation: quia habes apud te exemplaria sive ideas omnium, quomodo pictor vel sculptor scit ex informi materia quid futurum sit, quia videt exemplar. The signification of the future &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is regulated by &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, and becomes, as relating to the synchronous past, scribebantur. The days &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, which were already formed, are the subject. It is usually rendered: "the days which had first to be formed." If &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; could be equivalent to &#1497;&#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, it would be to be preferred; but this rejection of the praeform. fut. is only allowed in the fut. Piel of the verbs Pe Jod, and that after a Waw convertens, e.g., &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a> (cf. Caspari on <a href="/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>).<p>(Note: But outside the Old Testament it also occurs in the Pual, though as a wrong use of the word; vide my Anekdota (1841), S. 372f.)<p>Accordingly, assuming the original character of the &#1500;&#1488; in a negative signification, it is to be rendered: The days which were (already) formed, and there was not one among them, i.e., when none among them had as yet become a reality. The suffix of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; points to the succeeding &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, to which &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is appended as an attributive clause; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; is subordinated to this &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;: cum non or nondum (<a href="/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>) unus inter eos  equals  unus eorum (<a href="/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>) esset. But the expression (instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; or &#1496;&#1512;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;) remains doubtful, and it becomes a question whether the Ker &#1493;&#1500;&#1493; (vid., on <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>), which stands side by side with the Chethb &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; (which the lxx, Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, the Targum, Syriac, Jerome, and Saadia follow), is not to be preferred. This &#1493;&#1500;&#1493;, referred to &#1490;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;, gives the acceptable meaning: and for it (viz., its birth) one among them (these days), without our needing to make any change in the proposed exposition down to &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;. We decide in favour of this, because this &#1493;&#1500;&#1493; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1489;&#1492;&#1501; does not, as &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1489;&#1492;&#1501;, make one feel to miss any &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, and because the &#1493;&#1500;&#1497; which begins <a href="/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17</a> connects itself to it by way of continuation. The accentuation has failed to discern the reference of &#1499;&#1500;&#1501; to the following &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, inasmuch as it places Olewejored against &#1497;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;. Hupfeld follows this accentuation, referring &#1499;&#1500;&#1501; back to &#1490;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497; as a coil of days of one's life; and Hitzig does the same, referring it to the embryos. But the precedence of the relative pronoun occurs in other instances also, <p>(Note: The Hebrew poet, says Gesenius (Lehrgebude, S. 739f.), sometimes uses the pronoun before the thing to which it referred has even been spoken of. This phenomenon belongs to the Hebrew style generally, vid., my Anekdota (1841), S. 382.)<p>and is devoid of all harshness, especially in connection with &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, which directly signifies altogether (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/43-14.htm">Isaiah 43:14</a>).<p>It is the confession of the omniscience that is united with the omnipotence of God, which the poet here gives utterance to with reference to himself, just as Jahve says with reference to Jeremiah, <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>. Among the days which were preformed in the idea of God (cf. on &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;, <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a>) there was also one, says the poet, for the embryonic beginning of my life. The divine knowledge embraces the beginning, development, and completion of all things (Psychology, S. 37ff., tr. pp. 46ff.). The knowledge of the thoughts of God which are written in the book of creation and revelation is the poet's cherished possession, and to ponder over them is his favourite pursuit: they are precious to him, &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (after <a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>), not: difficult of comprehension (schwerbegreiflich, Maurer, Olshausen), after <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-11.htm">Daniel 2:11</a>, which would surely have been expressed by &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/psalms/92-6.htm">Psalm 92:6</a>), more readily: very weighty (schwergewichtig, Hitzig), but better according to the prevailing Hebrew usage: highly valued (schwergewerthet), cara.<p>(Note: It should be noted that the radical idea of the verb, viz., being heavy (German schwer), is retained in all these renderings. - Tr.)<p>"Their sums" are powerful, prodigious (<a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>), and cannot be brought to a summa summarum. If he desires to count them (fut. hypothet. as in <a href="/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7</a>; <a href="/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>), they prove themselves to be more than the sand with its grains, that is to say, innumerable. He falls asleep over the pondering upon them, wearied out; and when he wakes up, he is still with God, i.e., still ever absorbed in the contemplation of the Unsearchable One, which even the sleep of fatigue could not entirely interrupt. Ewald explains it somewhat differently: if I am lost in the stream of thoughts and images, and recover myself from this state of reverie, yet I am still ever with Thee, without coming to an end. But it could only perhaps be interpreted thus if it were &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; or &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. Hofmann's interpretation is altogether different: I will count them, the more numerous than the sand, when I awake and am continually with Thee, viz., in the other world, after the awaking from the sleep of death. This is at once impossible, because &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1510;&#1514;&#1497; cannot here, according to its position, be a perf. hypotheticum. Also in connection with this interpretation &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; would be an inappropriate expression for "continually," since the word only has the sense of the continual duration of an action or a state already existing; here of one that has not even been closed and broken off by sleep. He has not done; waking and dreaming and waking up, he is carried away by that endless, and yet also endlessly attractive, pursuit, the most fitting occupation of one who is awake, and the sweetest (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/31-26.htm">Jeremiah 31:26</a>) of one who is asleep and dreaming. </body></html>
