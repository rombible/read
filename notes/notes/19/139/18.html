We cannot think how many mercies we have received from him. It would help to keep us in the fear of the Lord all the day long, if, when we wake in the morning, our first thoughts were of him: and how shall we admire and bless our God for his precious salvation, when we awake in the world of glory! Surely we ought not to use our members and senses, which are so curiously fashioned, as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin. But our immortal and rational souls are a still more noble work and gift of God. Yet if it were not for his precious thoughts of love to us, our reason and our living for ever would, through our sins, prove the occasion of our eternal misery. How should we then delight to meditate on God's love to sinners in Jesus Christ, the sum of which exceeds all reckoning! Sin is hated, and sinners lamented, by all who fear the Lord. Yet while we shun them we should pray for them; with God their conversion and salvation are possible. As the Lord knows us thoroughly, and we are strangers to ourselves, we should earnestly desire and pray to be searched and proved by his word and Spirit. if there be any wicked way in me, let me see it; and do thou root it out of me. The way of godliness is pleasing to God, and profitable to us; and will end in everlasting life. It is the good old way. All the saints desire to be kept and led in this way, that they may not miss it, turn out of it, or tire in it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/139.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I should count them - If I could count them.<p>They are more in number than the sand - Numberless as the sand on the sea-shore.<p>When I awake, I am still with thee - When I am lost in deep and profound meditation on this subject, and am aroused again to consciousness, I find the same thing still true.

Thou art still the same; and the same unceasing care, the same thoughtfulness, still exists in regard to me. Or, the meaning may be, sleeping or waking with me, it is still the same in regard to thee. Thine eyes never close. When mine are closed in sleep, thou art round about me; when I awake from that unconscious state, I find the same thing existing still.

After presenting the sublime doctrines of God's omnipresence and omniscience, the Psalmist appeals to Him, avowing his innocence, his abhorrence of the wicked, and his ready submission to the closest scrutiny. Admonition to the wicked and comfort to the pious are alike implied inferences from these doctrines.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, by my thoughts and meditations.

So Pindar says (s), that sand flies number, that is, is not to be numbered; though the Pythian oracle boastingly said (t), I know the number of the sand, and the measures of the sea; to which Lucan (u) may have respect when he says, measure is not wanting to the ocean, nor number to the sand; hence geometricians affect to know them; so Archytas the mathematician, skilled in geometry and arithmetic, is described and derided by Horace (w) as the measurer of the earth and sea, and of the sand without number; and Archimedes wrote a book called (x), of the number of the sand, still extant (y), in which he proves that it is not infinite, but that if even the whole world was sand it might be numbered; but the thoughts of God are infinite; <p>when I wake, I am still with thee; after I have been reckoning them up all the day, and then fall asleep at night to refresh nature after such fatiguing researches; when I awake in the morning and go to it again, I am just where I was, and have got no further knowledge of God and his thoughts, and have as many to count as at first setting out, and far from coming to the end of them: or else the sense is, as I was under thine eye and care even in the womb, before I was born, so I have been ever since, and always am, whether sleeping or waking; I lay myself down and sleep in safety, and rise in the morning refreshed and healthful, and still continue the care of thy providence: it would be well if we always awaked with God in our thoughts, sensible of his favours, thankful for them, and enjoying his gracious presence; as it will be the happiness of the saints, that, when they shall awake in the resurrection morn, they shall be with God, and for ever enjoy him. <p>(s) Olymp.

Kirschianae, and Levy s.v. &#1504;&#1505;&#1511;). &#1488;&#1501; with the simple future is followed by cohortatives (vid., on <a href="/psalms/73-16.htm">Psalm 73:16</a>) with the equivalent &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; among them: et si stratum facerem (mihi) infernum (accusative of the object as in <a href="/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5</a>), etc. In other passages the wings of the sun (<a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>) and of the wind (<a href="/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>) are mentioned, here we have the wings of the morning's dawn. Pennae aurorae, Eugubinus observes (1548), est velocissimus aurorae per omnem mundum decursus. It is therefore to be rendered: If I should lift wings (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1499;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-16.htm">Ezekiel 10:16</a>, and frequently) such as the dawn of the morning has, i.e., could I fly with the swiftness with which the dawn of the morning spreads itself over the eastern sky, towards the extreme west and alight there. Heaven and Hades, as being that which is superterrestrial and subterrestrial, and the east and west are set over against one another. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497;&#1501; is the extreme end of the sea (of the Mediterranean with the "isles of the Gentiles"). In <a href="/psalms/139-10.htm">Psalm 139:10</a> follows the apodosis: nowhere is the hand of God, which governs everything, to be escaped, for dextera Dei ubique est. &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (not &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, <a href="/ezekiel/13-15.htm">Ezekiel 13:15</a>), "therefore I spake," also has the value of a hypothetical protasis: quodsi dixerim. &#1488;&#1498; and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; belongs together: merae tenebrae (vid: <a href="/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a>.); but &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; is obscure. The signification secured to it of conterere, contundere, in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>, which is followed by the lxx (Vulgate) &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, is inappropriate to darkness. The signification inhiare, which may be deduced as possible from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, suits relatively better, yet not thoroughly well (why should it not have been &#1497;&#1489;&#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;?). The signification obvelare, however, which one expects to find, and after which the Targum, Symmachus, Jerome, Saadia, and others render it, seems only to be guessed at from the connection, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; has not this signification in any other instance, and in favour of it we cannot appeal either to &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507; - whence &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;, which belongs together with &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, and &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; - or to &#1506;&#1496;&#1507;, the root of which is &#1506;&#1514; (&#1506;&#1514;&#1492;), or to &#1510;&#1506;&#1507;, whence &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1507;, which does not signify to cover, veil, but according to Arab. d&#803;&#8219;f, to fold, fold together, to double. We must therefore either assign to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; the signification operiat me without being able to prove it, or we must put a verb of this signification in its place, viz., &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497; (Ewald) or &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; (Bttcher), which latter is the more commendable here, where darkness (&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, synon. &#1506;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;) is the subject: and if I should say, let nothing but darkness cover me, and as night (the predicate placed first, as in <a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>) let the light become about me, i.e., let the light become night that shall surround and cover me (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, poetic for &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>) -  the darkness would spread abroad no obscurity (<a href="/psalms/105-28.htm">Psalm 105:28</a>) that should extend beyond (&#1502;&#1503;) Thy piercing eye and remove me from Thee. In the word &#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512;, too, the Hiphil signification is not lost: the night would give out light from itself, as if it were the day; for the distinction of day and night has no conditioning influence upon God, who is above and superior to all created things (der Uebercreatrliche), who is light in Himself. The two &#1499; are correlative, as e.g., in <a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4</a>. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492; (with a superfluous Jod) is an old word, but &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; (cf. Aramaic &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;) is a later one. </body></html>
