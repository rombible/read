We cannot think how many mercies we have received from him. It would help to keep us in the fear of the Lord all the day long, if, when we wake in the morning, our first thoughts were of him: and how shall we admire and bless our God for his precious salvation, when we awake in the world of glory! Surely we ought not to use our members and senses, which are so curiously fashioned, as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin. But our immortal and rational souls are a still more noble work and gift of God. Yet if it were not for his precious thoughts of love to us, our reason and our living for ever would, through our sins, prove the occasion of our eternal misery. How should we then delight to meditate on God's love to sinners in Jesus Christ, the sum of which exceeds all reckoning! Sin is hated, and sinners lamented, by all who fear the Lord. Yet while we shun them we should pray for them; with God their conversion and salvation are possible. As the Lord knows us thoroughly, and we are strangers to ourselves, we should earnestly desire and pray to be searched and proved by his word and Spirit. if there be any wicked way in me, let me see it; and do thou root it out of me. The way of godliness is pleasing to God, and profitable to us; and will end in everlasting life. It is the good old way. All the saints desire to be kept and led in this way, that they may not miss it, turn out of it, or tire in it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/139.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And see if there be any wicked way in me - Margin, "way of pain," or "grief." The Hebrew word properly means an image, an idol <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-5.htm">Isaiah 48:5</a>, but it also means pain, <a href="/1_chronicles/4-9.htm">1 Chronicles 4:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-3.htm">Isaiah 14:3</a>. The word in the form used here does not occur elsewhere. Gesenius (Lexicon) renders it here idol-worship. DeWette, "way of idols." Prof. Alexander, "way of pain." The Septuagint and Vulgate, "way of iniquity." So Luther. The Syriac, "way of falsehood." Rosenmuller, "way of an idol." According to this, the prayer is that God would search him and see if there was anything in him that partook of the nature of idolatry, or of defection from the true religion; any tendency to go back from God, to worship other gods, to leave the worship of the true God. As idolatry comprehends the sum of all that is evil, as being alienation from the true God, the prayer is that there might be nothing found in his heart which tended to alienate him from God - would indicate unfaithfulness or want of attachment to him.<p>And lead me in the way everlasting - The way which leads to eternal life; the path which I may tread forever. In any other way than in the service of God his steps must be arrested. He must encounter his Maker in judgment, and be cut off, and consigned to woe. The path to heaven is one which man may steadily pursue; one, in reference to which death itself is really no interruption - for the journey commenced here will be continued through the dark valley, and continued forevermore. Death does not interrupt the journey of the righteous for a moment. It is the same journey continued - as when we cross a narrow stream, and are on the same path still. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/139.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 139<p>Ps 139:1-24. After presenting the sublime doctrines of God's omnipresence and omniscience, the Psalmist appeals to Him, avowing his innocence, his abhorrence of the wicked, and his ready submission to the closest scrutiny.

Not that David thought himself free from wickedness, or that there was none to be found in his heart and life; and therefore said this in a boasting way, he knew otherwise; see <a href="/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12</a>; but he is desirous it might be thoroughly looked into and seen whether there was any such wicked way in him he was charged with; as that he had a design upon the life of Saul, and to seize his throne and kingdom, which never entered into his mind, <a href="/1_samuel/24-9.htm">1 Samuel 24:9</a>. Or, "any way of grief" (d); what tended to wound and grieve his own soul, or to grieve the hearts of God's people; or to grieve the Holy Spirit of God; and which he ought to grieve for and repent of: suggesting, that upon the first conviction he was ready to relinquish any such wicked way, and express his abhorrence of it, and testify true repentance for it. Some render it, "the way of an idol" (e); because a word from the same root signifies an idol: every carnal lust in a man's heart is an idol; and whatsoever engrosses the affections, or has more of them than God himself has, or is preferred to him, <a href="/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4</a>. The Targum is, <p>"and see if the way of those that err is me;'' <p>and lead me in the way everlasting; or, "in the way of old" (f): the good old way, the ancient path, in which the patriarchs before and after the flood walked, Or, "in the perpetual way" (g); the way that endures for ever; in opposition to the way of the wicked, that perishes, <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>; or in the way that leads to everlasting life, to eternal peace and rest, and endless pleasures; as opposed to the way of grief and sorrow. It designs Christ, the true and only way to eternal life, the path of faith, truth, and godliness, <a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13</a>; in which the Lord leads his people, as a father does his child, and as the shepherd his flock. The Jewish commentators, Aben Ezra and Kimchi, interpret it the way of the world; and take it to be the same with the way of all flesh, death, or the grave; which is called man's world, or home, <a href="/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>; and make the sense to be this: If thou seest any evil in me, take me out of the world; kill me at once, let me die But this seems to be foreign from the text; for the word "lead" designs a blessing or benefit, as Calvin well observes.

The days &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, which were already formed, are the subject. It is usually rendered: "the days which had first to be formed."

The suffix of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; points to the succeeding &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, to which &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is appended as an attributive clause; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; is subordinated to this &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;: cum non or nondum (<a href="/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>) unus inter eos  equals  unus eorum (<a href="/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>) esset. But the expression (instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; or &#1496;&#1512;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;) remains doubtful, and it becomes a question whether the Ker &#1493;&#1500;&#1493; (vid., on <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>), which stands side by side with the Chethb &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; (which the lxx, Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, the Targum, Syriac, Jerome, and Saadia follow), is not to be preferred. This &#1493;&#1500;&#1493;, referred to &#1490;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;, gives the acceptable meaning: and for it (viz., its birth) one among them (these days), without our needing to make any change in the proposed exposition down to &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;.

The accentuation has failed to discern the reference of &#1499;&#1500;&#1501; to the following &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, inasmuch as it places Olewejored against &#1497;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;. Hupfeld follows this accentuation, referring &#1499;&#1500;&#1501; back to &#1490;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497; as a coil of days of one's life; and Hitzig does the same, referring it to the embryos. But the precedence of the relative pronoun occurs in other instances also, <p>(Note: The Hebrew poet, says Gesenius (Lehrgebude, S. 739f.), sometimes uses the pronoun before the thing to which it referred has even been spoken of. This phenomenon belongs to the Hebrew style generally, vid., my Anekdota (1841), S. 382.)<p>and is devoid of all harshness, especially in connection with &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, which directly signifies altogether (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/43-14.htm">Isaiah 43:14</a>).<p>It is the confession of the omniscience that is united with the omnipotence of God, which the poet here gives utterance to with reference to himself, just as Jahve says with reference to Jeremiah, <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>. Among the days which were preformed in the idea of God (cf. on &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;, <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a>) there was also one, says the poet, for the embryonic beginning of my life. The divine knowledge embraces the beginning, development, and completion of all things (Psychology, S. 37ff., tr. pp. 46ff.). The knowledge of the thoughts of God which are written in the book of creation and revelation is the poet's cherished possession, and to ponder over them is his favourite pursuit: they are precious to him, &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (after <a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>), not: difficult of comprehension (schwerbegreiflich, Maurer, Olshausen), after <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-11.htm">Daniel 2:11</a>, which would surely have been expressed by &#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/psalms/92-6.htm">Psalm 92:6</a>), more readily: very weighty (schwergewichtig, Hitzig), but better according to the prevailing Hebrew usage: highly valued (schwergewerthet), cara.<p>(Note: It should be noted that the radical idea of the verb, viz., being heavy (German schwer), is retained in all these renderings. - Tr.)<p>"Their sums" are powerful, prodigious (<a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>), and cannot be brought to a summa summarum. If he desires to count them (fut. hypothet. as in <a href="/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7</a>; <a href="/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>), they prove themselves to be more than the sand with its grains, that is to say, innumerable. He falls asleep over the pondering upon them, wearied out; and when he wakes up, he is still with God, i.e., still ever absorbed in the contemplation of the Unsearchable One, which even the sleep of fatigue could not entirely interrupt. Ewald explains it somewhat differently: if I am lost in the stream of thoughts and images, and recover myself from this state of reverie, yet I am still ever with Thee, without coming to an end. But it could only perhaps be interpreted thus if it were &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; or &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. Hofmann's interpretation is altogether different: I will count them, the more numerous than the sand, when I awake and am continually with Thee, viz., in the other world, after the awaking from the sleep of death. This is at once impossible, because &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1510;&#1514;&#1497; cannot here, according to its position, be a perf. hypotheticum. Also in connection with this interpretation &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; would be an inappropriate expression for "continually," since the word only has the sense of the continual duration of an action or a state already existing; here of one that has not even been closed and broken off by sleep. He has not done; waking and dreaming and waking up, he is carried away by that endless, and yet also endlessly attractive, pursuit, the most fitting occupation of one who is awake, and the sweetest (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/31-26.htm">Jeremiah 31:26</a>) of one who is asleep and dreaming. </body></html>
