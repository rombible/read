It is more profitable to meditate on Divine truths, applying them to our own cases, and with hearts lifted to God in prayer, than with a curious or disputing frame of mind. That God knows all things, is omniscient; that he is every where, is omnipresent; are truths acknowledged by all, yet they are seldom rightly believed in by mankind. God takes strict notice of every step we take, every right step and every by step. He knows what rule we walk by, what end we walk toward, what company we walk with. When I am withdrawn from all company, thou knowest what I have in my heart. There is not a vain word, not a good word, but thou knowest from what thought it came, and with what design it was uttered. Wherever we are, we are under the eye and hand of God. We cannot by searching find how God searches us out; nor do we know how we are known. Such thoughts should restrain us from sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/139.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For there is not a word in my tongue - All that I say; all that I have power to say; all that I am disposed at any time to say.<p>But lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether - All that pertains to it.

Just as &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; signifies impetuosity, vehemence, and then also a monster, so &#1492;&#1512;&#1492;&#1497;&#1489; signifies both to break in upon one violently and overpowerlingly (Sol 6:5; cf. Syriac arheb, Arabic arhaba, to terrify), and to make any one courageous, bold, and confident of victory. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1506;&#1494; forms a corollary to the verb that is marked by Mugrash or Dech: so that in my soul there was &#1506;&#1494;, i.e., power, viz., a consciousness of power (cf. <a href="/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>). The thanksgiving, which he, the king of the promise, offers to God on account of this, will be transmitted to all the kings of the earth when they shall hear (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; in the sense of a fut. exactum) the words of His mouth, i.e., the divine &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, and they shall sing of (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; with &#1489;&#1468;, like &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a>, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="/psalms/105-2.htm">Psalm 105:2</a> and frequently, &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9</a>, &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a>, and the like) the ways of the God of the history of salvation, they shall sing that great is the glory of Jahve. <a href="/psalms/138-6.htm">Psalm 138:6</a> tells us by what means He has so super-gloriously manifested Himself in His leadings of David. He has shown Himself to be the Exalted One who is His all-embracing rule does not leave the lowly (cf. David's confessions in <a href="/psalms/131-1.htm">Psalm 131:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-22.htm">2 Samuel 6:22</a>) unnoticed (<a href="/psalms/113-6.htm">Psalm 113:6</a>), but on the contrary makes him the especial object of His regard; and on the other hand even from afar (cf. <a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>) He sees through (&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; as in <a href="/psalms/94-11.htm">Psalm 94:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>) the lofty one who thinks himself unobserved and conducts himself as if he were answerable to no higher being (<a href="/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>). In correct texts &#1493;&#1490;&#1489;&#1492; has Mugrash, and &#1502;&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511; Mercha. The form of the fut.

Chajug&#769; also regards the first Jod in these forms as the preformative and the second as the radical, whereas Abulwald, Gramm. ch. xxvi. p. 170, explains the first as a prosthesis and the second as the preformative. According to the view of others, e.g., of Kimchi, &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; might be fut. Hiph. weakened from &#1497;&#1492;&#1491;&#1506; (&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;), which, apart from the unsuitable meaning, assumes a change of consonants that is all the more inadmissible as &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; itself springs from &#1493;&#1491;&#1506;. Nor is it to be supposed that &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; is modified from &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; (Luzzatto, 197), because it is nowhere written &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;.) </body></html>
