(Comp. <a href="/context/job/10-8.htm" title="Your hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet you do destroy me.">Job 10:8-12</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/7-22.htm" title="I cannot tell how ye came into my womb: for I neither gave you breath nor life, neither was it I that formed the members of every one of you;">2 Maccabees 7:22</a>.)<p>Others take it of the ball of the threads of destiny; but this is not a Hebrew conception. By inserting the word <span class= "ital">members, </span>the Authorised Version suggests a <span class= "ital">possible, </span>but not a probable, interpretation. The Hebrew language likes to use a pronoun before the word to which it refers has occurred (see Note, <a href="/psalms/68-14.htm" title="When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.">Psalm 68:14</a>); and, in spite of the accents, we must refer <span class= "ital">all of them </span>to “days” (Authorised Version, “in continuance”).<p>“Thine eyes beheld my embryo,<p>And in thy book were written<p>All the days, the days<p>Which were being formed,<p>When as yet there were none of them.”<p>But a much more satisfactory sense is obtained by adopting one slight change and following Symmachus in the last line—<p>“The days which are all reckoned, and not one of them is wanting.”<p>All the ancient versions make that which is written in God’s book either the days of life, or men born in the course of these days, each coming into being according to the Divine will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/psalms/139.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/139-16.htm" title="Your eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; and in your book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.">Psalm 139:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thine eyes did see my substance — </span>Hebrews <span class="greekheb">גלמי</span>, <span class="ital">my rude mass, </span>as Dr. Waterland renders the word: <span class="ital">massa rudis et intricata adhuc, </span>says Buxtorf, <span class="ital">neque in veram formam evoluta, a mass, yet rude and entangled, and not unfolded into proper form. </span>When the matter, out of which I was made, was an unshapen embryo, without any form, it was visible to thee how every part, however minute, would be wrought; <span class="ital">and in thy book all my members were written — </span>Before any of them were in being they lay open before thy eyes, and were discerned by thee as clearly as if the plan of them had been drawn in a book.

But then, (which is the chief thing here insisted on by the psalmist,)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>whereas the human artificer must have the clearest light, whereby to accomplish his task, the divine work-master seeth in secret, and effecteth all his wonders within the dark and narrow confines of the womb.” — Horne.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>139:7-16 We cannot see God, but he can see us. The psalmist did not desire to go from the Lord. Whither can I go? In the most distant corners of the world, in heaven, or in hell, I cannot go out of thy reach. No veil can hide us from God; not the thickest darkness. No disguise can save any person or action from being seen in the true light by him. Secret haunts of sin are as open before God as the most open villanies. On the other hand, the believer cannot be removed from the supporting, comforting presence of his Almighty Friend. Should the persecutor take his life, his soul will the sooner ascend to heaven. The grave cannot separate his body from the love of his Saviour, who will raise it a glorious body. No outward circumstances can separate him from his Lord. While in the path of duty, he may be happy in any situation, by the exercise of faith, hope, and prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/139.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect - This whole verse is very obscure, but the "idea" in this expression clearly is, "Before I had shape or form thou didst see what I was to be." The single word in the original translated "my substance, yet being unperfect," is &#1490;&#1500;&#1501;  go&#770;lem. It occurs only in this place, though the verb - &#1490;&#1500;&#1501;  ga&#770;lam - is found in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/2-8.htm">2 Kings 2:8</a>, where it is used in reference to the mantle of Elijah: And Elijah took his mantle, and "wrapped it together," etc. That is, he rolled it up, or he folded it. The noun, then, means that which "is" rolled or wrapped together; that which is folded up, and hence, is applicable to anything folded up or undeveloped; and would thus most aptly denote the embryo, or the foetus, where all the members of the body are as yet folded up, or undeveloped; that is, before they have assumed their distinct form and proportions. This is undoubtedly the idea here. Before the embryo had any such form that its future size, shape, or proportions could be marked by the eye of man, it was clearly and distinctly known by God.<p>And in thy book - Where thou recordest all things. Perhaps the allusion here would be to the book of an architect or draftsman, who, before his work is begun, draws his plan, or sketches it for the direction of the workmen.<p>All my members were written - The words "my members" are not in the original. The Hebrew is, as in the margin, "all of them." The reference may be, not to the members of his body, but to his "days" (see the margin on the succeeding phrase) - and then the sense would be, all my "days," or all the periods of my life, were delineated in thy book. That is, When my substance - my form - was not yet developed, when yet an embryo, and when nothing could be determined from that by the eye of man as to what I was to be, all the future was known to God, and was written down - just what should be my form and vigor; how long I should live; what I should be; what would be the events of my life.<p>Which in continuance were fashioned - Margin, "What days they should be fashioned." Literally, "Days should be formed." DeWette renders this, "The days were determined before any one of them was." There is nothing in the Hebrew to correspond with the phrase "in continuance." The simple idea is, The days of my life were determined on, the whole matter was fixed and settled, not by anything seen in the embryo, but "before" there was any form - before there were any means of judging from what I then was to what I would be - all was seen and arranged in the divine mind.<p>When as yet there was none of them - literally, "And not one among them." Before there was one of them in actual existence. Not one development had yet occurred from which it could be inferred what the rest would be. The entire knowledge on the subject must have been based on Omniscience. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/139.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 139<p>Ps 139:1-24.

We must therefore either assign to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; the signification operiat me without being able to prove it, or we must put a verb of this signification in its place, viz., &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497; (Ewald) or &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; (Bttcher), which latter is the more commendable here, where darkness (&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, synon. &#1506;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;) is the subject: and if I should say, let nothing but darkness cover me, and as night (the predicate placed first, as in <a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>) let the light become about me, i.e., let the light become night that shall surround and cover me (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, poetic for &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>) -  the darkness would spread abroad no obscurity (<a href="/psalms/105-28.htm">Psalm 105:28</a>) that should extend beyond (&#1502;&#1503;) Thy piercing eye and remove me from Thee. In the word &#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512;, too, the Hiphil signification is not lost: the night would give out light from itself, as if it were the day; for the distinction of day and night has no conditioning influence upon God, who is above and superior to all created things (der Uebercreatrliche), who is light in Himself. The two &#1499; are correlative, as e.g., in <a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4</a>. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492; (with a superfluous Jod) is an old word, but &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; (cf. Aramaic &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;) is a later one. </body></html>
