See the idea in this passage fully explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/60-3.htm">Psalm 60:3</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>, note.<p>And the wine is red - The word used here - &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;  cha&#770;mar - may mean either to boil up, or to be red - from the idea of boiling, or becoming heated. The Septuagint and the Vulgate render it, "And he pours it out from this into that;" that is, he draws it off, as is done with wine. The true idea in the expression is probably that it ferments; and the meaning may be that the wrath of God seems to boil like fermenting liquor.<p>It is full of mixture - Mixed with spices, in order to increase its strength; or, as we should say, drugged. This was frequently done in order to increase the intoxicating quality of wine. The idea is, that the wrath of God was like wine whose native strength, or power of producing intoxication, was thus increased by drugs. And he poureth out of the same. He pours it out in order that his enemies may drink it; in other words, they reel and stagger under the expressions of his wrath, as men reel and stagger under the influence of spiced or drugged wine.<p>But the dregs thereof - The "lees" - the settlings - what remains after the wine is racked off. See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>. This would contain the strongest part of the mixture; and the idea is, that they would drink the wrath of God to the utmost.<p>All the wicked of the earth - Wicked people everywhere. The expression of the wrath of God would not be confined to one nation, or one people; but wherever wicked people are found, he will punish them. He will be just in his dealings with all people.<p>Shall wring them out - Wine was kept in skins; and the idea here is, that they would wring out these skins so as to get out "all" that there was in them, and leave nothing remaining. The wrath of God would be exhausted in the punishment of wicked people, as if it were all wrung out.<p>And drink them - Not merely the wine; but the dregs; all that there was. Wicked people will suffer all that there is in the justice of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/75.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. in the hand &#8230; a cup &#8230; red&#8212;God's wrath often thus represented (compare Isa 51:17; Jer 25:15).<p>but the dregs&#8212;literally, "surely the dregs, they shall drain it."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/75.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse is added, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The connection with &#1493; in &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; presents a difficulty. Neither here nor anywhere else is it to be supposed that &#1493; is synonymous with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;; but at any rate even &#1499;&#1497; might stand instead of it. For Hupfeld's attempt to explain it: and "near is Thy name" Thy wonders have declared; and Hitzig's: and Thou whose Name is near, they declare Thy wondrous works - are past remedy. Such a personification of wonders does not belong to the spirit of Hebrew poetry, and such a relative clause lies altogether beyond the bounds of syntax. If we would, however, take &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498;, after <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>, as a result of the thanksgiving (Campensis), then that for which thanks are rendered would remain undefined; neither will it do to take &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; as referring to the being inwardly present (Hengstenberg), since this, according to <a href="/jeremiah/12-2.htm">Jeremiah 12:2</a> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/30-14.htm">Deuteronomy 30:14</a>), would require some addition, which should give to the nearness this reference to the mouth or to the heart. Thus, therefore, nothing remains for us but to connect the nearness of the Name of God as an outward fact with the earnest giving of thanks. The church has received the promise of an approaching judicial, redemptive revelation of God, and now says, "We give Thee thanks, we give thanks and near is Thy Name;" it welcomes the future act of God with heartfelt thanksgiving, all those who belong to it declare beforehand the wonders of God. Such was really the position of matters when in Hezekiah's time the oppression of the Assyrians had reached its highest point - Isaiah's promises of a miraculous divine deliverance were at that time before them, and the believing ones saluted beforehand, with thanksgiving, the "coming Name of Jahve" (<a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>). The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which was to be expected after &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; (cf. e.g., <a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>.) does not follow until <a href="/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>. God Himself undertakes the confirmation of the forthcoming thanksgiving and praise by a direct announcement of the help that is hailed and near at hand (<a href="/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>). It is not to be rendered, "when I shall seize," etc., for <a href="/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a> has not the structure of an apodosis. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is confirmatory, and whatever interpretation we may give to it, the words of the church suddenly change into the words of God. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; in the language of prophecy, more especially of the apocalyptic character, is a standing expression fore the appointed time of the final judgment (vid., on <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>). When this moment or juncture in the lapse of time shall have arrived, then God will seize or take possession of it (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495; in the unweakened original sense of taking hold of with energy, cf. <a href="/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>): He Himself will then interpose and hold judgment according to the strictly observed rule of right (&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, adverbial accusative, cf. &#1489;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>, and frequently). If it even should come to pass that the earth and all its inhabitants are melting away (cf. <a href="/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9</a>), i.e., under the pressure of injustice (as is to be inferred from <a href="/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>), are disheartened, scattered asunder, and are as it were in the act of dissolution, then He (the absolute I, &#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497;) will restrain this melting away: He setteth in their places the pillars, i.e., the internal shafts (<a href="/job/9-6.htm">Job 9:6</a>), of the earth, or without any figure: He again asserts the laws which lie at the foundation of its stability. &#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is a mood of certainty, and <a href="/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4</a> is a circumstantial clause placed first, after the manner of the Latin ablative absolute. Hitzig appropriately compares <a href="/proverbs/29-9.htm">Proverbs 29:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-15.htm">Isaiah 23:15</a> may also be understood according to this bearing of the case.<p>The utterance of God is also continued after the Sela. It is not the people of God who turn to the enemies with the language of warning on the ground of the divine promise (Hengstenberg); the poet would then have said &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, or must at least have said &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. God Himself speaks, and His words are not yet peremptorily condemning, as in <a href="/psalms/50-16.htm">Psalm 50:16</a>., cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/46-11.htm">Psalm 46:11</a>, but admonitory and threatening, because it is not He who has already appeared for the final judgment who speaks, but He who announces His appearing. With &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; He tells the braggarts who are captivated with the madness of supposed greatness, and the evil-doers who lift up the horn or the head, <p>(Note: The head is called in Sanscrit iras, in Zend aranh,  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;; the horn in Sanscrit, ringa, i.e., (according to Burnlouf, Etudes, p. 19) that which proceeds from and projects out of the head (iras), Zend rva  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; (k&#803;arn).)<p>hat He will have once for all said to them, and what they are to suffer to be said to them for the short space of time till the judgment. The poet, if we have assigned the right date to the Psalm, has Rabshakeh and his colleagues before his mind, cf. <a href="/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a>. The &#1500;, as in that passage, and like &#1488;&#1500; in <a href="/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a> (vid., Khler), has the idea of a hostile tendency. &#1488;&#1500; rules also over <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a>: "speak not insolence with a raised neck." It is not to be construed &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; &#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, with a stiff neck. Parallel passages like <a href="/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>, and more especially the primary passage <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a>, show that &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; is an object-notion, and that &#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; by itself (with which, too, the accentuation harmonizes, since Munach here is the vicarius of a distinctive), according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-26.htm">Job 15:26</a>, has the sense of &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; or &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;. </body></html>
