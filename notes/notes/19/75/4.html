Since ever present facts of creation have been referred to just now, and the historical mighty deeds of God only further back, &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; refers rather forwards to the blaspheming of the enemies which He suffers now to go on unpunished, as though He took no cognizance of it. &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; has Pasek after it in order to separate the word, which signifies reviling, from the most holy Name. The epithet &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1504;&#1489;&#1500; reminds one of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>. In <a href="/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a> according to the accents &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; is the absolute state (the primary form of &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, vid., on <a href="/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a>): give not over, abandon not to the wild beast (beasts), the soul of Thy turtle-dove. This is probably correct, since &#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, "to the eager wild beast," this inversion of the well-known expression &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which on the contrary yields the sense of vita animae, is an improbable and exampleless expression. If &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; were intended to be thus understood, the poet might have written &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498;, "give not Thy turtle-dove over to the desire of the wild beast." Hupfeld thinks that the "old, stupid reading" may be set right at one stroke, inasmuch as he reads &#1488;&#1500; &#1514;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513; &#1495;&#1497;&#1514; &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498;, and renders it "give not to rage the life Thy turtle-dove;" but where is any support to be found for this &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, "to rage," or rather (Psychology, S. 202; tr. p. 239) "to eager desire?" The word cannot signify this in such an isolated position. Israel, which is also compared to a dove in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a>, is called a turtle-dove (&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;). In <a href="/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a> &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; has the same signification as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a>, and the same sense as <a href="/psalms/68-11.htm">Psalm 68:11</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/69-37.htm">Psalm 69:37</a>): the creatures of Thy miserable ones, i.e., Thy poor, miserable creatures - a figurative designation of the ecclesia pressa. The church, which it is the custom of the Asaphic Psalms to designate with emblematical names taken from the animal world, finds itself now like sheep among wolves, and seems to itself as if it were forgotten by God. The cry of prayer &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; comes forth out of circumstances such as were those of the Maccabaean age. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is the covenant of circumcision (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>); the persecution of the age of the Seleucidae put faith to the severe test, that circumcision, this sign which was the pledge to Israel of God's gracious protection, became just the sign by which the Syrians knew their victims. In the Book of Daniel, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-32.htm">Psalm 22:32</a>, &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is used directly of the religion of Israel and its band of confessors. The confirmatory clause <a href="/psalms/74-20.htm">Psalm 74:20</a> also corresponds to the Maccabaean age, when the persecuted confessors hid themselves far away in the mountains (1 Macc. 2:26ff., 2 Macc. 6:11), but were tracked by the enemy and slain, - at that time the hiding-places (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, 1 Macc. 1:53) of the land were in reality full of the habitations of violence. The combination &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; is like &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-37.htm">Jeremiah 25:37</a>, cf. <a href="/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11</a>. From this point the Psalm draws to a close in more familiar Psalm - strains. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-21.htm">Psalm 74:21</a>, viz., from drawing near to Thee with their supplications. "The reproach of the foolish all the day" is that which incessantly goes forth from them. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, "going up (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-12.htm">1 Samuel 5:12</a>, not: increasing, <a href="/1_kings/22-35.htm">1 Kings 22:35</a>) perpetually," although without the article, is not a predicate, but attributive (vid., on <a href="/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a>). The tone of the prayer is throughout temperate; this the ground upon which it bases itself is therefore all the more forcible. </body></html>
