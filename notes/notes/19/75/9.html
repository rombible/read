There are mixtures of mercy and grace in the cup of affliction, when it is put into the hands of God's people; mixtures of the curse, when it is put into the hands of the wicked. God's people have their share in common calamities, but the dregs of the cup are for the wicked. The exaltation of the Son of David will be the subject of the saints' everlasting praises.

Power and liberty being restored to Israel, she begins again to execute justice, by abasing the godless who had gloried in the reign of oppression. Their power and pomp are to be smitten down. Men wore horns in those days as a part of their state, and these, both literally and figuratively, were to be lopped off; for since God abhors the proud, his church will not tolerate them any longer. "But the horns of the righteous shall be exalted." In a rightly ordered society, good men are counted great men, virtue confers true rank, and grace is more esteemed than gold.

The connection with &#1493; in &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; presents a difficulty. Neither here nor anywhere else is it to be supposed that &#1493; is synonymous with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;; but at any rate even &#1499;&#1497; might stand instead of it. For Hupfeld's attempt to explain it: and "near is Thy name" Thy wonders have declared; and Hitzig's: and Thou whose Name is near, they declare Thy wondrous works - are past remedy. Such a personification of wonders does not belong to the spirit of Hebrew poetry, and such a relative clause lies altogether beyond the bounds of syntax. If we would, however, take &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498;, after <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>, as a result of the thanksgiving (Campensis), then that for which thanks are rendered would remain undefined; neither will it do to take &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; as referring to the being inwardly present (Hengstenberg), since this, according to <a href="/jeremiah/12-2.htm">Jeremiah 12:2</a> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/30-14.htm">Deuteronomy 30:14</a>), would require some addition, which should give to the nearness this reference to the mouth or to the heart. Thus, therefore, nothing remains for us but to connect the nearness of the Name of God as an outward fact with the earnest giving of thanks. The church has received the promise of an approaching judicial, redemptive revelation of God, and now says, "We give Thee thanks, we give thanks and near is Thy Name;" it welcomes the future act of God with heartfelt thanksgiving, all those who belong to it declare beforehand the wonders of God. Such was really the position of matters when in Hezekiah's time the oppression of the Assyrians had reached its highest point - Isaiah's promises of a miraculous divine deliverance were at that time before them, and the believing ones saluted beforehand, with thanksgiving, the "coming Name of Jahve" (<a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>). The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which was to be expected after &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; (cf. e.g., <a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>.) does not follow until <a href="/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>. God Himself undertakes the confirmation of the forthcoming thanksgiving and praise by a direct announcement of the help that is hailed and near at hand (<a href="/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>). It is not to be rendered, "when I shall seize," etc., for <a href="/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a> has not the structure of an apodosis. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is confirmatory, and whatever interpretation we may give to it, the words of the church suddenly change into the words of God. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; in the language of prophecy, more especially of the apocalyptic character, is a standing expression fore the appointed time of the final judgment (vid., on <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>). When this moment or juncture in the lapse of time shall have arrived, then God will seize or take possession of it (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495; in the unweakened original sense of taking hold of with energy, cf. <a href="/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>): He Himself will then interpose and hold judgment according to the strictly observed rule of right (&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, adverbial accusative, cf. &#1489;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>, and frequently). If it even should come to pass that the earth and all its inhabitants are melting away (cf. <a href="/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9</a>), i.e., under the pressure of injustice (as is to be inferred from <a href="/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>), are disheartened, scattered asunder, and are as it were in the act of dissolution, then He (the absolute I, &#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497;) will restrain this melting away: He setteth in their places the pillars, i.e., the internal shafts (<a href="/job/9-6.htm">Job 9:6</a>), of the earth, or without any figure: He again asserts the laws which lie at the foundation of its stability. &#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is a mood of certainty, and <a href="/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4</a> is a circumstantial clause placed first, after the manner of the Latin ablative absolute. Hitzig appropriately compares <a href="/proverbs/29-9.htm">Proverbs 29:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-15.htm">Isaiah 23:15</a> may also be understood according to this bearing of the case.<p>The utterance of God is also continued after the Sela. It is not the people of God who turn to the enemies with the language of warning on the ground of the divine promise (Hengstenberg); the poet would then have said &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, or must at least have said &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. God Himself speaks, and His words are not yet peremptorily condemning, as in <a href="/psalms/50-16.htm">Psalm 50:16</a>., cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/46-11.htm">Psalm 46:11</a>, but admonitory and threatening, because it is not He who has already appeared for the final judgment who speaks, but He who announces His appearing. With &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; He tells the braggarts who are captivated with the madness of supposed greatness, and the evil-doers who lift up the horn or the head, <p>(Note: The head is called in Sanscrit iras, in Zend aranh,  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;; the horn in Sanscrit, ringa, i.e., (according to Burnlouf, Etudes, p. 19) that which proceeds from and projects out of the head (iras), Zend rva  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; (k&#803;arn).)<p>hat He will have once for all said to them, and what they are to suffer to be said to them for the short space of time till the judgment. The poet, if we have assigned the right date to the Psalm, has Rabshakeh and his colleagues before his mind, cf. <a href="/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a>. The &#1500;, as in that passage, and like &#1488;&#1500; in <a href="/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a> (vid., Khler), has the idea of a hostile tendency. &#1488;&#1500; rules also over <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a>: "speak not insolence with a raised neck." It is not to be construed &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; &#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, with a stiff neck. Parallel passages like <a href="/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>, and more especially the primary passage <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a>, show that &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; is an object-notion, and that &#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; by itself (with which, too, the accentuation harmonizes, since Munach here is the vicarius of a distinctive), according to <a href="//biblehub.com/job/15-26.htm">Job 15:26</a>, has the sense of &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; or &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;. </body></html>
