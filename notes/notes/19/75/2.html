The phrase is thus rendered in most of the versions. So the Septuagint, "When I take the time" - &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  hotan labo&#772; kairon. So the Vulgate, "When I accept the time." So Luther, "When in its own time." So De Wette, "When I take the time." According to this interpretation, this is the language of God, as if implying that, although "the earth" was then "dissolved," or although disorders were allowed to exist, yet he would take a set time, or take the appointed time for judgment, and would pronounce a sentence on the conduct of people, and deal with them in a righteous manner, punishing the rebellious, and vindicating his own cause. The proper interpretation of the passage turns on the meaning of the Hebrew word rendered in the text "congregation" - &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;  mo&#770;&#8219;e&#770;d. See the word explained in the notes at <a href="/psalms/74-8.htm">Psalm 74:8</a>. It may mean a set time, an appointed season, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/13-11.htm">1 Samuel 13:11</a>; or a coming together, an assembly, <a href="/job/30-23.htm">Job 30:23</a>; or a place of assemblage, as the tabernacle, etc.; <a href="/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-22.htm">Exodus 40:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/74-8.htm">Psalm 74:8</a>. It may, therefore, be applied to the congregation of the Jewish people - the nation considered as an assemblage for the worship of God; and the idea of taking this, or receiving this, may be applied to the act of assuming authority or sovereignty over the people, and hence, the language may be used to denote the entrance on the discharge of the duties of such sovereignty. The language would be ap plicable to one who had the right of such an elevation to power - a prince - an heir apparent - in a time when his right was disputed; when there was an organized opposition to him; or when the nation was in a state of anarchy and confusion. It seems to me that this supposition best accords with the proper meaning of the language, and with the scope of the psalm.<p>I will judge uprightly - I will put down all this opposition to law. I will deal with exact justice between man and man. I will restore order, and the supremacy of law, to the state. The language, therefore, according to this interpretation, is not the language of God, but that of a prince having a right to the throne, and about to ascend it in a time of great misrule and disorder. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/75.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2, 3.

This is generally believed to be the voice of God, who will, when he accepts his people, mount his judgment seat and avenge their cause in righteousness. It is rendered by some, "I will take a set time;" and by others, "I will seize the moment."<p>"God never is before his time,<p>He never is too late."<p>He determines the period of interposition, and when that arrives swift are his blows and sure are his deliverances. God sends no delegated judge, but sits himself upon the throne. O Lord, let thy set time come for grace. Tarry no longer, but for the truth and the throne of Jesus be thou speedily at work. Let the appointed assize come, O Jesus, and sit thou on thy throne to judge the world in equity.<p><a href="/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a><p>"The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved." When anarchy is abroad, and tyrants are in power, everything is unloosed, dissolution threatens all things, the solid mountains of government melt as wax; but even then the Lord upholds and sustains the right. "I bear up the pillars of it." Hence, there is no real cause for fear. While the pillars stand, and stand they must for God upholds them, the house will brave out the storm in the day of the Lord's appearing a general melting will take place, but in that day our covenant God will be the sure support of our confidence.<p>"How can I sink with such a prop<p>As my eternal God,<p>Who bears the earth's huge pillars up,<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/75.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When I shall receive the congregation, </span> to wit, the whole congregation, or body of thy people, to wit, all the tribes; which are now distracted and disordered by a civil war, which is a great hinderance to the administration of justice.

Since ever present facts of creation have been referred to just now, and the historical mighty deeds of God only further back, &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; refers rather forwards to the blaspheming of the enemies which He suffers now to go on unpunished, as though He took no cognizance of it. &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; has Pasek after it in order to separate the word, which signifies reviling, from the most holy Name. The epithet &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1504;&#1489;&#1500; reminds one of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>. In <a href="/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a> according to the accents &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; is the absolute state (the primary form of &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, vid., on <a href="/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a>): give not over, abandon not to the wild beast (beasts), the soul of Thy turtle-dove. This is probably correct, since &#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, "to the eager wild beast," this inversion of the well-known expression &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which on the contrary yields the sense of vita animae, is an improbable and exampleless expression. If &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; were intended to be thus understood, the poet might have written &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498;, "give not Thy turtle-dove over to the desire of the wild beast." Hupfeld thinks that the "old, stupid reading" may be set right at one stroke, inasmuch as he reads &#1488;&#1500; &#1514;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513; &#1495;&#1497;&#1514; &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498;, and renders it "give not to rage the life Thy turtle-dove;" but where is any support to be found for this &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, "to rage," or rather (Psychology, S. 202; tr. p. 239) "to eager desire?" The word cannot signify this in such an isolated position. Israel, which is also compared to a dove in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a>, is called a turtle-dove (&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;). In <a href="/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a> &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; has the same signification as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a>, and the same sense as <a href="/psalms/68-11.htm">Psalm 68:11</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/69-37.htm">Psalm 69:37</a>): the creatures of Thy miserable ones, i.e., Thy poor, miserable creatures - a figurative designation of the ecclesia pressa. The church, which it is the custom of the Asaphic Psalms to designate with emblematical names taken from the animal world, finds itself now like sheep among wolves, and seems to itself as if it were forgotten by God. The cry of prayer &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1496; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; comes forth out of circumstances such as were those of the Maccabaean age. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is the covenant of circumcision (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>); the persecution of the age of the Seleucidae put faith to the severe test, that circumcision, this sign which was the pledge to Israel of God's gracious protection, became just the sign by which the Syrians knew their victims. In the Book of Daniel, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-32.htm">Psalm 22:32</a>, &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is used directly of the religion of Israel and its band of confessors. The confirmatory clause <a href="/psalms/74-20.htm">Psalm 74:20</a> also corresponds to the Maccabaean age, when the persecuted confessors hid themselves far away in the mountains (1 Macc. 2:26ff., 2 Macc. 6:11), but were tracked by the enemy and slain, - at that time the hiding-places (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, 1 Macc. 1:53) of the land were in reality full of the habitations of violence. The combination &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; is like &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-37.htm">Jeremiah 25:37</a>, cf. <a href="/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11</a>. From this point the Psalm draws to a close in more familiar Psalm - strains. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/74-21.htm">Psalm 74:21</a>, viz., from drawing near to Thee with their supplications. "The reproach of the foolish all the day" is that which incessantly goes forth from them. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, "going up (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-12.htm">1 Samuel 5:12</a>, not: increasing, <a href="/1_kings/22-35.htm">1 Kings 22:35</a>) perpetually," although without the article, is not a predicate, but attributive (vid., on <a href="/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a>). The tone of the prayer is throughout temperate; this the ground upon which it bases itself is therefore all the more forcible. </body></html>
