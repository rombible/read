David, in the complaints he makes of his enemies, seems to refer to Christ. But our enemies do us real mischief only when they drive us from God and our duty. The true believer's trouble will be made useful; he will learn to wait for his God, and will not seek relief from the world or himself. The less we notice the unkindness and injuries that are done us, the more we consult the quiet of our own minds. David's troubles were the chastisement and the consequence of his transgressions, whilst Christ suffered for our sins and ours only. What right can a sinner have to yield to impatience or anger, when mercifully corrected for his sins? David was very sensible of the present workings of corruption in him. Good men, by setting their sorrow continually before them, have been ready to fall; but by setting God always before them, they have kept their standing. If we are truly penitent for sin, that will make us patient under affliction. Nothing goes nearer to the heart of a believer when in affliction, than to be under the apprehension of God's deserting him; nor does any thing come more feelingly from his heart than this prayer, Be not far from me. The Lord will hasten to help those who trust in him as their salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forsake me not, O Lord - That is, Do not leave me in my troubles, my sickness, my sorrow.

Delay would prove destruction. The poor pleader was far gone and ready to expire, only speedy help would serve his turn. See how sorrow quickens the importunity of prayer! Here is one of the sweet results of affliction, it gives new life to our pleading, and drives us with eagerness to our God. "O Lord my salvation." Not my Saviour only, but my salvation. He who has the Lord on his side has salvation in present possession. Faith foresees the blessed issue of all her pleas, and in this verse begins to ascribe to God the glory of the expected mercy. We shall not be left of the Lord. His grace will succour us most opportunely, and in heaven we shall see that we had not one trial too many, or one pang too severe. A sense of sin shall melt into the joy of salvation; grief shall lead on to gratitude, and gratitude to joy unspeakable and full of glory. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Forsake me not, O Lord,....

This construction is indispensable where it is intended to give special prominence to the subject notion or a secondary notion of the clause, e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/20-6.htm">Deuteronomy 20:6</a>. In one instance &#1508;&#1503; is even followed (3) by the perf. and fut. consec., viz., <a href="/2_kings/2-10.htm">2 Kings 2:10</a>.)<p>but, since in this case one would look for a Waw relat. and a different order of the words, <a href="/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a> is to be regarded as a subject clause: "who, when my foot totters, i.e., when my affliction changes to entire downfall, would magnify themselves against me." In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>,   &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; connects what follows with &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1496; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; by way of confirmation: he is &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; &#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1506;, ready for falling (<a href="/psalms/35-15.htm">Psalm 35:15</a>), he will, if God does not graciously interpose, assuredly fall headlong. The fourth &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/38-19.htm">Psalm 38:19</a> is attached confirmatorily to <a href="/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>: his intense pain or sorrow is ever present to him, for he is obliged to confess his guilt, and this feeling of guilt is just the very sting of his pain. And whilst he in the consciousness of well-deserved punishment is sick unto death, his foes are numerous and withal vigorous and full of life. Instead of &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, probably &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;, as in <a href="/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-5.htm">Psalm 69:5</a>, is to be read (Houbigant, Hitzig, Kster, Hupfeld, Ewald, and Olshausen). But even the lxx read &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;; and the reading which is so old, although it does not very well suit &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; (instead of which one would look for &#1493;&#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;), is still not without meaning: he looks upon himself, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/38-9.htm">Psalm 38:9</a>, more as one dead than living; his foes, however, are &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, living, i.e., vigorous. The verb frequently ash this pregnant meaning, and the adjective can also have it. Just as the accentuation of the form &#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; varies elsewhere out of pause, &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; here has the tone on the ultima, although it is not perf. consec.<p>(Note: As perf. consec. the following have the accent on the ultima: - &#1493;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-9.htm">Obadiah 1:9</a>, and &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>; perhaps also &#1493;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1493;&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>, and &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (perf. hypoth.), <a href="/job/32-15.htm">Job 32:15</a>.

By the "following of that which is good" David means more particularly that which is brought into exercise in relation to his present foes.<p>(Note: In the Greek and Latin texts, likewise in all the Aethiopic and several Arabic texts, and in the Syriac Psalterium Medilanense, the following addition is found after <a href="/psalms/38-21.htm">Psalm 38:21</a> : Ce aperripsan me ton agapeton osi necron ebdelygmenon, Et projecerunt me dilectum tanquam mortuum abominatum (so the Psalt.

No lighting up of the darkness of wrath takes place. The fides supplex is not changed into fides triumphans. But the closing words, "O Lord, my salvation" (cf. <a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>), show where the repentance of Cain and that of David differ. True repentance has faith within itself, it despairs of itself, but not of God. </body></html>
