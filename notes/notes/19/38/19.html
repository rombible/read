David, in the complaints he makes of his enemies, seems to refer to Christ. But our enemies do us real mischief only when they drive us from God and our duty. The true believer's trouble will be made useful; he will learn to wait for his God, and will not seek relief from the world or himself. The less we notice the unkindness and injuries that are done us, the more we consult the quiet of our own minds. David's troubles were the chastisement and the consequence of his transgressions, whilst Christ suffered for our sins and ours only. What right can a sinner have to yield to impatience or anger, when mercifully corrected for his sins? David was very sensible of the present workings of corruption in him. Good men, by setting their sorrow continually before them, have been ready to fall; but by setting God always before them, they have kept their standing. If we are truly penitent for sin, that will make us patient under affliction. Nothing goes nearer to the heart of a believer when in affliction, than to be under the apprehension of God's deserting him; nor does any thing come more feelingly from his heart than this prayer, Be not far from me. The Lord will hasten to help those who trust in him as their salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But mine enemies are lively ... - DeWette renders this, "My enemies live and are strong." The word translated "lively" - &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;  chayiym - means properly "living, being alive." The literal translation would be, "My enemies, being alive, are strong." The idea is, that while he was weak and apparently near to death, they were in the full vigor of life and health. They were able to engage in active efforts to accomplish their purposes. They could take advantage of his weakness; and he could not contend with them, for he was no match for them. In every respect they had the advantage of him; and he prays, therefore, for the divine interposition in his behalf.<p>And they that hate me wrongfully - Hebrew, "falsely."

The psalmist goes back to the thought of his enemies, to whom he has made no answer, and whom he has not ventured to rebuke (vers. 13, 14). He remembers that they are full of life and strength; he calls to mind the fact that they are many in number; he puts on record the cause of their enmity, which is not his sin, but his earnest endeavour to forsake his sin and follow after righteousness (ver. 20); and then, in conclusion, he makes a direct appeal to God for aid against them - first negatively (ver. 21), and then positively in the final outburst, "Make haste to help me, O Lord my Salvation" (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_word">And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</span> This suits well the time of Absalom's conspiracy, when day by day more and more of the people forsook David and joined the party of his son.

He has complained, but not as if it were necessary for him first of all to make God acquainted with his suffering; the Omniscient One is directly cognisant of (has directly before Him, &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, like &#1500;&#1504;&#1490;&#1491; in <a href="/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25</a>) every wish that his suffering extorts from him, and even his softer sighing does not escape His knowledge. The sufferer does not say this so much with the view of comforting himself with this thought, as of exciting God's compassion. Hence he even goes on to draw the piteous picture of his condition: his heart is in a state of violent rotary motion, or only of violent, quickly repeated contraction and expansion (Psychol. S. 252; tr. p. 297), that is to say, a state of violent palpitation (&#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1495;&#1512;, Pealal according to Ges. 55, 3). Strength of which the heart is the centre (<a href="/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a>) has left him, and the light of his eyes, even of these (by attraction for &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, since the light of the eyes is not contrasted with anything else), is not with him, but has become lost to him by weeping, watching, and fever. Those who love him and are friendly towards him have placed themselves far from his stroke (nega`, the touch of God's hand of wrath), merely looking on (<a href="/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>), therefore, in a position hostile (<a href="/2_samuel/18-13.htm">2 Samuel 18:13</a>) rather than friendly. &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;, far away, but within the range of vision, within sight, <a href="/genesis/21-16.htm">Genesis 21:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-52.htm">Deuteronomy 32:52</a>.

In the consciousness of his sin he is obliged to be silent, and, renouncing all self-help, to abandon his cause to God. Consciousness of guilt and resignation close his lips, so that he is not able, nor does he wish, to refute the false charges of his enemies; he has no &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, counter-evidence wherewith to vindicate himself.

It is only &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; (Arab. kma&#770;) that can be used as a conjunction; but &#1499; (Arab. k) is always a preposition in ancient Hebrew just as in Syriac and Arabic (vid., Fleischer in the Hallische Allgem. Lit. Zeitschr. 1843, Bd. iv. S. 117ff.). It is not until the mediaeval synagogal poetry (vid., Zunz, Synagogal-poesie des Mittelalters, S. 121, 381f.) that it is admissible to use it as a conjunction (e.g., &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, when he had found), just as it also occurs in Himjaritic, according to Osiander's deciphering of the inscriptions. The verbal clause appended to the word to which this &#1499;, instar, is prefixed is for the most part an attributive clause as above, but sometimes even a circumstantial clause (Arab. h&#803;a&#770;l), as in <a href="/psalms/38-14.htm">Psalm 38:14</a>; cf. Sur. lxii. 5: "as the likeness of an ass carrying books.") </body></html>
