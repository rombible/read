The way to keep the heart quiet, is to keep ourselves in the love of God. But a sense of guilt is too heavy to bear; and would sink men into despair and ruin, unless removed by the pardoning mercy of God. If there were not sin in our souls, there would be no pain in our bones, no illness in our bodies. The guilt of sin is a burden to the whole creation, which groans under it. It will be a burden to the sinners themselves, when they are heavy-laden under it, or a burden of ruin, when it sinks them to hell. When we perceive our true condition, the Good Physician will be valued, sought, and obeyed. Yet many let their wounds rankle, because they delay to go to their merciful Friend. When, at any time, we are distempered in our bodies, we ought to remember how God has been dishonoured in and by our bodies. The groanings which cannot be uttered, are not hid from Him that searches the heart, and knows the mind of the Spirit. David, in his troubles, was a type of Christ in his agonies, of Christ on his cross, suffering and deserted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am troubled - Margin, "wearied." The Hebrew word means to bend, to curve; then, to be distorted, to writhe with pain, convulsions, and spasms. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a>, the same word is rendered, "I was bowed down at the hearing of it;" that is, Sorrow so took hold of him, that at the intelligence he writhed with pain as a woman in travail. So here it means that he was bent, or bowed down, or that he writhed in pain as the result of his iniquities.<p>I am bowed down greatly - Compare <a href="/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a>. The word means properly to bow down; then, to be brought low; to be depressed with pain, grief, sorrow: <a href="/psalms/10-10.htm">Psalm 10:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>.<p>I go mourning all the day long - Constantly; without any intermission.

The idea here is, that, on account of sin, he was crushed and bowed down as a mourner is with his sorrows, and that he appeared constantly as be walked about with these badges of grief and heavy sorrow. The disease which he had, and which was so offensive to himself <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/38-5.htm">Psalm 38:5</a>, and to others <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a>, was like the filthy and foul garments which mourners put on as expressive of their sorrow.
