David, in the complaints he makes of his enemies, seems to refer to Christ. But our enemies do us real mischief only when they drive us from God and our duty. The true believer's trouble will be made useful; he will learn to wait for his God, and will not seek relief from the world or himself. The less we notice the unkindness and injuries that are done us, the more we consult the quiet of our own minds. David's troubles were the chastisement and the consequence of his transgressions, whilst Christ suffered for our sins and ours only. What right can a sinner have to yield to impatience or anger, when mercifully corrected for his sins? David was very sensible of the present workings of corruption in him. Good men, by setting their sorrow continually before them, have been ready to fall; but by setting God always before them, they have kept their standing. If we are truly penitent for sin, that will make us patient under affliction. Nothing goes nearer to the heart of a believer when in affliction, than to be under the apprehension of God's deserting him; nor does any thing come more feelingly from his heart than this prayer, Be not far from me. The Lord will hasten to help those who trust in him as their salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I will declare mine iniquity - That is, he was not disposed to hide his sin. He would make no concealment of the fact that he regarded himself as a sinner. He admitted this to be true, and he admitted that his sin was the cause of all his troubles. It was the fact that he was a sinner that so painfully affected his mind; and he was not disposed to attempt to conceal it from anyone.<p>I will be sorry for my sin - I will not deny it; I will not apologize for it. I admit the truth of what my conscience charges on me; I admit the correctness and the propriety of the divine judgment by which I have been affiicted on account of my sin; I desire to repent of all my transgressions, and to turn from them. Compare <a href="/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>. The calamity brought upon the psalmist for his sin had produced the desired effect in this respect, that it had brought him to true repentance; and now, with the full confession of his sin, he was anxious only lest he should fall utterly, and should give his enemies, and the enemies of the truth, the occasion to triumph over him which they desired. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

If we are justified in attributing the psalm to David, and in assigning its composition to the period immediately preceding Absalom's rebellion, we must look upon it as opening to us  a view of David's condition of mind at that time which is of great interest. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 38:10-15) Having thus bewailed his suffering before God, he goes on in a somewhat calmer tone: it is the calm of weariness, but also of the rescue which shows itself from afar. He has complained, but not as if it were necessary for him first of all to make God acquainted with his suffering; the Omniscient One is directly cognisant of (has directly before Him, &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, like &#1500;&#1504;&#1490;&#1491; in <a href="/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25</a>) every wish that his suffering extorts from him, and even his softer sighing does not escape His knowledge. The sufferer does not say this so much with the view of comforting himself with this thought, as of exciting God's compassion. Hence he even goes on to draw the piteous picture of his condition: his heart is in a state of violent rotary motion, or only of violent, quickly repeated contraction and expansion (Psychol. S. 252; tr. p. 297), that is to say, a state of violent palpitation (&#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1495;&#1512;, Pealal according to Ges. 55, 3). Strength of which the heart is the centre (<a href="/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a>) has left him, and the light of his eyes, even of these (by attraction for &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, since the light of the eyes is not contrasted with anything else), is not with him, but has become lost to him by weeping, watching, and fever. Those who love him and are friendly towards him have placed themselves far from his stroke (nega`, the touch of God's hand of wrath), merely looking on (<a href="/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>), therefore, in a position hostile (<a href="/2_samuel/18-13.htm">2 Samuel 18:13</a>) rather than friendly. &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;, far away, but within the range of vision, within sight, <a href="/genesis/21-16.htm">Genesis 21:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-52.htm">Deuteronomy 32:52</a>.

In the consciousness of his sin he is obliged to be silent, and, renouncing all self-help, to abandon his cause to God. Consciousness of guilt and resignation close his lips, so that he is not able, nor does he wish, to refute the false charges of his enemies; he has no &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, counter-evidence wherewith to vindicate himself.

It is only &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; (Arab. kma&#770;) that can be used as a conjunction; but &#1499; (Arab. k) is always a preposition in ancient Hebrew just as in Syriac and Arabic (vid., Fleischer in the Hallische Allgem. Lit. Zeitschr. 1843, Bd. iv. S. 117ff.). It is not until the mediaeval synagogal poetry (vid., Zunz, Synagogal-poesie des Mittelalters, S. 121, 381f.) that it is admissible to use it as a conjunction (e.g., &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, when he had found), just as it also occurs in Himjaritic, according to Osiander's deciphering of the inscriptions. The verbal clause appended to the word to which this &#1499;, instar, is prefixed is for the most part an attributive clause as above, but sometimes even a circumstantial clause (Arab. h&#803;a&#770;l), as in <a href="/psalms/38-14.htm">Psalm 38:14</a>; cf. Sur. lxii. 5: "as the likeness of an ass carrying books.") </body></html>
