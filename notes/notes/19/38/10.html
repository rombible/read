The way to keep the heart quiet, is to keep ourselves in the love of God. But a sense of guilt is too heavy to bear; and would sink men into despair and ruin, unless removed by the pardoning mercy of God. If there were not sin in our souls, there would be no pain in our bones, no illness in our bodies. The guilt of sin is a burden to the whole creation, which groans under it. It will be a burden to the sinners themselves, when they are heavy-laden under it, or a burden of ruin, when it sinks them to hell. When we perceive our true condition, the Good Physician will be valued, sought, and obeyed. Yet many let their wounds rankle, because they delay to go to their merciful Friend. When, at any time, we are distempered in our bodies, we ought to remember how God has been dishonoured in and by our bodies. The groanings which cannot be uttered, are not hid from Him that searches the heart, and knows the mind of the Spirit. David, in his troubles, was a type of Christ in his agonies, of Christ on his cross, suffering and deserted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My heart panteth - The word rendered "panteth," in its original form, means properly to go about; to travel around; and then, to travel around as a merchant or pedlar, or for purposes of traffic: <a href="/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-34.htm">Genesis 42:34</a>. Applied to the heart, as it is here, it means to move about rapidly; to palpitate; to beat quick. It is an expression of pain and distress, indicated by a rapid beating of the heart.<p>My strength faileth me - It is rapidly failing. He regarded himself as rapidly approaching death.<p>As for the light of mine eyes - My vision; my sight.<p>It also is gone from me - Margin, as in Hebrew: "is not with me." This is usually an indication of approaching death; and it would seem from all these symptoms that he appeared to be drawing near to the end of life.

Here begins another tale of woe. He was so dreadfully pained by the unkindness of friends, that his heart was in a state of perpetual palpitation. Sharp and quick were the beatings of his heart; he was like a hunted roe, filled with distressing alarms, and ready to fly out of itself with fear. The soul seeks sympathy in sorrow, and if it finds none, its sorrowful heart-throbs are incessant. "My strength faileth me." What with disease and distraction, he was weakened and ready to expire. A sense of sin, and a clear perception that none can help us in our distress, are enough to bring a man to death's door, especially if there be none to speak a gentle word, and point the broken spirit to the beloved Physician. "As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me." Sweet light departed from his bodily eye, and consolation vanished from his soul. Those who were the very light of his eyes forsook him. Hope, the last lamp of night, was ready to go out. What a plight was the poor convict in! Yet here we have some of us been; and here should we have perished had not infinite mercy interposed. Now, as we remember the lovingkindness of the Lord, we see how good it was for us to find our own strength fail us, since it drove us to the strong for strength; and how right it was that our light should all be quenched, that the Lord's light should be all in all to us.<p><a href="/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a><p>"My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore." Whatever affection they might pretend to, they kept out of his company, lest as a sinking vessel often draws down boats with it, they might be made to suffer through his calamities. It is very hard when those who should be the first to come to the rescue, are the first to desert us. In times of deep soul trouble even the most affectionate friends cannot enter into the sufferer's case; let them be as anxious as they may, the sores of a tender conscience they cannot bind up. Oh, the loneliness of a soul passing under the convincing power of the Holy Ghost! "And my kinsmen stand afar off." As the women and others of our Lord's acquaintances from afar gazed on his cross, so a soul wounded for sin sees all mankind as distant spectators, and in the whole crowd finds none to aid. Often relatives hinder seekers after Jesus, oftener still they look on with unconcern, seldom enough to do they endeavour to lead the penitent to Jesus.<p><a href="/psalms/38-12.htm">Psalm 38:12</a><p>"They also that seek after my life lay snares for me." Alas! for us when in addition to inward griefs, we are beset by outward temptations. David's foes endeavoured basely to ensnare him. If fair means would not overthrow him, foul should be tried. This snaring business is a vile one, the devil's own poachers alone condescend to it; but prayer to God will deliver us, for the craft of the entire college of tempters can be met and overcome by those who are led of the Spirit. "They that seek my hurt speak mischievous things." Lies and slanders poured from them like water from the town pump. Their tongue was for ever going, and their heart for ever inventing lies. "And imagine deceits all the day long." They were never done, their forge was going from morning to night. When they could not act they talked, and when they could not talk they imagined, and schemed, and plotted. Restless is the activity of malice. Bad men never have enough of evil. They compass sea and land to injure a saint; no labour is too severe, no cost too great if they may utterly destroy the innocent. Our comfort is, that our glorious Head knows the pertinacious malignity of our foes, and will in due season put an end to it, as he even now sets a bound about it.<p><a href="/psalms/38-13.htm">Psalm 38:13</a><p>"But I, as a deaf man, heard not." Well and bravely was this done. A sacred indifference to the slanders of malevolence is true courage and wise policy. It is well to be as if we could not hear or see. Perhaps the Psalmist means that this deafness on his part was unavoidable because he had no power to answer the taunts of the cruel, but felt much of the truth of their ungenerous accusations. "And I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth." David was bravely silent, and herein was eminently typical of our Lord Jesus, whose marvellous silence before Pilate was far more eloquent than words. To abstain from self-defence is often most difficult, and frequently most wise.<p><a href="/psalms/38-14.htm">Psalm 38:14</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Panteth; </span> or, <span class="ital">goes round</span>; wanders hither and thither, as the word signifies; is perplexed and tossed with many and various thoughts, not knowing what to do, nor whither to go.

The strength suddenly fails. As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

Bakius correctly paraphrases. <a href="/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a> : Corripe sane per legem, castiga per crucem, millies promerui, negare non possum, sed castiga, quaeso, me ex amore ut pater, non ex furore et fervore ut judex; ne punias justitiae rigore, sed misericordiae dulcore (cf. on <a href="/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2</a>). The negative is to be repeated in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>, as in <a href="/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/9-19.htm">Psalm 9:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a>. In the description, which give the ground of the cry for pity, &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, is not the Piel, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a>, but the Niphal of the Kal &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; immediately following (root &#1504;&#1495;). &#1511;&#1510;&#1507; is anger as a breaking forth, fragor (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-7.htm">Hosea 10:7</a>, lxx &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), with e&#774; instead of &#305;&#774; in the first syllable, vowels which alternate in this word; and &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, as a glowing or burning. &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (in Homer, &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;), God's wrath-arrows, i.e., lightnings of wrath, are His judgments of wrath; and &#1497;&#1491;, as in <a href="/psalms/32-4.htm">Psalm 32:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/39-11.htm">Psalm 39:11</a>, God's punishing hand, which makes itself felt in dispensing punishment, hence &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514; might be attached as a mood of sequence. In <a href="/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a> wrath is called &#1494;&#1506;&#1501; as a boiling up. Sin is the cause of this experiencing wrath, and the wrath is the cause of the bodily derangement; sin as an exciting cause of the wrath always manifests itself outwardly even on the body as a fatal power. In <a href="/psalms/38-5.htm">Psalm 38:5</a> sin is compared to waters that threaten to drown one, as in <a href="/psalms/38-5.htm">Psalm 38:5</a> to a burden that presses one down. &#1499;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, they are heavier than I, i.e., than my power of endurance, too heavy for me. In <a href="/psalms/38-6.htm">Psalm 38:6</a> the effects of the operation of the divine hand (as punishing) are wounds, &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; (properly, suffused variegated marks from a blow or wheals, <a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>; from &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;, Arab. h&#803;br, to be or make striped, variegated), which &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, send forth an offensive smell, and &#1504;&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, suppurate. Sin, which causes this, is called &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, because, as it is at last manifest, it is always the destruction of itself. With emphasis does &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; form the second half of the verse. To take &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; out of <a href="/psalms/38-7.htm">Psalm 38:7</a> and put it to this, as Meier and Thenius propose, is to destroy this its proper position. On the three &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, vid., Ewald, 217, l. Thus sick in soul and body, he is obliged to bow and bend himself in the extreme. &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492; is used of a convulsive drawing together of the body, <a href="/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a>; &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1495;, of a bowed mien, <a href="/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a>; &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, of a heavy, lagging gait. With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/38-8.htm">Psalm 38:8</a> the grounding of the petition begins for the third time. His &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., internal muscles of the loins, which are usually the fattest parts, are full of &#1504;&#1511;&#1500;&#1492;, that which is burnt, i.e., parched. It is therefore as though the burning, starting from the central point of the bodily power, would spread itself over the whole body: the wrath of God works commotion in this latter as well as in the soul. Whilst all the energies of life thus yield, there comes over him a partial, almost total lifelessness. &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490; is the proper word for the coldness and rigidity of a corpse; the Niphal means to be brought into this condition, just as &#1504;&#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488; means to be crushed, or to be brought into a condition of crushing, i.e., of violent dissolution. The &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1514; is intended to imply that the loud wail is only the utterance of the pain that is raging in his heart, the outward expression of his ceaseless, deep inward groaning. </body></html>
