David, in the complaints he makes of his enemies, seems to refer to Christ. But our enemies do us real mischief only when they drive us from God and our duty. The true believer's trouble will be made useful; he will learn to wait for his God, and will not seek relief from the world or himself. The less we notice the unkindness and injuries that are done us, the more we consult the quiet of our own minds. David's troubles were the chastisement and the consequence of his transgressions, whilst Christ suffered for our sins and ours only. What right can a sinner have to yield to impatience or anger, when mercifully corrected for his sins? David was very sensible of the present workings of corruption in him. Good men, by setting their sorrow continually before them, have been ready to fall; but by setting God always before them, they have kept their standing. If we are truly penitent for sin, that will make us patient under affliction. Nothing goes nearer to the heart of a believer when in affliction, than to be under the apprehension of God's deserting him; nor does any thing come more feelingly from his heart than this prayer, Be not far from me. The Lord will hasten to help those who trust in him as their salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For in thee, O Lord, do I hope - This shows the reason or ground of his patience. He committed his whole cause to God. He believed that God would take care of his reputation, and that he would vindicate him. See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5-6</a>. He had no doubt that He would protect his character, and that, notwithstanding the reproaches of his enemies, his true character would at last be made to shine forth, so that all men would see that he had been unjustly aspersed. The exact idea here is expressed, and the sentiment was beautifully and perfectly illustrated, in what is said of the Lord Jesus: "Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously," <a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>.<p>Thou wilt hear, O Lord my God - Margin, as in Hebrew: "answer." The idea is, that God would answer his prayers, and that his character would, in answer to those prayers, be set right before the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-17. for he is confident the<p>Lord&#8212;literally, "Sovereign" (to whom he was a servant), would answer his prayer (Ps 3:4; 4:1), and not permit their triumph in his partial halting, of which he was in danger.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/38.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>15 For in thee, O Lord, do I:hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.<p>David committed himself to him that judgeth righteously, and so in patience was able to possess his soul. Hope in God's intervention, and belief in the power of prayer, are two most blessed stays to the soul in time of adversity. Turning right away from the creature to the sovereign Lord of all, and to him as our own covenant God, we shall find the richest solace in waiting upon him. Reputation like a fair pearl may be cast into the mire, but in due time when the Lord makes up his jewels, the godly character shall shine with unclouded splendour.

He has complained, but not as if it were necessary for him first of all to make God acquainted with his suffering; the Omniscient One is directly cognisant of (has directly before Him, &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, like &#1500;&#1504;&#1490;&#1491; in <a href="/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25</a>) every wish that his suffering extorts from him, and even his softer sighing does not escape His knowledge. The sufferer does not say this so much with the view of comforting himself with this thought, as of exciting God's compassion. Hence he even goes on to draw the piteous picture of his condition: his heart is in a state of violent rotary motion, or only of violent, quickly repeated contraction and expansion (Psychol. S. 252; tr. p. 297), that is to say, a state of violent palpitation (&#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1495;&#1512;, Pealal according to Ges. 55, 3). Strength of which the heart is the centre (<a href="/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a>) has left him, and the light of his eyes, even of these (by attraction for &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, since the light of the eyes is not contrasted with anything else), is not with him, but has become lost to him by weeping, watching, and fever. Those who love him and are friendly towards him have placed themselves far from his stroke (nega`, the touch of God's hand of wrath), merely looking on (<a href="/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>), therefore, in a position hostile (<a href="/2_samuel/18-13.htm">2 Samuel 18:13</a>) rather than friendly. &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;, far away, but within the range of vision, within sight, <a href="/genesis/21-16.htm">Genesis 21:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-52.htm">Deuteronomy 32:52</a>.

In the consciousness of his sin he is obliged to be silent, and, renouncing all self-help, to abandon his cause to God. Consciousness of guilt and resignation close his lips, so that he is not able, nor does he wish, to refute the false charges of his enemies; he has no &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, counter-evidence wherewith to vindicate himself.

Lit. Zeitschr. 1843, Bd. iv. S. 117ff.). It is not until the mediaeval synagogal poetry (vid., Zunz, Synagogal-poesie des Mittelalters, S. 121, 381f.) that it is admissible to use it as a conjunction (e.g., &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, when he had found), just as it also occurs in Himjaritic, according to Osiander's deciphering of the inscriptions. The verbal clause appended to the word to which this &#1499;, instar, is prefixed is for the most part an attributive clause as above, but sometimes even a circumstantial clause (Arab. h&#803;a&#770;l), as in <a href="/psalms/38-14.htm">Psalm 38:14</a>; cf. Sur. lxii. 5: "as the likeness of an ass carrying books.") </body></html>
