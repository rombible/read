The way to keep the heart quiet, is to keep ourselves in the love of God. But a sense of guilt is too heavy to bear; and would sink men into despair and ruin, unless removed by the pardoning mercy of God. If there were not sin in our souls, there would be no pain in our bones, no illness in our bodies. The guilt of sin is a burden to the whole creation, which groans under it. It will be a burden to the sinners themselves, when they are heavy-laden under it, or a burden of ruin, when it sinks them to hell. When we perceive our true condition, the Good Physician will be valued, sought, and obeyed. Yet many let their wounds rankle, because they delay to go to their merciful Friend. When, at any time, we are distempered in our bodies, we ought to remember how God has been dishonoured in and by our bodies. The groanings which cannot be uttered, are not hid from Him that searches the heart, and knows the mind of the Spirit. David, in his troubles, was a type of Christ in his agonies, of Christ on his cross, suffering and deserted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My lovers - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a>.

These "lovers" and "friends" were such for whom David had had an affection, and had been friendly to, and therefore it was ungrateful in them to act the part they did; and such who had pretended love and friendship to him in his health and prosperity, but now had deserted him, which is a common case; see <a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13</a>.

Bakius correctly paraphrases. <a href="/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a> : Corripe sane per legem, castiga per crucem, millies promerui, negare non possum, sed castiga, quaeso, me ex amore ut pater, non ex furore et fervore ut judex; ne punias justitiae rigore, sed misericordiae dulcore (cf. on <a href="/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2</a>). The negative is to be repeated in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>, as in <a href="/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/9-19.htm">Psalm 9:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a>. In the description, which give the ground of the cry for pity, &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, is not the Piel, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a>, but the Niphal of the Kal &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; immediately following (root &#1504;&#1495;). &#1511;&#1510;&#1507; is anger as a breaking forth, fragor (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-7.htm">Hosea 10:7</a>, lxx &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), with e&#774; instead of &#305;&#774; in the first syllable, vowels which alternate in this word; and &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, as a glowing or burning. &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (in Homer, &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;), God's wrath-arrows, i.e., lightnings of wrath, are His judgments of wrath; and &#1497;&#1491;, as in <a href="/psalms/32-4.htm">Psalm 32:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/39-11.htm">Psalm 39:11</a>, God's punishing hand, which makes itself felt in dispensing punishment, hence &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514; might be attached as a mood of sequence. In <a href="/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a> wrath is called &#1494;&#1506;&#1501; as a boiling up. Sin is the cause of this experiencing wrath, and the wrath is the cause of the bodily derangement; sin as an exciting cause of the wrath always manifests itself outwardly even on the body as a fatal power. In <a href="/psalms/38-5.htm">Psalm 38:5</a> sin is compared to waters that threaten to drown one, as in <a href="/psalms/38-5.htm">Psalm 38:5</a> to a burden that presses one down. &#1499;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;, they are heavier than I, i.e., than my power of endurance, too heavy for me. In <a href="/psalms/38-6.htm">Psalm 38:6</a> the effects of the operation of the divine hand (as punishing) are wounds, &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; (properly, suffused variegated marks from a blow or wheals, <a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>; from &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;, Arab. h&#803;br, to be or make striped, variegated), which &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, send forth an offensive smell, and &#1504;&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, suppurate. Sin, which causes this, is called &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, because, as it is at last manifest, it is always the destruction of itself. With emphasis does &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; form the second half of the verse. To take &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; out of <a href="/psalms/38-7.htm">Psalm 38:7</a> and put it to this, as Meier and Thenius propose, is to destroy this its proper position. On the three &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, vid., Ewald, 217, l. Thus sick in soul and body, he is obliged to bow and bend himself in the extreme. &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492; is used of a convulsive drawing together of the body, <a href="/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a>; &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1495;, of a bowed mien, <a href="/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a>; &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, of a heavy, lagging gait. With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/38-8.htm">Psalm 38:8</a> the grounding of the petition begins for the third time. His &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., internal muscles of the loins, which are usually the fattest parts, are full of &#1504;&#1511;&#1500;&#1492;, that which is burnt, i.e., parched. It is therefore as though the burning, starting from the central point of the bodily power, would spread itself over the whole body: the wrath of God works commotion in this latter as well as in the soul. Whilst all the energies of life thus yield, there comes over him a partial, almost total lifelessness. &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490; is the proper word for the coldness and rigidity of a corpse; the Niphal means to be brought into this condition, just as &#1504;&#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488; means to be crushed, or to be brought into a condition of crushing, i.e., of violent dissolution. The &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1514; is intended to imply that the loud wail is only the utterance of the pain that is raging in his heart, the outward expression of his ceaseless, deep inward groaning. </body></html>
