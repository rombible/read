David, in all this, was conscious of innocence.

Hiph. of &#1502;&#1505;&#1492;  equals  &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;), let him perish? The change of the number does not favour this; and according to the usage of the language, which is fond of construing &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; with gerunds and participles, and also with abstract nouns, e.g., &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;, the words &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1505; &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; belong together, and they are also accented accordingly: as a snail or slug which goes along in dissolution, goes on and dissolves as it goes (&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1505; after the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; form &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;<p>(Note: In the Phoenician, the Cyprian copper mine &#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; appears to have taken its name from &#1514;&#1502;&#1505;, liquefactio (Levy, Phnizische Studien, iii.7).)).<p>The snail has received its name from this apparent dissolving into slime. For &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; (with Dag. dirimens for &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;) is the naked slimy snail or slug (Targum, according to ancient conception, &#1494;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1500;&#1488; "the slimeworm"), from &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;&#1500;, to make wet, moist.<p>(Note: "God has created nothing without its use," says the Talmud, B. Shabbath 77b; "He has created the snail (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500; &#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1514;) to heal bruises by laying it upon them:" cf. Genesis Rabba, ch. 51 init., where &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500; is explained by &#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, &#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1497;, &#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1497;, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;, &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, limax. Abraham b. David of Fez, the contemporary of Saadia, has explained it in his Arabico-Hebrew Lexicon by &#1488;&#1500;&#1495;&#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;, the slug. Nevertheless this is properly the name of the snail with a house (&#1504;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1511;), Talmudic &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;, and even at the present day in Syria and Palestine Arab. h&#803;lzu&#770;n (which is pronounced h&#803;alezo&#770;n); whereas &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500;, in conformity with the etymon and with the figure, is the naked snail or slug. The ancient versions perhaps failed to recognise this, because the slug is not very often to be seen in hot eastern countries; but &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500; in this signification can be looked upon as traditional. The rendering "a rain-brook or mountain-torrent (Arabic seil sa&#770;bil) which running runs away," would, to say nothing more, give us, as Rosenmller has already observed, a figure that has been made use of already in <a href="/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a>.)<p>In the second figure, the only sense in which &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; belong together is "the untimely birth of a woman;" and rather than explain with the Talmud (B. Med katan 6b) and Targum (contrary to the accents): as an abortion, a mole, <p>(Note: The mole, which was thought to have no eyes, is actually called in post-biblical Hebrew &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, plur. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; (vid., Keelim xxi. 3).)<p>one would alter &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; into &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;. But this is not necessary, since the construct form &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; is found also in other instances (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-11.htm">Deuteronomy 21:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>) out of the genitival relation, in connection with a close coordinate construction. So here, where &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;, according to <a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3-5</a>, is an attributive clause to &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; (the falling away of a woman  equals  abortions), which is used collectively (Ew. 176, b). The accentuation also harmonizes here with the syntactic relation of the words. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>, &#1488;&#1496;&#1491; (plural in African, i.e., Punic, in Dioscorides atadi'n) is the rhamnus or buckthorn, which, like &#1512;&#1514;&#1501;, the broom, not only makes a cheerful crackling fire, but also produces an ash that retains the heat a long time, and is therefore very useful in cooking. The alternative &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; - &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; signifies sive, sive, whether the one or the other. &#1495;&#1497; is that which is living, fresh, viz., the fresh, raw meat still having the blood in it, the opposite of &#1502;&#1489;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-15.htm">1 Samuel 2:15</a>); &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, a fierce heat or fire, here a boiling heat. There is no need to understand &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; metonymically, or perhaps as an adjective  equals  charro&#770;n, of boiled meat: it is a statement of the condition. The suffix of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, however, refers, as being neuter, to the whole cooking apparatus, and more especially to the contents of the pots. The rendering therefore is: whether raw or in a state of heat, i.e., of being cooked through, He (Jahve) carries it away as with a whirlwind. Hengstenberg rightly remarks, "To the raw meat correspond the immature plots, and to the cooked the mature ones." To us, who regard the Psalm as belonging to the time of Absalom, and not, like Hengstenberg, to the time of Saul, the meat in the pots is the new kingship of Absalom. The greater the self-renunciation with which David at that time looked on at the ripening revolt, disclaiming all action of his own, the stronger the confidence with which he expected the righteous interposition of God that did actually follow, but (as he here supposes possible) not until the meat in the pot was almost done through; yet, on the other side, so quickly, that the pots had scarcely felt the crackling heat which should fully cook the meat. </body></html>
