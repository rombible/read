Hence, the word means also to pour out "words" - words that flow freely - words of folly, abuse, or reproach. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>, "the mouth of fools poureth out (Margin, belcheth or babbleth) foolishness." <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/15-28.htm">Proverbs 15:28</a>, "the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things;" that is, "gushes over" with wicked things - as a fountain overflows. In this place, the word means that the enemies of David who were in pursuit of his life, poured out reproaches and threatenings like a gushing fountain.<p>Swords are in their lips - Their words are as sharp swords. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>.<p>For who, say they, doth hear? - That is, no one hears who will be able to punish us. They dread no man; and they have no fear of God. Compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>. The words "say they" are, however, supplied here by the translators, and are not in the original; and the language "may" be understood as that of David himself, "as if" no one heard; that is, It is no wonder that they thus pour out words of reproach, for who "is" there to hear and to punish them? The former interpretation, however, is to be preferred. The language expresses the feelings of the enemies of David, who indulged freely in language of abuse and reproach "as if" there were none to hear. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/59.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. for who, say they&#8212;For the full expression with the supplied words, compare Ps 64:5.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/59.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They belch out; </span> or, <span class="ital">they pour forth</span>, (to wit, words, for what else should come out of the mouth? even sharp and bitter words, as the next clause explains it,) abundantly and vehemently, as a fountain doth waters, as this word signifies.

As far as <a href="/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4</a> we recognise strains familiar in the Psalms. The enemies are called &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/27-7.htm">Job 27:7</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/17-7.htm">Psalm 17:7</a>; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; as shameless, &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a>, on account of their bold shameless greediness, dogs. On &#1500;&#1488; in a subordinate clause, vid., Ewald, &#1431;286, g: without there being transgression or sin on my side, which might have caused it. The suffix (transgression on my part) is similar to <a href="/psalms/18-24.htm">Psalm 18:24</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; (cf. <a href="/job/34-6.htm">Job 34:6</a>) is a similar adverbial collateral definition: without there existing any sin, which ought to be punished. The energetic future jeruzu&#770;n depicts those who servilely give effect to the king's evil caprice; they run hither and thither as if attacking and put themselves in position. &#1492;&#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;  equals  &#1492;&#1514;&#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;, like the Hithpa. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/26-26.htm">Proverbs 26:26</a>, the Hothpa. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1505;, <a href="/leviticus/13-55.htm">Leviticus 13:55</a>., and the Hithpa. &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="/deuteronomy/21-8.htm">Deuteronomy 21:8</a>. Surrounded by such a band of assassins, David is like one besieged, who sighs for succour; and he calls upon Jahve, who seems to be sleeping and inclined to abandon him, with that bold &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, to awake to meet him, i.e., to join him with His help like a relieving army, and to convince Himself from personal observation of the extreme danger in which His charge finds himself. The continuation was obliged to be expressed by &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, because a special appeal to God interposes between &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; and &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;. In the emphatic "Thou," however, after it has been once expressed, is implied the conditional character of the deliverance by the absolute One. And each of the divine names made use of in this lengthy invocation, which corresponds to the deep anxiety of the poet, is a challenge, so to speak, to the ability and willingness, the power and promise of God. The juxtaposition Jahve Elohim Tsebaoth (occurring, besides this instance, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80-5.htm">Psalm 80:5</a>, 20; <a href="/psalms/84-9.htm">Psalm 84:9</a>), which is peculiar to the Elohimic Psalms, is to be explained by the consideration that Elohim had become a proper name like Jahve, and that the designation Jahve Tsebaoth, by the insertion of Elohim in accordance with the style of the Elohimic Psalms, is made still more imposing and solemn; and now &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is a genitive dependent not merely upon &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; but upon &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (similar to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>; Symbolae, p. 15). &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; is in apposition to this threefold name of God. The poet evidently reckons himself as belonging to an Israel from which he excludes his enemies, viz., the true Israel which is in reality the people of God. Among the heathen, against whom the poet invokes God's interposition, are included the heathen-minded in Israel; this at least is the view which brings about this extension of the prayer. Also in connection with the words &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497; the poet, in fact, has chiefly before his mind those who are immediately round about him and thus disposed. It is those who act treacherously from extreme moral nothingness and worthlessness (&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; genit. epexeg.). The music, as Sela directs, here becomes more boisterous; it gives intensity to the strong cry for the judgment of God; and the first unfolding of thought of this Michtam is here brought to a close.<p>The second begins by again taking up the description of the movements of the enemy which was begun in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/59-5.htm">Psalm 59:5</a>. We see at a glance how here <a href="/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a> coincides with <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-5.htm">Psalm 59:5</a>, and <a href="/psalms/59-8.htm">Psalm 59:8</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4</a>, and <a href="/psalms/59-9.htm">Psalm 59:9</a> with <a href="/psalms/59-6.htm">Psalm 59:6</a>. Hence the imprecatory rendering of the futures of <a href="/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a> is not for a moment to be entertained. By day the emissaries of Saul do not venture to carry out their plot, and David naturally does not run into their hands. They therefore come back in the evening, and that evening after evening (cf. <a href="/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a>); they snarl or howl like dogs (&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, used elsewhere of the growling of the bear and the cooing of the dove; it is distinct from &#1504;&#1489;&#1495;, Arab. nbb, nbh&#803;, to bark, and &#1499;&#1500;&#1489;, to yelp), because they do not want to betray themselves by loud barking, and still cannot altogether conceal their vexation and rage; and they go their rounds in the city (like &#1505;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, Sol 3:2, cf. supra <a href="/psalms/55-11.htm">Psalm 55:11</a>), in order to cut off their victim from flight, and perhaps, what would be very welcome to them, to run against him in the darkness. The further description in <a href="/psalms/59-8.htm">Psalm 59:8</a> follows them on this patrol. What they belch out or foam out is to be inferred from the fact that swords are in their lips, which they, as it were, draw so soon as they merely move their lips. Their mouth overflows with murderous thoughts and with slanders concerning David, by which they justify their murderous greed to themselves as if there were no one, viz., no God, who heard it. But Jahve, from whom nothing, as with men, can be kept secret, laughs at them, just as He makes a mockery of all heathen, to whom this murderous band, which fears the light and in unworthy of the Israelitish name, is compared. This is the primary passage to <a href="/psalms/37-13.htm">Psalm 37:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>; for <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59.htm">Psalm 59</a> is perhaps the oldest of the Davidic Psalms that have come down to us, and therefore also the earliest monument of Israelitish poetry in which the divine name Jahve Tsebaoth occurs; and the chronicler, knowing that it was the time of Samuel and David that brought it into use, uses this name only in the life of David. Just as this strophe opened in <a href="/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a> with a distich that recurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/59-15.htm">Psalm 59:15</a>, so it also closes now in <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a> with a distich that recurs below in v. 18, and that is to be amended according to the text of that passage. For all attempts to understand &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; as being genuine prove its inaccuracy. With the old versions it has to be read &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;; but as for the rest, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; must be retained in accordance with the usual variation found in such refrains: my strength, Thee will I regard (<a href="/1_samuel/26-15.htm">1 Samuel 26:15</a>; observe, <a href="/2_samuel/11-16.htm">2 Samuel 11:16</a>), or upon Thee will I wait (cf. &#1500;, <a href="/psalms/130-6.htm">Psalm 130:6</a>); i.e., in the consciousness of my own feebleness, tranquil and resigned, I will look for Thine interposition on my behalf. </body></html>
