They pray for the mercy of God, for they pretend not to plead any merit of their own. His favour would be a full fountain of future joys. It would be a sufficient balance to former griefs. Let the grace of God in us produce the light of good works. And let Divine consolations put gladness into our hearts, and a lustre upon our countenances. The work of our hands, establish thou it; and, in order to that, establish us in it. Instead of wasting our precious, fleeting days in pursuing fancies, which leave the possessors for ever poor, let us seek the forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance in heaven.

If we accept the Mosaic authorship of the psalm, the establishment of Israel in the laud of Canaan may reasonably be taken as the "work" spoken of. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/90.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the transitoriness of men has now been confirmed in <a href="/psalms/90-6.htm">Psalm 90:6</a>. out of the special experience of Israel, the fact that this particular experience has its ground in a divine decree of wrath is more definitely confirmed from the facts of this experience, which, as <a href="/psalms/90-11.htm">Psalm 90:11</a>. complain, unfortunately have done so little to urge them on to the fear of God, which is the condition and the beginning of wisdom. In <a href="/psalms/90-9.htm">Psalm 90:9</a> we distinctly hear the Israel of the desert speaking. That was a generation that fell a prey to the wrath of God (&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493;, <a href="/jeremiah/7-29.htm">Jeremiah 7:29</a>). &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492; is wrath that passes over, breaks through the bounds of subjectivity. All their days (cf. <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15</a>) are passed away (&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, to turn one's self, to turn, e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/1-24.htm">Deuteronomy 1:24</a>) in such wrath, i.e., thoroughly pervaded by it. They have spent their years like a sound (&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1492;), which has hardly gone forth before it has passed away, leaving no trace behind it; the noun signifies a gentle dull sound, whether a murmur (<a href="/job/37-2.htm">Job 37:2</a>) or a groan (<a href="/ezekiel/2-10.htm">Ezekiel 2:10</a>). With &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; in <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a> the sum is stated: there are comprehended therein seventy years; they include, run up to so many. Hitzig renders: the days wherein (&#1489;&#1492;&#1501;) our years consist are seventy years; but &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; side by side with &#1497;&#1502;&#1497; must be regarded as its more minute genitival definition, and the accentuation cannot be objected to. Beside the plural &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; the poetic plural &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; appears here, and it also occurs in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a> (and nowhere else in the Pentateuch). That of which the sum is to be stated stands first of all as a casus absol. Luther's rendering: Siebenzig Jar, wens hoch kompt so sinds achtzig (seventy years, or at the furthest eighty years), as Symmachus also meant by his &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#837; (in Chrysostom), is confirmed by the Talmudic &#1492;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506; &#1500;&#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, "to attain to extreme old age" (B. Mo&#1499;d katan, 28a), and rightly approved of by Hitzig and Olshausen. &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; signifies in <a href="/psalms/71-16.htm">Psalm 71:16</a> full strength, here full measure. Seventy, or at most eighty years, were the average sum of the extreme term of life to which the generation dying out in the wilderness attained. &#1493;&#1512;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; the lxx renders &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, but &#1512;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; is not equivalent to &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501;. The verb &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; signifies to behave violently, e.g., of importunate entreaty, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm">Proverbs 6:3</a>, of insolent treatment, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a>, whence &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; (here &#1512;&#1492;&#1489;), violence, impetuosity, and more especially a boastful vaunting appearance or coming forward, <a href="/job/9-13.htm">Job 9:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a>. The poet means to say that everything of which our life is proud (riches, outward appearance, luxury, beauty, etc.), when regarded in the right light, is after all only &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, inasmuch as it causes us trouble and toil, and &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, because without any true intrinsic merit and worth. To this second predicate is appended the confirmatory clause. &#1495;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is infin. adverb. from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a> : speedily, swiftly (Symmachus, the Quinta, and Jerome). The verb &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; signifies transire in all the Semitic dialects; and following this signification, which is applied transitively in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>, the Jewish expositors and Schultens correctly render: nam transit velocissime. Following upon the perfect &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;, the modus consecutivus &#1493;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;&#1508;&#1492; maintains its retrospective signification. The strengthening of this mood by means of the intentional ah is more usual with the 1st pers. sing., e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-6.htm">Genesis 32:6</a>, than with the 1st pers. plur., as here and in <a href="/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11</a>; Ew. 232, g. The poet glances back from the end of life to the course of life. And life, with all of which it had been proud, appears as an empty burden; for it passed swiftly by and we fled away, we were borne away with rapid flight upon the wings of the past.<p>Such experience as this ought to urge one on to the fear of God; but how rarely does this happen! and yet the fear of God is the condition (stipulation) and the beginning of wisdom. The verb &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/90-11.htm">Psalm 90:11</a>, just as it in general denotes not merely notional but practically living and efficient knowledge, is here used of a knowledge which makes that which is known conduce to salvation. The meaning of &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1498; is determined in accordance with this. The suffix is here either gen. subj.: according to Thy fearfulness (&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; as in <a href="/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a>), or gen. obj.: according to the fear that is due to Thee, which in itself is at once (cf. <a href="/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>) more natural, and here designates the knowledge which is so rarely found, as that which is determined by the fear of God, as a truly religious knowledge. Such knowledge Moses supplicates for himself and for Israel: to number our days teach us rightly to understand. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-17.htm">1 Samuel 23:17</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; signifies "he does not know it to be otherwise, he is well aware of it," shows how &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is meant. Hitzig, contrary to the accentuation, draws it to &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;; but "to number our days" is in itself equivalent to "hourly to contemplate the fleeting character and brevity of our lifetime;" and &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; prays for a true qualification for this, and one that accords with experience. The future that follows is well adapted to the call, as frequently aim and result. But &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; is not to be taken, with Ewald and Hitzig, in the signification of bringing as an offering, a meaning this verb cannot have of itself alone (why should it not have been &#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;?). Bttcher also erroneously renders it after the analogy of <a href="/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a> : "that we may bring wisdom into the heart," which ought to be &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;. &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, deriving its meaning from agriculture, signifies "to carry off, obtain, gain, prop. to bring in," viz., into the barn, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-10.htm">2 Samuel 9:10</a>, Hagg. Psa 1:6; the produce of the field, and in a general way gain or profit, is hence called &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;. A wise heart is the fruit which one reaps or garners in from such numbering of the days, the gain which one carries off from so constantly reminding one's self of the end. &#1500;&#1489;&#1489; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is a poetically intensified expression for &#1500;&#1489; &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, just as &#1500;&#1489; &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488; in <a href="/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a> signifies a calm easy heart. </body></html>
