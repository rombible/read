Worthy is He to be praised, for Israel knows full well that He who hath chosen it is the God of gods. The beginning is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>, and <a href="/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a> from <a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a> (<a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>).

Instead of &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; (cf. <a href="/psalms/78-16.htm">Psalm 78:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-43.htm">Psalm 105:43</a>), which does not admit of the retreating of the tone, the expression is &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;, the ground-form of the part.
