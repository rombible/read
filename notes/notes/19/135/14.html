This language is copied literally from <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a> : "For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants." It is there a part of the song of Moses after the journey through the wilderness, after smiting the kings of the Amorites and of Bashan; and when, delivered from their enemies, the Israelites had come to the borders of the promised land, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31.htm">Deuteronomy 31</a>. The language was, therefore, especially appropriate to the design of this psalm.<p>And he will repent himself concerning his servants - In behalf of his people. That is, he will do as if he repented, or had changed his mind. He will stay his judgments. He will not suffer his people to be destroyed. He will not permit the judgments which seemed to threaten their entire ruin to be carried out to the full. They shall be arrested midway as if God had then changed his mind. Of course, all this is language accommodated to human weakness, and to the manner of speaking among people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/135.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. will judge&#8212;do justice (Ps 72:2).<p>repent himself&#8212;change His dealings (Ps 90:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/135.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Will judge his people; </span> will in due time plead the cause of his people, or give judgment for them, as this phrase is used, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm" title="For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.">Deu 32:36</a> <a href="/jeremiah/5-28.htm" title="They are waxen fat, they shine: yes, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.">Jeremiah 5:28</a> 22:16</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He will repent himself concerning his servants; </span> he will recall that severe sentence which for their sins he had passed upon them, and be reconciled to them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/135.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the Lord will judge his people,....
