Jehovah the Father is great in his perfections; in his power, wisdom, faithfulness, grace, and goodness; and in his works of creation, providence, and grace: and so is Jehovah the Son, who seems chiefly designed, who is called "our Lord" or "Adon" in the next clause; he is great, having the same perfections his Father has; and doing the same works, besides the miracles he wrought here on earth, and the great work of our redemption: he is the great God and our Saviour, and a great Saviour he is; and indeed he is great in all his offices of Prophet, Priest, and King: and so is the blessed Spirit, who is equal to the Father and Son, and greater than he that is in the world. Now all this the psalmist could say from his own knowledge; he knew the Lord was great, from the consideration and meditation of his wondrous works; he knew the greatness of Christ, from the revelation made to him of his person, offices, and grace; he knew the greatness of the divine Spirit, from the inward experience of his upon his heart, as well as from his being divinely inspired by him; and because of this greatness of the Lord, as well as his goodness, he is to be praised; it is mentioned as a reason of it; <p>and that our Lord is above all gods; the Lord our righteousness; Immanuel, God with us: our Lord, not only by right of creation, but of redemption; he is above all that the Heathens called gods, even the greatest of them; not the idols their hands made only, but the heavens and all the host of them, the sun, moon, and stars; his glory is above them, being the Maker of them, as God; and he is made higher than they, as man and Mediator: he is above civil magistrates, princes, and kings of the earth, called gods, <a href="/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a>; he is King of kings, and Lord of lords, he is higher than they; by him they reign, and to him they are accountable; and he is above the angels, sometimes called "Elohim", or gods, <a href="/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a>; he has a more excellent name and nature than they; he is the Creator of them, the object of their worship, to whom they minister, whose servants they are; and he is now exalted above them in the human nature, at the right hand of God; see <a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/135.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/135.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">For I know</span>] A further reason for praising Jehovah. <span class="ital">I</span> is emphatic.

This greatness is shown, firstly, in his power over nature, which is the subject of vers. 7, 8; and secondly, in his dealings with mankind, which form the subject of vers. 8-12. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/134.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Psalm begins, like its predecessor, with &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;; there is directs attention to an attractive phenomenon, here to a duty which springs from the office. For that it is not the persons frequenting the Temple who are addressed is at once clear from the fact that the tarrying of these in the Temple through the night, when such a thing did actually occur (<a href="/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>), was only an exception. And then, however, from the fact that &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; is the customary word for the service of the priests and Levites, <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-7.htm">Deuteronomy 18:7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-30.htm">1 Chronicles 23:30</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-11.htm">2 Chronicles 29:11</a> (cf. on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, and <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>), which is also continued in the night, <a href="/1_chronicles/9-33.htm">1 Chronicles 9:33</a>. Even the Targum refers <a href="/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a> to the Temple-watch. In the second Temple the matter was arranged thus. After midnight the chief over the gate-keepers took the keys of the inner Temple and went with some of the priests through the little wicket of the Fire Gate (&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1491;). In the inner court this patrol divided into two companies, each with a burning torch; one company turned west, the other east, and so they compassed the court to see whether everything was in readiness for the service of the dawning day. At the bakers' chamber, in which the Mincha of the high priest was baked (&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1503;), they met with the cry: All is well. In the meanwhile the rest of the priests also arose, bathed, and put on their garments. Then they went into the stone chamber (one half of which was the place of session of the Sanhedrim), where, under the superintendence of the chief over the drawing of the lots and of a judge, around whom stood all the priests in their robes of office, the functions of the priests in the service of the coming day were assigned to them by lot (<a href="/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9</a>). Accordingly Tholuck, with Kster, regards <a href="/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>. and <a href="/psalms/134-3.htm">Psalm 134:3</a> as the antiphon of the Temple-watch going off duty and those coming on. It might also be the call and counter-call with which the watchmen greeted one another when they met. But according to the general keeping of the Psalm, <a href="/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>. have rather to be regarded as a call to devotion and intercession, which the congregation addresses to the priests and Levites entrusted with the night-service in the Temple. It is an error to suppose that "in the nights" can be equivalent to "early and late." If the Psalter contains Morning Psalms (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/3-1.htm">Psalm 3:1-8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1-11</a>) and Evening Psalms (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1-8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/141-1.htm">Psalm 141:1-10</a>), why should it then not contain a vigil Psalm? On this very ground Venema's idea too, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is syncopated from &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, "with Hallels, i.e., praises," is useless. Nor is there any reason for drawing &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;, as the lxx does, to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/134-2.htm">Psalm 134:2</a>,<p>(Note: The lxx adjusts the shortening of <a href="/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a> arising from this, by reading &#1489;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492; after <a href="/psalms/135-2.htm">Psalm 135:2</a>.)<p>or, what would be more natural, to the &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; that opens the Psalm, since it is surely not strange that, so long as the sanctuary was standing, a portion of the servants of God who ministered in it had to remain up at night to guard it, and to see to it that nothing was wanting in the preparations for the early service. That this ministering watching should be combined with devotional praying is the purport of the admonition in <a href="/psalms/134-2.htm">Psalm 134:2</a>. Raising suppliant hands (&#1497;&#1491;&#1499;&#1501;, negligently written for &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;) towards the Most Holy Place (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;), they are to bless Jahve. &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; (according to B. Sota 39a, the accusative of definition: in holiness, i.e., after washing of hands), in view of <a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/138-2.htm">Psalm 138:2</a> (cf. &#1512;&#1493;&#1501; in <a href="/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a>), has to be regarded as the accusative of the direction. </body></html>
