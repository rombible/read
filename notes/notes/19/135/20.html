And the more deplorable the condition of the Gentile nations that worship idols, the more are we to be thankful that we know better. Let us pity, and pray for, and seek to benefit benighted heathens and deluded sinners. Let us endeavour to glorify his name, and recommend his truth, not only with our lips, but by holy lives, copying the example of Christ's goodness and truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/135.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bless the Lord, O house of Israel ... - This passage, also, is evidently an imitation of the passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115-9.htm">Psalm 115:9-13</a>. The form in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115.htm">Psalm 115</a>, however, is rather an exhortation to trust in the Lord, and an assurance that God would bless the classes spoken of, than a call on them to bless the Lord. Still the same classes of persons are referred to; the house of Israel; the house of Aaron; and those who feared the Lord. The passage needs no further illustration than what is found in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115-9.htm">Psalm 115:9-13</a>. It is an earnest call on all classes of the people to bless and praise the Lord. It is language expressive of overflowing joy; the utterance of a heart full of exalted conceptions of the majesty, the glory, and the mercy of God; of a heart which feels to the utmost the fitness of praise, and desires that all classes of people - priests and people - that all created things should unite in the praise of Yahweh. Who, in reading the psalm, can fail to catch the feelings of the psalmist, and to say Amen and amen! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/135.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19-21.

These were of the same tribe with the house of Aaron, but inferior ministers; they ministered to the priests, and had the charge of things in the tabernacle and temple; many of them were porters in the latter, and others were singers, and of these Kimchi interprets the words; whose work it was to give thanks morning and evening, and so are with great propriety called upon to bless the Lord, <a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6</a>; and may mystically design inferior officers in the church, who are helps and assistants to ministers in the government and discipline of it, and have the care of its secular affairs; and who, when they behave well, purchase to themselves a good degree, and boldness in the faith; and even doorkeepers in the house of the Lord have reason to bless his name for a place there; and all the saints are the sweet singers of Israel, have the new song of electing, redeeming, and calling grace, put into their mouths, and therefore should bless the Lord; <p>ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord; these are distinct from the Israelites, priests, and Levites, and design the proselytes among them of other nations that truly feared God, as Jarchi notes; and all such persons, whoever and wherever they are, have reason to bless the Lord for the fear of him they have, which is not from nature, but from grace; and for the layouts shown them, the blessings bestowed upon them, the good things laid up for them, and the guard that is about them, which the Scriptures abundantly declare, and experience confirms. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/135.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/135.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bless the Lord, O house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/115-11.htm">Psalm 115:11, 13</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/135.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This God who rules so praiseworthily in the universe and in the history of Israel is the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever.
