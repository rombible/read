For that it is not the persons frequenting the Temple who are addressed is at once clear from the fact that the tarrying of these in the Temple through the night, when such a thing did actually occur (<a href="/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>), was only an exception. And then, however, from the fact that &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; is the customary word for the service of the priests and Levites, <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-7.htm">Deuteronomy 18:7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-30.htm">1 Chronicles 23:30</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-11.htm">2 Chronicles 29:11</a> (cf. on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, and <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>), which is also continued in the night, <a href="/1_chronicles/9-33.htm">1 Chronicles 9:33</a>. Even the Targum refers <a href="/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a> to the Temple-watch. In the second Temple the matter was arranged thus. After midnight the chief over the gate-keepers took the keys of the inner Temple and went with some of the priests through the little wicket of the Fire Gate (&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1491;). In the inner court this patrol divided into two companies, each with a burning torch; one company turned west, the other east, and so they compassed the court to see whether everything was in readiness for the service of the dawning day. At the bakers' chamber, in which the Mincha of the high priest was baked (&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1503;), they met with the cry: All is well. In the meanwhile the rest of the priests also arose, bathed, and put on their garments. Then they went into the stone chamber (one half of which was the place of session of the Sanhedrim), where, under the superintendence of the chief over the drawing of the lots and of a judge, around whom stood all the priests in their robes of office, the functions of the priests in the service of the coming day were assigned to them by lot (<a href="/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9</a>). Accordingly Tholuck, with Kster, regards <a href="/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>. and <a href="/psalms/134-3.htm">Psalm 134:3</a> as the antiphon of the Temple-watch going off duty and those coming on. It might also be the call and counter-call with which the watchmen greeted one another when they met. But according to the general keeping of the Psalm, <a href="/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>. have rather to be regarded as a call to devotion and intercession, which the congregation addresses to the priests and Levites entrusted with the night-service in the Temple. It is an error to suppose that "in the nights" can be equivalent to "early and late." If the Psalter contains Morning Psalms (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/3-1.htm">Psalm 3:1-8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1-11</a>) and Evening Psalms (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1-8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/141-1.htm">Psalm 141:1-10</a>), why should it then not contain a vigil Psalm? On this very ground Venema's idea too, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is syncopated from &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, "with Hallels, i.e., praises," is useless. Nor is there any reason for drawing &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;, as the lxx does, to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/134-2.htm">Psalm 134:2</a>,<p>(Note: The lxx adjusts the shortening of <a href="/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a> arising from this, by reading &#1489;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492; after <a href="/psalms/135-2.htm">Psalm 135:2</a>.)<p>or, what would be more natural, to the &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; that opens the Psalm, since it is surely not strange that, so long as the sanctuary was standing, a portion of the servants of God who ministered in it had to remain up at night to guard it, and to see to it that nothing was wanting in the preparations for the early service. That this ministering watching should be combined with devotional praying is the purport of the admonition in <a href="/psalms/134-2.htm">Psalm 134:2</a>. Raising suppliant hands (&#1497;&#1491;&#1499;&#1501;, negligently written for &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;) towards the Most Holy Place (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;), they are to bless Jahve. &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; (according to B. Sota 39a, the accusative of definition: in holiness, i.e., after washing of hands), in view of <a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/138-2.htm">Psalm 138:2</a> (cf. &#1512;&#1493;&#1501; in <a href="/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a>), has to be regarded as the accusative of the direction. </body></html>
