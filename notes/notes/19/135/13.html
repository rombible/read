The generations of people pass away; the kingdoms of the earth change; the idols perish, but thou art the same. The object here seems to be to bring the image or the idea of God before the mind as he was when he performed these great works, as a God interposing in behalf of his people, and as worthy of praise. The idea is that he is the same now that he was then; and as he then impressed the world with a sense of his majesty and power, and as he then interposed in behalf of his people by mighty signs and wonders, we should feel that, being an unchangeable God, he can do it now, and is now equally worthy. of confidence, adoration, and praise.<p>And thy memorial - Thy remembrance; the memory of thyself.

Worthy is He to be praised, for Israel knows full well that He who hath chosen it is the God of gods. The beginning is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>, and <a href="/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a> from <a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a> (<a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>).

Instead of &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; (cf. <a href="/psalms/78-16.htm">Psalm 78:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-43.htm">Psalm 105:43</a>), which does not admit of the retreating of the tone, the expression is &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;, the ground-form of the part.
