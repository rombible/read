And how ought redemption from the wrath to come, from the power of sin and of Satan, to be valued! The sinner convinced of his guilt and danger, when by looking to a crucified Saviour he receives peace to his conscience, and power to break off his sins, often can scarcely believe that the prospect which opens to him is a reality.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/126.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then was our mouth filled with laughter - Then were we happy; completely happy.

Their feelings find expression in the songs of Zion. This is natural; this is proper; this will occur when sinners are converted. An assemblage of young converts is always a happy assemblage; a place where there is a "revival" of religion is always a happy place - full of songs and singing.<p>Then said they among the heathen - The nations; the people among whom they dwelt.<p>The Lord hath done great things for them - In causing their return to their own land; in ordering the arrangements for it; in bringing their captivity to an end; in securing such interposition from the civil rulers as to facilitate their return. This would indicate that the surrounding people had not an unfriendly feeling toward them, but that they pitied them in exile, and were disposed to acknowledge the hand of God in what was done. Their deliverance, in the circumstances, was such as evidently to have been the work of God. This will agree well with the account of the return of the exiles from Babylon, and with all that had been done for them by Cyrus.

Older expositors are of opinion that the heavenly Zion must be understood on account of the Chaldaean and the Roman catastrophes; but these, in fact, only came upon the buildings on the mountain, not upon the mountain itself, which in itself and according to its appointed destiny (vid., <a href="/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>; <a href="/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>) remained unshaken. in <a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a> also it is none other than the earthly Jerusalem that is meant.
