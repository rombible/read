It is good to enter into the history of God's favours, and in each to observe, and own, that his mercy endureth for ever.

The death of a wicked man is a benefit to the world, and the act of removing him may be really an act of the highest benevolence to mankind.

The hymn, it is true, is not found in the Versions, but Dr Schechter thinks that its authenticity is established, and that its omission is accounted for, by the prominence which it gives to the house of Zadok. It was natural for Ben Sira, who knew that family in its best representative, Simon the Just, to give thanks for its election to the priesthood: it was equally natural for his grandson the translator to omit such a thanksgiving, when the high-priests of the house of Zadok had disgraced their calling, and the house of Zadok had been superseded by the Maccabaean line.

With reference to the Deuteronomic colouring of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/136-19.htm">Psalm 136:19-22</a>, vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>; also the expression "Israel His servant" recalls <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/135-14.htm">Psalm 135:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a>), and still more <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>, where the comprehension of Israel under the unity of this notion has its own proper place. In other respects, too, the Psalm is an echo of earlier model passages. Who alone doeth great wonders sounds like <a href="/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a> (<a href="/psalms/86-10.htm">Psalm 86:10</a>); and the adjective "great" that is added to "wonders" shows that the poet found the formula already in existence.
