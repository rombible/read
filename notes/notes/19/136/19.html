It is good to enter into the history of God's favours, and in each to observe, and own, that his mercy endureth for ever. He put them in possession of a good land; it was a figure of the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/136.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To him which smote great kings - On this passage see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>. There is little difference in the two places, except that here the statement is divided by the refrain, "For his mercy endureth forever." The idea in the whole passage, in view of the divine interposition in slaying the mighty kings, and in giving their land for a possession to the Hebrew people, is, that it was a proof of mercy and benevolence. It is benevolence to mankind and to the church of God - it is in the interests of humanity, of domestic peace, and of the charities of life, to remove wicked people from the world. This mercy may be manifested further, not merely in removing the wicked, but in transferring their possessions to those who will make a better use of them. Thus the possessions of these mighty kings, Sihon and Og, were transferred to the people of God, and lands which had been devoted to the service of blood, ambition, crime, pollution, and idolatry, became devoted to the service of religion and righteousness. In like manner, through the removal of a wicked man from the world by death, God may cause his wealth, accumulated by avarice and dishonesty, to be transferred to the hands of children who will make a good use of it - children converted as if in anticipation of this, and with a view to this. Among the highest expressions of mercy to the world may be, therefore, the removal of wicked princes in war - or the removal of wicked people, in other ranks of life, by death in any form. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/136.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. overthrew&#8212;literally, "shook off," as in Ex 14:27, as a contemptuous rejection of a reptile.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/136.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/136.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Sihon king of the Amorites,....

With reference to the name of the Egyptian ruler Pharaoh (Herodotus also, ii. 111, calls the Pharaoh of the Exodus the son of Sesostris-Rameses Miumun, not &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, as he is properly called, but absolutely &#x3a6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;), vid., on <a href="/psalms/73-22.htm">Psalm 73:22</a>. After the God to whom the praise is to be ascribed has been introduced with &#1500; by always fresh attributes, the &#1500; before the names of Sihon and of Og is perplexing. The words are taken over, as are the six lines of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/136-17.htm">Psalm 136:17-22</a> in the main, from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>, with only a slight alteration in the expression. In <a href="/psalms/136-23.htm">Psalm 136:23</a> the continued influence of the construction &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500; is at an end. The connection by means of &#1513;&#1473; (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135-8.htm">Psalm 135:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10</a>) therefore has reference to the preceding "for His goodness endureth for ever."

In <a href="/psalms/136-23.htm">Psalm 136:23</a> the praise changes suddenly to that which has been experienced very recently. The attribute in <a href="/psalms/136-25.htm">Psalm 136:25</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-15.htm">Psalm 145:15</a>) leads one to look back to a time in which famine befell them together with slavery. </body></html>
