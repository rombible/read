Psa 136:2 and <a href="/psalms/136-3.htm">Psalm 136:3</a> (God of gods and Lord of lords) are taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/136-12.htm">Psalm 136:12</a> (with a strong hand and stretched-out arm) from <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>, and frequently (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/32-21.htm">Jeremiah 32:21</a>); <a href="/psalms/136-16.htm">Psalm 136:16</a> like <a href="/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a> (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). With reference to the Deuteronomic colouring of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/136-19.htm">Psalm 136:19-22</a>, vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>; also the expression "Israel His servant" recalls <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/135-14.htm">Psalm 135:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a>), and still more <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>, where the comprehension of Israel under the unity of this notion has its own proper place. In other respects, too, the Psalm is an echo of earlier model passages. Who alone doeth great wonders sounds like <a href="/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a> (<a href="/psalms/86-10.htm">Psalm 86:10</a>); and the adjective "great" that is added to "wonders" shows that the poet found the formula already in existence. In connection with <a href="/psalms/136-5.htm">Psalm 136:5</a> he has <a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a> or <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a> in his mind; &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, like &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, is the demiurgic wisdom. <a href="/psalms/136-6.htm">Psalm 136:6</a> calls to mind <a href="/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>; the expression is "above the waters," as in <a href="/psalms/34-2.htm">Psalm 34:2</a> "upon the seas," because the water is partly visible and partly invisible &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). The plural &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, luces, instead of &#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, lumina (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-8.htm">Ezekiel 32:8</a>, &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;), is without precedent. It is a controverted point whether &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514; in <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a> signifies lights (cf. &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/139-12.htm">Psalm 139:12</a>) or herbs (<a href="/2_kings/4-39.htm">2 Kings 4:39</a>). The plural &#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is also rare (occurring only besides in <a href="/psalms/114-2.htm">Psalm 114:2</a>): it here denotes the dominion of the moon on the one hand, and (going beyond <a href="/genesis/1-16.htm">Genesis 1:16</a>) of the stars on the other. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, is the second member of the stat. construct. </body></html>
