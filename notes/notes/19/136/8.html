By mercy we understand the Lord's disposition to save those whom sin has rendered miserable and vile, and all the provision he has made for the redemption of sinners by Jesus Christ. The counsels of this mercy have been from everlasting, and the effects of it will endure for ever, to all who are interested in it. The Lord continues equally ready to show mercy to all who seek for it, and this is the source of all our hope and comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/136.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sun to rule by day - <a href="/genesis/1-16.htm">Genesis 1:16</a>.

With reference to the Deuteronomic colouring of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/136-19.htm">Psalm 136:19-22</a>, vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>; also the expression "Israel His servant" recalls <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/135-14.htm">Psalm 135:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a>), and still more <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>, where the comprehension of Israel under the unity of this notion has its own proper place. In other respects, too, the Psalm is an echo of earlier model passages. Who alone doeth great wonders sounds like <a href="/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a> (<a href="/psalms/86-10.htm">Psalm 86:10</a>); and the adjective "great" that is added to "wonders" shows that the poet found the formula already in existence.
