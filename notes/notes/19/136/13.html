It is good to enter into the history of God's favours, and in each to observe, and own, that his mercy endureth for ever. He put them in possession of a good land; it was a figure of the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/136.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To him which divided the Red sea into parts - More literally, "Parted it into parts;" made parts of that which before was unbroken and a whole.

Into two parts, so that the waters of it stood as a wall on the right and left hand of the Israelites, as they passed through; this was done by means of a strong east wind, <a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>. The Jews have a tradition, which Jarchi, Kimchi, and Arama, make mention of, that the sea was divided into twelve parts, according to the twelve tribes of Israel, and every tribe had a path by itself to walk in; but for this there is no foundation: however, the dividing it into parts was a wonderful work, and a rich display of mercy to Israel; <p>for his mercy endureth for ever; the children of Israel were encompassed about, and in the utmost distress: the rocks were on each side, Pharaoh and his host behind them, the Red sea before them; and so no visible way of escape; but the Lord cut a way for them through the sea, and saved them. The sea is an emblem of this world, which is like a tempestuous troubled sea; where everything is restless, fluctuating, and passing away; where the people of God are tossed with tempests; and where afflictions, like the waves and billows of the sea, come over them one after another; and through which they must pass and enter the kingdom: and God, that wills, orders, and appoints them, sets these proud waves of the sea their bounds, or makes them a calm; and, sooner or later, makes a way through them and out of them, which is owing to his enduring mercy, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/136.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/136.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>.

Psa 136:2 and <a href="/psalms/136-3.htm">Psalm 136:3</a> (God of gods and Lord of lords) are taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/136-12.htm">Psalm 136:12</a> (with a strong hand and stretched-out arm) from <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>, and frequently (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/32-21.htm">Jeremiah 32:21</a>); <a href="/psalms/136-16.htm">Psalm 136:16</a> like <a href="/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a> (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). With reference to the Deuteronomic colouring of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/136-19.htm">Psalm 136:19-22</a>, vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>; also the expression "Israel His servant" recalls <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/135-14.htm">Psalm 135:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a>), and still more <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>, where the comprehension of Israel under the unity of this notion has its own proper place. In other respects, too, the Psalm is an echo of earlier model passages. Who alone doeth great wonders sounds like <a href="/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a> (<a href="/psalms/86-10.htm">Psalm 86:10</a>); and the adjective "great" that is added to "wonders" shows that the poet found the formula already in existence. In connection with <a href="/psalms/136-5.htm">Psalm 136:5</a> he has <a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a> or <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a> in his mind; &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, like &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, is the demiurgic wisdom. <a href="/psalms/136-6.htm">Psalm 136:6</a> calls to mind <a href="/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>; the expression is "above the waters," as in <a href="/psalms/34-2.htm">Psalm 34:2</a> "upon the seas," because the water is partly visible and partly invisible &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). The plural &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, luces, instead of &#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, lumina (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-8.htm">Ezekiel 32:8</a>, &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;), is without precedent. It is a controverted point whether &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514; in <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a> signifies lights (cf. &#1488;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/139-12.htm">Psalm 139:12</a>) or herbs (<a href="/2_kings/4-39.htm">2 Kings 4:39</a>).
