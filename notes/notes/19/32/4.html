But the true and only way to peace of conscience, is, to confess our sins, that they may be forgiven; to declare them that we may be justified. Although repentance and confession do not merit the pardon of transgression, they are needful to the real enjoyment of forgiving mercy. And what tongue can tell the happiness of that hour, when the soul, oppressed by sin, is enabled freely to pour forth its sorrows before God, and to take hold of his covenanted mercy in Christ Jesus! Those that would speed in prayer, must seek the Lord, when, by his providence, he calls them to seek him, and, by his Spirit, stirs them up to seek him. In a time of finding, when the heart is softened with grief, and burdened with guilt; when all human refuge fails; when no rest can be found to the troubled mind, then it is that God applies the healing balm by his Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For day and night - I found no relief even at night.

That is, the radical moisture in him was almost dried up, as brooks in the summer season; his body was parched, as it were, with the burning heat of the disease; or with an apprehension of the wrath of God under it, or both: and so he continued until be was brought to a true sense of sin, and an acknowledgment of it, when he had the discoveries of pardoning love, as is expressed in <a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>.

The thought: how gracious hath Jahve been to me, takes a more universal form in <a href="/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>. It is an exclamation (&#1502;&#1492;, as in <a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>) of adoring admiration. &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is the sum of the good which God has treasured up for the constant and ever increasing use and enjoyment of His saints. &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; is used in the same sense as in <a href="/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a>; cf. &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>. Instead of &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468; it ought strictly to be &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;; for we can say &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, but not &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;. What is meant is, the doing or manifesting of &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; springing from this &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, which is the treasure of grace. Jahve thus makes Himself known to His saints for the confounding of their enemies and in defiance of all the world besides, <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>. He takes those who are His under His protection from the &#1512;&#1499;&#1505;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, confederations of men (from &#1512;&#1499;&#1505;, Arab. rks, magna copia), from the wrangling, i.e., the slanderous scourging, of tongues. Elsewhere it is said, that God hides one in &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493; (<a href="/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>), or in &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1493; (<a href="/psalms/61-5.htm">Psalm 61:5</a>), or in His shadow (&#1510;&#1500;, <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>); in this passage it is: in the defence and protection of His countenance, i.e., in the region of the unapproachable light that emanates from His presence. The &#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; is the safe and comfortable protection of the Almighty which spans over the persecuted one like an arbour or rich foliage. With &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; &#1492; David again passes over to his own personal experience. The unity of the Psalm requires us to refer the praise to the fact of the deliverance which is anticipated by faith. Jahve has shown him wondrous favour, inasmuch as He has given him a &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512; as a place of abode. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;, from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; to shut in (Arabic misr with the denominative verb mas&#803;s&#803;ara, to found a fortified city), signifies both a siege, i.e., a shutting in by siege-works, and a fortifying (cf. <a href="/psalms/60-11.htm">Psalm 60:11</a> with <a href="/psalms/108-11.htm">Psalm 108:11</a>), i.e., a shutting in by fortified works against the attack of the enemy, <a href="/2_chronicles/8-5.htm">2 Chronicles 8:5</a>. The fenced city is mostly interpreted as God Himself and His powerful and gracious protection. We might then compare <a href="/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a> and other passages. But why may not an actual city be intended, viz., Ziklag? The fact, that after long and troublous days David there found a strong and sure resting-place, he here celebrates beforehand, and unconsciously prophetically, as a wondrous token of divine favour. To him Ziklag was indeed the turning-point between his degradation and exaltation. He had already said in his trepidation (&#1495;&#1508;&#1494;, trepidare), cf. <a href="/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a> : I am cut away from the range of Thine eyes. &#1504;&#1490;&#1512;&#1494;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is explained according to &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1503;, an axe; <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/3-54.htm">Lamentations 3:54</a>, &#1504;&#1490;&#1512;&#1494;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jonah/2-5.htm">Jonah 2:5</a>, &#1504;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, favour this interpretation. He thought in his fear and despair, that God would never more care about him. &#1488;&#1499;&#1503;, verum enim vero, but Jahve heard the cry of his entreaty, when he cried unto Him (the same words as in <a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>). On the ground of these experiences he calls upon all the godly to love the God who has done such gracious things, i.e., to love Love itself. On the one hand, He preserves the faithful (&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;  equals  &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, as in <a href="/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>), who keep faith with Him, by also proving to them His faithfulness by protection in every danger; on the other hand, not scantily, but plentifully (&#1506;&#1500; as in <a href="/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a> : &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;) He rewardeth those that practise pride-in the sight of God, the Lord, the sin of sins. An animating appeal to the godly (metamorphosed out of the usual form of the expression &#1495;&#1494;&#1511; &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1509;, macte esto), resembling the animating call to his own heart in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>, closes the Psalm. The godly and faithful are here called "those who wait upon Jahve." They are to wait patiently, for this waiting has a glorious end; the bright, spring sun at length breaks through the dark, angry aspect of the heavens, and the esto mihi is changed into halleluja. This eye of hope patiently directed towards Jahve is the characteristic of the Old Testament faith. The substantial unity, however, of the Old Testament order of grace, or mercy, with that of the New Testament, is set before us in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1-11</a>, which, in its New Testament and Pauline character, is the counterpart of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-14</a>. </body></html>
