The lxx appropriately renders &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; by &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, for God is called "good" not so much in respect of His nature as of the revelation of His nature. The fulness of this revelation, says <a href="/psalms/106-2.htm">Psalm 106:2</a> (like <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>), is inexhaustible. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; are the manifestations of His all-conquering power which makes everything subservient to His redemptive purposes (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>); and &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is the glory (praise or celebration) of His self-attestation in history. The proclaiming of these on the part of man can never be an exhaustive echo of them. In <a href="/psalms/106-3.htm">Psalm 106:3</a> the poet tells what is the character of those who experience such manifestations of God; and to the assertion of the blessedness of these men he appends the petition in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/106-4.htm">Psalm 106:4</a>, that God would grant him a share in the experiences of the whole nation which is the object of these manifestations. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; beside &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; is a genitive of the object: with the pleasure which Thou turnest towards Thy people, i.e., when Thou again (cf. <a href="/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47</a>) showest Thyself gracious unto them. On &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; cf. <a href="/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80-15.htm">Psalm 80:15</a>, and on &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489;, <a href="/jeremiah/29-32.htm">Jeremiah 29:32</a>; a similar Beth is that beside &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495; (at, on account of, not: in connection with), <a href="/psalms/21-2.htm">Psalm 21:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/122-1.htm">Psalm 122:1</a>.
