An undue desire, even for lawful things, becomes sinful. God showed his displeasure for this. He filled them with uneasiness of mind, terror of conscience, and self-reproach. Many that fare deliciously every day, and whose bodies are healthful, have leanness in their souls: no love to God, no thankfulness, no appetite for the Bread of life, and then the soul must be lean. Those wretchedly forget themselves, that feast their bodies and starve their souls. Even the true believer will see abundant cause to say, It is of the Lord's mercies that I am not consumed. Often have we set up idols in our hearts, cleaved to some forbidden object; so that if a greater than Moses had not stood to turn away the anger of the Lord, we should have been destroyed. If God dealt severely with Moses for unadvised words, what do those deserve who speak many proud and wicked words? It is just in God to remove those relations that are blessings to us, when we are peevish and provoking to them, and grieve their spirits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions - The word rendered "inventions" means properly "works; deeds;" then it is used in the sense of "evil" deeds, crimes.<p>And the plague brake in upon them - See <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8-9</a>.

Sin is an invention of man's: when our first parents sinned, they found out many inventions; and their posterity ever since have been inventors of evil things; and man's invention is very quick at that work.

For what <a href="/psalms/106-13.htm">Psalm 106:13</a> places foremost was the root of the whole evil, that, falling away from faith in God's promise, they forgot the works of God which had been wrought in confirmation of it, and did not wait for the carrying out of His counsel. The poet has before his eye the murmuring for water on the third day after the miraculous deliverance (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22-24</a>) and in Rephidim (<a href="/exodus/17-2.htm">Exodus 17:2</a>). Then the murmuring for flesh in the first and second years of the exodus which was followed by the sending of the quails (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a>), together with the wrathful judgment by which the murmuring for the second time was punished (Kibro&#770;th ha-Ta'avah, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33-35</a>). This dispensation of wrath the poet calls &#1512;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503; (lxx, Vulgate, and Syriac erroneously &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, perhaps &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;, nourishment), inasmuch as he interprets <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33-35</a> of a wasting disease, which swept away the people in consequence of eating inordinately of the flesh, and in the expression (cf. <a href="/psalms/78-31.htm">Psalm 78:31</a>) he closely follows <a href="/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16</a>.

The poet has <a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a> in his eye. The rebellious ones were swallowed up by the earth, and their two hundred and fifty noble, non-Levite partisans consumed by fire. The fact that the poet does not mention Korah among those who were swallowed up is in perfect harmony with <a href="/numbers/16-25.htm">Numbers 16:25</a>., <a href="/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>; cf. however <a href="/numbers/26-10.htm">Numbers 26:10</a>.

God made and also expressed the resolve to destroy Israel. Then Moses stepped into the gap (before the gap), i.e., as it were covered the breach, inasmuch as he placed himself in it and exposed his own life; cf. on the fact, besides <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, also <a href="/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-10.htm">Psalm 10:10</a>, and on the expression, <a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a> and also <a href="/jeremiah/18-20.htm">Jeremiah 18:20</a>. </body></html>
