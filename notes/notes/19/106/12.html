Bar. 2:12), makes itself heard here in <a href="/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>; Israel is bearing at this time the punishment of its sins, by which it has made itself like its forefathers. In this needy and helpless condition the poet, who all along speaks as a member of the assembly, takes the way of the confession of sin, which leads to the forgiveness of sin and to the removal of the punishment of sin. &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-47.htm">1 Kings 8:47</a>, signifies to be, and the Hiph. to prove one's self to be, a &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. &#1506;&#1501; in <a href="/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a> is equivalent to aeque ac, as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:16</a>; <a href="/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>. With <a href="/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a> the retrospect begins. The fathers contended with Moses and Aaron in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/5-21.htm">Exodus 5:21</a>), and gave no heed to the prospect of redemption (<a href="/exodus/6-9.htm">Exodus 6:9</a>). The miraculous judgments which Moses executed (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>) had no more effect in bringing them to a right state of mind, and the abundant tokens of loving-kindness (<a href="/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>) amidst which God redeemed them made so little impression on their memories that they began to despair and to murmur even at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11</a>.). With &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>, alternates &#1489;&#1468; (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-15.htm">Ezekiel 10:15</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;); cf. the alternation of prepositions in <a href="/joel/3-8.htm">Joel 3:8</a>. When they behaved thus, Jahve might have left their redemption unaccomplished, but out of unmerited mercy He nevertheless redeemed them. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/106-8.htm">Psalm 106:8-11</a> are closely dependent upon <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>. <a href="/psalms/106-11.htm">Psalm 106:11</a> is a transposition (cf. <a href="/psalms/34-21.htm">Psalm 34:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>) from <a href="/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>. On the other hand, <a href="/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a> is taken out of <a href="/isaiah/63-13.htm">Isaiah 63:13</a> (cf. Wisd. 19:9); <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7-64:12</a> is a prayer for redemption which has a similar ground-colouring. The sea through which they passed is called, as in the T&#1508;ra, &#1497;&#1501;&#1470;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, which seems, according to <a href="/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>, to signify the sea of reed or sedge, although the sedge does not grow in the Red Sea itself, but only on the marshy places of the coast; but it can also signify the sea of sea-weed, mare algosum, after the Egyptian sippe, wool and sea-weed (just as Arab. s&#803;u&#770;f also signifies both these). The word is certainly Egyptian, whether it is to be referred back to the Egyptian word sippe (sea-weed) or seebe (sedge), and is therefore used after the manner of a proper name; so that the inference drawn by Knobel on <a href="/exodus/8-18.htm">Exodus 8:18</a> from the absence of the article, that &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; is the name of a town on the northern point of the gulf, is groundless. The miracle at the sea of sedge or sea-weed - as <a href="/psalms/106-12.htm">Psalm 106:12</a> says - also was not without effect. <a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a> tells us that they believed on Jahve and Moses His servant, and the song which they sang follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>. But they then only too quickly added sins of ingratitude. </body></html>
