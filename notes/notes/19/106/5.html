The more unworthy we are, the more is his kindness to be admired. And those who depend on the Redeemer's righteousness will endeavour to copy his example, and by word and deed to show forth his praise. God's people have reason to be cheerful people; and need not envy the children of men their pleasure or pride.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That I may see the good of thy chosen - Thy chosen people; or, thine elect. That I may possess and enjoy the same favor and happiness which they do. It is implied here that there are special favors conferred on them; or, that happiness is found in the friendship of God which is not to be found elsewhere. It is a characteristic of true piety to desire to make that our own. A truly religious man more desires the happiness which results from being among the "chosen" of God than all that the world can confer.<p>That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation - The happiness found in the nation that serves thee. True religion - the favor of God - not only confers happiness on the "individual" who possesses it, but on the nation or people where it prevails. It is just as much suited to produce happiness there, and is just as necessary for happiness there, as in the case of an individual.<p>That I may glory with thine inheritance - That I may share the honor of thy people. The word "inheritance" here is used to denote that which is one's own, and is thus applied to the people of God considered as "his." The meaning is, that the psalmist desired no other glory, honor, or distinction, than that which pertained to God's people as such. He sought not the "glory" connected with the distinctions of the world; the display of wealth; the triumph of genius, of conquest, of arms - but the "glory" of being a friend of God, and of partaking of that which God confers on his people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/106.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. see the good&#8212;participate in it (Ps 37:13).<p>thy chosen&#8212;namely, Israel, God's elect (Isa 43:20; 45:4).

The elect, according to the foreknowledge of God; who are chosen in Christ to holiness and happiness, through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth unto salvation by him; the vessels of mercy afore prepared unto glory, both of Jews and Gentiles. The "good" of those is not any goodness of their own, for there is none in them naturally; they are by nature no better than others, none are good, nor do good, no, not one: but the goodness of God laid up for them, and bestowed on them; the blessings of goodness with which Christ is preparing for them; all the good things secured for them in a well ordered covenant; which they partake of in time, and to eternity. To "see" these is not to have a superficial, notional, knowledge of them, as hypocrites may have; or a distant view of them, as Balaam, and the rich man in hell; but to have an experience of them, possess them, and enjoy them. <p>That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation; all the nations of the world are the Lord's; but there is a chosen generation, an holy nation, that is peculiarly his; a nation taken out of a nation, nay, taken out of all the nations that are upon earth: and these have a joy peculiar to them, which foreigners know nothing of, and strangers intermeddle not with; a spiritual joy in the Holy Ghost; a rejoicing in Christ Jesus, in his person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, and in hope of the glory of God; and such joy is desirable, a joy unspeakable, and full of glory. <p>That I may glory with thine inheritance; the same with his chosen people and nation: for the Lord's people is his portion, and the lot of his inheritance; they are chosen for an inheritance, given to Christ as such, with which he is well pleased, esteeming them a goodly heritage; they are his purchased possession, his jewels and peculiar treasure. These "glory" not in themselves, in their strength and wisdom, their riches and righteousness; but in Christ and in his righteousness, and in what he is made unto them. And the psalmist desires to join with them, and glory in what they did, and in no other; and unite with them in giving glory to God and Christ, now and hereafter, for his salvation, and all good things from him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/106.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/106.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.

With &#1500;&#1502;&#1505;&#1498; we are not to associate the idea of a covering against foes, <a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>., but of a covering from the smiting sun, for &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="/exodus/40-19.htm">Exodus 40:19</a>), as in <a href="/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>., points to the idea of a canopy. In connection with the sending of the quails the tempting character of the desire is only momentarily dwelt upon, the greater emphasis is laid on the omnipotence of the divine goodness which responded to it. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is to be read instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, the w before w having been overlooked; and the Ker&#1502; writes and points &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (like &#1505;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;) in order to secure the correct pronunciation, after the analogy of the plural termination &#1497;&#1493;-. The bread of heaven (<a href="/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24</a>.) is the manna. In <a href="/psalms/105-41.htm">Psalm 105:41</a> the giving of water out of the rock at Rephidim and at Kadesh are brought together; the expression corresponds better to the former instance (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>, cf. <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>). &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; refers to the waters, and &#1504;&#1492;&#1512; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-16.htm">Psalm 78:16</a>, is, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a>, an equation instead of a comparison. In this miraculous escort the patriarchal promise moves on towards its fulfilment; the holy word of promise, and the stedfast, proved faith of Abraham - these were the two motives. The second &#1488;&#1514; is, like the first, a sign of the object, not a preposition (lxx, Targum), in connection with which <a href="/psalms/105-42.htm">Psalm 105:42</a> would be a continuation of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-42.htm">Psalm 105:42</a>, dragging on without any parallelism. Joy and exulting are mentioned as the mood of the redeemed ones with reference to the festive joy displayed at the Red Sea and at Sinai. By <a href="/psalms/105-43.htm">Psalm 105:43</a> one is reminded of the same descriptions of the antitype in Isaiah, <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>, just as <a href="/psalms/105-41.htm">Psalm 105:41</a> recalls <a href="/isaiah/48-21.htm">Isaiah 48:21</a>. "The lands of the heathen" are the territories of the tribes of Canaan. &#1506;&#1502;&#1500; is equivalent to &#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506; in <a href="/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a> : the cultivated ground, the habitable cities, and the accumulated treasures. Israel entered upon the inheritance of these peoples in every direction. As an independent people upon ground that is theirs by inheritance, keeping the revealed law of their God, was Israel to exhibit the pattern of a holy nation moulded after the divine will; and, as the beginning of the Psalm shows, to unite the peoples to themselves and their God, the God of redemption, by the proclamation of the redemption which has fallen to their own lot. </body></html>
