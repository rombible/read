One sin led to many more, and brought the judgments of God on them. Their sin was, in part, their own punishment. Sinners often see themselves ruined by those who led them into evil. Satan, who is a tempter, will be a tormentor. At length, God showed pity to his people for his covenant's sake. The unchangeableness of God's merciful nature and love to his people, makes him change the course of justice into mercy; and no other change is meant by God's repentance. Our case is awful when the outward church is considered. When nations professing Christianity, are so guilty as we are, no wonder if the Lord brings them low for their sins. Unless there is general and deep repentance, there can be no prospect but of increasing calamities. The psalm concludes with prayer for completing the deliverance of God's people, and praise for the beginning and progress of it. May all the people of the earth, ere long, add their Amen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/106.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he remembered for them his covenant - His solemn promises made to their fathers. He remembered that covenant in their behalf; or, on account of that, he came and blessed them. He had made gracious promises to the patriarchs; he had promised to be the God of their posterity; he had his own great purposes to accomplish through their nation in the distant future; and on these accounts, he came and blessed them.<p>And repented - He averted impending judgments. He checked and arrested the calamities which he was bringing upon them for their sins. He acted toward them as though his mind had been changed; as though he was sorry for what he was doing. The word "repent" can be applied to God in no other sense than this. It cannot be applied to him in the sense that he felt or admitted that he had done wrong; or that he had made a mistake; or that he had changed his mind or purposes; or that he intended to enter on a new course of conduct; but it may be applied to him in the sense that his treatment of people is "as if" he had changed his mind, or "as if" he were sorry for what he had done: that is, a certain course of things which had been commenced, would be arrested and changed to meet existing circumstances, because "they" had changed - though all must have been foreseen and purposed in his eternal counsels.<p>According to the multitude of his mercies - The greatness of his mercy; the disposition of his nature to show mercy; the repeated instances in which he had shown mercy in similar circumstances. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/106.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>45. repented&#8212;(compare Ps 90:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/106.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His covenant; </span> the covenant made with their father which, notwithstanding their horrible violation of it. made good unto them, and in consideration thereof delivered them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Repented; </span> changed his course and dealing with them, as penitent persons usually do. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/genesis/6-6.htm" title="And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.">Genesis 6:6</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/106.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he remembered for them his covenant,....

Or "according to the abundance of his grace", or "gracious benefits" (e); there is an abundance of grace in his heart, in his Son, in his covenant, in salvation by Christ, and in every part of it; and which appears at conversion, as superabundant; and by this multitude of mercy, and abundance of grace, he is moved to "repent". This is sometimes denied of him; and indeed he never repents so as to change his mind, to alter his purposes, to revoke his promises or his gifts, these are all without repentance; but he sometimes changes his ways and his works, his conduct in Providence, and the course of it; and then he may be said to repent of the evil he threatened to do, or was doing, when he puts a stop to it; and instead of that bestows favours and blessings. <p>(e)  "secundum amplitudinem, seu multitudinem gratiarum suarum", Cocceius, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/106.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he remembered for them his covenant, and <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</span><p>(z) Not that God is changeable in himself, but that then he seems to us to repent when he alters his punishment, and forgives us.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/106.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">45</span>.

In <a href="/psalms/106-34.htm">Psalm 106:34</a> the poet appeals to the command, frequently enjoined upon them from <a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32</a>. onwards, to extirpate the inhabitants of Canaan. Since they did not execute this command (vid., <a href="/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>), that which it was intended to prevent came to pass: the heathen became to them a snare (mowqeesh), <a href="/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>. They intermarried with them, and fell into the Canaanitish custom in which the abominations of heathenism culminate, viz., the human sacrifice, which Jahve abhorreth (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>), and only the demons (&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>) delight in. Thus then the land was defiled by blood-guiltiness (&#1495;&#1504;&#1507;, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>, cf. <a href="/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a>), and they themselves became unclean (<a href="/ezekiel/20-43.htm">Ezekiel 20:43</a>) by the whoredom of idolatry. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/106-40.htm">Psalm 106:40-43</a> the poet (as in <a href="/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a>.) sketches the alternation of apostasy, captivity, redemption, and relapse which followed upon the possession of Canaan, and more especially that which characterized the period of the judges. God's "counsel" was to make Israel free and glorious, but they leaned upon themselves, following their own intentions (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1501;); wherefore they perished in their sins. The poet uses &#1502;&#1499;&#1498; (to sink down, fall away) instead of the &#1504;&#1502;&#1511; (to moulder, rot) of the primary passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>, retained in <a href="/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-10.htm">Ezekiel 33:10</a>, which is no blunder (Hitzig), but a deliberate change. </body></html>
