These were the Ziphites, according to Arama; see <a href="/psalms/119-85.htm">Psalm 119:85</a>; the character well agrees with the Scribes and Pharisees, who were proud boasters, and despised others, and often laid snares for Christ to take away his life; and with the enemies of the church and people of God; who, through their pride, persecute them, and are insidious, and use artful methods to ensnare them; as the fowler lays his snare for the bird, and has his cords to draw it to him when it is taken in the snare, to which the allusion is; <p>they have spread a net by the wayside: they waylaid him; knowing the way he would go, they lay in wait for him, to seize him at once as he went along; see <a href="/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>; the word "cords" in the preceding clause should be connected with this, and be read, "and with cords they have spread a net by the wayside": it being usual, as Jarchi observes, to fasten a long cord at the top of the net; and when the fowler sees the birds under the net, he draws the cord, and the net falls upon the fowls; <p>they have set gins for me; all these expressions design the insidiousness, and the private, secret, artful methods, the enemies of David, of Christ and his people, took and do take to ensnare them. Arama interprets the "snare and cords" of the watching of David's house; the "net by the wayside" of posting themselves at the gates of the city, and surrounding it; and gins of spies; see <a href="/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11</a>. <p>Selah; on this word; see Gill on <a href="/psalms/3-2.htm">Psalm 3:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/140.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me.

The fact "Thou hast searched me," which the beginning of the Psalm confesses, is here turned into a petitioning "search me." Instead of &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17</a>, the poet here says &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, which signifies branches (<a href="/ezekiel/31-5.htm">Ezekiel 31:5</a>) and branchings of the act of thinking (thoughts and cares, <a href="/psalms/94-19.htm">Psalm 94:19</a>). The Resh is epenthetic, for the first form is &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>; <a href="/job/20-2.htm">Job 20:2</a>. The poet thus sets the very ground and life of his heart, with all its outward manifestations, in the light of the divine omniscience. And in <a href="/psalms/139-24.htm">Psalm 139:24</a> he prays that God would see whether any &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;&#1470;&#1506;&#1510;&#1489; cleaves to him (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; as in <a href="/1_samuel/25-24.htm">1 Samuel 25:24</a>), by which is not meant "a way of idols" (Rosenm&#1516;ller, Gesenius, and Maurer), after <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-5.htm">Isaiah 48:5</a>, since an inclination towards, or even apostasy to, heathenism cannot be an unknown sin; nor to a man like the writer of this Psalm is heathenism any power of temptation. &#1491;&#1493;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; (Gr&#1492;tz) might more readily be admissible, but &#1491;&#1493;&#1498; &#1506;&#1510;&#1489; is a more comprehensive notion, and one more in accordance with this closing petition. The poet gives this name to the way that leads to the pain, torture, viz., of the inward and outward punishments of sin; and, on the other hand, the way along which he wishes to be guided he calls &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, the way of endless continuance (lxx, Vulgate, Luther), not the way of the former times, after <a href="/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a> (Maurer, Olshausen), which thus by itself is ambiguous (as becomes evident from <a href="/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-15.htm">Jeremiah 18:15</a>), and also does not furnish any direct antithesis. The "everlasting way" is the way of God (<a href="/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>), the way of the righteous, which stands fast for ever and shall not "perish" (<a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>). </body></html>
