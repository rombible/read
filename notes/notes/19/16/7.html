And we ought so far to apply it to ourselves as to learn from it wherein our duty and happiness consist, and to examine ourselves by it, whether we are properly influenced by such discoveries, and act accordingly.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-11 This psalm begins with expressions of devotion, which may be applied to Christ; but ends with such confidence of a resurrection, as must be applied to Christ, and to him only. - David flees to God's protection, with cheerful, believing confidence. Those who have avowed that the Lord is their Lord, should often put themselves in mind of what they have done, take the comfort of it, and live up to it. He devotes himself to the honour of God, in the service of the saints. Saints on earth we must be, or we shall never be saints in heaven. Those renewed by the grace of God, and devoted to the glory of God, are saints on earth. The saints in the earth are excellent ones, yet some of them so poor, that they needed to have David's goodness extended to them. David declares his resolution to have no fellowship with the works of darkness; he repeats the solemn choice he had made of God for his portion and happiness, takes to himself the comfort of the choice, and gives God the glory of it. This is the language of a devout and pious soul. Most take the world for their chief good, and place their happiness in the enjoyments of it; but how poor soever my condition is in this world, let me have the love and favour of God, and be accepted of him; let me have a title by promise to life and happiness in the future state; and I have enough. Heaven is an inheritance; we must take that for our home, our rest, our everlasting good, and look upon this world to be no more ours, than the country through which is our road to our Father's house. Those that have God for their portion, have a goodly heritage. Return unto thy rest, O my soul, and look no further. Gracious persons, though they still covet more of God, never covet more than God; but, being satisfied of his loving-kindness, are abundantly satisfied with it: they envy not any their carnal mirth and delights. But so ignorant and foolish are we, that if left to ourselves, we shall forsake our own mercies for lying vanities. God having given David counsel by his word and Spirit, his own thoughts taught him in the night season, and engaged him by faith to live to God.  Verses 8-11, are quoted by St. Peter in his first sermon, after the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2:25-31; he declared that David in them speaks concerning Christ, and particularly of his resurrection. And Christ being the Head of the body, the church, these verses may be applied to all Christians, guided and animated by the Spirit of Christ; and we may hence learn, that it is our wisdom and duty to set the Lord always before us. And if our eyes are ever toward God, our hearts and tongues may ever rejoice in him. Death destroys the hope of man, but not the hope of a real Christian. Christ's resurrection is an earnest of the believer's resurrection. In this world sorrow is our lot, but in heaven there is joy, a fulness of joy; our pleasures here are for a moment, but those at God's right hand are pleasures for evermore. Through this thy beloved Son, and our dear Saviour, thou wilt show us, O Lord, the path of life; thou wilt justify our souls now, and raise our bodies by thy power at the last day; when earthly sorrow shall end in heavenly joy, pain in everlasting happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will bless the Lord, who hath given the counsel - Probably the reference here is to the fact that the Lord had counseled him to choose him as his portion, or had inclined him to his service. There is nothing for which a heart rightly affected is more disposed to praise God than for the fact that by his grace it has been inclined to serve him; and the time when the heart was given away to God is recalled ever onward as the happiest period of life.<p>My reins ... - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>. The "reins" are here put for the mind, the soul. They were regarded as the seat of the affections, <a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>; <a href="/job/19-27.htm">Job 19:27</a>. The meaning here is, that in the wakeful hours of night, when meditating on the divine character and goodness, he found instruction in regard to God. Compare <a href="/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>. Everything then is favorable for reflection. The natural calmness and composure of the mind; the stillness of night; the starry heavens; the consciousness that we are alone with God, and that no human eye is upon us - all these things are favorable to profound religious meditation. They who are kept wakeful by night "need" not find this an unprofitable portion of their lives. Some of the most instructive hours of life are those which are spent when the eyes refuse to close themselves in slumber, and when the universal stillness invites to contemplation on divine things. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. given me counsel&#8212;cared for me.<p>my reins&#8212;the supposed seat of emotion and thought (Ps 7:9; 26:2).<p>instruct me&#8212;or, excite to acts of praise (Isa 53:11, 12; Heb 12:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Who hath given me counsel, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">consulted for me</span>, i.e. by his wise and gracious counsel hath provided so good an heritage for me, and withal inspired that counsel and wisdom into me, by which I have chosen the Lord for my portion, and am so fully satisfied with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My reins, </span> i.e. my inward thoughts and affections, (which are commonly signified by <span class="ital">the reins</span>, as <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/7-9.htm" title="Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God tries the hearts and reins.">Psalm 7:9</a> 26:2 73:21 139:13 <a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm" title="But, O LORD of hosts, that judge righteously, that try the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I revealed my cause.">Jeremiah 11:20</a> 12:2 17:10</span>) being inspired and moved by the Holy Spirit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Instruct me, </span> i. e. direct me what course to take, how to please and serve God, and to put my whole trust and confidence in him, as it follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the night seasons; </span> not only in the day time, but also in the night, when others are asleep, but my mind is working upon God, and the things of God, and improving the silence, and leisure, and solitude of the night to holy meditations, and the exciting of my affections towards God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I will bless the Lord,.... As prayer, so thanksgiving belongs to Christ, as man and Mediator; see <a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>; and here he determines to praise the Lord, and give thanks to him for counsel and instruction: <p>who hath given me counsel; for though he himself is the Counsellor, with respect to his people, yet as man he received counsel from God, and the spirit of counsel rested on him, <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>; and fitted him for and directed him in the execution of his prophetic office; for the doctrine he taught was not his own, but his Father's; and he said nothing of himself but what his Father taught him, and instructed him to speak, <a href="/john/6-16.htm">John 6:16</a>. And he also gave him counsel about the execution of his priestly office, or about his sufferings and death, and drinking of the cup, which he, with submission to the divine will, desired might pass from him; but having advice in this matter, most cheerfully and courageously yielded to take it, see <a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>; <p>my reins also instruct me in the night seasons; when engaged in prayer to God, in which he sometimes continued a whole night together, <a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a>; and especially in that dark and dismal night in which he was betrayed, when it was the hour and power of darkness with his enemies; then, his inward parts being influenced by the spirit of wisdom and counsel, directed him how to behave and conduct himself. Or "the reins" being the seat of the affections, and being put for them, may signify, that his strong affection for God, and love to his people, put him upon and moved him to take the steps he did, to deliver up himself into the hands of sinful men, in order to suffer and die for his friends, and obtain eternal salvation for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">given me counsel</span>] Taught me to choose Him and to follow Him.

God has become David's "Counsellor" (see <a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>), makes suggestions to him which he follows, and so guides his life that he feels bound to praise and bless him for it. <span class="cmt_word">My reins also instruct me in the night seasons</span>. The reins, according to Hebrew ideas, are the seat of feeling and emotion. David is "instructed" or "stimulated" (Hengstenberg) to bless God by the feelings which stir within him as he lies awake at night - feelings, we must suppose, of affection and gratitude. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Psalm begins with a prayer that is based upon faith, the special meaning of which becomes clear from <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> : May God preserve him (which He is able to do as being &#1488;&#1500;, the Almighty, able to do all things), who has no other refuge in which he has hidden and will hide but Him. This short introit is excepted from the parallelism; so far therefore it is monostichic, - a sigh expressing everything in few words. And the emphatic pronunciation &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; sha&#772;mereni harmonises with it; for it is to be read thus, just as in <a href="/psalms/86-2.htm">Psalm 86:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-167.htm">Psalm 119:167</a> sha&#772;merah (cf. on <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a> &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492;), according to the express testimony of the Masora.<p>(Note: The Masora observes &#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1488; &#1489;, i.e., twice in the Psalter &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; is in the imperative, the o being displaced by Gaja (Metheg) and changed into aa, vid., Baer, Torath Emeth p. 22f. In spite of this the grammarians are not agreed as to the pronunciation of the imperative and infinitive forms when so pointed. Luzzatto, like Lonzano, reads it sho&#774;mereni.)<p>The text of the next two verses (so it appears) needs to be improved in two respects. The reading &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; as addressed to the soul (Targ.), cf. <a href="/lamentations/3-24.htm">Lamentations 3:24</a>., is opposed by the absence of any mention of the thing addressed. It rests upon a misconception of the defective form of writing, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; (Ges. 44, rem. 4). Hitzig and Ewald (190, d) suppose that in such cases a rejection of the final vowel, which really occurs in the language of the people, after the manner of the Aramaic (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; or &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;), lies at the bottom of the form. And it does really seem as though the frequent occurrence of this defective form (&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;  equals  &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497; <a href="/psalms/140-13.htm">Psalm 140:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>, &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;  equals  &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-48.htm">1 Kings 8:48</a>, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514;  equals  &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/18-20.htm">2 Kings 18:20</a>, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; now pointed &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;, with <a href="/isaiah/36-5.htm">Isaiah 36:5</a>) has its occasion at least in some such cutting away of the i, peculiar to the language of the common people; although, if David wrote it so, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; is not intended to be read otherwise than it is in <a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/140-7.htm">Psalm 140:7</a>.<p>(Note: Pinsker's view (Einleit. S. 100-102), who considers &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468; to have sprung from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1514; as the primary form of the 1 pers. sing., from which then came &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; and later still &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, is untenable according to the history of the language.)<p>First of all David gives expression to his confession of Jahve, to whom he submits himself unconditionally, and whom he sets above everything else without exception. Since the suffix of &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; (properly domini mei  equals  domine mi, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/19-2.htm">Psalm 19:2</a>), which has become mostly lost sight of in the usage of the language, now and then retains its original meaning, as it does indisputably in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-23.htm">Psalm 35:23</a>, it is certainly to be rendered also here: "Thou art my Lord" and not "Thou art the Lord." The emphasis lies expressly on the "my." It is the unreserved and joyous feeling of dependence (more that of the little child, than of the servant), which is expressed in this first confession. For, as the second clause of the confession says: Jahve, who is his Lord, is also his benefactor, yea even his highest good. The preposition &#1506;&#1500; frequently introduces that which extends beyond something else, <a href="/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/95-3.htm">Psalm 95:3</a>), and to this passage may be added <a href="/genesis/31-50.htm">Genesis 31:50</a>; <a href="/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/35-22.htm">Exodus 35:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-9.htm">Deuteronomy 19:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>, the one thing being above, or co-ordinate with, the other. So also here: "my good, i.e., whatever makes me truly happy, is not above Thee," i.e., in addition to Thee, beside Thee; according to the sense it is equivalent to out of Thee or without Thee (as the Targ., Symm., and Jerome render it), Thou alone, without exception, art my good. In connection with this rendering of the &#1506;&#1500;, the &#1489;&#1468;&#1500; (poetic, and contracted from &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;), which is unknown to the literature before David's time, presents no difficulty. As in <a href="/proverbs/23-7.htm">Proverbs 23:7</a> it is short for &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;. Hengstenberg remarks, "Just as Thou art the Lord! is the response of the soul to the words I am the Lord thy God (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>), so Thou only art my salvation! is the response to Thou shalt have no other gods beside Me (&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;)." The psalmist knows no fountain of true happiness but Jahve, in Him he possesses all, his treasure is in Heaven.<p>Such is his confession to Jahve. But he also has those on earth to whom he makes confession. Transposing the w we read:<p>&#1493;&#1500;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;<p>&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1470;&#1489;&#1501;&#1475;<p>While Diestel's alteration: "to the saints, who are in his land, he makes himself glorious, and all his delight is in them," is altogether strange to this verse: the above transfer of the Waw<p>(Note: Approved by Kamphausen and by the critic in the Liter. Blatt of the Allgem. Kirchen-Zeitung 1864 S. 107.)<p>suffices to remove its difficulties, and that in a way quite in accordance with the connection. Now it is clear, that &#1500;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, as has been supposed by some, is the dative governed by &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, the influence of which is thus carried forward; it is clear what is meant by the addition &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, which distinguishes the object of his affection here below from the One above, who is incomparably the highest; it is clear, as to what &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; defines, whereas otherwise this purely descriptive relative clause &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (which von Ortenberg transposes into &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; &#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;) appears to be useless and surprises one both on account of its redundancy (since &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; is superfluous, cf. e.g., <a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>) and on account of its arrangement of the words (an arrangement, which is usual in connection with a negative construction, <a href="/deuteronomy/20-15.htm">Deuteronomy 20:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-7.htm">2 Chronicles 8:7</a>, cf. <a href="/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-10.htm">Ezekiel 12:10</a>); it is clear, in what sense &#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; alternates with &#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, since it is not those who are accounted by the world as &#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505; on account of their worldly power and possessions (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/136-18.htm">Psalm 136:18</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/23-20.htm">2 Chronicles 23:20</a>), but the holy, prized by him as being also glorious, partakers of higher glory and worthy of higher honour; and moreover, this corrected arrangement of the verse harmonises with the Michtam character of the Psalm. The thought thus obtained, is the thought one expected (love to God and love to His saints), and the one which one is also obliged to wring from the text as we have it, either by translating with De Welte, Maurer, Dietrich and others: "the saints who are in the land, they are the excellent in whom I have all my delight," - a Waw apodoseos, with which one could only be satisfied if it were &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/15-34.htm">2 Samuel 15:34</a>) - or: "the saints who are in the land and the glorious-all my delight is in them." By both these interpretations, &#1500; would be the exponent of the nom. absol. which is elsewhere detached and placed at the beginning of a sentence, and this l of reference (Ew. 310, a) is really common to every style (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:4</a>); whereas the &#1500; understood of the fellowship in which he stands when thus making confession to Jahve: associating myself with the saints (Hengst.), with (von Lengerke), among the saints (Hupf., Thenius), would be a preposition most liable to be misapprehended, and makes <a href="/psalms/16-3.htm">Psalm 16:3</a> a cumbersome appendage of <a href="/psalms/16-2.htm">Psalm 16:2</a>. But if l be taken as the Lamed of reference then the elliptical construct &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;, to which &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; ought to be supplied, remains a stumbling-block not to be easily set aside. For such an isolation of the connecting form from its genitive cannot be shown to be syntactically possible in Hebrew (vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17</a>, Thenius, and Keil); nor are we compelled to suppose in this instance what cannot be proved elsewhere, since &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1470;&#1489;&#1501; is, without any harshness, subordinate to &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; as a genitival notion (Ges. 116, 3). And still in connection with the reading &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;, both the formation of the sentence which, beginning with &#1500;, leads one to expect an apodosis, and the relation of <a href="/psalms/16-3.htm">Psalm 16:3</a> to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-2.htm">Psalm 16:2</a>, according to which the central point of the declaration must lie just within &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1470;&#1489;&#1501;, are opposed to this rendering of the words &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1501;.<p>Thus, therefore, we come back to the above easy improvement of the text. &#1511;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are those in whom the will of Jahve concerning Israel, that it should be a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>), has been fulfilled, viz., the living members of the ecclesia sanctorum in this world (for there is also one in the other world, <a href="/psalms/89-6.htm">Psalm 89:6</a>). Glory, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;, is the outward manifestation of holiness. It is ordained of God for the sanctified (cf. <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>), whose moral nobility is now for the present veiled under the menial form of the &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;; and in the eyes of David they already possess it. His spiritual vision pierces through the outward form of the servant. His verdict is like the verdict of God, who is his all in all. The saints, and they only, are the excellent to him. His whole delight is centred in them, all his respect and affection is given to them. The congregation of the saints is his Chephzibah, <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a> (cf. <a href="/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>). </body></html>
