Those who have avowed that the Lord is their Lord, should often put themselves in mind of what they have done, take the comfort of it, and live up to it. He devotes himself to the honour of God, in the service of the saints. Saints on earth we must be, or we shall never be saints in heaven. Those renewed by the grace of God, and devoted to the glory of God, are saints on earth. The saints in the earth are excellent ones, yet some of them so poor, that they needed to have David's goodness extended to them. David declares his resolution to have no fellowship with the works of darkness; he repeats the solemn choice he had made of God for his portion and happiness, takes to himself the comfort of the choice, and gives God the glory of it. This is the language of a devout and pious soul. Most take the world for their chief good, and place their happiness in the enjoyments of it; but how poor soever my condition is in this world, let me have the love and favour of God, and be accepted of him; let me have a title by promise to life and happiness in the future state; and I have enough. Heaven is an inheritance; we must take that for our home, our rest, our everlasting good, and look upon this world to be no more ours, than the country through which is our road to our Father's house. Those that have God for their portion, have a goodly heritage. Return unto thy rest, O my soul, and look no further. Gracious persons, though they still covet more of God, never covet more than God; but, being satisfied of his loving-kindness, are abundantly satisfied with it: they envy not any their carnal mirth and delights. But so ignorant and foolish are we, that if left to ourselves, we shall forsake our own mercies for lying vanities. God having given David counsel by his word and Spirit, his own thoughts taught him in the night season, and engaged him by faith to live to God.  Verses 8-11, are quoted by St. Peter in his first sermon, after the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2:25-31; he declared that David in them speaks concerning Christ, and particularly of his resurrection. And Christ being the Head of the body, the church, these verses may be applied to all Christians, guided and animated by the Spirit of Christ; and we may hence learn, that it is our wisdom and duty to set the Lord always before us. And if our eyes are ever toward God, our hearts and tongues may ever rejoice in him. Death destroys the hope of man, but not the hope of a real Christian. Christ's resurrection is an earnest of the believer's resurrection. In this world sorrow is our lot, but in heaven there is joy, a fulness of joy; our pleasures here are for a moment, but those at God's right hand are pleasures for evermore. Through this thy beloved Son, and our dear Saviour, thou wilt show us, O Lord, the path of life; thou wilt justify our souls now, and raise our bodies by thy power at the last day; when earthly sorrow shall end in heavenly joy, pain in everlasting happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore my heart is glad - In view of this fact, that my confidence is in God alone, and my belief that he is my Protector and Friend. See the notes at <a href="/acts/2-26.htm">Acts 2:26</a>.<p>And my glory rejoiceth - The Septuagint translate this, "my tongue," and this translation is followed by Peter in his quotation of the passage in <a href="/acts/2-26.htm">Acts 2:26</a>. See the notes at that passage. The meaning here is, that whatever there was in him that was honorable, dignified, or glorious - all the faculties of his soul, as well as his heart - had occasion to rejoice in God. His whole nature - his undying soul - his exalted powers as he was made by God - all - all, found cause of exultation in the favor and friendship of God. The heart - the uuderstanding - the imagination - the whole immortal soul, found occasion for joy in God.<p>My flesh also - My body. Or, it may mean, his whole person, he himself, though the direct allusion is to the body considered as lying in the grave, <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>. The language is such as one would use of himself when he reflected on his own death, and it is equivalent to saying, "I myself, when I am dead, shall rest in hope; my soul will not be left to abide in the gloomy place of the dead; nor will my body remain permanently in the grave under the power of corruption. In reference to my soul and my body - my whole nature - I shall descend to the grave in the hope of a future life."<p>Shall rest - Margin, "dwell confidently." The Hebrew is literally "shall dwell in confidence" or hope. The word here rendered "shall rest" means properly to let oneself down; to lie down, <a href="/numbers/9-17.htm">Numbers 9:17</a>; <a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16</a>; then, to lay oneself down, to lie down, as, for example, a lion lying down, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-20.htm">Deuteronomy 33:20</a>; or a people in tents, <a href="/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a>; and hence, to rest, to take rest, <a href="/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>; and then to abide, to dwell. Gesenius, Lexicon. Perhaps the sense here is that of "lying down," considered as lying in the grave, and the expression is equivalent to saying, "When I die I shall lie down in the grave in hope or confidence, not in despair. I shall expect to rise and live again."<p>In hope - The word used here means "trust, confidence, security." It is the opposite of despair. As used here, it would refer to a state of mind in which there was an expectation of living again, as distinguished from that state of mind in which it was felt that the grave was the end of man. What is particularly to be remarked here is, that this trust or confidence extended to the "flesh" as well as to the "soul;" and the language is such as would be naturally used by one who believed in the resurrection of the body. Language of this kind occurs elsewhere in the Old Testament, showing that the doctrine of the resurrection of the body was one to which the sacred writers were not strangers, and that although the doctrine was not as explicitly and formally stated in the Old Testament as in the New, yet that it was a doctrine which had been at some time communicated to man. See <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, note. As applicable to David, the language used here is expressive of his belief that "he" would rise again, or would not perish in the grave when his body died; as applicable to the Messiah, as applied by Peter <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-26.htm">Acts 2:26</a>, it means that when "he" should die it would be with the hope and expectation of being raised again without seeing corruption. The language is such as to be applicable to both cases; and, in regard to the interpretation of the "language," it makes no difference whether it was supposed that the resurrection would occur before the body should moulder back to dust, or whether it would occur at a much more remote period, and long after it had gone to decay. In either case it would be true that it was laid in the grave "in hope." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. glory&#8212;as heart (Ps 7:5), for self.

Hitzig and Ewald (190, d) suppose that in such cases a rejection of the final vowel, which really occurs in the language of the people, after the manner of the Aramaic (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; or &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;), lies at the bottom of the form. And it does really seem as though the frequent occurrence of this defective form (&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;  equals  &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497; <a href="/psalms/140-13.htm">Psalm 140:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>, &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;  equals  &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-48.htm">1 Kings 8:48</a>, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514;  equals  &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/18-20.htm">2 Kings 18:20</a>, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; now pointed &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;, with <a href="/isaiah/36-5.htm">Isaiah 36:5</a>) has its occasion at least in some such cutting away of the i, peculiar to the language of the common people; although, if David wrote it so, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; is not intended to be read otherwise than it is in <a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/140-7.htm">Psalm 140:7</a>.<p>(Note: Pinsker's view (Einleit. S. 100-102), who considers &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468; to have sprung from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1514; as the primary form of the 1 pers. sing., from which then came &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; and later still &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, is untenable according to the history of the language.)<p>First of all David gives expression to his confession of Jahve, to whom he submits himself unconditionally, and whom he sets above everything else without exception. Since the suffix of &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; (properly domini mei  equals  domine mi, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/19-2.htm">Psalm 19:2</a>), which has become mostly lost sight of in the usage of the language, now and then retains its original meaning, as it does indisputably in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-23.htm">Psalm 35:23</a>, it is certainly to be rendered also here: "Thou art my Lord" and not "Thou art the Lord." The emphasis lies expressly on the "my." It is the unreserved and joyous feeling of dependence (more that of the little child, than of the servant), which is expressed in this first confession. For, as the second clause of the confession says: Jahve, who is his Lord, is also his benefactor, yea even his highest good. The preposition &#1506;&#1500; frequently introduces that which extends beyond something else, <a href="/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/95-3.htm">Psalm 95:3</a>), and to this passage may be added <a href="/genesis/31-50.htm">Genesis 31:50</a>; <a href="/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/35-22.htm">Exodus 35:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-9.htm">Deuteronomy 19:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>, the one thing being above, or co-ordinate with, the other. So also here: "my good, i.e., whatever makes me truly happy, is not above Thee," i.e., in addition to Thee, beside Thee; according to the sense it is equivalent to out of Thee or without Thee (as the Targ., Symm., and Jerome render it), Thou alone, without exception, art my good. In connection with this rendering of the &#1506;&#1500;, the &#1489;&#1468;&#1500; (poetic, and contracted from &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;), which is unknown to the literature before David's time, presents no difficulty. As in <a href="/proverbs/23-7.htm">Proverbs 23:7</a> it is short for &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;. Hengstenberg remarks, "Just as Thou art the Lord! is the response of the soul to the words I am the Lord thy God (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>), so Thou only art my salvation! is the response to Thou shalt have no other gods beside Me (&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;)." The psalmist knows no fountain of true happiness but Jahve, in Him he possesses all, his treasure is in Heaven.<p>Such is his confession to Jahve. But he also has those on earth to whom he makes confession. Transposing the w we read:<p>&#1493;&#1500;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;<p>&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1470;&#1489;&#1501;&#1475;<p>While Diestel's alteration: "to the saints, who are in his land, he makes himself glorious, and all his delight is in them," is altogether strange to this verse: the above transfer of the Waw<p>(Note: Approved by Kamphausen and by the critic in the Liter. Blatt of the Allgem. Kirchen-Zeitung 1864 S. 107.)<p>suffices to remove its difficulties, and that in a way quite in accordance with the connection. Now it is clear, that &#1500;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, as has been supposed by some, is the dative governed by &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, the influence of which is thus carried forward; it is clear what is meant by the addition &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, which distinguishes the object of his affection here below from the One above, who is incomparably the highest; it is clear, as to what &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; defines, whereas otherwise this purely descriptive relative clause &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (which von Ortenberg transposes into &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; &#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;) appears to be useless and surprises one both on account of its redundancy (since &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; is superfluous, cf. e.g., <a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>) and on account of its arrangement of the words (an arrangement, which is usual in connection with a negative construction, <a href="/deuteronomy/20-15.htm">Deuteronomy 20:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-7.htm">2 Chronicles 8:7</a>, cf. <a href="/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-10.htm">Ezekiel 12:10</a>); it is clear, in what sense &#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; alternates with &#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, since it is not those who are accounted by the world as &#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505; on account of their worldly power and possessions (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/136-18.htm">Psalm 136:18</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/23-20.htm">2 Chronicles 23:20</a>), but the holy, prized by him as being also glorious, partakers of higher glory and worthy of higher honour; and moreover, this corrected arrangement of the verse harmonises with the Michtam character of the Psalm. The thought thus obtained, is the thought one expected (love to God and love to His saints), and the one which one is also obliged to wring from the text as we have it, either by translating with De Welte, Maurer, Dietrich and others: "the saints who are in the land, they are the excellent in whom I have all my delight," - a Waw apodoseos, with which one could only be satisfied if it were &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/15-34.htm">2 Samuel 15:34</a>) - or: "the saints who are in the land and the glorious-all my delight is in them." By both these interpretations, &#1500; would be the exponent of the nom. absol. which is elsewhere detached and placed at the beginning of a sentence, and this l of reference (Ew. 310, a) is really common to every style (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:4</a>); whereas the &#1500; understood of the fellowship in which he stands when thus making confession to Jahve: associating myself with the saints (Hengst.), with (von Lengerke), among the saints (Hupf., Thenius), would be a preposition most liable to be misapprehended, and makes <a href="/psalms/16-3.htm">Psalm 16:3</a> a cumbersome appendage of <a href="/psalms/16-2.htm">Psalm 16:2</a>. But if l be taken as the Lamed of reference then the elliptical construct &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;, to which &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; ought to be supplied, remains a stumbling-block not to be easily set aside. For such an isolation of the connecting form from its genitive cannot be shown to be syntactically possible in Hebrew (vid., on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17</a>, Thenius, and Keil); nor are we compelled to suppose in this instance what cannot be proved elsewhere, since &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1470;&#1489;&#1501; is, without any harshness, subordinate to &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; as a genitival notion (Ges. 116, 3). And still in connection with the reading &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;, both the formation of the sentence which, beginning with &#1500;, leads one to expect an apodosis, and the relation of <a href="/psalms/16-3.htm">Psalm 16:3</a> to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-2.htm">Psalm 16:2</a>, according to which the central point of the declaration must lie just within &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1470;&#1489;&#1501;, are opposed to this rendering of the words &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1501;.<p>Thus, therefore, we come back to the above easy improvement of the text. &#1511;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are those in whom the will of Jahve concerning Israel, that it should be a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>), has been fulfilled, viz., the living members of the ecclesia sanctorum in this world (for there is also one in the other world, <a href="/psalms/89-6.htm">Psalm 89:6</a>). Glory, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;, is the outward manifestation of holiness. It is ordained of God for the sanctified (cf. <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>), whose moral nobility is now for the present veiled under the menial form of the &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;; and in the eyes of David they already possess it. His spiritual vision pierces through the outward form of the servant. His verdict is like the verdict of God, who is his all in all. The saints, and they only, are the excellent to him. His whole delight is centred in them, all his respect and affection is given to them. The congregation of the saints is his Chephzibah, <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a> (cf. <a href="/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>). </body></html>
