It has against it the weight of all the ancient versions except the Syriac. Thus the Chaldaic has, “receive instruction “; LXX., followed by Vulg., “lay hold of discipline.” Symmachus and Jerome render “pay pure adoration.”Aquila has “kiss with discernment.” <span class= "ital">Bar, </span>in the sense of “son,” is common in Chaldee, and is familiar to us from the Aramaic patronymics of the New Testament: <span class= "ital">e.g., Bar-Jonas, Bar-nabas, </span>&c. The only place where it occurs in Heb., is <a href="/proverbs/31-2.htm" title="What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?">Proverbs 31:2</a>, where it is repeated three times; but the Book of Proverbs has a great deal of Aramaic colouring. Our psalmist uses <span class= "ital">ben </span>for “son” in <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a>, and it is unlikely that he would change to so unusual a term, unless <span class= "ital">nashshekû-bar were </span>a proverbial saying, and of this there is no proof Surely, too, the article or a suffix would have been employed. “Kiss son” seems altogether too abrupt and bald even for Hebrew poetry. The change of subject also in the co-ordinate clause, “lest he (<span class= "ital">i.e., Jehovah, </span>as the context shows) be angry,” is very awkward. As to the translation of the verb, the remark of Delitzsch, that it means “to kiss, and nothing else,” is wide of the mark, since it must in any case be taken <span class= "ital">figuratively, </span>with sense of <span class= "ital">doing homage, </span>as in <a href="/genesis/41-40.htm" title="You shall be over my house, and according to your word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than you.">Genesis 41:40</a> (margin), or <span class= "ital">worshipping </span>(<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm" title="Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.">1Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-2.htm" title="And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.">Hosea 13:2</a>). The most consistent rendering is, therefore, <span class= "ital">proffer pure homage </span>(to Jehovah), <span class= "ital">lest he be angry. </span>It may be added that the current of Rabbinical authority is against our Authorised version. Thus R. Solomon: “Arm yourselves with discipline;” (so, with a slight variation, one of the latest commentators, E. Reuss: “Arm yourselves with loyalty”;) another Rabbi: “Kiss the covenant”; another, “Adore the corn.” Among the best of modern scholars, Hupfeld renders “yield sincerely”; Ewald, “receive wholesome warning”; Hitzig, “submit to duty”; Gratz (by emendation), “give good heed to the warning.”<p><span class= "bld">From the way.</span>—The LXX. and Vulg. amplify and explain “from the righteous way.” It is the way in following which, whether for individuals or nations, alone there is peace and happiness. (See <span class= "ital">Note </span><a href="/psalms/119-1.htm" title="Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.">Psalm 119:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">When his wrath.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">for his wrath is soon kindled, </span>or <span class= "ital">easily kindled.</span><p><span class= "bld">Put their trust.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">find their refuge.</span><p>Notice in the close of the psalm the settled and memorable belief that good must ultimately triumph over evil.

This cannot, with any colour, be applied to David, who always dissuaded all men from putting their trust in princes, or any child of man, or any thing besides or below God.

To welcome Jesus Christ, and to submit to him, is our wisdom and interest. Let him be very dear and precious; love him above all, love him in sincerity, love him much, as she did, to whom much was forgiven, and, in token of it, kissed his feet, Lu 7:38. And with a kiss of loyalty take this yoke upon you, and give up yourselves to be governed by his laws, disposed of by his providence, and entirely devoted to his cause. Unbelief is a sin against the remedy. It will be utter destruction to yourselves; lest ye perish in the way of your sins, and from the way of your vain hopes; lest your way perish, lest you prove to have missed the way of happiness. Christ is the way; take heed lest ye be cut off from Him as your way to God. They thought themselves in the way; but neglecting Christ, they perish from it. Blessed will those be in the day of wrath, who, by trusting in Christ, have made him their Refuge.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Kiss the Son - Him whom God hath declared to be his Son <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, and whom, as such, he has resolved to set as King on his holy hill <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>. The word "kiss" here is used in accordance with Oriental usages, for it was in this way that respect was indicated for one of superior rank. This was the ancient mode of doing homage or allegiance to a king, <a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>. It was also the mode of rendering homage to an idol, <a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>; <a href="/job/31-27.htm">Job 31:27</a>. The mode of rendering homage to a king by a kiss was sometimes to kiss his hand, or his dress, or his feet, as among the Persians. DeWette. The practice of kissing the hand of a monarch is not uncommon in European courts as a token of allegiance. The meaning here is that they should express their allegiance to the Son of God, or recognize him as the authorized King, with suitable expressions of submission and allegiance; that they should receive him as King, and submit to his reign. Applied to others, it means that they should embrace him as their Saviour.<p>Lest he be angry - If you do not acknowledge his claims, and receive him as the Messiah.<p>And ye perish from the way - The word from in this place is supplied by the translators. It is literally, "And ye perish the way." See the notes at <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>. The meaning here seems to be either "lest ye are lost in respect to the way," that is, the way to happiness and salvation; or "lest ye fail to find the way" to life; or "lest ye perish by the way," to wit, before you reach your destination, and accomplish the object you have in view. The design seems to be to represent them as pursuing a certain journey or path - as life is often represented (compare <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>) - and as being cut down before they reached the end of their journey.<p>When his wrath is kindled - When his wrath burns. Applying to anger or wrath a term which is common now, as when we speak of one whose anger is heated, or who is hot with wrath.<p>But a little - Prof. Alexander renders this, "For his wrath will soon burn." This, it seems to me, is in accordance with the original; the word "little" probably referring to time, and not to the intensity of his anger. This accords better also with the connection, for the design is not to state that there will be degrees in the manifestation of his anger, but that his anger would not long be delayed. In due time he would execute judgment on his enemies; and whenever his anger began to burn, his enemies must perish.<p>Blessed are all they that put their trust in him - Kings, princes, people; - all, of every age and every land; the poor, the rich, the bond, the free; white, black, copper-colored, or mixed; all in sickness or health, in prosperity or adversity, in life or in death; all, of every condition, and in all conceivable circumstances - are blessed who put their trust in him. All need him as a Saviour; all will find him to be a Saviour adapted to their wants. All who do this are happy (compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>); all are safe in time and in eternity. This great truth is stated everywhere in the Bible; and to induce the children of men - weak, and guilty, and helpless - to put their trust in the Son of God, is the great design of all the communications which God has made to mankind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

And whereas a kiss is a token of love among friends and relations, at meeting and parting, <a href="/genesis/33-11.htm">Genesis 33:11</a>; it may here design the love and affection that is to be expressed to Christ, who is a most lovely object, and to be loved above all creatures and things; or, as it sometimes signifies, homage and subjection, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>, and it is the custom of the Indians to this day for subjects to kiss their kings: it may here also denote the subjection of the kings and judges and others to Christ, who is Lord of all; or else, as it has been used in token of adoration and worship, <a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>; it may design the worship which is due to him from all ranks of creatures, angels and men, <a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>; and the honour which is to be given to him, as to the Father, <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>; which shows the greatness and dignity of his person, and that he is the true God and eternal life: in the Talmud (l) this is interpreted of the law, where it is said, <p>"there is no but the law, according to <a href="/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>;'' <p>which agrees with the Septuagint version; <p>lest he be angry; though he is a Lamb, he has wrath in him, and when the great day of his wrath comes in any form on earth, there is no standing before him; and how much less when he shall appear as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, and shall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire; then kings and freemen will call to the rocks to fall upon them, and hide them from him; <p>and ye perish from the way; the Syriac version renders it "from his way", the Son's way; and the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions "from the righteous way"; and the Arabic version "from the way of righteousness"; or "as to the way", as others (m), the good way; all to one sense; meaning that way of righteousness, salvation and eternal life by Jesus Christ, which being missed by persons, they are eternally lost and undone: some render it "because of the way" (n); that is, because of their sinful course of life; for the way of the ungodly shall perish itself, and therefore they that pursue it shall perish also: others render it "in the way" (o); and then the sense is, lest they perish in the midst of their course of sin, in their own evil way, they have chosen and delighted in, or, to use the words of Christ, "die in their sins", <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-21.htm">John 8:21</a>, and everlastingly perish; for this perishing is to be understood not of corporeal death, in which sense righteous men perish, but of everlasting destruction: or the word which is rendered "from the way" may be translated "suddenly" (p), "immediately", or "straightway", and our English word "directly" is almost the same; and so may design the swift and sudden destruction of such persons who provoke the Son to wrath and anger; which sense is confirmed by what follows; <p>when his wrath is kindled but a little; either to a small degree, or but for a little while; for the least degree and duration of it are intolerable, and who then can dwell in everlasting burnings, or abide the devouring flames? or when it is kindled  "suddenly" (q), in a moment, as Jarchi interprets it; and so sudden wrath brings sudden destruction; <p>blessed are all they that put their trust in him; not in horses and chariots, in riches and honours, in their own wisdom, strength, and righteousness; but in the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, and who is truly and properly God; or otherwise faith and trust would not be required to be put in him: and happy are those who betake themselves to him as to their strong hold and place of defence; who look to him and believe in him for pardon, peace, righteousness, every supply of grace and eternal life; these are safe and secure in him, nor shall they want any good thing needful for them; and they have much peace, joy, and comfort here, and shall have more grace as they want it, and hereafter eternal glory and happiness. <p>(k)  Aquila; "purum", Cocceius; so Kimchi &amp; Ben Melech.

For the <span class="ital">kiss</span> of homage cp. <a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm" title="Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance?">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm" title="Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="/job/31-27.htm" title="And my heart has been secretly enticed, or my mouth has kissed my hand:">Job 31:27</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-2.htm" title="And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.">Hosea 13:2</a>. But this rendering must certainly be abandoned, (1) Not to mention some minor difficulties, it assumes that the Psalmist has used the Aramaic word <span class="ital">bar</span> for son (cp. <span class="ital">Bar-jona, Bar-Jesus</span>) instead of the usual Hebrew word <span class="ital">ben</span>. The only example of its use in the <span class="ital">Hebrew</span> of the O.T. (it is of course found in the <span class="ital">Aramaic</span> of Ezra and Daniel) is in <a href="/proverbs/31-2.htm" title="What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?">Proverbs 31:2</a>, a passage which contains other marked Aramaisms. No satisfactory reason has been suggested for its introduction here. We should not expect a poet to borrow a foreign word for <span class="ital">son</span> either for ‘emphasis’ or for ‘euphony.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) None of the ancient Versions, with the exception of the Syriac, give this sense to the words. They represent two views as to the meaning, (<span class="ital">a</span>) The LXX, and of course the Versions dependent on it, render, <span class="ital">Lay hold of instruction</span>: and similarly the Targum, <span class="ital">Receive instruction</span>, (<span class="ital">b</span>) Symmachus and Jerome render, <span class="ital">Worship purely</span>; and to the same effect, but with his usual bald literalism, Aquila gives, <span class="ital">Kiss choicely</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Syriac gives the meaning <span class="ital">Kiss the son</span>: but its rendering is merely a transcription of the Hebrew words. The reading of the Ambrosian MS., which agrees with the rendering of the LXX, is a correction by a later hand to the reading of the Hexaplar Syriac.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jerome was acquainted with the translation <span class="ital">Worship the son</span>, but rejected it as doubtful. The passage in his treatise <span class="ital">against Ruffinus</span> (i. 19) deserves quotation. He had been charged with inconsistency for translating <span class="ital">Worship purely</span> (adorate pure) in his Psalter, though he had given <span class="ital">Worship the son</span> (adorate filium) in his Commentary. After discussing the possible meanings of the words he concludes thus: “Why am I to blame, if I have given different translations of an ambiguous word? and while in my short commentary where there is opportunity for discussion I had said <span class="ital">Worship the Son</span>, in the text itself, to avoid all appearance of forced interpretation, and to leave no opening for Jewish cavils, I have said, <span class="ital">Worship purely</span>, or <span class="ital">choicely</span>; as Aquila also and Symmachus have translated it.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is however easier to shew that the rendering <span class="ital">Kiss the Son</span> is untenable, than to decide what rendering should be adopted. <span class="ital">Bar</span> (beside other senses inapplicable here) may mean <span class="ital">choice</span>, or, <span class="ital">pure</span>. Hence some commentators have adopted the renderings <span class="ital">Worship the chosen one</span>; or, <span class="ital">Worship in purity</span> (cp. <a href="/psalms/18-20.htm" title="The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.">Psalm 18:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-24.htm" title="Therefore has the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.">Psalm 18:24</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/24-3.htm" title="Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?...">Psalm 24:3-5</a>). But the substantial agreement of the LXX and Targum points to the existence of a widely-spread early tradition as to the sense, and on the whole it seems best to follow their general direction and render, <span class="ital">Embrace instruction</span>, or perhaps, <span class="ital">obedience</span>. No rendering is free from difficulty, and it may be doubted whether the text is sound. But an exaggerated importance has frequently been attached to the words. The uncertainty as to their meaning does not affect the general drift of the Psalm, or its Messianic interpretation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lest he be angry</span>] The subject of the verb is Jehovah Himself. The verb is applied to God in all the thirteen passages where it occurs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">perish</span> from <span class="ital">the way</span>] Rather, as R.V., perish in the way: find that your expedition leads only to ruin. Cp. <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm" title="For the LORD knows the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.">Psalm 1:6</a>. P.B.V. adds <span class="ital">right</span> from the LXX (<span class="greekheb">ἐξ ὁδοῦ δικαίας</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when his wrath is kindled but a little</span>] Better, For quickly (or <span class="ital">easily</span>) may his anger blaze forth. <span class="ital">Kindled</span> fails to give the idea of the Divine wrath blazing up to <span class="ital">consume</span> all adversaries. Cp. <a href="/psalms/83-14.htm" title="As the fire burns a wood, and as the flame sets the mountains on fire;">Psalm 83:14</a> f.; <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm" title="Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:">Isaiah 30:27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Blessed</span> are <span class="ital">all they that put their trust in him</span>] Rather, Happy are all they that take refuge in him: lit. seek asylum or shelter: cp. <a href="/judges/9-15.htm" title="And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.">Jdg 9:15</a>; <a href="/ruth/2-12.htm" title="The LORD recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to trust.">Ruth 2:12</a> (R.V.); <a href="/psalms/7-1.htm" title="O LORD my God, in you do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:">Psalm 7:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/57-1.htm" title="Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me: for my soul trusts in you: yes, in the shadow of your wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be over.">Psalm 57:1</a>. Here primarily, those are congratulated who place themselves under His protectorate by accepting the suzerainty of His king; but as in the preceding verse, the deeper spiritual sense must not be excluded. Cp. <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm" title="O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusts in him.">Psalm 34:8</a>. <a href="/nahum/1-7.htm" title="The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knows them that trust in him.">Nahum 1:7</a> combines the thought with that of <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm" title="For the LORD knows the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.">Psalm 1:6</a> <span class="ital">a</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Kiss the Son</span>. It is certainly remarkable that we have here a different word for "Son" from that employed in ver. 7, and ordinarily in the Hebrew Bible. Still, there is other evidence that the word here used, <span class="accented">bar</span>, existed in the Hebrew no less than in the Aramaic, viz. <a href="/proverbs/31-2.htm">Proverbs 31:2</a>, where it is repeated thrice. It was probably an archaic and poetic word, like our "sire" for "father," rarely used, but, when used, intended to mark some special dignity. Hengstenberg suggests that the writer's motive in prefering <span class="accented">bar to ben</span> in this place was to avoid the cacophony which would have arisen from the juxtaposition of <span class="accented">ben</span> and pen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5df;</span>); and this is quite possible, but as a secondary rather than as the main reason. By "<span class="accented">kiss</span> the Son" we must understand "pay him homage," salute him as King in the customary way (see <a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lest he be angry</span>. The omission of a customary token of respect is an insult which naturally augers the object of it (<a href="/esther/3-5.htm">Esther 3:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And ye perish from the way</span>; or, <span class="accented">as to the way."</span> To anger the Son is to bring destruction on our "way," or course in life. <span class="cmt_word">When his wrath is kindled but a little</span>; rather, for soon <span class="accented">his wrath may be kindled</span> (see the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are all they that put their trust in him</span>. The writer ends with words of blessing, to relieve the general severity of the psalm (comp. <a href="/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a>, etc.). (On the blessedness of trusting in God, see <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-12.htm">Psalm 84:12</a>, etc.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/psalms/2-5.htm">Psalm 2:5</a> is like a peal of thunder (cf. <a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33</a>); &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;,   <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-5.htm">Psalm 2:5</a>, like the lightning's destructive flash. And as the first strophe closed with the words of the rebels, so this second closes with Jahve's own words.

It has been shown by Bttcher, that we must not translate "I have anointed" (Targ., Symm.). &#1504;&#1505;&#1498;, Arab. nsk, certainly means to pour out, but not to pour upon, and the meaning of pouring wide and firm (of casting metal, libation, anointing) then, as in &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1490;, &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, goes over into the meaning of setting firmly in any place (fundere into fundare, constituere, as lxx, Syr., Jer., and Luther translate), so that consequently &#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1498; the word for prince cannot be compared with &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;, but with &#1504;&#1510;&#1497;&#1489;.<p>(Note: Even the Jalkut on the Psalms, 620, wavers in the explanation of &#1504;&#1505;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497; between &#1488;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; I have anointed him, (after <a href="/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>), &#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; (I have cast him (after <a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a> and freq.), and &#1490;&#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; I have made him great (after <a href="/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a>).

A fifth is &#1504;&#1505;&#1498; to purify, consecrate (Hitz.), which does not exist, for the Arabic nasaka obtains this meaning from the primary signification of cleansing by flooding with water (e.g., washing away the briny elements of a field). Also in <a href="/proverbs/8-23.htm">Proverbs 8:23</a> &#1504;&#1505;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; means I am cast  equals  placed.)<p>The Targum rightly inserts &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; (et praefeci eum) after &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; (unxi), for the place of the anointing is not &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;. History makes no mention of a king of Israel being anointed on Zion. Zion is mentioned as the royal seat of the Anointed One; there he is installed, that He may reign there, and rule from thence, <a href="/psalms/110-2.htm">Psalm 110:2</a>. It is the hill of the city of David (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1</a>) including Moriah, that is intended. That hill of holiness, i.e., holy hill, which is the resting-place of the divine presence and therefore excels all the heights of the earth, is assigned to Him as the seat of His throne. </body></html>
