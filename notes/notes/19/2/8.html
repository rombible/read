Thus “Christ was to enter upon the exercise of the intercessorial branch of his priestly office, with a request to the Father that the heathen world, &c., might be given for his inheritance, in return for the labours he had undergone, and the pains he had endured; as also to supply the place of the Jews, who were his original inheritance and possession, but were cast off because of unbelief.” — Horne.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:7-9 The kingdom of the Messiah is founded upon an eternal decree of God the Father. This our Lord Jesus often referred to, as what he governed himself by. God hath said unto him, Thou art my Son, and it becomes each of us to say to him, Thou art my Lord, my Sovereign'. The Son, in asking the heathen for his inheritance, desires their happiness in him; so that he pleads for them, ever lives to do so, and is able to save to the uttermost, and he shall have multitudes of willing, loyal subjects, among them. Christians are the possession of the Lord Jesus; they are to him for a name and a praise. God the Father gives them to him, when, by his Spirit and grace, he works upon them to submit to the Lord Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ask of me - That is, of God. This is a part of the "decree" or purpose, as mentioned in <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>. That decree embraced not only the design to constitute him as his Son, in the sense that he was to be king in Zion, but also the purpose to give him a dominion embracing "the heathen" and "the uttermost parts of the earth." This wide dominion was to be given him on condition that he would "ask" for it, thus keeping up the idea that Yahweh, as such, is the great source of authority and empire, and that the Messiah, as such occupies a rank subordinate to him. This relation of the Father and Son is everywhere recognized in the New Testament. As we may be sure that the Messiah will ask for this, it follows that the world will yet be brought under his scepter. It may be added that as this wide dominion is promised to the Messiah only on condition that he "asks" for it or prays for it, much more is it true that we can hope for this and for no favor from God, unless we seek it by earnest prayer.<p>And I shall give thee - I will give thee. That is, he would ultimately give him this possession. No time is specified when it would be done, and the prophecy will be fulfilled if it shall be accomplished in any period of the history of the world.<p>The heathen - The nations (notes, <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>); that is, the world. In the time of the writer of the psalm, the world would be spoken of as divided into Hebrews and other nations; the people of God and foreigners. The same division is often referred to in the New Testament under the terms Jew and Gentile, as the Greeks divided all the world into Greeks and barbarians. The word would now embrace all the nations which are not under the influence of the true religion.<p>For thine inheritance - Thy heritage; thy portion as my Son. There is an allusion here to the fact that he had constituted him as his Son, and hence, it was proper to speak of him as the heir of all things. See the notes at <a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>.<p>And the uttermost parts of the earth - The farthest regions of the world. This promise would properly embrace all the world as then known, as it is now known, as it shall be hereafter known.<p>For thy possession - That is, as king. This, on the earth, was be to his possession as the Son of Yahweh, constituted as king. It may be remarked here,<p>(a) that this can have its fulfillment only in the Lord Jesus Christ. It was not true of David nor of any other Hebrew monarch that he had conceded to him, in fact, any such possession. Their dominions extended, at any time, but little beyond the bounds of Palestine, and embraced a very limited part of the earth - but a small territory, even as compared with many then existing kingdoms. The phrase used here could never have been applied to the limited and narrow country of Palestine.<p>(b) The promise is to be understood as still in full force. It has never been cancelled or recalled, and though its fulfillment has seemed to be long delayed, yet as no time was specified, its spirit and meaning have not been disregarded. Events have shown that it was not intended that it should be speedily accomplished; and events, when no time is specified, should be allowed to be interpreters of the original meaning of the prophecy.<p>(c) The promise will yet be fulfilled. It is evidently supposed in the promise that the Messiah would ask for this; and it is solemnly affirmed that if he did, this wide inheritance would be granted to him. The world, then, is to be regarded as given by covenant to the Son of God, and in due time he will set up his dominion over the earth, and rule over mankind. The period is coming when the actual scepter swayed over the nations of the earth will be that of the Son of God, and when his right to give laws and to reign will be acknowledged from the rising to the setting sun. This is the only thing in the future that is certainly known to us, and this is enough to make everything in that future bright. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

This certainty is expressed, with a tinge of involuntary astonishment, in the question. &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; followed by a praet. enquires the ground of such lawlessness: wherefore have the peoples banded together so tumultuously (Aquila: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)? and followed by a fut., the aim of this ineffectual action: wherefore do they imagine emptiness? &#1512;&#1497;&#1511; might be adverbial and equivalent to &#1500;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;, but it is here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>, a governed accusative; for &#1492;&#1490;&#1492; which signifies in itself only quiet inward musing and yearning, expressing itself by a dull muttering (here: something deceitful, as in <a href="/psalms/38-13.htm">Psalm 38:13</a>), requires an object. By this &#1512;&#1497;&#1511; the involuntary astonishment of the question justifies itself: to what purpose is this empty affair, i.e., devoid of reason and continuance? For the psalmist, himself a subject and member of the divine kingdom, is too well acquainted with Jahve and His Anointed not to recognise beforehand the unwarrantableness and impotency of such rebellion. That these two things are kept in view, is implied by <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, which further depicts the position of affairs without being subordinated to the &#1500;&#1502;&#1492;. The fut. describes what is going on at the present time: they set themselves in position, they take up a defiant position (&#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; as in <a href="/1_samuel/17-16.htm">1 Samuel 17:16</a>), after which we again (comp. the reverse order in <a href="/psalms/83-6.htm">Psalm 83:6</a>) have a transition to the perf. which is the more uncoloured expression of the actual: &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1491; (with &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; as the exponent of reciprocity) prop. to press close and firm upon one another, then (like Arab. sa&#770;wada, which, according to the correct observation of the Turkish Kamus, in its signification clam cum aliquo locutus est, starts from the very same primary meaning of pressing close to any object): to deliberate confidentially together (as <a href="/psalms/31-14.htm">Psalm 31:14</a> and &#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1509; <a href="/psalms/71-10.htm">Psalm 71:10</a>). The subjects &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; and &#1512;&#1493;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (according to the Arabic razuna, to be weighty: the grave, dignitaries, &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, augusti) are only in accordance with the poetic style without the article. It is a general rising of the people of the earth against Jahve and His &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;, &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;, the king anointed by Him by means of the holy oil and most intimately allied to Him.

The pathetic suff. e&#770;mo&#772; instead of e&#770;he&#769;m refers back to Jahve and His Anointed. The cohortatives express the mutual kindling of feeling; the sound and rhythm of the exclamation correspond to the dull murmur of hatred and threatening defiance: the rhythm is iambic, and then anapaestic. First they determine to break asunder the fetters (&#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;  equals  &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;) to which the &#1488;&#1514;, which is significant in the poetical style, points, then to cast away the cords from them (&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; a nobis, this is the Palestinian mode of writing, whereas the Babylonians said and wrote mimeenuw a nobis in distinction from &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; ab eo, B.

They are, therefore, at present subjects of Jahve and His Anointed, and not merely because the whole world is Jahve's, but because He has helped His Anointed to obtain dominion over them. It is a battle for freedom, upon which they are entering, but a freedom that is opposed to God. </body></html>
