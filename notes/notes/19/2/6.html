As this world is the kingdom of Satan, unconverted men, of every rank, party, and character, are stirred up by him to oppose the cause of God. But the rulers of the earth generally have been most active. The truths and precepts of Christianity are against ambitious projects and worldly lusts. We are told what they aim at in this opposition. They would break asunder the bands of conscience, and the cords of God's commandments; they will not receive, but cast them away as far as they can. These enemies can show no good cause for opposing so just and holy a government, which, if received by all, would bring a heaven upon earth. They can hope for no success in so opposing so powerful a kingdom. The Lord Jesus has all power both in heaven and in earth, and is Head over all things to the church, notwithstanding the restless endeavours of his enemies.

It is rendered in the Vulgate "but ...autem;" and so in the Septuagint, &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;  de. It would be better rendered perhaps by the usual word "and:" "And I have set or constituted my king," etc. This is properly to be regarded as the expression of God himself; as what he says in reply to their declared purposes <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-3.htm">Psalm 2:3</a>, and as what is referred to in <a href="/psalms/2-5.htm">Psalm 2:5</a>. The meaning is, he would speak to them in his anger, and say, "In spite of all your purposes and all your opposition, I have set my king on the hill of Zion." That is, they had their plans and God had his; they meant to cast off his authority, and to prevent his purpose to set up the Messiah as king; he resolved, on the contrary, to carry out his purposes, and he would do it. The word rendered set - &#1504;&#1505;&#1498;  na&#770;sak - means, literally, to pour, to pour out, as in making a libation to the Deity, <a href="/exodus/30-9.htm">Exodus 30:9</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-4.htm">Hosea 9:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a>; then, to pour out oil in anointing a king or priest, and hence, to consecrate, to inaugurate, etc. See <a href="/joshua/13-21.htm">Joshua 13:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/83-11.htm">Psalm 83:11</a>; <a href="/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>. The idea here is, that he had solemnly inaugurated or constituted the Messiah as king; that is, that he had formed the purpose to do it, and he therefore speaks as if it were already done. The words "my King" refer, of course, to the anointed One, the Messiah, <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>. It is not simply a king, or the king, but "my king," meaning that he derived his appointment from God, and that he was placed there to execute his purposes. This indicates the very near relation which the anointed One sustains to him who had appointed him, and prepares us for what is said in the subsequent verse, where he is called His Son.<p>Upon my holy hill of Zion - Zion was the southern hill in the city of Jerusalem. See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>. It was the highest of the hills on which the city was built. It was made by David the capital of his kingdom, and was hence called the city of David, <a href="/2_chronicles/5-2.htm">2 Chronicles 5:2</a>. By the poets and prophets it is often put for Jerusalem itself, <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-14.htm">Isaiah 33:14</a>, et al. It did not obtain this distinction until it was taken by David from the Jebusites, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5-9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-4.htm">1 Chronicles 11:4-8</a>. To that place David removed the ark of the covenant, and there he built an altar to the Lord in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15-25</a>. Zion became thenceforward the metropolis of the king dom, and the name was transferred to the entire city. It is to this that the passage here refers; and the meaning is, that in that metropolis or capital God had constituted his Messiah king, or had appointed him to reign over his people. This cannot refer to David himself, for in no proper sense was he constituted or inaugurated king in Jerusalem; that is, there was no such ceremony of inauguration as is referred to here. Zion was called the "holy hill," or "the hill of my holiness" (Hebrew), because it was set apart as the seat of the theocracy, or the residence of God, from the time that David removed the ark there. That became the place where God reigned, and where his worship was celebrated. This must refer to the Messiah, and to the fact that God had set him apart to reign over his people, and thence over all the earth. The truth taught in this passage is, that God will carry forward his own purposes in spite of all the opposition which men can make, and that it is his deliberate design to make his anointed One - the Messiah - King over all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Or, "behold, I have set", &amp;c. so Noldius by Zion is meant the church of God, especially under the Gospel dispensation; see <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>; so called, because, as Zion was, it is the object of God's love and choice, the place of his habitation and residence; where divine worship is observed, and the word and ordinances of God administered; and where the Lord distributes his blessings of grace; and which is the perfection of beauty, through Christ's comeliness put upon her; and will be the joy of the whole earth: it is strongly fortified by the power and grace of God, and is immovable and impregnable, being built on Christ, the Rock of ages; and, like Zion, it is an high hill, eminent and visible; and more especially will be so when the mountain of the Lord's house is established upon the tops of the mountains: and it is an Holy One, through the presence and worship of God in it, and the sanctification of his Spirit. And over this hill, the church, Christ is King; he is King of saints, and is acknowledged by them; and it is for their great safety and security, their joy, comfort, and happiness, that he is set over them: he is called by his Father "my King", because he who is King of Zion is his Anointed, as in <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>; and his Son, his begotten Son, as in <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; his firstborn, his fellow and equal; and because he is his as King; not that he is King over him, for his Father is greater than he, as man and Mediator, or with respect to his office capacity, in which he is to be considered as King; and therefore he is rather King under him: but he is a King of his setting up, and therefore called his; he has appointed him his kingdom, given him the throne of his father David; put a crown of pure gold on his head, and crowned him with glory and honour, and the sceptre of righteousness in his hand, and has given him a name above every name. He did not make himself a King, nor was he made so by men; but he was set up, or "anointed" by God the Father, as the word (g) here used signifies; and may refer either to the inauguration of Christ into his kingly office, and his investiture with it from all eternity, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-23.htm">Proverbs 8:23</a>, where the same word is used as here; and anointing with oil being a ceremony performed at the instalment of kings into their office, the phrase is used for the thing itself: or rather, since Christ was anointed with the Holy Ghost in the human nature, at his incarnation and baptism, and especially at the time of his ascension, when he was made or declared to be LORD and CHRIST; this may refer to the time when he, as the ascended Lord and King, gave gifts to men, to his apostles, and qualified them in an extraordinary manner to carry his Gospel into the Gentile world, and spread it there, as they did with success; whereby his kingdom became more visible and glorious, to the great vexation of the Jews; for, in spite of all their opposition, Christ being set by his Father King over his church and people, continued so, and his kingdom was every day more and more enlarged, to their great mortification. <p>(g)  Symmachus; "unxi", Musculus, Vatablus, Ainsworth, Piscator, Muis, Cocceius; "ego inungens", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "inunxi", Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Yet have I set</span>] R.V., Yet I have set.

The congregation (&#1506;&#1491;&#1492;( noi  equals  &#8219;idah, from &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;) of the righteous is the congregation of Jahve (&#1506;&#1491;&#1514; &#1492;), which, according to its nature which is ordained and inwrought by God, is a congregation of the righteous, to which consequently the unrighteous belong only outwardly and visibly: &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, <a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6</a>. God's judgment, when and wheresoever he may hold it, shall trace back this appearance to its nothingness. When the time of the divine decision shall come, which also separates outwardly that which is now inwardly separate, viz., righteous and unrighteous, wheat and chaff, then shall the unrighteous be driven away like chaff before the storm, and their temporary prosperity, which had no divine roots, come to a fearful end. For Jahve knoweth the way of the righteous, &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; as in <a href="/psalms/37-18.htm">Psalm 37:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>, and frequently. What is intended is, as the schoolmen say, a nosse con affectu et effectu, a knowledge which is in living, intimate relationship to its subject and at the same time is inclined to it and bound to it by love. The way, i.e., the life's course, of the righteous has God as its goal; God knows this way, which on this very account also unfailingly reaches its goal. On the contrary, the way of the ungodly &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, perishes, because left to itself, - goes down to &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, loses itself, without reaching the goal set before it, in darkest night. The way of the righteous only is &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/139-24.htm">Psalm 139:24</a>, a way that ends in eternal life. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/112-1.htm">Psalm 112:1-10</a> which begins with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; ends with the same fearful &#1514;&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;. </body></html>
