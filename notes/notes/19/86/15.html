Christ is the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be taught the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be taught the way and the truth of God, in order to walk therein, than to be delivered out of earthly distress. Those who set not the Lord before them, seek after believers' souls; but the compassion, mercy, and truth of God, will be their refuge and consolation. And those whose parents were the servants of the Lord, may urge this as a plea why he should hear and help them. In considering David's experience, and that of the believer, we must not lose sight of Him, who though he was rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/86.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion ... - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/86-5.htm">Psalm 86:5</a>.

But although for the most part flowing on only in the language of prayer borrowed from earlier periods, this Psalm is, moreover, not without remarkable significance and beauty. With the confession of the incomparableness of the Lord is combined the prospect of the recognition of the incomparable One throughout the nations of the earth. This clear unallegorical prediction of the conversion of the heathen is the principal parallel to <a href="/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>. "All nations, which Thou hast made" - they have their being from Thee; and although they have forgotten it (vid., <a href="/psalms/9-18.htm">Psalm 9:18</a>), they will nevertheless at last come to recognise it. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, since the article is wanting, are nations of all tribes (countries and nationalities); cf. <a href="/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Jeremiah 16:16</a> with <a href="/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a>; Tobit 13:11, &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;, with ibid. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-6.htm">Psalm 14:6</a>, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;. And how weightily brief and charming is the petition in <a href="/psalms/86-11.htm">Psalm 86:11</a> : uni cor meum, ut timeat nomen tuum! Luther has rightly departed from the renderings of the lxx, Syriac, and Vulgate: laetetur (&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468; from &#1495;&#1491;&#1492;). The meaning, however, is not so much "keep my heart near to the only thing," as "direct all its powers and concentrate them on the one thing."
