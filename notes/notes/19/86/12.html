Nor is this more my duty than my interest; for I know that gratitude for mercies already received will be recompensed by a continuance and increase of those mercies. Of the greatness of God’s mercy the psalmist gives this instance. <span class="ital">Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">משׁאול תחתיה</span>, <span class="ital">mesheol tachtijah, </span>which Green renders, <span class="ital">From the grave beneath: </span>“Thou hast often snatched me from extreme dangers, which, like an abyss, or bottomless pit, were ready to swallow me up.” But <span class="ital">sheol </span>often means <span class="ital">hell, </span>properly so called, or eternal death; and of this even some of the Jewish writers understand the word here. David knew he had deserved to be cast off for ever, and to be doomed to the lowest hell for his sin in the matter of Uriah; but Nathan assured him <span class="ital">the Lord hath taken away thy sin: </span>and by that word he was delivered from the <span class="ital">lowest hell, </span>and herein God’s mercy was great toward him. Even the best saints, we must remember, owe it, not to their own merit, but to the mercy of God, that they are saved <span class="ital">from the lowest hell; </span>and the consideration of that should greatly enlarge their hearts in praising the mercy of God, which they are obliged to glorify for evermore.

Christ is the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be taught the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be taught the way and the truth of God, in order to walk therein, than to be delivered out of earthly distress. Those who set not the Lord before them, seek after believers' souls; but the compassion, mercy, and truth of God, will be their refuge and consolation. And those whose parents were the servants of the Lord, may urge this as a plea why he should hear and help them. In considering David's experience, and that of the believer, we must not lose sight of Him, who though he was rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/86.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart - This is but carrying out the idea in the previous verse.
