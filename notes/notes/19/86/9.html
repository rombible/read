This was, in part, fulfilled in the multitude of proselytes to the Jewish religion, in the days of David and Solomon, but it was to have its full accomplishment in the days of the Messiah, when some out of every kingdom and nation should be effectually brought to praise God, <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a>.

Christ is the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be taught the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to be taught the way and the truth of God, in order to walk therein, than to be delivered out of earthly distress. Those who set not the Lord before them, seek after believers' souls; but the compassion, mercy, and truth of God, will be their refuge and consolation. And those whose parents were the servants of the Lord, may urge this as a plea why he should hear and help them. In considering David's experience, and that of the believer, we must not lose sight of Him, who though he was rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/86.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All nations whom thou hast made shall come ... - In this verse the psalmist expresses his belief that the conviction which he entertained about the ability of God to save - about his being the only true God - would yet pervade all the nations of the earth; that they all would yet be convinced that he was the true God, and would come and worship him alone. So clear to him seemed to be the evidence of the existence and perfections of God that he did not doubt that all people would come yet to see it also, and to acknowledge him. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3-14</a>; <a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>.<p>And shall glorify thy name - Shall honor thee as the true God. They will renounce their idols; they will come and worship thee. This belief - this hope - is held out through the entire volume of revealed truth. It cheered and encouraged the hearts of the saints of the Old Testament and the New; and it may and should cheer and encourage our hearts. It is not less certain because it seems to be long delayed. To the view of man this is all that is certain in the future. No man can predict what will occur in regard to any of the existing political institutions on the earth - either the monarchies of the old world, or the republics of the new.  No man can tell in reference to the arts; to the sciences; to social life; to manners; to the cities and towns which now exist on the earth, what they will be in the far distant future. Only one thing is certain in that future - that the kingdom of God will be set up, and that the Redeemer's throne will be established over all the earth; that the time is to come when "all nations shall come and worship before God, and shall glorify his name." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/86.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10.
