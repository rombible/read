The best self-preservation is to commit ourselves to God's keeping. I am one whom thou favourest, hast set apart for thyself, and made partaker of sanctifying grace. It is a great encouragement to prayer, to feel that we have received the converting grace of God, have learned to trust in him, and to be his servants. We may expect comfort from God, when we keep up our communion with God. God's goodness appears in two things, in giving and forgiving. Whatever others do, let us call upon God, and commit our case to him; we shall not seek in vain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/86.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thou, Lord, art good ... - This is another reason why God should hear his prayer; and it is a reason which may be properly urged at all times, and by all classes of persons. It is founded on the benevolence of God; on the fullness of his mercy to all that invoke his name. We should call in vain on a God who was not merciful and ready to forgive; but in the divine character there is the most ample foundation for such an appeal. In his benevolence; in his readiness to forgive; in the plenitude of his mercy, God is all that a penitent sinner could wish him to be. For if such a sinner should endeavor to describe what he would desire to find in God as a ground of appeal in his prayers, he could not express his feelings in language more full and free than God has himself employed about his own readiness to pardon and save. The language of the Bible on this subject would express, better than any language which he could himself employ, what in those circumstances he would wish to find God to be. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/86.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-7. unto all &#8230; that call upon thee&#8212;or, "worship Thee" (Ps 50:15; 91:15) however undeserving (Ex 34:6; Le 11:9-13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/86.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Herewith he relieveth himself under the sense of his guilt, whereby he had brought his present calamities upon himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Them that call upon thee, </span> to wit, in truth, as it is explained <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/145-18.htm" title="The LORD is near to all them that call on him, to all that call on him in truth.">Psalm 145:18</a></span>, or with an upright heart; for if a man regard iniquity in his heart, God will not hear him, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/66-18.htm" title="If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:">Psalm 66:18</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/86.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thou, Lord, art good,....

After God's &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, i.e., faithfulness to the promises, has descended like dew, &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, i.e., faithfulness to the covenant, springs up out of the land, the fruit of that fertilizing influence. And &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, gracious justice, looks down from heaven, smiling favour and dispensing blessing. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; in <a href="/psalms/85-13.htm">Psalm 85:13</a> places these two prospects in reciprocal relation to one another (cf. <a href="/psalms/84-7.htm">Psalm 84:7</a>); it is found once instead of twice. Jahve gives &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, everything that is only and always good and that imparts true happiness, and the land, corresponding to it, yields &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, the increase which might be expected from a land so richly blessed (cf. <a href="/psalms/67-7.htm">Psalm 67:7</a> and the promise in <a href="/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4</a>). Jahve Himself is present in the land: righteousness walks before Him majestically as His herald, and righteousness &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, sets (viz., its footsteps) upon the way of His footsteps, that is to say, follows Him inseparably. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493; stands once instead of twice; the construct is to a certain extent attractional, as in <a href="/psalms/65-12.htm">Psalm 65:12</a>; <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>. Since the expression is neither &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (<a href="/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>) nor &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (<a href="/isaiah/49-11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a>), it is natural to interpret the expression thus, and it gives moreover (cf. <a href="/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>) an excellent sense. But if, which we prefer, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; is taken in the sense of &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489; (as e.g., in <a href="/job/4-20.htm">Job 4:20</a>) with the following &#1500;, to give special heed to anything (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-46.htm">Deuteronomy 32:46</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-4.htm">Ezekiel 40:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-5.htm">Ezekiel 44:5</a>), to be anxiously concerned about it (<a href="/1_samuel/9-20.htm">1 Samuel 9:20</a>), then we avoid the supplying in thought of a second &#1508;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, which is always objectionable, and the thought obtained by the other interpretation is brought clearly before the mind: righteousness goes before Jahve, who dwells and walks abroad in Israel, and gives heed to the way of His steps, that is to say, follows carefully in His footsteps. </body></html>
