He should see mercy through his sufferings. There is a rest remaining for the people of God after the days of their adversity, which shall not last always. He that sends the trouble, will send the rest. The psalmist found succour and relief only in the Lord, when all earthly friends failed. We are beholden, not only to God's power, but to his pity, for spiritual supports; and if we have been kept from falling into sin, or shrinking from our duty, we should give him the glory, and encourage our brethren. The psalmist had many troubled thoughts concerning the case he was in, concerning the course he should take, and what was likely to be the end of it. The indulgence of such contrivances and fears, adds to care and distrust, and renders our views more gloomy and confused. Good men sometimes have perplexed and distressed thoughts concerning God. But let them look to the great and precious promises of the gospel. The world's comforts give little delight to the soul, when hurried with melancholy thoughts; but God's comforts bring that peace and pleasure which the smiles of the world cannot give, and which the frowns of the world cannot take away. God is his people's Refuge, to whom they may flee, in whom they are safe, and may be secure. And he will reckon with the wicked. A man cannot be more miserable than his own wickedness will make him, if the Lord visit it upon him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/94.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unless the Lord had been my help - At the time referred to. If I had not had a God to whom I could have gone - if my mind had not been directed to him - if I had not actually found him a refuge and strength, I should have despaired altogether. There was no other one to whom I could go; there was nothing else but the help of God on which I could rely.<p>My soul had almost dwelt in silence - Margin, quickly. The original is, "It was as it were but little;" that is, there was little lacking to bring this about; a little heavier pressure - a little added to what I was then suffering - a little longer time before relief was obtained - would have brought me down to the land of silence - to the grave. The Latin Vulgate renders this, "My soul had dwelt in inpherno." The Septuagint, "in Hades" - &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#837; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#837;  to&#772; Hade&#772;. See <a href="/psalms/31-17.htm">Psalm 31:17</a>. The grave is represented as a place of silence, or as the land of silence: <a href="/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a> : "The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence."

Without Jehovah's help the Psalmist declares that he should have died outright, and gone into the silent land, where no more testimonies can be borne for the living God. Or he may mean that he would not have had a word to speak against his enemies, but would have been wrapped in speechless shame. Blessed be God, we are not left to that condition yet, for the Almighty Lord is still the helper of all those who look to him. Our inmost soul is bowed down when we see the victories of the Lord's enemies - owe cannot brook it, we cover our mouths in confusion; but he will yet arise and avenge his own cause, therefore have we hope.<p><a href="/psalms/94-18.htm">Psalm 94:18</a><p>"When I said, My foot slippeth" - is slipping even now, I perceived my danger, and cried out in horror, and then, at the very moment of my extremity, came the needed help, "thy mercy, O Lord, held me up." Often enough is this the case, we feel our weakness, and see our danger, and in fear and trembling we cry out. At such times nothing can help us but mercy; we can make no appeal to any fancied merit, for we feel that it is our inbred sin which makes our feet so ready to fail us; our joy is that mercy endureth for ever, and is always at hand to pluck us out of the danger, and hold us up, where else we should fall to our destruction. Ten thousand times has this verse been true in relation to some of us, and especially to the writer of this comment. The danger was imminent, it was upon us, we were going; the peril was apparent, we saw it, and were aghast at the sight; our own heart was failing, and we concluded that it was all over with us; but then came the almighty interposition: we did not fall, we were held up by an unseen hand, the devices of the enemy were frustrated, and we sang for joy. O faithful Keeper of our souls, be thou extolled for ever and ever! We will bless the Lord at all times, his praise shall continually be in our mouths.<p><a href="/psalms/94-19.htm">Psalm 94:19</a><p>"In the multitude of my thoughts within me." When I am tossed to and fro with various reasonings, distractions, questionings, and forebodings, I will fly to my true rest, for "thy comforts delight my soul." From my sinful thoughts, my vain thoughts, my sorrowful thoughts, my griefs, my cares, my conflicts, I will hasten to the Lord; he has divine comforts, and these will not only console but actually delight me. How sweet are the comforts of the Spirit! Who can muse upon eternal love, immutable purposes, covenant promises, finished redemption, the risen Saviour, his union with his people, the coming glory, and such like themes, without feeling his heart leaping with joy? The little world within is, like the great world without, full of confusion and strife; but when Jesus enters it, and whispers "Peace be unto you," there is a calm, yea, a rapture of bliss. Let us turn away from the mournful contemplation of the oppression of man and the present predominance of the wicked, to that sanctuary of pure rest which is found in the God of all comfort. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/94.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In the place of silence, to wit, the grave.

They are called &#1489;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; in the sense of <a href="/psalms/73-21.htm">Psalm 73:21</a>. Those hitherto described against whom God's vengeance is supplicated are this also; but this appellation would be too one-sided for them, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; refers the address expressly to a class of men among the people whom those oppress and slay. It is absurd that God, the planter of the ear (&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1496;&#1506;, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1506; in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>, with an accented ultima, because the praet. Kal does not follow the rule for the drawing back of the accent called &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1490; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;) and the former of the eye (cf. <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-11.htm">Exodus 4:11</a>), should not be able to hear and to see; everything that is excellent in the creature, God must indeed possess in original, absolute perfection.<p>(Note: The questions are not: ought He to have no ear, etc.; as Jerome pertinently observes in opposition to the anthropomorphites, membra tulit, efficientias dedit.)<p>The poet then points to the extra-Israelitish world and calls God &#1497;&#1505;&#1512; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, which cannot be made to refer to a warning by means of the voice of conscience; &#1497;&#1505;&#1512; used thus without any closer definition does not signify "warning," but "chastening" (<a href="/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7</a>). Taking his stand upon facts like those in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-23.htm">Job 12:23</a>, the poet assumes the punitive judicial rule of God among the heathen to be an undeniable fact, and presents for consideration the question, whether He who chasteneth nations cannot and will not also punish the oppressors of His church (cf. <a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>), He who teacheth men knowledge, i.e., He who nevertheless must be the omnipotent One, since all knowledge comes originally from Him? Jahve - thus does the course of argument close in <a href="/psalms/94-11.htm">Psalm 94:11</a> - sees through (&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; of penetrative perceiving or knowing that goes to the very root of a matter) the thoughts of men that they are vanity. Thus it is to be interpreted, and not: for they (men) are vanity; for this ought to have been &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1489;&#1500; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, whereas in the dependent clause, when the predicate is not intended to be rendered especially prominent, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/9-21.htm">Psalm 9:21</a>, the pronominal subject may precede, <a href="/isaiah/61-9.htm">Isaiah 61:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a> (Hitzig). The rendering of the lxx (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-20.htm">1 Corinthians 3:20</a>), &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; (Jerome, quoniam vanae sunt), is therefore correct; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, with the customary want of exactness, stands for &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;. It is true men themselves are &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;; it is not, however, on this account that He who sees through all things sees through their thoughts, but He sees through them in their sinful vanity. </body></html>
