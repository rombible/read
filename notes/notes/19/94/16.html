He should see mercy through his sufferings. There is a rest remaining for the people of God after the days of their adversity, which shall not last always. He that sends the trouble, will send the rest. The psalmist found succour and relief only in the Lord, when all earthly friends failed. We are beholden, not only to God's power, but to his pity, for spiritual supports; and if we have been kept from falling into sin, or shrinking from our duty, we should give him the glory, and encourage our brethren. The psalmist had many troubled thoughts concerning the case he was in, concerning the course he should take, and what was likely to be the end of it. The indulgence of such contrivances and fears, adds to care and distrust, and renders our views more gloomy and confused. Good men sometimes have perplexed and distressed thoughts concerning God. But let them look to the great and precious promises of the gospel. The world's comforts give little delight to the soul, when hurried with melancholy thoughts; but God's comforts bring that peace and pleasure which the smiles of the world cannot give, and which the frowns of the world cannot take away. God is his people's Refuge, to whom they may flee, in whom they are safe, and may be secure. And he will reckon with the wicked. A man cannot be more miserable than his own wickedness will make him, if the Lord visit it upon him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/94.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers?... - This is the language of the psalmist. It is what he had said in the circumstances referred to in the first part of the psalm, when the wicked seemed to triumph; when they had come in upon the land, and laid waste the heritage of God, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-3.htm">Psalm 94:3-6</a>. At that time, full of anxiety and trouble, and deeply impressed with a sense of danger, he had anxiously looked around for help, and had asked with deep concern who would stand up for him and defend him. The following verses <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/94-17.htm">Psalm 94:17-18</a> show what was then his reliance, and in what way confidence in God had kept him from falling into despair. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/94.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

This also is a bitter trial, and a sore evil under the sun; yet it has its purpose, for it drives the heart still more completely to the Lord, compelling it to rest alone in him. If we could find friends elsewhere, it may be our God would not be so dear to us; but when, after calling upon heaven and earth to help, we meet with no succour but such as comes from the eternal arm, we are led to prize our God, and rest upon him with undivided trust. Never is the soul safer or more at rest than when, all other helpers failing, she leans upon the Lord alone. The verse before us is an appropriate cry, now that the church sees error invading her on all sides, while faithful ministers are few, and fewer still are bold enough to stand up and defy the enemies of truth. Where are our Luthers and our Calvins? A false charity has enfeebled the most of the valiant men of Israel. One John Knox would be worth a mint at this hour, but where is he? Our grand consolation is that the God of Knox and Luther is yet with us, and in due time will call out his chosen champions. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/94.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To defend and help me.

Are they not left a prey to the evil doers, at their mercy, without a champion? The answer is given in the next verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/94.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The third strophe now turns from those bloodthirsty, blasphemous oppressors of the people of God whose conduct calls forth the vengeance of Jahve, to those among the people themselves, who have been puzzled about the omniscience and indirectly about the righteousness of God by the fact that this vengeance is delayed. They are called &#1489;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; in the sense of <a href="/psalms/73-21.htm">Psalm 73:21</a>. Those hitherto described against whom God's vengeance is supplicated are this also; but this appellation would be too one-sided for them, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; refers the address expressly to a class of men among the people whom those oppress and slay. It is absurd that God, the planter of the ear (&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1496;&#1506;, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1506; in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>, with an accented ultima, because the praet. Kal does not follow the rule for the drawing back of the accent called &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1490; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;) and the former of the eye (cf. <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-11.htm">Exodus 4:11</a>), should not be able to hear and to see; everything that is excellent in the creature, God must indeed possess in original, absolute perfection.<p>(Note: The questions are not: ought He to have no ear, etc.; as Jerome pertinently observes in opposition to the anthropomorphites, membra tulit, efficientias dedit.)<p>The poet then points to the extra-Israelitish world and calls God &#1497;&#1505;&#1512; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, which cannot be made to refer to a warning by means of the voice of conscience; &#1497;&#1505;&#1512; used thus without any closer definition does not signify "warning," but "chastening" (<a href="/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7</a>). Taking his stand upon facts like those in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-23.htm">Job 12:23</a>, the poet assumes the punitive judicial rule of God among the heathen to be an undeniable fact, and presents for consideration the question, whether He who chasteneth nations cannot and will not also punish the oppressors of His church (cf. <a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>), He who teacheth men knowledge, i.e., He who nevertheless must be the omnipotent One, since all knowledge comes originally from Him? Jahve - thus does the course of argument close in <a href="/psalms/94-11.htm">Psalm 94:11</a> - sees through (&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; of penetrative perceiving or knowing that goes to the very root of a matter) the thoughts of men that they are vanity. Thus it is to be interpreted, and not: for they (men) are vanity; for this ought to have been &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1489;&#1500; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, whereas in the dependent clause, when the predicate is not intended to be rendered especially prominent, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/9-21.htm">Psalm 9:21</a>, the pronominal subject may precede, <a href="/isaiah/61-9.htm">Isaiah 61:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a> (Hitzig). The rendering of the lxx (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-20.htm">1 Corinthians 3:20</a>), &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; (Jerome, quoniam vanae sunt), is therefore correct; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, with the customary want of exactness, stands for &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;. It is true men themselves are &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;; it is not, however, on this account that He who sees through all things sees through their thoughts, but He sees through them in their sinful vanity. </body></html>
