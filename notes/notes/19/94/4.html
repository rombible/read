Let this encourage those who suffer wrong, to bear it with silence, committing themselves to Him who judges righteously. These prayers are prophecies, which speak terror to the sons of violence. There will come a day of reckoning for all the hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against God, his truths, and ways, and people. It would hardly be believed, if we did not witness it, that millions of rational creatures should live, move, speak, hear, understand, and do what they purpose, yet act as if they believed that God would not punish the abuse of his gifts. As all knowledge is from God, no doubt he knows all the thoughts of the children of men, and knows that the imaginations of the thoughts of men's hearts are only evil, and that continually. Even in good thoughts there is a want of being fixed, which may be called vanity. It concerns us to keep a strict watch over our thoughts, because God takes particular notice of them.

The sea with its mighty mass of waters, with the constant unrest of its waves, with its ceaseless pressing against the solid land and foaming against the rocks, is an emblem of the Gentile world alienated from and at enmity with God; and the rivers (floods) are emblems of worldly kingdoms, as the Nile of the Egyptian (<a href="/jeremiah/44-7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a>.), the Euphrates of the Assyrian (<a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>.), or more exactly, the Tigris, swift as an arrow, of the Assyrian, and the tortuous Euphrates of the Babylonian empire (<a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>). These rivers, as the poet says whilst he raises a plaintive but comforted look upwards to Jahve, have lifted up, have lifted up their murmur, the rivers lift up their roaring. The thought is unfolded in a so-called "parallelism with reservation." The perfects affirm what has taken place, the future that which even now as yet is taking place. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497; signifies a striking against (collisio), and a noise, a din. One now in <a href="/psalms/93-4.htm">Psalm 93:4</a> looks for the thought that Jahve is exalted above this roaring of the waves. &#1502;&#1503; will therefore be the min of comparison, not of the cause: "by reason of the roar of great waters are the breakers of the sea glorious" (Starck, Geier), - which, to say nothing more, is a tautological sentence. But if &#1502;&#1503; is comparative, then it is impossible to get on with the accentuation of &#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, whether it be with Mercha (Ben-Asher) or Dech&#1502; (Ben-Naphtali). For to render: More than the roar of great waters are the breakers of the sea glorious (Mendelssohn), is impracticable, since &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; are nothing less than &#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>.), and we are prohibited from taking &#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1501; as a parenthesis (K&#1510;ster), by the fact that it is just this clause that is exceeded by &#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1512; &#1489;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;.

Frensdorf's Ochla we-Ochla, p. 123), i.e., one of the seventeen words whose Aleph is audible, whilst it is otherwise always quiescent; e.g., &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;, otherwise &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;.)<p>therefore the feminine of the adjective with a more loosened syllable next to the tone, like &#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/40-18.htm">Psalm 40:18</a>), that is to say, it is inviolable (sacrosanct), and when it is profaned, shall ever be vindicated again in its holiness. This clause, formulated after the manner of a prayer, is at the same time a petition that Jahve in all time to come would be pleased to thoroughly secure the place where His honour dwells here below against profanation. </body></html>
