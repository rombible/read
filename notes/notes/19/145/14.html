He satisfies the desire of every living thing, except the unreasonable children of men, who are satisfied with nothing. He does good to all the children of men; his own people in a special manner. Many children of God, who have been ready to fall into sin, to fall into despair, have tasted his goodness in preventing their falls, or recovering them speedily by his graces and comforts. And with respect to all that are heavy laden under the burden of sin, if they come to Christ by faith, he will ease them, he will raise them. He is very ready to hear and answer the prayers of his people. He is present every where; but in a special way he is nigh to them, as he is not to others. He is in their hearts, and dwells there by faith, and they dwell in him. He is nigh to those that call upon him, to help them in all times of need. He will be nigh to them, that they may have what they ask, and find what they seek, if they call upon him in truth and sincerity. And having taught men to love his name and holy ways, he will save them from the destruction of the wicked. May we then love his name, and walk in his ways, while we desire that all flesh should bless his holy name for ever and ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/145.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord upholdeth all that fall - The word used here is a participle, literally, "The Lord sustaining;" that is, the Lord is a Sustainer or Upholder of all that fall. The allusion is to those who have no power to go of themselves; who would sink under the burdens of life if they were not supported. The idea is, that it is a characteristic of the Lord, that he does sustain such; that all such may confidently look to him to uphold them.<p>And raiseth up all those that be bowed down - The word here also is a participle: "he is lifting up;" that is, he is a lifter up. The reference is to those who are bent and bowed under the duties, the cares, the trials of life; who go bowed down under those burdens. God is able to strengthen them so that they can bear those burdens without being crushed under them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/145.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Read this verse in connection with the preceding and admire the unexpected contrast, he who reigns in glorious majesty, yet condescends to lift up and hold up those who are apt to fall. The form of the verb shows that he is always doing this; he is Jehovah upholding. His choice of the fallen, and the falling, as the subjects of his gracious help is specially to be noted. The fallen of our race, especially fallen women, are shunned by us, and it is peculiar tenderness on the Lord's part that such he looks upon, even those who are at once the chief of sinners and the least regarded of mankind. The falling ones among us are too apt to be pushed down by the strong, their timidity and dependence make them the victims of the proud and domineering. To them also the Lord gives his upholding help. The Lord loves to reverse things, - he puts down the lofty, and lifts up the lowly.<p>"And raiseth up all those that be bowed down." Another deed of condescension. Many are despondent, and cannot lift up their heads in courage, or their hearts with comfort; but these he cheers. Some are bent with their daily load, and these he strengthens. Jesus loosed a daughter of Abraham whom Satan had so bound that she was bowed down and could by no means lift up herself. In this he proved himself to be the true Son of the Highest. Think of the Infinite bowing to lift up the bowed, and stooping to be leaned upon by those who are ready to fall. The two "alls" should not be overlooked: the Lord has a kindly heart towards the whole company of the afflicted.<p><a href="/psalms/145-15.htm">Psalm 145:15</a><p>"The eyes of all wait upon thee." They have learned to look to thee, it has become their nature to turn to thee for all they want. As children look to a father for all they need, so do the creatures look to God, the all-sufficient Provider. It were well if all men had the eye of faith, and if all waited therewith upon the Lord. "And thou givest them their meat in due season." They wait, and God gives. The thought of this brings God so near to our poet-prophet that he is again speaking with God after the style of thee and thou. Is it to be wondered at when the Lord is feeding the hungry all around us, - giving food to all creatures, and to ourselves among them? Like a flock of sheep the creatures stand around the Lord as their great Shepherd; all eyes are to his hand expecting to receive their food; nor are they disappointed, for when the hour comes suitable provender is ready for each creature. Observe the punctuality of the Lord in giving food at meal-time, - in the season when it is due. This he does for all, and each living thing has its own season, so that the Lord of heaven is feeding his great flock both by day and by night, during every moment of time.<p><a href="/psalms/145-16.htm">Psalm 145:16</a><p>"Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing." Thou alone providest, O Jehovah! - Thou doest it liberally, with open hand; thou doest it easily, as if it were only to open thine hand; thou doest this at once as promptly as if all supplies were ready to hand. Living things have needs, and these create desires; the living God has suitable supplies at hand, and these he gives till inward satisfaction is produced, and the creature sighs no longer. In spiritual things, when God has raised a desire, he always gratifies it; hence the longing is prophetic of the blessing. In no case is the desire of the living thing excited to produce distress, but in order that it may seek and find satisfaction.<p>These verses refer to natural providence; but they may equally well apply to the stores of grace, since the same God is king in both spheres. If we will but wait upon the Lord for pardon, renewing, or whatever else we need, we shall not wait in vain. The hand of grace is never closed while the sinner lives. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/145.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Upholdeth all; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Not all that fell in Adam, as all mankind did; nor all that fall into sin, as every man does; and therefore not those that fall into hell: but this is to be understood of the subjects of Christ's kingdom, of which the psalmist is speaking; who does that which no mortal king can do, as Aben Ezra observes: another king raises up one, and depresses another; supports one, and lets another fall: but the Lord upholds all his people and subjects with the right hand of his righteousness; though they are liable to fall into sin, and in many instances do fall, and into various temptations and afflictions; yet he sustains and upholds them, that they shall not fall finally and totally by sin, nor be overwhelmed and crushed by their heavy afflictions. Or, "all that are falling" (g); he either upholds and keeps them that they shall not fall, at least so as to perish; or he holds them by his right hand when they are fallen, and raises them up again; and bears them up under all their exercises, so that they are not utterly cast down and destroyed, <a href="/psalms/37-24.htm">Psalm 37:24</a>; <p>and raiseth up all those that be bowed down: with a body of sin, under which they groan, being burdened, and which presses them sore; with Satan's temptations, like the woman in the Gospel, bound together by him; and with various troubles and afflictions; but the Lord raises and bears them up under all, and comforts and refreshes them. <p>(g)  "emnes cadentes", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/145.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD upholdeth all that <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> fall, and raiseth up all <i>those that be</i> bowed down.</span><p>(h) Who being in misery and affliction would faint and fall away if God did not uphold them, and therefore they should revere him who reigns in heaven and suffer themselves to be governed by him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/145.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">all that fall</span>] Or, <span class="ital">all that are falling</span>.

Instead of &#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491; the expression here, however, is &#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; (Ker&#1502;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29</a>, with Makkeph &#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1500;&#1470;). The real will of God tends towards favour, which gladly giving stoops to give (&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;), and towards compassion, which interests itself on behalf of the sinner for his help and comfort (&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). Wrath is only the background of His nature, which He reluctantly and only after long waiting (&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;) lets loose against those who spurn His great mercy. For His goodness embraces, as <a href="/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a> says, all; His tender mercies are over all His works, they hover over and encompass all His creatures. Therefore, too, all His works praise Him: they are all together loud-speaking witnesses of that sympathetic all-embracing love of His, which excludes no one who does not exclude himself; and His saints, who live in God's love, bless Him (&#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; written as in <a href="/1_kings/18-44.htm">1 Kings 18:44</a>): their mouth overflows with the declaration (&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;) of the glory of the kingdom of this loving God, and in speaking (&#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;) of the sovereign power with which He maintains and extends this kingdom. This confession they make their employ, in order that the knowledge of the mighty acts of God and the glorious majesty of His kingdom may at length become the general possession of mankind. When the poet in <a href="/psalms/145-12.htm">Psalm 145:12</a> sets forth the purpose of the proclamation, he drops the form of address. God's kingdom is a kingdom of all aeons, and His dominion is manifested without exception and continually in all periods or generations (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1512; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-18.htm">Psalm 45:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/9-28.htm">Esther 9:28</a>, a pleonastic strengthening of the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>). It is the eternal circumference of the history of time, but at the same time its eternal substance, which more and more unfolds and achieves itself in the succession of the periods that mark its course. For that all things in heaven and on earth shall be gathered up together (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>) in the all-embracing kingdom of God in His Christ, is the goal of all history, and therefore the substance of history which is working itself out.
