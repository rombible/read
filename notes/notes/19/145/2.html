Especially we should speak of God's wondrous work of redemption, while we declare his greatness. For no deliverance of the Israelites, nor the punishment of sinners, so clearly proclaims the justice of God, as the cross of Christ exhibits it to the enlightened mind. It may be truly said of our Lord Jesus Christ, that his words are words of goodness and grace; his works are works of goodness and grace. He is full of compassion; hence he came into the world to save sinners. When on earth, he showed his compassion both to the bodies and souls of men, by healing the one, and making wise the other. He is of great mercy, a merciful High Priest, through whom God is merciful to sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/145.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Every day will I bless thee ... - Compare <a href="/psalms/92-2.htm">Psalm 92:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>. As we receive blessings from God every day (compare <a href="/lamentations/3-23.htm">Lamentations 3:23</a>), it is proper that we should render to him daily thanks; as God is the same always - "yesterday, today, and forever" - it is proper that he should receive from day to day the tribute of praise; as we are daily dependent on him - one day as much as another - our recognition of that dependence should be daily; and as he will always be unchangeably the same, it will be proper that he should be praised forever and ever. Two things are apparent from this verse:<p>(1) that a truly religious man "will" worship God every day;<p>(2) that it is the fixed purpose of a truly religious man to continue this forever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/145.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 145<p>Ps 145:1-21.

David understood the doctrine of the saints' perseverance, and knew he should not be an apostate and blasphemer of the name of Christ, but a praiser of it as long as he had a being; and that his principal service, and that of all the saints in the other world, will be praise; not praying, nor preaching, nor hearing the word, and attendance on other ordinances, which will be no more, but adoring and magnifying the riches of divine grace, <a href="/psalms/104-34.htm">Psalm 104:34</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/145.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/145.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy Name for ever and ever.</span> An emphatic repetition of the second clause of ver. 1. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/144.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the exception of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/108-1.htm">Psalm 108:1-13</a>, which is composed of two Davidic Elohim-Psalms, the Elohim in <a href="/psalms/144-9.htm">Psalm 144:9</a> of this strophe is the only one in the last two Books of the Psalter, and is therefore a feeble attempt also to reproduce the Davidic Elohimic style.

The fact that David mentions himself by name in his own song comes about in imitation of <a href="/psalms/18-51.htm">Psalm 18:51</a>. From the eminence of thanksgiving the song finally descends again to petition, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7-8</a>, being repeated as a refrain. The petition developes itself afresh out of the attributes of the Being invoked (<a href="/psalms/144-10.htm">Psalm 144:10</a>), and these are a pledge of its fulfilment. For how could the God to whom all victorious kings owe their victory (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>, cf. <a href="/2_kings/5-1.htm">2 Kings 5:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>) possibly suffer His servant David to succumb to the sword of the enemy! &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is the sword that is engaged in the service of evil. </body></html>
