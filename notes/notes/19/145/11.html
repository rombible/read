He satisfies the desire of every living thing, except the unreasonable children of men, who are satisfied with nothing. He does good to all the children of men; his own people in a special manner. Many children of God, who have been ready to fall into sin, to fall into despair, have tasted his goodness in preventing their falls, or recovering them speedily by his graces and comforts. And with respect to all that are heavy laden under the burden of sin, if they come to Christ by faith, he will ease them, he will raise them. He is very ready to hear and answer the prayers of his people. He is present every where; but in a special way he is nigh to them, as he is not to others. He is in their hearts, and dwells there by faith, and they dwell in him. He is nigh to those that call upon him, to help them in all times of need. He will be nigh to them, that they may have what they ask, and find what they seek, if they call upon him in truth and sincerity. And having taught men to love his name and holy ways, he will save them from the destruction of the wicked. May we then love his name, and walk in his ways, while we desire that all flesh should bless his holy name for ever and ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/145.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom - Of thy reign; of the great principles of thy government and laws. They see in that reign evidence that thou art worthy of universal praise. Seeing this, it becomes to them a subject on which they talk or converse (compare <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>) - a subject of interest to their hearts, and "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks." People talk about that which interests them; those things in which they have pleasure; those which they desire to understand; those in which they see difficulties that they would wish to have solved. It is one of the characteristics of the "saints" - of the people of God - that they do talk about God and his kingdom; that the subject is to them a pleasant theme of meditation and conversation; that they have the kind of pleasure in talking about God which other people have in conversing about their farms or their merchandise, their children and friends, the news of the day, politics, literature, or science.<p>And talk of thy power - As put forth in the works of creation; as manifested in the dispensations of thy providence; as evinced in the conversion of sinners; as displayed in carrying thy truth around the world; as exhibited in sustaining fine sufferer, and in giving peace and support to the dying. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/145.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11, 12.

Excellent themes for saintly minds. Those who bless God from their hearts rejoice to see him enthroned, glorified, and magnified in power. No subject is more profitable for humility obedience, hope, and joy than that of the reigning power of the Lord our God. His works praise him, but they cannot crown him: this remains for holy hands and hearts. It is their high pleasure to tell of the glory of his kingdom in its justice, kindness, eternity, and so forth. Kingdoms of earth are glorious for riches, for extent of territory, for victories, for liberty, for commerce, and other matters; but in an true glories the kingdom of Jehovah excels them. We have seen a palace dedicated "to all the glories of France"; but time, eternity, and all space are filled with the glories of God: on these we love to speak. "And talk of thy power." This power supports the kingdom and displays the glory, and we are sure to talk of it when the glory of the divine kingdom is under discussion. God's power to create or to destroy, to bless or to punish, to strengthen or to crush, is matter for frequent rehearsal. All power comes from God. Apart from him the laws of nature would be inoperative. His power is the one source of force - mechanical, vital, mental, spiritual. Beyond the power of God which has been put forth, infinite force lies latent in himself. Who can calculate the reserve forces of the Infinite? How, then, can his kingdom fail? We hear talk of the five great powers, but what are they to the One Great Power? The Lord is "the blessed and only Potentate." Let us accustom ourselves to think more deeply and speak more largely of the' power which ever makes for righteousness and works for mercy.<p><a href="/psalms/145-12.htm">Psalm 145:12</a><p>"To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts." These glorious deeds ought to be known to all mankind; but yet few reckon such knowledge to be an essential part of education. As the State cannot teach these holy histories the people of God must take care to do it themselves. The work must be done for every age, for men have short memories in reference to their God, and the doings of his power. They inscribe the deeds of their heroes upon brass, but the glorious acts of Jehovah are written upon the sand, and the tide of time washes them from present memory; therefore we must repeat the lesson, and yet again repeat it. The saints are the religious instructors of the race; they ought to be not only the historians of the past, but the bards of the present, whose duty it is to keep the sons of men in memory of the great deeds which the Lord did in the days of their fathers and in the old time before them. Note the contrast between the great deeds of God and the puny sons of Adam, who have even degenerated from their father, though he was as nothing compared with his Maker.<p>"And the glorious majesty of his kingdom." What a grand subject! Yet this we are to make known; the publication of it is left to us who bless the Lord. "The glory of the majesty of his reign." What a theme! Jehovah's reign as sovereign Lord of all, his majesty in that dominion, and the glory of that majesty! The threefold subject baffles the most willing mind. How shall we make this known to the sons of men? Let us first labour to know it ourselves, and then let us make it a frequent subject of discourse, so shall men know it from us, the Holy Spirit attending our word.<p><a href="/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a><p>"Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom." His meditation has brought him near to God, and God near to him, he speaks to him in adoration, changing the pronoun from "his" to "thy." He sees the great King, and prostrates himself before him. It is well when our devotion opens the gate of heaven, and enters within the portal to speak with God face to face, as a man speaketh with his friend. The point upon which the Psalmist's mind rests is the eternity of the divine throne, - "thy reign is a reign of all eternities." The Lord's kingdom is without beginning, without break, without bound, and without end. He never abdicates his throne, neither does he call in a second to share his empire. None can overthrow his power, or break away from his rule. Neither this age, nor the age to come, nor ages of ages shall cause his sovereignty to fail. Herein is rest for faith. "The Lord sitteth King for ever." "And thy dominion endureth throughout all generations." Men come and go like shadows on the wall, but God reigneth eternally. We distinguish kings as they succeed each other by calling them first and second; but this King is Jehovah, the First and the Last. Adam in his generation knew his Creator to be King, and the last of his race shall know the same. All haft, Great God! Thou art ever Lord of lords!<p>These three verses are a reverent hymn concerning "the kingdom of God": they will be best appreciated by those who are in that kingdom in the fullest sense, and are most truly loyal to the Lord. It is, according to these verses, a kingdom of glory and power; a kingdom of light which men are to know, and of might which men are to feel; it is full of majesty and eternity; it is the benediction of every generation. We are to speak of it, talk of it, and make it known, and then we are to acknowledge it in the homage directed distinctly to the Lord himself - as in verse thirteen. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/145.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/145.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom,.... That is, the saints who are his special workmanship, in the celebration of his praise; and, while they are blessing him, will take particular notice, and make particular mention of his kingdom, and the glory of it; not only his kingdom of nature and providence, which ruleth over all, angels and men, good and bad; which deserves the notice of the saints, and is matter of great joy unto them, that their King reigns in the world, but also, and rather, his kingdom of grace, in which he rules by his Spirit and grace in the hearts of his people; which is not worldly, but spiritual; is not with outward observation, but lies within the heart, and makes the Lord's people all glorious within; consisting of peace, righteousness, and joy in the Holy Ghost, and is what can never be removed. The church is Christ's kingdom, in which he reigns; and all the subjects of it are kings and priests unto God: here proper laws are made and observed, and officers appointed to explain them, and see them put in execution; glorious ordinances are administered, in which Christ the King is seen in his beauty; and the glorious Gospel, which is his sceptre, is held forth, and by which he rules in the midst of his enemies. More especially this may regard the glorious kingdom of Christ in the latter day; both in his spiritual reign, in which there will be a great display of glory; as a large effusion of the Spirit; much spiritual light and knowledge; great holiness of heart and life; an abundance of peace, temporal and spiritual; great purity of Gospel doctrine, worship, and ordinances: and also in his personal reign; when he will appear glorious, and reign before his ancients gloriously, and his saints will appear with him in glory; the New Jerusalem will have the glory of God upon her; a glory there will be then both upon the bodies and souls of the saints Christ will have with him in that state: <p>and talk of thy power; not only as exerted in creation and providence; but of his power in working out the salvation of men; and in conquering and subduing all the spiritual enemies of his people, sin, Satan, the world, and death; in raising himself from the dead, as he will all his saints by the same power at the last day; in going forth into the Gentile world in the ministry of the word, conquering and to conquer, making it powerful and effectual to the conversion of thousands: and also of his power in heaven and in earth, given him as Mediator; and which he has exercised and does exercise on the behalf of his church, and for its protection and welfare: and especially of the more open display of it in the latter day, when he shall take to himself his great power and reign; then will his saints talk of it with great pleasure and thankfulness; see <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/145.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{f}</span> They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;</span><p>(f) The praise of your glory belongs in all your creatures and though the wicked would obscure the same by their silence, yet the faithful are always mindful of the same.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/145.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">thy power</span>] Thy might, as in <span class="ital"><a href="/psalms/145-4.htm" title="One generation shall praise your works to another, and shall declare your mighty acts.">Psalm 145:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-12.htm" title="To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.">Psalm 145:12</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/145.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/22-28.htm">Psalm 22:28</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>). The "glory" of God's kingdom is such that the faithful are naturally drawn to "speak" of it. "His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion endureth throughout all ages" (ver. 13). "His kingdom <span class="accented">ruleth over all"</span> (<a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>) - heaven and earth, and hell, and all space, and whatever space contains. There is no limit either to its extent or its duration. And its "glory" transcends all. human thought - much more all description. "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard," etc. <span class="cmt_word">And talk of thy power</span>. "Power" is of the essence of kingship, and comes naturally to the front whenever the character of a kingdom is spoken of. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/145.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The strains with which this hymn opens are familiar Psalm-strains. We are reminded of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/30-2.htm">Psalm 30:2</a>, and the likewise alphabetical song of praise and thanksgiving <a href="/psalms/34-2.htm">Psalm 34:2</a>. The plena scriptio &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; in <a href="/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/98-6.htm">Psalm 98:6</a>. The language of address "my God the King," which sounds harsh in comparison with the otherwise usual "my King and my God" (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-4.htm">Psalm 84:4</a>), purposely calls God with unrelated generality, that is to say in the most absolute manner, the King. If the poet is himself a king, the occasion for this appellation of God is all the more natural and the signification all the more pertinent. But even in the mouth of any other person it is significant. Whosoever calls God by such a name acknowledges His royal prerogative, and at the same time does homage to Him and binds himself to allegiance; and it is just this confessory act of exalting Him who in Himself is the absolutely lofty One that is here called &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;. But who can the poet express the purpose of praising God's Name for ever? Because the praise of God is a need of his inmost nature, he has a perfect right to forget his own mortality when engaged upon this devotion to the ever-living King. Clinging adoringly to the Eternal One, he must seem to himself to be eternal; and if there is a practical proof for a life after death, it is just this ardent desire of the soul, wrought of God Himself, after the praise of the God of its life (lit., its origin) which affords it the highest, noblest delight. The idea of the silent Hades, which forces itself forward elsewhere, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>, where the mind of the poet is beclouded by sin, is here entirely removed, inasmuch as here the mind of the poet is the undimmed mirror of the divine glory. Therefore <a href="/psalms/145-2.htm">Psalm 145:2</a> also does not concede the possibility of any interruption of the praise: the poet will daily (<a href="/psalms/68-20.htm">Psalm 68:20</a>) bless God, be they days of prosperity or of sorrow, uninterruptedly in all eternity will he glorify His Name (&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; as in <a href="/psalms/69-31.htm">Psalm 69:31</a>). There is no worthier and more exhaustless object of praise (<a href="/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>): Jahve is great, and greatly to be praised (&#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/96-4.htm">Psalm 96:4</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>), and of His "greatness" (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a>, where this attribute precedes all others) there is no searching out, i.e., it is so abysmally deep that no searching can reach its bottom (as in <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>; <a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>.). It has, however, been revealed, and is being revealed continually, and is for this very reason thus celebrated in <a href="/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a> : one generation propagates to the next the growing praise of the works that He has wrought out (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;), and men are able to relate all manner of proofs of His victorious power which prevails over everything, and makes everything subject to itself (&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, and frequently). This historically manifest and traditional divine doxa and the facts (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; as in <a href="/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>) of the divine wonders the poet will devoutly consider. &#1492;&#1491;&#1512; stands in attributive relation to &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, as this on its part does to &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1498;. Thy brilliantly gloriously (kingly) majesty (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>). The poet does not say &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, nor may we insert it, either here in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>, or in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/145-6.htm">Psalm 145:6</a>, where the same sequence of thoughts recurs, more briefly expressed. The emphasis lies on the objects. The mightiness (&#1506;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4</a>, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>, where it signifies violence) of His terrible acts shall pass from mouth to mouth (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; with a substantival object as in <a href="/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a>), and His mighty acts (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, magnalia, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-19.htm">1 Chronicles 17:19</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>) - according to the Ker (which is determined by the suffix of &#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;; cf. however, <a href="/2_samuel/22-23.htm">2 Samuel 22:23</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-3.htm">2 Kings 3:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26</a>, and frequently): His greatness (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;) - will he also on his part make the matter of his narrating. It is, however, not alone the awe-inspiring majesty of God which is revealed in history, but also the greatness (&#1512;&#1489; used as a substantive as in <a href="/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a>, whereas &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-51.htm">Psalm 89:51</a> is an adjective placed before the noun after the manner of a numeral), i.e., the abundant measure, of His goodness and His righteousness, i.e., His acting in inviolable correspondence with His counsel and order of salvation. The memory of the transcendent goodness of God is the object of universal, overflowing acknowledgement and the righteousness of God is the object of universal exultation (&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1503; with the accusative as in <a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-17.htm">Psalm 59:17</a>). After the poet has sung the glorious self-attestation of God according to both its sides, the fiery and the light sides, he lingers by the light side, the front side of the Name of Jahve unfolded in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>. </body></html>
