He satisfies the desire of every living thing, except the unreasonable children of men, who are satisfied with nothing. He does good to all the children of men; his own people in a special manner. Many children of God, who have been ready to fall into sin, to fall into despair, have tasted his goodness in preventing their falls, or recovering them speedily by his graces and comforts. And with respect to all that are heavy laden under the burden of sin, if they come to Christ by faith, he will ease them, he will raise them. He is very ready to hear and answer the prayers of his people. He is present every where; but in a special way he is nigh to them, as he is not to others. He is in their hearts, and dwells there by faith, and they dwell in him. He is nigh to those that call upon him, to help them in all times of need. He will be nigh to them, that they may have what they ask, and find what they seek, if they call upon him in truth and sincerity. And having taught men to love his name and holy ways, he will save them from the destruction of the wicked. May we then love his name, and walk in his ways, while we desire that all flesh should bless his holy name for ever and ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/145.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him - There is a sense in which he is "nigh" to all, for he is everywhere present; but there is a special sense in which he seems to be near to us; in which he manifests himself to us; in which he gives us evidence of his presence. It is in prayer, in praise, in his ordinances - in his gracious interpositions in our behalf - in the peace and joy which we have in communion with him. Compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a> : "The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart."<p>To all that call upon him in truth - In sincerity; not hypocritically; worshipping him as the true God, and with a sincere desire to obtain his favor. Compare the notes at <a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>. We can have no hope that God will hear us unless we are sincere in our worship.

Instead of &#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491; the expression here, however, is &#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; (Ker&#1502;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29</a>, with Makkeph &#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1500;&#1470;). The real will of God tends towards favour, which gladly giving stoops to give (&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;), and towards compassion, which interests itself on behalf of the sinner for his help and comfort (&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). Wrath is only the background of His nature, which He reluctantly and only after long waiting (&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;) lets loose against those who spurn His great mercy. For His goodness embraces, as <a href="/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a> says, all; His tender mercies are over all His works, they hover over and encompass all His creatures. Therefore, too, all His works praise Him: they are all together loud-speaking witnesses of that sympathetic all-embracing love of His, which excludes no one who does not exclude himself; and His saints, who live in God's love, bless Him (&#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; written as in <a href="/1_kings/18-44.htm">1 Kings 18:44</a>): their mouth overflows with the declaration (&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;) of the glory of the kingdom of this loving God, and in speaking (&#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;) of the sovereign power with which He maintains and extends this kingdom. This confession they make their employ, in order that the knowledge of the mighty acts of God and the glorious majesty of His kingdom may at length become the general possession of mankind. When the poet in <a href="/psalms/145-12.htm">Psalm 145:12</a> sets forth the purpose of the proclamation, he drops the form of address. God's kingdom is a kingdom of all aeons, and His dominion is manifested without exception and continually in all periods or generations (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1512; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-18.htm">Psalm 45:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/9-28.htm">Esther 9:28</a>, a pleonastic strengthening of the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>). It is the eternal circumference of the history of time, but at the same time its eternal substance, which more and more unfolds and achieves itself in the succession of the periods that mark its course. For that all things in heaven and on earth shall be gathered up together (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>) in the all-embracing kingdom of God in His Christ, is the goal of all history, and therefore the substance of history which is working itself out. With <a href="/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a> (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-33.htm">Daniel 3:33</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-31.htm">Daniel 4:31</a>, according to Hitzig the primary passages) another paragraph is brought to a close. </body></html>
