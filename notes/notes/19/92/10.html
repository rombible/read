Let us seek for ourselves the salvation and grace of the gospel, that being daily anointed by the Holy Spirit, we may behold and share the Redeemer's glory. It is from his grace, by his word and Spirit, that believers receive all the virtue that keeps them alive, and makes them fruitful. Other trees, when old, leave off bearing, but in God's trees the strength of grace does not fail with the strength of nature. The last days of the saints are sometimes their best days, and their last work their best work: perseverance is sure evidence of sincerity. And may every sabbath, while it shows forth the Divine faithfulness, find our souls resting more and more upon the Lord our righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/92.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But my horn shalt thou exalt - The horn is a symbol of strength or power (see the notes at <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>); and the meaning here is, that, while the wicked would be cut off, he would be prospered; that is, he had such confidence that he was the friend of God, that he believed God would honor him and exalt him. The psalmist here speaks of himself not so much with reference to his own particular case, but as the representative of the righteous. The idea is, that God will thus exalt "a righteous man."<p>Like the horn of an unicorn - Supposed to be remarkable for the strength of its horn. On the animal here referred to, see the notes at <a href="/job/39-9.htm">Job 39:9</a>; compare <a href="/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>.<p>I shall be anointed with fresh oil - Oil pure and sweet; not old and rancid. That is, he would be made happy, cheerful, bright, and prosperous. Anointing with oil in the East was the symbol of all this, or was equivalent to what we mean by putting on festive apparel - holiday apparel. Compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/92.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. horn &#8230; exalt&#8212;is to increase power (Ps 75:5).<p>anointed &#8230; fresh&#8212;or, "new"<p>oil&#8212;(Ps 23:5) a figure for refreshment (compare Lu 7:46). Such use of oil is still common in the East.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/92.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn, I shall be anointed with fresh oil.<p>11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.<p><a href="/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a><p>"But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn." The believer rejoices that he shall not be suffered to perish, but shall be strengthened and enabled to triumph over his enemies, by the divine aid. The unicorn may have been some gigantic ox or buffalo now unknown, and perhaps extinct - among the ancients it was the favourite symbol of unconquerable power; the Psalmist adopts it as his emblem. Faith takes delight in foreseeing the mercy of the Lord, and sings of what he will do as well as of what he has done. "I shall be anointed with fresh oil." Strengthening shall be attended with refreshment and honour. As guests were anointed at feasts with perfumed unguents, so shall the saints be cheered and delighted by fresh outpourings of divine grace; and for this reason they shall not pass away like the wicked. Observe the contrast between the happiness of the brutish people and the joy of the righteous, the brutish men grow with a sort of vegetable vigour of their own, but the righteous are dealt with by the Lord himself, and all the good which they receive comes directly from his own right hand, and so is doubly precious in their esteem. The Psalmist speaks in the first person, and it should be a matter of prayer with the reader that he may be enabled to do the same.<p><a href="/psalms/92-11.htm">Psalm 92:11</a><p>"Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies." The words, "my desire," inserted by the translators, had far better have been left out. He does not say what he should see concerning his enemies, he leaves that blank, and we have no right to fill in the vacant space with words which look vindictive. He would see that which would be for God's glory, and that which would be eminently right and just. "And mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me." Here, again, the words "my desire" are not inspired, and are a needless and perhaps a false interpolation. The good man is quite silent as to what he expected to hear; he knew that what he should hear would vindicate his faith in his God, and he was content to leave his cruel foes in God's hands, without an expression concerning his own desire one way or the other. It is always best to leave Scripture as we find it. The broken sense of inspiration is better let alone than pieced out with additions of a translator's own invention; it is like repairing pure gold with tinsel, or a mosaic of gems with painted wood. The holy Psalmist had seen the beginning of the ungodly, and expected to see their end; he felt sure that God would right all wrongs, and clear his Providence from the charge of favouring the unjust; this confidence he here expresses, and sits down contentedly to wait the issues of the future. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/92.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> But as for me and other righteous persons, (of whom he saith the same thing <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/92-12.htm" title="The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.">Psalm 92:12</a></span>) we shall be advanced to the height of honour, and true and lasting felicity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unicorn; </span> of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm" title="His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.">Deu 33:17</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I shall be anointed; </span> I shall have great cause of rejoicing and testifying my joy by anointing myself, as the manner was in feasts and all joyful solemnities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Fresh oil; </span> sweet and uncorrupted. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/92.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But my horn shall thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn,....

The metaphor is derived from animals tossing their heads in the consciousness of vigour. God has restored to Israel a buoyant sense of life and power to repel its enemies.

To be able to rejoice over the revelation of God in creation and the revelation of God in general is a gift from above, which the poet thankfully confesses that he has received. The Vulgate begins <a href="/psalms/92-5.htm">Psalm 92:5</a> Quia delectasti me, and Dante in his Purgatorio, xxviii. 80, accordingly calls the Psalm il Salmo Delectasti; a smiling female form, which represents the life of Paradise, says, as she gathers flowers, she is so happy because, with the Psalm Delectasti, she takes a delight in the glory of God's works. The works of God are transcendently great; very deep are His thoughts, which mould human history and themselves gain from in it (cf. <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17</a>., where infinite fulness is ascribed to them, and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8</a>, where infinite height is ascribed to them). Man can neither measure the greatness of the divine works nor fathom the depth of the divine thoughts; he who is enlightened, however, perceives the immeasurableness of the one and the unfathomableness of the other, whilst a &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, a man of animal nature, homo brutus (vid., <a href="/psalms/73-22.htm">Psalm 73:22</a>), does not come to the knowledge (&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, used absolutely as in <a href="/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>), and &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, a blockhead, or one dull in mind, whose carnal nature outweighs his intellectual and spiritual nature, does not discern &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/13-17.htm">2 Samuel 13:17</a>), id ipsum, viz., how unsearchable are God's judgments and untrackable His ways (<a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>). </body></html>
