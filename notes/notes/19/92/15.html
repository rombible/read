Let us seek for ourselves the salvation and grace of the gospel, that being daily anointed by the Holy Spirit, we may behold and share the Redeemer's glory. It is from his grace, by his word and Spirit, that believers receive all the virtue that keeps them alive, and makes them fruitful. Other trees, when old, leave off bearing, but in God's trees the strength of grace does not fail with the strength of nature. The last days of the saints are sometimes their best days, and their last work their best work: perseverance is sure evidence of sincerity. And may every sabbath, while it shows forth the Divine faithfulness, find our souls resting more and more upon the Lord our righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/92.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To shew that the Lord is upright - That is, This will be a proof that God is faithful to his promises; that he is the true friend of his people.

In all respects he is worthy of confidence: "worthy" to be loved, trusted, adored, obeyed, by the inhabitants of all worlds. What a sublime thought is this! What a consolatory truth!

The infinitive construction in <a href="/psalms/92-8.htm">Psalm 92:8</a> is continued in the historic tense, and it may also be rendered as historical. &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; (Saadia: Arab. fa&#770;nnh) is to be supplied in thought before &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1491;&#1501;, as in <a href="/job/27-14.htm">Job 27:14</a>. What is spoken of is an historical occurrence which, in its beginning, course, and end, has been frequently repeated even down to the present day, and ever confirmed afresh. And thus, too, in time to come and once finally shall the ungodly succumb to a peremptory, decisive (&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1491;) judgment of destruction. Jahve is &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501;, by His nature and by His rule He is "a height for ever;" i.e., in relation to the creature and all that goes on here below He has a nature beyond and above all this (Jenseitigkeit), ever the same and absolute; He is absolutely inaccessible to the God-opposed one here below who vaunts himself in stupid pride and rebelliously exalts himself as a titan, and only suffers it to last until the term of his barren blossoming is run out. Thus the present course of history will and must in fact end in a final victory of good over evil: for lo Thine enemies, Jahve - for lo Thine enemies.... &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; points as it were with the finger to the inevitable end; and the emotional anadiplosis breathes forth a zealous love for the cause of God as if it were his own. God's enemies shall perish, all the workers of evil shall be disjointed, scattered, &#1497;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <a href="/job/4-11.htm">Job 4:11</a>). Now they form a compact mass, which shall however fall to pieces, when one day the intermingling of good and evil has an end. </body></html>
