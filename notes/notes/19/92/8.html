Let us seek for ourselves the salvation and grace of the gospel, that being daily anointed by the Holy Spirit, we may behold and share the Redeemer's glory. It is from his grace, by his word and Spirit, that believers receive all the virtue that keeps them alive, and makes them fruitful. Other trees, when old, leave off bearing, but in God's trees the strength of grace does not fail with the strength of nature. The last days of the saints are sometimes their best days, and their last work their best work: perseverance is sure evidence of sincerity. And may every sabbath, while it shows forth the Divine faithfulness, find our souls resting more and more upon the Lord our righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/92.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But thou, Lord, art most high for evermore - In the treatment of the righteous and the wicked, thou wilt maintain thine own exalted place as a sovereign.

So this verse gives a reason of the former, as well the first branch of it, why God suffers the wicked to flourish so long, because he is not like man, of short and uncertain continuance here, to whom a little time is long and tedious, who therefore impatiently expects the time of vengeance, and fears lest the offender should escape it; whereas God is unchangeable and everlasting, and therefore long-suffering without any inconvenience, and the longest time of the prosperity of the wicked is but short and inconsiderable in his eyes, <span class="ital">a thousand years being in his sight but as yesterday when it is past</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/90-4.htm" title="For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.">Psalm 90:4</a></span>, and they can never escape out of his hands; as also of the latter branch of the verse, why the wicked shall be destroyed for ever, because God lives and reigns for ever to execute that just sentence of everlasting punishment which he hath pronounced against them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/92.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But thou, Lord, art most high for evermore,....

It is good, i.e., not merely good in the eyes of God, but also good for man, beneficial to the heart, pleasant and blessed.
