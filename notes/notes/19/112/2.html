Their fear is not that which love casts out, but that which love brings in. It follows and flows from love. It is a fear to offend. This is both fear and trust. The heart touched by the Spirit of God, as the needle touched with the loadstone, turns direct and speedily to God, yet still with trembling, being filled with this holy fear. Blessings are laid up for the faithful and their children's children; and true riches are bestowed on them, with as much of this world's possessions as is profitable for them. In the darkest hours of affliction and trial, the light of hope and peace will spring up within them, and seasonable relief shall turn mourning into joy. From their Lord's example they learn to be kind and full of compassion, as well as just in all their dealings; they use discretion, that they may be liberal in that manner which appears most likely to do good. Envy and slander may for a time hide their true characters here, but they shall be had in everlasting remembrance. They need not fear evil tidings. A good man shall have a settled spirit. And it is the endeavour of true believers to keep their minds stayed upon God, and so to keep them calm and undisturbed; and God has promised them both cause to do so, and grace to do so. Trusting in the Lord is the best and surest way of establishing the heart. The heart of man cannot fix any where with satisfaction, but in the truth of God, and there it finds firm footing. And those whose hearts are established by faith, will patiently wait till they gain their point. Compare all this with the vexation of sinners. The happiness of the saints is the envy of the wicked. The desire of the wicked shall perish; their desire was wholly to the world and the flesh, therefore when these perish, their joy is gone. But the blessings of the gospel are spiritual and eternal, and are conferred upon the members of the Christian church, through Christ their Head, who is the Pattern of all righteousness, and the Giver of all grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/112.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His seed shall be mighty upon earth - His children; his posterity. That is, they shall be prospered; honored; distinguished among people: distinguished for their virtues, for their influence, for their success in life. This refers to what was regarded among the Hebrews as an object of great desire, and is in accordance with the promises everywhere found in their Scriptures. See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/25-13.htm">Psalm 25:13</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25-26</a>, notes.

It is in accordance, also, with a general fact in the course of events. The best security for the virtue and success of children is the virtue and the piety of parents; the surest inheritance as pertaining to happiness, respectability, and usefulness in life, is that which is derived from the example, the prayers, the counsel of a pious father and mother.<p>The generation of the upright shall be blessed - The family; the children. Such promises are to be expected to be fulfilled in general; it is not required by any proper rules of interpreting language that this should be universally and always true. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/112.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2, 3.

The true seed of the righteous are those who follow them in their virtues, even as believers are the seed of Abraham, because they imitate his faith; and these are the real heroes of their era, the truly great men among the sons of Adam; their lives are sublime, and their power upon their age is far greater than at first sight appears. If the promise must be regarded as alluding to natural seed, it must be understood as a general statement rather than a promise made to every individual, for the children of the godly are not all prosperous, nor all famous. Nevertheless, he who fears God, and leads a holy life, is, as a rule, doing the best he can for the future advancement of his house; no inheritance is equal to that of an unblemished name, no legacy can excel the benediction of a saint; and, taking matters for all in all, the children of the righteous man commence life with greater advantages than others, and are more likely to succeed in it, in the best and highest sense. "The generation of the upright shall be blessed." The race of sincere, devout, righteous men, is kept up from age to age, and ever abides under the blessing of God. The godly may be persecuted, but they shall not be forsaken; the curses of men cannot deprive them of the blessing of God, for the words of Balaam are true, "He hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it." Their children also are under the special care of heaven, and as a rule it shall be found that they inherit the divine blessing. Honesty and integrity are better corner-stones for an honourable house than mere cunning and avarice, or even talent and push. To fear God and to walk uprightly is a higher nobility than blood or birth can bestow.<p><a href="/psalms/112-3.htm">Psalm 112:3</a><p>"Wealth and riches shall be in his house." Understood literally this is rather a promise of the old covenant than of the new, for many of the best of the people of God are very poor; yet it has been found true that uprightness is the road to success, and, all other things being equal, the honest man is the rising man. Many are kept poor through knavery and profligacy; but godliness hath the promise of the life that now is. If we understand the passage spiritually it is abundantly true. What wealth can equal that of the love of God? What riches can rival a contented heart? It matters nothing that the roof is thatched, and the floor is of cold stone: the heart which is cheered with the favour of heaven is "rich to all the intents of bliss." "And his righteousness endureth for ever." Often when gold comes in the gospel goes out; but it is not so with the blessed man. Prosperity does not destroy the holiness of his life, or the humility of his heart. His character stands the test of examination, overcomes the temptations of wealth, survives the assaults of slander, outlives the afflictions of time, and endures the trial of the last great day. The righteousness of a true saint endureth for ever, because it springs from the same root as the righteousness of God, and is, indeed, the reflection of it. So long as the Lord abideth righteous he will maintain by his grace the righteousness of his people. They shall hold on their way, and wax stronger and stronger. There is also another righteousness which belongs to the Lord's chosen, which is sure to endure for ever, namely, the imputed righteousness of the Lord Jesus, which is called "everlasting righteousness," belonging as it does to the Son of God himself, who is "the Lord our righteousness."<p><a href="/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a><p>"Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness." He does not lean to injustice in order to ease himself, but like a pillar stands erect, and he shall be found so standing when the ungodly, who are as a bowing wall and a tottering fence, shall lie in ruins. He will have his days of darkness, he may be sick and sorry, poor and pining, as well as others; his former riches may take to themselves wings and fly away, while even his righteousness may be cruelly suspected; thus the clouds may lower around him, but his gloom shall not last for ever, the Lord will bring him light in due season, for as surely as a good man's sun goes down it shall rise again. If the darkness be caused by depression of spirit, the Holy Ghost will comfort him; if by pecuniary loss or personal bereavement, the presence of Christ shall be his solace; and if by the cruelty and malignity of men, the sympathy of his Lord shall be his support. It is as ordinary for the righteous to be comforted as for the day to dawn. Wait for the light and it will surely come; for even if our heavenly Father should in our last hours put us to bed in the dark, we shall find it morning when we awake. "He is gracious, and lull of compassion, and righteous." This is spoken of God in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4</a>, and now the same words are used of his servant: thus we are taught that when God makes a man upright, he makes him like himself. We are at best but humble copies of the great original; still we are copies, and because we are so we praise the Lord, who hath created us anew in Christ Jesus. The upright man is "gracious," that is, full of kindness to all around him; he is not sour and churlish, but he is courteous to friends, kind to the needy, forgiving to the erring, and earnest for the good of all. He is also "full of compassion"; that is to say, he tenderly feels for others, pities them, and as far as he can assists them in their time of trouble. He does not need to be driven to benevolence, he is brimful of humanity; it is his joy to sympathize with the sorrowing. He is also said to be "righteous": in all his transactions with his fellow men he obeys the dictates of right, and none can say that he goes beyond or defrauds his neighbour. His justice is, however, tempered with compassion, and seasoned with graciousness. Such men are to be found in our churches, and they are by no means so rare as the censorious imagine; but at the same time they are far scarcer than the breadth of profession might lead us to hope. Lord, make us all to possess these admirable qualities.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/112.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The generation, </span> i.e. the posterity, as this word is oft used, as <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/23-43.htm" title="That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 23:43</a> <a href="/numbers/9-10.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover to the LORD.">Numbers 9:10</a></span>, &c., called <span class="ital">his seed</span> in the former branch. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/112.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>His seed shall be mighty upon earth,....

We are led to the right meaning by &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1493; in <a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a> in comparison with <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, where &#1495;&#1508;&#1509; signifies God's purpose in accordance with His counsel: constantly searched into, and therefore a worthy object of research (&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, root &#1491;&#1512;, to seek to know by rubbing, and in general experimentally, cf.

The deed of redemption which it relates has a power that continues in operation; for to the church of Jahve is assigned the victory not only over the peoples of Canaan, but over the whole world. The power of Jahve's deeds, which He has made known to His people, and which they tell over again among themselves, aims at giving them the inheritance of the peoples. The works of His hands are truth and right, for they are the realization of that which is true and which lasts and verifies itself, and of that which is right, that triumphantly maintains its ground.

If we have understood <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4-6</a> correctly, then &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; glances back at the deliverance out of Egypt. Upon this followed the ratification of the covenant on Sinai, which still remains inviolable down to the present time of the poet, and has the holiness and terribleness of the divine Name for a guarantee of its inviolability. The fear of Jahve, this holy and terrible God, is the beginning of wisdom - the motto of the Chokma in Job (<a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>) and Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), the Books of the Chokma. <a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a> goes on in this Proverbs-like strain: the fear of God, which manifests itself in obedience, is to those who practise them (the divine precepts, &#1508;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;) &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; (<a href="/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-4.htm">Proverbs 3:4</a>, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>), a fine sagacity, praiseworthy discernment - such a (dutiful) one partakes of everlasting praise. It is true, in glancing back to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-3.htm">Psalm 111:3</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; seems to refer to God, but a glance forward to <a href="/psalms/112-3.htm">Psalm 112:3</a> shows that the praise of him who fears God is meant. The old observation therefore holds good: ubi haec ode desinit, sequens incipit (Bakius). </body></html>
