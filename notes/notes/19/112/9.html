Their fear is not that which love casts out, but that which love brings in. It follows and flows from love. It is a fear to offend. This is both fear and trust. The heart touched by the Spirit of God, as the needle touched with the loadstone, turns direct and speedily to God, yet still with trembling, being filled with this holy fear. Blessings are laid up for the faithful and their children's children; and true riches are bestowed on them, with as much of this world's possessions as is profitable for them. In the darkest hours of affliction and trial, the light of hope and peace will spring up within them, and seasonable relief shall turn mourning into joy. From their Lord's example they learn to be kind and full of compassion, as well as just in all their dealings; they use discretion, that they may be liberal in that manner which appears most likely to do good. Envy and slander may for a time hide their true characters here, but they shall be had in everlasting remembrance. They need not fear evil tidings. A good man shall have a settled spirit. And it is the endeavour of true believers to keep their minds stayed upon God, and so to keep them calm and undisturbed; and God has promised them both cause to do so, and grace to do so. Trusting in the Lord is the best and surest way of establishing the heart. The heart of man cannot fix any where with satisfaction, but in the truth of God, and there it finds firm footing. And those whose hearts are established by faith, will patiently wait till they gain their point. Compare all this with the vexation of sinners. The happiness of the saints is the envy of the wicked. The desire of the wicked shall perish; their desire was wholly to the world and the flesh, therefore when these perish, their joy is gone. But the blessings of the gospel are spiritual and eternal, and are conferred upon the members of the Christian church, through Christ their Head, who is the Pattern of all righteousness, and the Giver of all grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/112.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He hath dispersed ... - This is another characteristic of a righteous man, and another reason of the permanent honor which will be rendered to him. The meaning is, that he is liberal; he freely scatters what he has; he divides it with those who are needy and unfortunate. One part of mankind have an overplus - have more than they need for themselves and their families - and that overplus is what is designed to meet the needs of the unfortunate, the weak, the aged, the imbecile, the infirm, who have "not" enough. It is the "treasury" of God - the "reservoir" where that is gathered which is to be distributed for the needs of the helpless and the dependent. The righteous man is one who enters fully into this arrangement, and who feels that all this overplus belongs to God, and is to be appropriated as he shall direct.<p>His righteousness endureth for ever - His acts of charity are constant. His piety is not fitful, spasmodic, uncertain; it is steady principle; it is firm and solid; it may always be relied on.

Psa 112:1 here also sets forth the theme of that which follows. What is there said in <a href="/psalms/112-3.htm">Psalm 112:3</a> concerning the righteousness of God, <a href="/psalms/112-3.htm">Psalm 112:3</a> here says of the righteousness of him who fears God: this also standeth fast for ever, it is indeed the copy of the divine, it is the work and gift of God (<a href="/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a>), inasmuch as God's salutary action and behaviour, laid hold of in faith, works a like form of action and behaviour to it in man, which, as <a href="/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a> says, is, according to its nature, love. The promise in <a href="/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a> sounds like <a href="/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a>. Hengstenberg renders: "There ariseth in the darkness light to the upright who is gracious and compassionate and just." But this is impossible as a matter of style. The three adjectives (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4</a>, pointing back to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/145-8.htm">Psalm 145:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/116-5.htm">Psalm 116:5</a>) are a mention of God according to His attributes. &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; and &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; never take the article in Biblical Hebrew, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; follows their examples here (cf. on the contrary, <a href="/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>). God Himself is the light which arises in darkness for those who are sincere in their dealings with Him; He is the Sun of righteousness with wings of rays dispensing "grace" and "tender mercies," <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>. The fact that He arises for those who are compassionate as He is compassionate, is evident from <a href="/psalms/112-5.htm">Psalm 112:5</a>. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; being, as in <a href="/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>, intended of well-being, prosperity, &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is here equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which is rendered &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488; in Targumic phrase. &#1495;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; signifies, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-26.htm">Psalm 37:26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-21.htm">Psalm 37:21</a>, one who charitably dispenses his gifts around. <a href="/psalms/112-5.htm">Psalm 112:5</a> is not an extension of the picture of virtue, but, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/127-5.htm">Psalm 127:5</a>, a promissory prospect: he will uphold in integrity (&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-2.htm">Psalm 72:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, and frequently), or rather ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;) in the cause (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>, and frequently), the things which depend upon him, or with which he has to do; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, sustinere, signifies to sustain, i.e., to nourish, to sustain, i.e., endure, and also to support, maintain, i.e., carry through.
