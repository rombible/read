Their fear is not that which love casts out, but that which love brings in. It follows and flows from love. It is a fear to offend. This is both fear and trust. The heart touched by the Spirit of God, as the needle touched with the loadstone, turns direct and speedily to God, yet still with trembling, being filled with this holy fear. Blessings are laid up for the faithful and their children's children; and true riches are bestowed on them, with as much of this world's possessions as is profitable for them. In the darkest hours of affliction and trial, the light of hope and peace will spring up within them, and seasonable relief shall turn mourning into joy. From their Lord's example they learn to be kind and full of compassion, as well as just in all their dealings; they use discretion, that they may be liberal in that manner which appears most likely to do good. Envy and slander may for a time hide their true characters here, but they shall be had in everlasting remembrance. They need not fear evil tidings. A good man shall have a settled spirit. And it is the endeavour of true believers to keep their minds stayed upon God, and so to keep them calm and undisturbed; and God has promised them both cause to do so, and grace to do so. Trusting in the Lord is the best and surest way of establishing the heart. The heart of man cannot fix any where with satisfaction, but in the truth of God, and there it finds firm footing. And those whose hearts are established by faith, will patiently wait till they gain their point. Compare all this with the vexation of sinners. The happiness of the saints is the envy of the wicked. The desire of the wicked shall perish; their desire was wholly to the world and the flesh, therefore when these perish, their joy is gone. But the blessings of the gospel are spiritual and eternal, and are conferred upon the members of the Christian church, through Christ their Head, who is the Pattern of all righteousness, and the Giver of all grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/112.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall not be afraid of evil tidings - Of bad news; of reverses and losses; of the destruction of his ship at sea, or his property by land; of disaster by flood, by famine, by war. His heart will so fully confide in God that he can commit all calmly into his hands. He will feel assured that all will be well; that nothing occurs but that which the wisest and the best Being in the universe sees it best should occur; and that in all which "does" take place he is able to sustain the sufferer. There is nothing so well suited to make the mind calm as trust in God. What has a man to be afraid of who does trust in him? Compare <a href="/psalms/27-3.htm">Psalm 27:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3-4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-6.htm">Hebrews 13:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/1-33.htm">Proverbs 1:33</a>.<p>His heart is fixed - Is firm; is established.

Either respecting things temporal; the death of friends, loss of substance, public calamities, wars and rumours of wars, commotions, confusions, convulsions, and revolutions in states, kingdoms, and nations, <a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a> or things spiritual; such as are brought to him by Satan; that he is an hypocrite, and the root of the matter is not in him; for he knows him to be a liar, and the father of lies; or by his own unbelieving heart: or what will befall the churches of Christ, and the interest of religion, in the latter day; as that the outward court shall be given to the Gentiles; that the witnesses shall be slain, and an hour of temptation shall come upon all the earth; and such a time of tribulation as has not yet been; for he knows that the saints, will be kept in it, and carried through it, and glorious times will follow. Or, "he shall not be afraid of an evil hearing" (p); of an ill report raised of himself; for he knows he must go through good report and bad report; and especially when it is a false one, and for the sake of truth and righteousness, it gives him no uneasiness: nor is he afraid of hearing the report of the law, which in some sense may be called an evil hearing or report, in opposition to the hearing of faith, or the good report of the Gospel; he is not afraid of it, when it curses, those that are under it, seeing he is redeemed by Christ from the curse of it; and therefore is not afraid of its menaces and threatenings, its curse and condemnation: nor is a good man afraid of or terrified at the tidings of death; nor will he be dismayed when the last trumpet sounds, and the dead are raised; when the heavens shall melt away with a great noise; when all shall be summoned to the judgment seat, and the wicked will hear, "Go ye cursed", he will be under no fears of hearing such a sentence. <p>His heart is fixed; on the love of God, and is rooted and grounded in it; and is firmly persuaded of his interest in it, and that nothing can separate him from it: it is fixed on Christ the foundation; his faith is fixed and settled in him, and so are his affections; and nothing can separate from his love to him, <a href="/romans/8-35.htm">Romans 8:35</a>. Or his heart is prepared (q); to meet the Lord in the way of his judgments: he expects tidings of evil things, and that he shall receive evil things, as well as good, at the hands of the Lord; and therefore is not afraid of them, or surprised at them when they come; as well as his heart is prepared by the Lord to serve him, and is ready to every good work. <p>Trusting in the Lord; in his covenant God and Father, who will never leave him nor forsake him; in his grace, which is sufficient for him in the worst of times; and who will supply all his wants: in his strength, to enable him to do his duty; to bear up under trials and exercises, and to do and suffer his will and pleasure; and in his power, to protect and preserve him, and keep him unto salvation; and in his faithfulness, to perform his promises, trusting in him for things temporal, spiritual, and eternal. The Targum is, <p>"trusting in the Word of the Lord;'' <p>in Christ, the essential Word; looking to him as the author and finisher of faith; leaning upon him, laying the whole stress of his salvation on him; trusting in his person for acceptance, in his righteousness for justification, in his blood for pardon and cleansing, in his sacrifice for atonement, in his fulness for supply, and in his strength and power for assistance and protection; all which give him peace, and secure him from fear of evil tidings; see <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>. <p>(p)  "ab auditione mala", V.

God Himself is the light which arises in darkness for those who are sincere in their dealings with Him; He is the Sun of righteousness with wings of rays dispensing "grace" and "tender mercies," <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>. The fact that He arises for those who are compassionate as He is compassionate, is evident from <a href="/psalms/112-5.htm">Psalm 112:5</a>. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; being, as in <a href="/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>, intended of well-being, prosperity, &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is here equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which is rendered &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488; in Targumic phrase. &#1495;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; signifies, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-26.htm">Psalm 37:26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-21.htm">Psalm 37:21</a>, one who charitably dispenses his gifts around. <a href="/psalms/112-5.htm">Psalm 112:5</a> is not an extension of the picture of virtue, but, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/127-5.htm">Psalm 127:5</a>, a promissory prospect: he will uphold in integrity (&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-2.htm">Psalm 72:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, and frequently), or rather ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;) in the cause (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>, and frequently), the things which depend upon him, or with which he has to do; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, sustinere, signifies to sustain, i.e., to nourish, to sustain, i.e., endure, and also to support, maintain, i.e., carry through.
