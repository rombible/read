Their fear is not that which love casts out, but that which love brings in. It follows and flows from love. It is a fear to offend. This is both fear and trust. The heart touched by the Spirit of God, as the needle touched with the loadstone, turns direct and speedily to God, yet still with trembling, being filled with this holy fear. Blessings are laid up for the faithful and their children's children; and true riches are bestowed on them, with as much of this world's possessions as is profitable for them. In the darkest hours of affliction and trial, the light of hope and peace will spring up within them, and seasonable relief shall turn mourning into joy. From their Lord's example they learn to be kind and full of compassion, as well as just in all their dealings; they use discretion, that they may be liberal in that manner which appears most likely to do good. Envy and slander may for a time hide their true characters here, but they shall be had in everlasting remembrance. They need not fear evil tidings. A good man shall have a settled spirit. And it is the endeavour of true believers to keep their minds stayed upon God, and so to keep them calm and undisturbed; and God has promised them both cause to do so, and grace to do so. Trusting in the Lord is the best and surest way of establishing the heart. The heart of man cannot fix any where with satisfaction, but in the truth of God, and there it finds firm footing. And those whose hearts are established by faith, will patiently wait till they gain their point. Compare all this with the vexation of sinners. The happiness of the saints is the envy of the wicked. The desire of the wicked shall perish; their desire was wholly to the world and the flesh, therefore when these perish, their joy is gone. But the blessings of the gospel are spiritual and eternal, and are conferred upon the members of the Christian church, through Christ their Head, who is the Pattern of all righteousness, and the Giver of all grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/112.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto the upright - The just; the pious; the man who fears God.<p>There ariseth light in the darkness - This is a new form of the blessing which follows the fear of the Lord, or another of the benefits which spring from true religion, and by which the pious man is distinguished from other people. The distinction is not that days of darkness will not come upon him as well as upon others, for he may be sick as others are, he may be bereaved as others are, he may lose his property as others do - since there are general laws that affect mankind in these respects. God has not promised that he will interpose to save his people from these things, but that he will save them in them. The peculiarity in regard to those who fear God is, that these things will not always continue; that they shall not be overwhelmed by them; that it will not be uninterrupted and unmitigated gloom; that the sky shall not be always overcast.

It is because his character is "really" pure and holy, so that whatever cloud may come over it for a time, however it may be temporarily obscured, however he may be calumniated by men, or however God may for a time seem to forsake him and to treat him as if he were a bad man, yet ultimately his character will appear as it really is. Light will come in upon the darkness. The clouds will break away. The prejudices against him will be dispersed. Full justice will be done to his character both by man and by God, and the world will see that he is a just and pious man. See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5-6</a>.

Upright ones are sometimes in the darkness of affliction, under divine desertions, without spiritual joy, and in an uncomfortable condition; when on a sudden light arises to them, like break of day, or the morning light: they have deliverance from affliction, and enjoy prosperity; the light of God's countenance is lifted up on them; the sun of righteousness arises upon them with healing in his wings; and spiritual joy and comfort are communicated unto them. It may denote the comforts the people of God have amidst their afflictions and troubles, even while they are in them; and the light they enjoy, while darkness is round about others, like the children of Israel in Egypt: or the suddenness of deliverance from adversity, temporal or spiritual; weeping endures for a night, joy comes in the morning, and at evening time it is light, <a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>. <p>He is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous; that is, the Lord is so. Thus the Arabic version, <p>"the Lord God is merciful and bountiful;'' <p>and the Ethiopic version, <p>"merciful and compassionate is the Lord, and righteous is our King.'' <p>And because God is the God of all grace, and is able to make it abound to his people, and is compassionate to them in distress, and is just and faithful to his promises; therefore he causes light to arise to them in darkness; and which, on such account, they may believe and expect; see <a href="/micah/7-8.htm">Micah 7:8</a>. Some understand this of the upright man and of his character; that he is "gracious", kind, and bountiful; that he is "full of compassion", tenderhearted, and shows mercy to distressed objects; and is righteous, through Christ, and lives soberly and righteously. This sense agrees both with what goes before, and follows after. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/112.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Unto the <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> upright there ariseth light in the darkness: <i>he is</i> gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.</span><p>(c) The faithful in all their adversities know that all will go well with them for God will be merciful and just.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/112.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>.

We are led to the right meaning by &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1493; in <a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a> in comparison with <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, where &#1495;&#1508;&#1509; signifies God's purpose in accordance with His counsel: constantly searched into, and therefore a worthy object of research (&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, root &#1491;&#1512;, to seek to know by rubbing, and in general experimentally, cf. Arab. dra&#770; of knowledge empirically acquired) according to all their aims, i.e., in all phases of that which they have in view. In <a href="/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4</a> &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; points to the festival which propagates the remembrance of the deeds of God in the Mosaic age; &#1496;&#1512;&#1507;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a>, therefore points to the food provided for the Exodus, and to the Passover meal, together with the feast of unleavened bread, this memorial (&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>) of the exemption in faithfulness to the covenant which was experienced in Egypt. This Psalm, says Luther, looks to me as though it had been composed for the festival of Easter. Even from the time of Theodoret and Augustine the thought of the Eucharist has been connected with <a href="/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a> in the New Testament mind; and it is not without good reason that <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1-10</a> has become the Psalm of the church at the celebration of the Lord's Supper. In connection with &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; one is reminded of the Pesach-Haggada. The deed of redemption which it relates has a power that continues in operation; for to the church of Jahve is assigned the victory not only over the peoples of Canaan, but over the whole world. The power of Jahve's deeds, which He has made known to His people, and which they tell over again among themselves, aims at giving them the inheritance of the peoples. The works of His hands are truth and right, for they are the realization of that which is true and which lasts and verifies itself, and of that which is right, that triumphantly maintains its ground. His ordinances are &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (occasionally pointed &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;), established, attested, in themselves and in their results authorizing a firm confidence in their salutariness (cf. <a href="/psalms/19-8.htm">Psalm 19:8</a>). &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, supported, stayed, viz., not outwardly, but in themselves, therefore imperturbable (cf. &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; used of the state of mind, <a href="/psalms/112-8.htm">Psalm 112:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>). &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, moulded, arranged, viz., on the part of God, "in truth, and upright;" &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; is accusative of the predicate (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-37.htm">Psalm 119:37</a>), but without its being clear why it is not pointed &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. If we have understood <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4-6</a> correctly, then &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; glances back at the deliverance out of Egypt. Upon this followed the ratification of the covenant on Sinai, which still remains inviolable down to the present time of the poet, and has the holiness and terribleness of the divine Name for a guarantee of its inviolability. The fear of Jahve, this holy and terrible God, is the beginning of wisdom - the motto of the Chokma in Job (<a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>) and Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), the Books of the Chokma. <a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a> goes on in this Proverbs-like strain: the fear of God, which manifests itself in obedience, is to those who practise them (the divine precepts, &#1508;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;) &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; (<a href="/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-4.htm">Proverbs 3:4</a>, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>), a fine sagacity, praiseworthy discernment - such a (dutiful) one partakes of everlasting praise. It is true, in glancing back to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-3.htm">Psalm 111:3</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; seems to refer to God, but a glance forward to <a href="/psalms/112-3.htm">Psalm 112:3</a> shows that the praise of him who fears God is meant. The old observation therefore holds good: ubi haec ode desinit, sequens incipit (Bakius). </body></html>
