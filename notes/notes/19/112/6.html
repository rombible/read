Their fear is not that which love casts out, but that which love brings in. It follows and flows from love. It is a fear to offend. This is both fear and trust. The heart touched by the Spirit of God, as the needle touched with the loadstone, turns direct and speedily to God, yet still with trembling, being filled with this holy fear. Blessings are laid up for the faithful and their children's children; and true riches are bestowed on them, with as much of this world's possessions as is profitable for them. In the darkest hours of affliction and trial, the light of hope and peace will spring up within them, and seasonable relief shall turn mourning into joy. From their Lord's example they learn to be kind and full of compassion, as well as just in all their dealings; they use discretion, that they may be liberal in that manner which appears most likely to do good. Envy and slander may for a time hide their true characters here, but they shall be had in everlasting remembrance. They need not fear evil tidings. A good man shall have a settled spirit. And it is the endeavour of true believers to keep their minds stayed upon God, and so to keep them calm and undisturbed; and God has promised them both cause to do so, and grace to do so. Trusting in the Lord is the best and surest way of establishing the heart. The heart of man cannot fix any where with satisfaction, but in the truth of God, and there it finds firm footing. And those whose hearts are established by faith, will patiently wait till they gain their point. Compare all this with the vexation of sinners. The happiness of the saints is the envy of the wicked. The desire of the wicked shall perish; their desire was wholly to the world and the flesh, therefore when these perish, their joy is gone. But the blessings of the gospel are spiritual and eternal, and are conferred upon the members of the Christian church, through Christ their Head, who is the Pattern of all righteousness, and the Giver of all grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/112.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Surely he shall not be moved for ever - Luther, "For he shall remain always." He shall be fixed, stable, firm, prosperous. He shall not be driven from place to place. He shall have a permanent home. He shall have a steady reputation. He shall have a constant influence. He shall be a firm, establislied, prosperous man. Of course this is to be taken in the general, and should not be pressed to mean that it will be, in the most literal sense, and always, true, for a good man "may" be "unfortunate in business," and suffer with others; he may be sick; he may see reason to change his residence; he will certainly die. But still it is true that religion "tends" to produce this permanency, and that in this respect there is a marked difference between people who are truly pious, and those who are not.<p>The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance - In <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>, it is said that "the name of the wicked shall rot;" and the meaning here is, that the way to secure a grateful remembrance among people after we are dead is to be righteous - to do something that shall deserve to be remembered. It cannot mean that a man who is righteous will "never" be forgotten, or that his name and deeds will never pass from the recollection of mankind - for that would not be true; but that people will delight to cherish the memory of the righteous; that they will be disposed to do justice to their character after they are dead; that the benevolent and the upright will be remembered when the names of the wicked shall be forgotten. The world has no interest in keeping up the memory of bad people, and as soon as it can be done hastens to forget them. Wicked people are remembered only when their deeds are enormous, and then their memory is cherished only to admonish and to warn. The world has no interest in keeping up the memory of Benedict Arnold, or Alexander VI, or Caesar Borgia except to warn future generations of the guilt and baseness of treason and profligacy; it "has" an interest in never suffering the names of Howard, of Wilberforce, of Henry Martyn, to die, for those names excite to noble feelings and to noble efforts wherever they are known. Such names are to be had "in everlasting remembrance." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/112.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. not be moved&#8212;(compare Ps 13:4; 15:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/112.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shall not be moved for ever; </span> though he may for a season be afflicted, yet he shall not be utterly and eternally destroyed, as wicked men shall.

We are led to the right meaning by &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1493; in <a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a> in comparison with <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, where &#1495;&#1508;&#1509; signifies God's purpose in accordance with His counsel: constantly searched into, and therefore a worthy object of research (&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, root &#1491;&#1512;, to seek to know by rubbing, and in general experimentally, cf. Arab. dra&#770; of knowledge empirically acquired) according to all their aims, i.e., in all phases of that which they have in view. In <a href="/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4</a> &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; points to the festival which propagates the remembrance of the deeds of God in the Mosaic age; &#1496;&#1512;&#1507;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a>, therefore points to the food provided for the Exodus, and to the Passover meal, together with the feast of unleavened bread, this memorial (&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>) of the exemption in faithfulness to the covenant which was experienced in Egypt. This Psalm, says Luther, looks to me as though it had been composed for the festival of Easter. Even from the time of Theodoret and Augustine the thought of the Eucharist has been connected with <a href="/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a> in the New Testament mind; and it is not without good reason that <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1-10</a> has become the Psalm of the church at the celebration of the Lord's Supper. In connection with &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; one is reminded of the Pesach-Haggada. The deed of redemption which it relates has a power that continues in operation; for to the church of Jahve is assigned the victory not only over the peoples of Canaan, but over the whole world. The power of Jahve's deeds, which He has made known to His people, and which they tell over again among themselves, aims at giving them the inheritance of the peoples. The works of His hands are truth and right, for they are the realization of that which is true and which lasts and verifies itself, and of that which is right, that triumphantly maintains its ground. His ordinances are &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (occasionally pointed &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;), established, attested, in themselves and in their results authorizing a firm confidence in their salutariness (cf. <a href="/psalms/19-8.htm">Psalm 19:8</a>). &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, supported, stayed, viz., not outwardly, but in themselves, therefore imperturbable (cf. &#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; used of the state of mind, <a href="/psalms/112-8.htm">Psalm 112:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>). &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, moulded, arranged, viz., on the part of God, "in truth, and upright;" &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; is accusative of the predicate (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-37.htm">Psalm 119:37</a>), but without its being clear why it is not pointed &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. If we have understood <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4-6</a> correctly, then &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; glances back at the deliverance out of Egypt. Upon this followed the ratification of the covenant on Sinai, which still remains inviolable down to the present time of the poet, and has the holiness and terribleness of the divine Name for a guarantee of its inviolability. The fear of Jahve, this holy and terrible God, is the beginning of wisdom - the motto of the Chokma in Job (<a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>) and Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), the Books of the Chokma. <a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a> goes on in this Proverbs-like strain: the fear of God, which manifests itself in obedience, is to those who practise them (the divine precepts, &#1508;&#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;) &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; (<a href="/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-4.htm">Proverbs 3:4</a>, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>), a fine sagacity, praiseworthy discernment - such a (dutiful) one partakes of everlasting praise. It is true, in glancing back to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/111-3.htm">Psalm 111:3</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; seems to refer to God, but a glance forward to <a href="/psalms/112-3.htm">Psalm 112:3</a> shows that the praise of him who fears God is meant. The old observation therefore holds good: ubi haec ode desinit, sequens incipit (Bakius). </body></html>
