God is sometimes the strength of his people, when he is not their song; they have spiritual supports, though they want spiritual delights. Whether the believer traces back his comfort to the everlasting goodness and mercy of God, or whether he looks forward to the blessing secured to him, he will find abundant cause for joy and praise. Every answer to our prayers is an evidence that the Lord is on our side; and then we need not fear what man can do unto us; we should conscientiously do our duty to all, and trust in him alone to accept and bless us. Let us seek to live to declare the works of God, and to encourage others to serve him and trust in him. Such were the triumphs of the Son of David, in the assurance that the good pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/118.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They compassed me about like bees - <p>(a) As thick or numerous as bees;<p>(b) armed as bees - or, their weapons might be compared to the stings of bees.<p>They are quenched as the fire of thorns - The Septuagint and the Vulgate render this, "They burn as the fire of thorns." The connection would seem to demand this, but the Hebrew will not bear it. The figure is changed in the Hebrew, as is not uncommon. The mind of the psalmist at first recalls the number and the malignity of his foes; it then instantly adverts to the rapid manner in which they were destroyed. The illustration from the "fire of thorns" is derived from the fact that they quickly kindle into a blaze, and then the flame soon dies away. In Eastern countries it was common to burn over their fields in the dry time of the year, and thus to clear them of thorns and briars and weeds. Of course, at such a time they would kindle quickly, and burn rapidly, and would soon be consumed. So the psalmist says it was with his enemies. He came upon them, numerous as they were, as the fire runs over a field in a dry time, burning everything before it. Compare the notes at <a href="/isaiah/33-12.htm">Isaiah 33:12</a>.<p>For in the name of the Lord I will destroy them - That is, such was his purpose then; such was the reason why they so soon and suddenly disappeared. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/118.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. as the fire of thorns&#8212;suddenly.<p>in the name, &c.&#8212;by the power (Ps 20:5; 124:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/118.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Like bees; </span> in great numbers, and with great and potent fury, and to their own ruin, as bees do when they fly about a man, and leave their stings in him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They are quenched:</span> so this word is used <span class="bld"><a href="/job/6-17.htm" title="What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.">Job 6:17</a> 18:5,6 21:17</span>.

They will attack horses and kill them, as Aristotle (x) says; and places besieged have been delivered by throwing out hives of bees among the besiegers (y): and yet as they are feeble creatures, so by striking they lose their sting; and either die very quickly, or however become useless. All which denotes the numbers of the enemies of David and of Christ, and of his church and people, and the wrath and fury of them against them, as well as their fruitless and unsuccessful attempts upon them; for though they rage, what they contrive and endeavour to put in execution are vain things, and in the issue end in their own ruin and destruction; <p>they are quenched as the fire of thorns; which make a blaze, a noise, for a while; but are soon consumed, and leave only a few ashes behind. Wicked men are often compared to thorns, they being like them, unfruitful in themselves, unprofitable to others, harmful to the saints, and whose end is to be burnt; and whose destruction is certain and sudden, and easily effected as the burning of thorns; see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/58-9.htm">Psalm 58:9</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>.

The notion of compassing round about is heightened in <a href="/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a> by the juxtaposition of two forms of the same verb (Ges. 67, rem. 10), as in <a href="/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1</a>, and frequently. The figure of the bees is taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>. The perfect &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <a href="/isaiah/43-17.htm">Isaiah 43:17</a>) describes their destruction, which takes place instantly and unexpectedly. The Pual points to the punishing power that comes upon them: they are extinguished (exstinguuntur) like a fire of thorns, the crackling flame of which expires as quickly as it has blazed up (<a href="/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>). In <a href="/psalms/118-13.htm">Psalm 118:13</a> the language of Israel is addressed to the hostile worldly power, as the antithesis shows. It thrust, yea thrust (inf. intens.) Israel, that it might fall (&#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;; with reference to the pointing, vid., on <a href="/psalms/40-15.htm">Psalm 40:15</a>); but Jahve's help would not suffer it to come to that pass. Therefore the song at the Red Sea is revived in the heart and mouth of Israel. <a href="/psalms/118-14.htm">Psalm 118:14</a> (like <a href="/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>) is taken from <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>. &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; (in MSS also written &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;) is a collateral form of &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; (Ew. 255, a), and here signifies the lofty self-consciousness which is united with the possession of power: pride and its expression an exclamation of joy. Concerning &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; vid., on <a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>. As at that time, the cry of exultation and of salvation (i.e., of deliverance and of victory) is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of Jahve - they sing - &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; (<a href="/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>), practises valour, proves itself energetic, gains (maintains) the victory. &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; is Milra, and therefore an adjective: victoriosa (Ew. 120 d), from &#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;. It is not the part. Pil. (cf. <a href="/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>), since the rejection of the participial Mem occurs in connection with Poal and Pual, but not elsewhere with Pilel (&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). The word yields a simpler sense, too, as adject. participle Kal; rome&#772;ma&#772;&#769;h is only the fuller form for rama&#772;&#769;h, <a href="/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a> (cf. ra&#772;&#769;mah, <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>). It is not its own strength that avails for Israel's exultation of victory, but the energy of the right hand of Jahve. Being come to the brink of the abyss, Israel is become anew sure of its immortality through Him. God has, it is true, most severely chastened it (&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; with the suffix anni as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6</a>, and &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; with the emphatic Dagesh, which neither reduplicates nor connects, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, <a href="/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>), but still with moderation (<a href="/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7</a>.). He has not suffered Israel to fall a prey to death, but reserved it for its high vocation, that it may see the mighty deeds of God and proclaim them to all the world. Amidst such celebration of Jahve the festive procession of the dedication of the Temple has arrived at the enclosure wall of the Temple. </body></html>
