But as so often we find, the hope is so expressed as to suit not only the community for whom the psalm was composed and sung, but each member of it individually.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/118.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>118:1-18 The account the psalmist here gives of his troubles is very applicable to Christ: many hated him without a cause; nay, the Lord himself chastened him sorely, bruised him, and put him to grief, that by his stripes we might be healed. God is sometimes the strength of his people, when he is not their song; they have spiritual supports, though they want spiritual delights. Whether the believer traces back his comfort to the everlasting goodness and mercy of God, or whether he looks forward to the blessing secured to him, he will find abundant cause for joy and praise. Every answer to our prayers is an evidence that the Lord is on our side; and then we need not fear what man can do unto us; we should conscientiously do our duty to all, and trust in him alone to accept and bless us. Let us seek to live to declare the works of God, and to encourage others to serve him and trust in him. Such were the triumphs of the Son of David, in the assurance that the good pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/118.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I shall not die, but live - Evidently the psalmist had apprehended that he would die; or, he had felt that he was in imminent danger of dying. In this language he seems, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-13.htm">Psalm 118:13</a>, to go back again to the scenes referred to in the psalm. He lives them over again. He describes the feelings which he had then. He saw that he was in danger. His enemies were thick round about him, and sought his life. But he had then the assurance that they would not be victorious; that they would not accomplish their object; that he would be protected; that he would live to declare what God had done for him. He does not say how he had this assurance, but there is no impropriety in supposing that he had it, as Hezekiah had in similar circumstances (see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5-8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/38-21.htm">Isaiah 38:21</a>), by a direct divine intimation. Things like this are not uncommon now, when, in danger or in sickness, the mind is strongly impressed with the belief that there will be a restoration to health and safety, and when the mind is made calm and peaceful by that belief - the very calmness of the mind under such a belief contributing not a little to that result. Why should we hesitate to believe that such a faith and hope may come from the Lord?

Not that he should never die, David knew he should; but that his present afflictions would not issue in death; or he should not die by the hands of his enemies, he sometimes feared he should; but now believed he should live, as he did, to a good old age: he knew he should live spiritually and eternally, and not die a second death; and so may all true believers and members of Christ say. Yea, these words may be considered as the words of Christ; who, though he came into the world to die, and did die for the sins of his people; yet he knew he should not die before his time, nor should he continue long under the power of death; but should live again, and live for evermore, and not die; death should have no more dominion over him; see <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>; <p>and declare the works of the Lord; the wonderful appearances of God in a providential way, and all his marvellous works of grace; as David did, and as all the people of God more or less do; and which is the end of their living; not to eat and drink, and gratify their carnal senses, but to glorify God, by declaring what he has done for themselves and others.

The Jewish people had experienced this helpful succour of Jahve in opposition to the persecutions of the Samaritans and the satraps during the building of the Temple; and had at the same time learned what is expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7-8</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>), that trust in Jahve (for which &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1489; is the proper word) proves true, and trust in men, on the contrary, and especially in princes, is deceptive; for under Pseudo-Smerdis the work, begun under Cyrus, and represented as open to suspicion even in the reign of Cambyses, was interdicted. But in the reign of Darius it again became free: Jahve showed that He disposes events and the hearts of men in favour of His people, so that out of this has grown up in the minds of His people the confident expectation of a world-subduing supremacy expressed in <a href="/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>.<p>The clauses <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a>, expressed in the perfect form, are intended more hypothetically than as describing facts.

As at that time, the cry of exultation and of salvation (i.e., of deliverance and of victory) is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of Jahve - they sing - &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; (<a href="/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>), practises valour, proves itself energetic, gains (maintains) the victory. &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; is Milra, and therefore an adjective: victoriosa (Ew. 120 d), from &#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;. It is not the part. Pil. (cf. <a href="/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>), since the rejection of the participial Mem occurs in connection with Poal and Pual, but not elsewhere with Pilel (&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). The word yields a simpler sense, too, as adject. participle Kal; rome&#772;ma&#772;&#769;h is only the fuller form for rama&#772;&#769;h, <a href="/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a> (cf. ra&#772;&#769;mah, <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>). It is not its own strength that avails for Israel's exultation of victory, but the energy of the right hand of Jahve. Being come to the brink of the abyss, Israel is become anew sure of its immortality through Him. God has, it is true, most severely chastened it (&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; with the suffix anni as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6</a>, and &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; with the emphatic Dagesh, which neither reduplicates nor connects, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, <a href="/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>), but still with moderation (<a href="/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7</a>.). He has not suffered Israel to fall a prey to death, but reserved it for its high vocation, that it may see the mighty deeds of God and proclaim them to all the world. Amidst such celebration of Jahve the festive procession of the dedication of the Temple has arrived at the enclosure wall of the Temple. </body></html>
