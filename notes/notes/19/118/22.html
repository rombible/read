His humiliation; he is the Stone which the builders refused: they would go on in their building without him. This proved the ruin of those who thus made light of him. Rejecters of Christ are rejected of God. 2. His exaltation; he is the chief Cornerstone in the foundation. He is the chief Top-stone, in whom the building is completed, who must, in all things, have the pre-eminence. Christ's name is Wonderful; and the redemption he wrought out is the most amazing of all God's wondrous works. We will rejoice and be glad in the Lord's day; not only that such a day is appointed, but in the occasion of it, Christ's becoming the Head. Sabbath days ought to be rejoicing days, then they are to us as the days of heaven. Let this Saviour be my Saviour, my Ruler. Let my soul prosper and be in health, in that peace and righteousness which his government brings. Let me have victory over the lusts that war against my soul; and let Divine grace subdue my heart. The duty which the Lord has made, brings light with it, true light. The duty this privilege calls for, is here set forth; the sacrifices we are to offer to God in gratitude for redeeming love, are ourselves; not to be slain upon the altar, but living sacrifices, to be bound to the altar; spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise, in which our hearts must be engaged. The psalmist praises God, and calls upon all about him to give thanks to God for the glad tidings of great joy to all people, that there is a Redeemer, even Christ the Lord. In him the covenant of grace is made sure and everlasting.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/118.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The stone which the builders refused - See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42-43</a>.

This is an allusion to a building, as if a stone should be cast away by workmen as unfit to be worked into the edifice. The figure would then be applicable to anyone who, for any purpose, was rejected. Thus it might have been applied many a time to David; so, doubtless, to others who urged claims to authority and power; and so, eminently, to the Lord Jesus Christ. We are not to suppose that this had original reference to the Messiah, but the language was applicable to him; and it is used in the passages above referred to, in addresses to the Jews, merely to show them how the principle was found in their own writings, that one who was rejected, like a stone regarded as unfit to be worked into any part of a building, might be in reality so important that it would be laid yet at the very corner, and become the most valuable stone in the edifice - that on which the whole superstructure would rest.<p>Is become the head stone of the corner - The principal stone placed at the corner of the edifice. This is usually one of the largest, the most solid, and the most carefully constructed of any in the edifice. Of course one would be needed at each corner of the building to constitute a firm support, but usually there is one placed at one corner of an edifice larger and more carefully made than the others, often laid with imposing ceremonies, and prepared to contain whatever it may be thought necessary to deposit in the foundation of the building to be transmitted to future times as preserving the names of the builders, or expressing the design of the edifice. Such a position he who had been rejected was to occupy in the civil polity of his country; such a position eminently the Lord Jesus occupies in relation to the church. <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/118.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22, 23. These words are applied by Christ (Mt 21:42) to Himself, as the foundation of the Church (compare Ac 4:11; Eph 2:20; 1Pe 2:4, 7). It may here denote God's wondrous exaltation to power and influence of him whom the rulers of the nation despised. Whether (see on [633]Ps 118:1) David or Zerubbabel (compare Hag 2:2; Zec 4:7-10) be primarily meant, there is here typically represented God's more wonderful doings in exalting Christ, crucified as an impostor, to be the Prince and Saviour and Head of His Church.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/118.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.<p>23 This is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.<p>24 This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.<p>25 Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.<p>26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.<p>27 God is the Lord, which hath showed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.<p>This passage will appear to be a mixture of the expressions of the people and of the hero himself.<p><a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a><p>"The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner." Here the people magnify God for bringing his chosen servant into the honourable office, which had been allotted to him by divine decree. A wise king and valiant leader is a stone by which the national fabric is built up. David had been rejected by those in authority, but God had placed him in a position of the highest honour and the greatest usefulness, making him the chief corner-stone of the state. In the case of many others whose early life has been spent in conflict, the Lord has been pleased to accomplish his divine purposes in like manner; but to none is this text so applicable as to the Lord Jesus himself- he is the living stone, the tried stone, elect, precious, which God himself appointed from of old. The Jewish builders, scribe, priest, Pharisee, and Herodian, rejected him with disdain. They could see no excellence in him that they should build upon him; he could not be made to fit in with their ideal of a national church, he was a stone of another quarry from themselves, and not after their mind nor according to their taste; therefore they cast him away and poured contempt upon him, even as Peter said, "This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders": they reckoned him to be as nothing, though he is Lord of all. In raising him from the dead the Lord God exalted him to be the head of his church, the very pinnacle of her glory and beauty. Since then he has become the confidence of the Gentiles, even of them that are afar off upon the sea, and thus he has joined the two walls of Jew and Gentile into one stately temple, and is seen to be the binding corner-stone, making both one. This is a delightful subject for contemplation.<p>Jesus in all things hath the pre-eminence, he is the principal stone of the whole house of God. We are accustomed to lay some one stone of a public building with solemn ceremony, and to deposit in it any precious things which may have been selected as a memorial of the occasion: henceforth that corner-stone is looked upon as peculiarly honourable, and joyful memories are associated with it. All this is in a very emphatic sense true of our blessed Lord, "The Shepherd, the Stone of Israel." God himself laid him where he is, and hid within him all the precious things of the eternal covenant; and there he shall for ever remain, the foundation of all our hopes, the glory of all our joys, the uniting bond of all our fellowship. He is "the head over all things to the church," and by him the church is fitly framed together, and groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord. Still do the builders refuse him: even to this day the professional teachers of the gospel are far too apt to fly to any and every new philosophy sooner than maintain the simple gospel, which is the essence of Christ: nevertheless, he holds his true position amongst his people, and the foolish builders shall see to their utter confusion that his truth shall be exalted over all. Those who reject the chosen stone will stumble against him to their own hurt, and ere long will come his second advent, when he will fall upon them from the heights of heaven, and grind them to powder.<p><a href="/psalms/118-23.htm">Psalm 118:23</a><p>"This is the Lord's doing." The exalted position of Christ in his church is not the work of man, and does not depend for its continuation upon any builders or ministers; God himself has wrought the exaltation of our Lord Jesus. Considering the opposition which comes from the wisdom, the power, and the authority of this world, it is manifest that if the kingdom of Christ be indeed set up and maintained in the world it must be by supernatural power. Indeed, it is so even in the smallest detail. Every grain of true faith in this world is a divine creation, and every hour in which the true church subsists is a prolonged miracle. It is not the goodness of human nature, nor the force of reasoning, which exalts Christ, and builds up the church, but a power from above. This staggers the adversary, for he cannot understand what it is which baffles him: of the Holy Ghost he knows nothing. "It is marvellous in our eyes." We actually see it; it is not in our thoughts and hopes and prayers alone, but the astonishing work is actually before our eyes. Jesus reigns, his power is felt, and we perceive that it is so. Faith sees our great Master, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come; she sees and marvels. It never ceases to astonish us, as we see, even here below, God by means of weakness defeating power, by the simplicity of his word baffling the craft of men, and by the invisible influence of his Spirit exalting his Son in human hearts in the teeth of open and determined opposition. It is indeed "marvellous in our eyes," as all God's works must be if men care to study them. In the Hebrew the passage reads, "It is wonderfully done" : not only is the exaltation of Jesus of Nazareth itself wonderful, but the way in which it is brought about is marvellous' it is wonderfully done. The more we study the history of Christ and his church the more fully shall we agree with this declaration.<p><a href="/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a><p>"This is the day which the Lord hath made." A new era has commenced. The day of David's enthronement was the beginning of better times for Israel; and in a far higher sense the day of our Lord's resurrection is a new day of God's own making, for it is the dawn of a blessed dispensation. No doubt the Israelitish nation celebrated the victory of its champion with a day of feasting, music and song; and surely it is but meet that we should reverently keep the feast of the triumph of the Son of David. We observe the Lord's-day as henceforth our true Sabbath, a day made and ordained of God, for the perpetual remembrance of the achievements of our Redeemer. Whenever the soft Sabbath light of the first day of the week breaks upon the earth, let us sing,<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/118.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The commonwealth of Israel and the church of God are here and elsewhere in Scripture compared to a building, wherein as the people are the stones and the matter, so the princes and rulers are the builders, whose office it was to erect, and support, and improve the building, and to use their wisdom and power in choosing fit materials for the several parts and purposes of the building, and in the rejection of what was unprofitable and inconvenient. And these master-builders rejected David as an obscure, and treacherous, and rebellious person, fit to be not only laid aside and thrown away, but also to be crushed to pieces. And so their successors rejected Christ as an enemy to Moses, a friend to sinners, and a blasphemer against God, and therefore deserving death and damnation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The head stone of the corner; </span> the chief stone in the whole building, by which the several parts of the building are upheld and firmly united and kept together. Thus David united all the tribes and families of Israel, who had been miserably distracted and divided by the civil wars between the houses of Saul and David. And thus Christ united Jews and Gentiles together, as is observed, <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a></span>, &c.

This is not Zerubabel, according to the sense of some Jews, as Theodoret suggests; nor the people of Israel, as Jarchi and Kimchi; nor David, as the Targum, which paraphrases the words, <p>"the child the builders despised was among the sons of Jesse, and deserved to be appointed a king and a governor.'' <p>He doubtless was a type of Christ, and there was some shadow of what is here said in him: he was refused by all the tribes but Judah; Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, was set upon the throne, though afterwards all Israel and Judah united in making David king, <a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>. But the Messiah is intended, as some ancient Jewish writers (e) own, and Jarchi himself elsewhere (f) confesses; and which is certain from the quotation and application of this passage to Christ, in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>, <a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; who is compared to a stone for his strength and duration; and because of his usefulness in the spiritual building of the church, as a foundation and corner stone; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>. Him the Jewish builders refused; their political ones, their rulers, that believed not on him; the princes of this world, that rose up against him and crucified him; even those who were the support of their civil state, and the maintainers of it: but more especially their ecclesiastical builders, the chief priests, Scribes, and Pharisees, who built the people, or directed them to build on their carnal privileges, the traditions of the elders, and their own legal righteousness. These refused to receive Jesus as the Messiah, and to believe in him; they refused to own and honour him as King of Zion; they refused his doctrines and ordinances; they refused to hear him preach, or suffer others to hear him; they refused to make use of him in the spiritual building, either to preach him themselves, or allow others to do it; they rejected him with contempt; they set him at nought, and preferred a thief and a robber to him; <p>is become the head stone of the corner; Christ is the corner stone, that unites elect angels and elect men together, Jews and Gentiles, Old and New Testament saints, saints above and below, saints in all ages and places; and he is the head stone, or chief corner stone, for strength and beauty, and the head of the corner; or of persons most eminent, who are sometimes called the corner, <a href="/judges/20-2.htm">Judges 20:2</a>.

The stone which the builders rejected<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Is become the head of the corner.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A metaphor from building. The ‘corner-stone’ bonding the walls together was a most important part of the structure. A large and strong stone was needed for the purpose. It is mentioned along with the foundation (<a href="/jeremiah/51-26.htm" title="And they shall not take of you a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you shall be desolate for ever, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 51:26</a>; <a href="/job/38-6.htm" title="Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;">Job 38:6</a>) of which it formed part (<a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>); and so possibly the meaning here is ‘the chief cornerstone’ of the foundation. But ‘the head of the corner’ is more naturally explained to be the top-stone (<a href="/zechariah/4-7.htm" title="Who are you, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace to it.">Zechariah 4:7</a>), not only bonding the walls together, but completing the building. Israel is the ‘head corner-stone.’ The powers of the world flung it aside as useless, but God destined it for the most honourable and important place in the building of His kingdom in the world. The words express Israel’s consciousness of its mission and destiny in the purpose of God. The perfect “is become” is a perfect of certainty. With the eye of faith the Psalmist sees the Divine purpose already realised.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Our Lord applies the passage to Himself in His solemn warning to the Pharisees of the consequences of rejecting Him (<a href="/matthew/21-42.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="/context/mark/12-10.htm" title="And have you not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:...">Mark 12:10-11</a>; <a href="/luke/20-17.htm" title="And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?">Luke 20:17</a>). St Peter also quotes it (<a href="/acts/4-11.htm" title="This is the stone which was set at nothing of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm" title="To you therefore which believe he is precious: but to them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,">1 Peter 2:7</a>). Comp. also <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>. The principle underlying this use of the words originally spoken of Israel is that Christ was the true representative of Israel, Who undertook and fulfilled the mission in which Israel had failed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/118.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.</span> The primary and literal meaning seems to be - " Israel, which the great of the world, those who think to arrange the world ac cording to their own ideas, have rejected and would fain have cast aside, has, nevertheless, despite their rejection, attained to eminence, and been advanced, by the course of events, into such a position, that it may be regarded as the head corner-stone - the most important of all the nations of the world."

In that passage it is still more clear than in the passage before us that by the Beth of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; Jahve is not meant to be designated as unus e multis, but as a helper who outweighs the greatest multitude of helpers. The Jewish people had experienced this helpful succour of Jahve in opposition to the persecutions of the Samaritans and the satraps during the building of the Temple; and had at the same time learned what is expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7-8</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>), that trust in Jahve (for which &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1489; is the proper word) proves true, and trust in men, on the contrary, and especially in princes, is deceptive; for under Pseudo-Smerdis the work, begun under Cyrus, and represented as open to suspicion even in the reign of Cambyses, was interdicted. But in the reign of Darius it again became free: Jahve showed that He disposes events and the hearts of men in favour of His people, so that out of this has grown up in the minds of His people the confident expectation of a world-subduing supremacy expressed in <a href="/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>.<p>The clauses <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a>, expressed in the perfect form, are intended more hypothetically than as describing facts. The perfect is here set out in relief as a hypothetical tense by the following future. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; signifies, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>, the heathen of every kind. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (in the Aramaic and Arabic with )&#1494; are both bees and wasps, which make themselves especially troublesome in harvest time. The suffix of &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501; (from &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  &#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, to hew down, cut in pieces) is the same as in <a href="/exodus/29-30.htm">Exodus 29:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/2-17.htm">Exodus 2:17</a>, and also beside a conjunctive accent in <a href="/psalms/74-8.htm">Psalm 74:8</a>. Yet the reading &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;, like &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-17.htm">Habakkuk 2:17</a>, is here the better supported (vid., Gesenius, Lehrgebude, S. 177), and it has been adopted by Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is that which states the ground or reason, and then becomes directly confirmatory and assuring (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/128-4.htm">Psalm 128:4</a>), which here, after the "in the name of Jahve" that precedes it, is applied and placed just as in the oath in <a href="/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>. And in general, as Redslob has demonstrated, &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; has not originally a relative, but a positive (determining) signification, &#1499; being just as much a demonstrative sound as &#1491;, &#1494;, &#1513;&#1473;, and &#1514; (cf. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;'&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, ecce, hic, illic, with the Doric &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;). The notion of compassing round about is heightened in <a href="/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a> by the juxtaposition of two forms of the same verb (Ges. 67, rem. 10), as in <a href="/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1</a>, and frequently. The figure of the bees is taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>. The perfect &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <a href="/isaiah/43-17.htm">Isaiah 43:17</a>) describes their destruction, which takes place instantly and unexpectedly. The Pual points to the punishing power that comes upon them: they are extinguished (exstinguuntur) like a fire of thorns, the crackling flame of which expires as quickly as it has blazed up (<a href="/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>). In <a href="/psalms/118-13.htm">Psalm 118:13</a> the language of Israel is addressed to the hostile worldly power, as the antithesis shows. It thrust, yea thrust (inf. intens.) Israel, that it might fall (&#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;; with reference to the pointing, vid., on <a href="/psalms/40-15.htm">Psalm 40:15</a>); but Jahve's help would not suffer it to come to that pass. Therefore the song at the Red Sea is revived in the heart and mouth of Israel. <a href="/psalms/118-14.htm">Psalm 118:14</a> (like <a href="/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>) is taken from <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>. &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; (in MSS also written &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;) is a collateral form of &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; (Ew. 255, a), and here signifies the lofty self-consciousness which is united with the possession of power: pride and its expression an exclamation of joy. Concerning &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; vid., on <a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>. As at that time, the cry of exultation and of salvation (i.e., of deliverance and of victory) is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of Jahve - they sing - &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; (<a href="/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>), practises valour, proves itself energetic, gains (maintains) the victory. &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; is Milra, and therefore an adjective: victoriosa (Ew. 120 d), from &#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;. It is not the part. Pil. (cf. <a href="/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>), since the rejection of the participial Mem occurs in connection with Poal and Pual, but not elsewhere with Pilel (&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). The word yields a simpler sense, too, as adject. participle Kal; rome&#772;ma&#772;&#769;h is only the fuller form for rama&#772;&#769;h, <a href="/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a> (cf. ra&#772;&#769;mah, <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>). It is not its own strength that avails for Israel's exultation of victory, but the energy of the right hand of Jahve. Being come to the brink of the abyss, Israel is become anew sure of its immortality through Him. God has, it is true, most severely chastened it (&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; with the suffix anni as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6</a>, and &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; with the emphatic Dagesh, which neither reduplicates nor connects, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, <a href="/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>), but still with moderation (<a href="/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7</a>.). He has not suffered Israel to fall a prey to death, but reserved it for its high vocation, that it may see the mighty deeds of God and proclaim them to all the world. Amidst such celebration of Jahve the festive procession of the dedication of the Temple has arrived at the enclosure wall of the Temple. </body></html>
