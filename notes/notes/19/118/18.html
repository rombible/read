God is sometimes the strength of his people, when he is not their song; they have spiritual supports, though they want spiritual delights. Whether the believer traces back his comfort to the everlasting goodness and mercy of God, or whether he looks forward to the blessing secured to him, he will find abundant cause for joy and praise. Every answer to our prayers is an evidence that the Lord is on our side; and then we need not fear what man can do unto us; we should conscientiously do our duty to all, and trust in him alone to accept and bless us. Let us seek to live to declare the works of God, and to encourage others to serve him and trust in him.

It had been a severe trial, and he was not insensible to its severity, though he regarded it as designed for his own good.<p>But he hath not given we over unto death - He interposed when I was in danger; he rescued me when I was on the verge of the grave. This is the close of the psalmist's statement in regard to the divine dealings with him. He had passed through great danger; he had been sorely afflicted; but he had been rescued and spared, and he came now to express his thanks to God for his recovery. In the following verse he addresses those who had the care of the sanctuary, and asks that he might be permitted to enter and offer his thanks to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/118.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17, 18.

The Jewish people had experienced this helpful succour of Jahve in opposition to the persecutions of the Samaritans and the satraps during the building of the Temple; and had at the same time learned what is expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7-8</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>), that trust in Jahve (for which &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1489; is the proper word) proves true, and trust in men, on the contrary, and especially in princes, is deceptive; for under Pseudo-Smerdis the work, begun under Cyrus, and represented as open to suspicion even in the reign of Cambyses, was interdicted. But in the reign of Darius it again became free: Jahve showed that He disposes events and the hearts of men in favour of His people, so that out of this has grown up in the minds of His people the confident expectation of a world-subduing supremacy expressed in <a href="/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>.<p>The clauses <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a>, expressed in the perfect form, are intended more hypothetically than as describing facts. The perfect is here set out in relief as a hypothetical tense by the following future. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; signifies, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>, the heathen of every kind. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (in the Aramaic and Arabic with )&#1494; are both bees and wasps, which make themselves especially troublesome in harvest time.

Yet the reading &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;, like &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-17.htm">Habakkuk 2:17</a>, is here the better supported (vid., Gesenius, Lehrgebude, S. 177), and it has been adopted by Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is that which states the ground or reason, and then becomes directly confirmatory and assuring (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/128-4.htm">Psalm 128:4</a>), which here, after the "in the name of Jahve" that precedes it, is applied and placed just as in the oath in <a href="/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>. And in general, as Redslob has demonstrated, &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; has not originally a relative, but a positive (determining) signification, &#1499; being just as much a demonstrative sound as &#1491;, &#1494;, &#1513;&#1473;, and &#1514; (cf. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;'&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, ecce, hic, illic, with the Doric &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;). The notion of compassing round about is heightened in <a href="/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a> by the juxtaposition of two forms of the same verb (Ges. 67, rem. 10), as in <a href="/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1</a>, and frequently. The figure of the bees is taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>. The perfect &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <a href="/isaiah/43-17.htm">Isaiah 43:17</a>) describes their destruction, which takes place instantly and unexpectedly. The Pual points to the punishing power that comes upon them: they are extinguished (exstinguuntur) like a fire of thorns, the crackling flame of which expires as quickly as it has blazed up (<a href="/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>). In <a href="/psalms/118-13.htm">Psalm 118:13</a> the language of Israel is addressed to the hostile worldly power, as the antithesis shows. It thrust, yea thrust (inf. intens.) Israel, that it might fall (&#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;; with reference to the pointing, vid., on <a href="/psalms/40-15.htm">Psalm 40:15</a>); but Jahve's help would not suffer it to come to that pass. Therefore the song at the Red Sea is revived in the heart and mouth of Israel. <a href="/psalms/118-14.htm">Psalm 118:14</a> (like <a href="/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>) is taken from <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>. &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; (in MSS also written &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;) is a collateral form of &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; (Ew. 255, a), and here signifies the lofty self-consciousness which is united with the possession of power: pride and its expression an exclamation of joy. Concerning &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; vid., on <a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>. As at that time, the cry of exultation and of salvation (i.e., of deliverance and of victory) is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of Jahve - they sing - &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; (<a href="/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>), practises valour, proves itself energetic, gains (maintains) the victory. &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; is Milra, and therefore an adjective: victoriosa (Ew. 120 d), from &#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;. It is not the part. Pil. (cf. <a href="/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>), since the rejection of the participial Mem occurs in connection with Poal and Pual, but not elsewhere with Pilel (&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). The word yields a simpler sense, too, as adject. participle Kal; rome&#772;ma&#772;&#769;h is only the fuller form for rama&#772;&#769;h, <a href="/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a> (cf. ra&#772;&#769;mah, <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>). It is not its own strength that avails for Israel's exultation of victory, but the energy of the right hand of Jahve. Being come to the brink of the abyss, Israel is become anew sure of its immortality through Him. God has, it is true, most severely chastened it (&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; with the suffix anni as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6</a>, and &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; with the emphatic Dagesh, which neither reduplicates nor connects, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, <a href="/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>), but still with moderation (<a href="/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7</a>.). He has not suffered Israel to fall a prey to death, but reserved it for its high vocation, that it may see the mighty deeds of God and proclaim them to all the world. Amidst such celebration of Jahve the festive procession of the dedication of the Temple has arrived at the enclosure wall of the Temple. </body></html>
