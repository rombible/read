Up to this point the church stirs itself up to a worshipping appearing before its God; now the voice of God (<a href="/hebrews/4-7.htm">Hebrews 4:7</a>), earnestly admonishing, meets it, resounding from out of the sanctuary. Since &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468; signifies not merely to hear, but to hear obediently, <a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a> cannot be a conditioning protasis to what follows. Hengstenberg wishes to supply the apodosis: "then will He bless you, His people;" but &#1488;&#1501; in other instances too (<a href="/psalms/81-9.htm">Psalm 81:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-19.htm">Psalm 139:19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-11.htm">Proverbs 24:11</a>), like &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, has an optative signification, which it certainly has gained by a suppression of a promissory apodosis, but yet without the genius of the language having any such in mind in every instance. The word &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; placed first gives prominence to the present, in which this call to obedience goes forth, as a decisive turning-point. The divine voice warningly calls to mind the self-hardening of Israel, which came to light at Mer&#1502;bah, on the day of Massah. What is referred to, as also in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/81-8.htm">Psalm 81:8</a>, is the tempting of God in the second year of the Exodus on account of the failing of water in the neighbourhood of Horeb, at the place which is for this reason called Massah u-Mer&#305;&#770;bah (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>); from which is to be distinguished the tempting of God in the fortieth year of the Exodus at Mer&#305;&#770;bah, viz., at the waters of contention near Kadesh (written fully Me&#770;-Mer&#305;&#770;bah Kadesh, or more briefly Me&#770;-Mer&#305;&#770;bah), <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/20-2.htm">Numbers 20:2-13</a> (cf. on <a href="/psalms/78-20.htm">Psalm 78:20</a>). Strictly &#1499;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492; signifies nothing but instar Meribae, as in <a href="/psalms/83-10.htm">Psalm 83:10</a> instar Midianitarum; but according to the sense, &#1499;&#1468; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32</a>, just as &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;. On &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, quum, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>. The meaning of &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; is not they also (&#1490;&#1501; as in <a href="/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>) saw His work; for the reference to the giving of water out of the rock would give a thought that is devoid of purpose here, and the assertion is too indefinite for it to be understood of the judgment upon those who tempted God (Hupfeld and Hitzig). It is therefore rather to be rendered: notwithstanding (ho'moos, Ew. 354, a) they had ( equals  although they had, cf. &#1490;&#1501; in <a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>) seen His work (His wondrous guiding and governing), and might therefore be sure that He would not suffer them to be destroyed. The verb &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496; coincides with &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; .&#1506;&#1503;, for which the lxx has &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, is anarthrous in order that the notion may be conceived of more qualitatively than relatively: with a (whole) generation. With &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; Jahve calls to mind the repeated declarations of His vexation concerning their heart, which was always inclined towards error which leads to destruction - declarations, however, which bore no fruit. Just this ineffectiveness of His indignation had as its result that (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, not &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; but &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;, as in <a href="/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-51.htm">Deuteronomy 28:51</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>, and frequently) He sware, etc. (&#1488;&#1501;  equals  verily not, Gesen. 155, 2, f, with the emphatic future form in n which follows). It is the oath in <a href="/numbers/14-27.htm">Numbers 14:27</a>. that is meant. The older generation died in the desert, and therefore lost the entering into the rest of God, by reason of their disobedience. If now, many centuries after Moses, they are invited in the Davidic Psalter to submissive adoration of Jahve, with the significant call: "To-day if ye will hearken to His voice!" and with a reference to the warning example of the fathers, the obedience of faith, now as formerly, has therefore to look forward to the gracious reward of entering into God's rest, which the disobedient at that time lost; and the taking possession of Canaan was, therefore, not as yet the final &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-9.htm">Deuteronomy 12:9</a>). This is the connection of the wider train of thought which to the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews Heb 3:1, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/4-1.htm">Hebrews 4:1</a>, follows from this text of the Psalm. </body></html>
