His apostles and evangelists showed forth his salvation among the heathen, his wonders among all people. All the earth is here summoned to worship the Lord. We must worship him in the beauty of holiness, as God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. Glorious things are said of him, both as motives to praise and matter of praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/96.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness - This verse is literally taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-29.htm">1 Chronicles 16:29-30</a>. The margin here is, "in the glorious sanctuary." The Septuagint, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;  en aule&#772; hagia - "in his holy court." So the Latin Vulgate. On the meanings of the expression, see the notes at <a href="/psalms/29-2.htm">Psalm 29:2</a>.<p>Fear before him, all the earth - All lands; all people. The word rendered "fear" means properly to writhe, to twist, to be in pain; and then, to tremble, to quake, to be afraid. The word "tremble" would perhaps best express the idea here. It is that solemn awe produced by the sense of the divine presence and majesty which causes trembling. It denotes profound reverence for God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/96.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. beauty of holiness&#8212;(Ps 29:2).<p>fear &#8230; him&#8212;(Ps 2:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/96.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the beauty of holiness; </span> either in the holy place which he shall appoint to that end; or clothed with all those holy ornaments, those gifts and graces, which are necessary and required in God’s worship. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/96.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,....
