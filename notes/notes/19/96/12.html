He shall rule in the hearts of men, by the power of truth, and the Spirit of righteousness. His coming draws nigh; this King, this Judge standeth before the door, but he is not yet come. The Lord will accept the praises of all who seek to promote the kingdom of Christ. The sea can but roar, and how the trees of the wood can show that they rejoice we know not; but He that searches the heart knows what is the mind of the Spirit, and understands the words, the broken language of the weakest. Christ will come to judge the earth, to execute just vengeance on his enemies, and to fulfil his largest promises to his people. What then are we? Would that day be welcome to us? If this be not our case, let us now begin to prepare to meet our God, by seeking the pardon of our sins, and the renewal of our souls to holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/96.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the field be joyful ... - This is taken - with the change of a single letter, not affecting the sense - from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-32.htm">1 Chronicles 16:32-33</a>. It is a call on the fields - the cultivated portions of the earth - to rejoice in the reign of God.

If they were conscious of their own magnificence and beauty - if they could see how much wisdom and goodness God has lavished on them, in their forms, their branches, their leaves, their flowers, their fruit - if they could know how much they are made to accomplish in rendering the world beautiful, and in contributing to the happiness of man - if they understood what a bare, bleak, cold, desert world this would be but for them, they, too, would have abundant occasion for praise and joy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/96.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13.
