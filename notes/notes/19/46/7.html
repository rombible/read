The refrain corresponds to Isaiah’s watchword <span class="ital">Immanuel</span>, ‘God is with us’ (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm" title="And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.">Isaiah 8:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-10.htm" title="Take counsel together, and it shall come to nothing; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.">Isaiah 8:10</a>). The name <span class="ital">Jehovah</span> is retained (or has been restored) here even in the Elohistic collection in the familiar title <span class="ital">Jehovah of hosts</span>. This great title <span class="ital">Jehovah Tsebâôth</span> or ‘Lord of hosts’ was characteristic of the regal and prophetic period. Originally it may have designated Jehovah as “the God of the armies of Israel” (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm" title="Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.">1 Samuel 17:45</a>), Who went forth with His people’s hosts to battle (<a href="/psalms/44-9.htm" title="But you have cast off, and put us to shame; and go not forth with our armies.">Psalm 44:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/60-10.htm" title="Will not you, O God, which had cast us off? and you, O God, which did not go out with our armies?">Psalm 60:10</a>). But as the phrase “host of heaven” was used for the celestial bodies (<a href="/genesis/2-1.htm" title="Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.">Genesis 2:1</a>), and celestial beings (<a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1 Kings 22:19</a>), the meaning of the title was extended to designate Jehovah as the ruler of the heavenly powers, the supreme Sovereign of the universe. Hence one of the renderings of it in the LXX is <span class="greekheb">Κύριος παντοκράτωρ</span>, <span class="ital">Lord Almighty</span>, or rather, <span class="ital">Lord All-Sovereign</span>. See add. note on 1 Sam., p. 235. The title is a favourite one with Isaiah, and its use here is significant. He whose command all the hosts of heaven obey is Israel’s ally.

This declaration is the result of their experience. Luther, after the lxx and Vulg., renders it, "in the great distresses which have come upon us." As though &#1504;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; could stand for &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, and that this again could mean anything else but "at present existing," to which &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; is not at all appropriate. God Himself is called &#1504;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; as being one who allows Himself to be found in times of distress (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-4.htm">2 Chronicles 15:4</a>, and frequently) exceedingly; i.e., to those who then seek Him He reveals Himself and verifies His word beyond all measure. Because God is such a God to them, the congregation or church does not fear though a still greater distress than that which they have just withstood, should break in upon them: if the earth should change, i.e., effect, enter upon, undergo or suffer a change (an inwardly transitive Hiphil, Ges. &#1431;53, 2); and if the mountains should sink down into the heart (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489; exactly as in <a href="/ezekiel/27-27.htm">Ezekiel 27:27</a>; <a href="/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a>) of the sea (ocean), i.e., even if these should sink back again into the waters out of which they appeared on the third day of the creation, so that consequently the old chaos should return. The church supposes the most extreme case, viz., the falling in of the universe which has been creatively set in order. We are no more to regard the language as being allegorical here (as Hengstenberg interprets it, the mountains being  equals  the kingdoms of the world), than we would the language of Horace: si fractus illabatur orbis (Carm. iii. 3, 7). Since &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is not a numerical but amplificative plural, the singular suffixes in <a href="/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a> may the more readily refer back to it. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, pride, self-exaltation, used of the sea as in <a href="/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a> &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, and in <a href="/job/38-11.htm">Job 38:11</a> &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; are used. The futures in <a href="/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a> do not continue the infinitive construction: if the waters thereof roar, foam, etc.; but they are, as their position and repetition indicate, intended to have a concessive sense. And this favours the supposition of Hupfeld and Ewald that the refrain, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/46-8.htm">Psalm 46:8</a>, 12, which ought to form the apodosis of this concessive clause (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8-10</a>; <a href="/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-30.htm">Isaiah 40:30</a>.) has accidentally fallen out here. In the text as it lies before us <a href="/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a> attaches itself to &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1504;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;: (we do not fear), let its waters (i.e., the waters of the ocean) rage and foam continually; and, inasmuch as the sea rises high, towering beyond its shores, let the mountains threaten to topple in. The music, which here becomes forte, strengthens the believing confidence of the congregation, despite this wild excitement of the elements. </body></html>
