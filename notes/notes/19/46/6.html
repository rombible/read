This language would well describe the consternation of the nations when the Assyrians went forth to conquest, and when, having subdued so many other kingdoms, they made war on Jerusalem. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a>.<p>The kingdoms were moved - That is, those who were invaded, as well as those that made the invasion. There was a general convulsion or shaking among the nations of the earth.<p>He uttered his voice - God spoke; he gave command; he expressed his will. Compare <a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>.<p>The earth melted - The very earth seemed to melt or dissolve before him. Everything became still. The danger passed away at his command, and the raging world became calm. The Bible abounds in language of this kind, showing the absolute power of God, or his power to control all the raging elements on land and ocean by a word.

Just as the kings of Judah and of Israel allowed their sons to share in their dominion (<a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/11-23.htm">2 Chronicles 11:23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/20-15.htm">1 Kings 20:15</a>), so out of the loving relationship of the daughter of Zion and of the virgins of her train to the King Messiah there spring up children, to whom the regal glory of the house of David which culminates in Him is transferred, - a royal race among which He divides the dominion of the earth (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/149-1.htm">Psalm 149:1-9</a>); for He makes His own people "kings and priests, and they shall reign on the earth" (<a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>). Those children are to be understood here which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1-7</a>, are born to Him as the dew out of the womb of the morning's dawn - the every-youthful nation, by which He conquers and rules the world. When, therefore, the poet says that he will remember the name of the king throughout all generations, this is based upon the twofold assumption, that he regards himself as a member of an imperishable church (Sir. 37:25), and that he regards the king as a person worthy to be praised by the church of every age. Elsewhere Jahve's praise is called a praise that lives through all generations (<a href="/psalms/102-13.htm">Psalm 102:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-13.htm">Psalm 135:13</a>); here the king is the object of the everlasting praise of the church, and, beginning with the church, of the nations also. First of all Israel, whom the psalmist represents, is called upon to declare with praise the name of the Messiah from generation to generation. But it does not rest with Israel alone. The nations are thereby roused up to do the same thing. The end of the covenant history is that Israel and the nations together praise this love-worthy, heroic, and divine King: "His name shall endure for ever; as long as the sun shall His name bud, and all nations shall be blessed in Him (and) shall praise Him" (<a href="/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>). </body></html>
