Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>, "Stand still, and see the salvation of God." In this place the word seems to be used as meaning that there was to be no anxiety; that there was to be a calm, confiding, trustful state of mind in view of the displays of the divine presence and power. The mind was to be calm, in view of the fact that God had interposed, and had shown that he was able to defend his people when surrounded by dangers. If this the divine interposition when Jerusalem was threatened by the armies of the Assyrians under Sennacherib, the force and beauty of the expression will be most clearly seen.<p>And know that I am God - See, in what I have done, the evidence that I am God. See a work accomplished which none "but" God could effect. Compare <a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>.<p>I will be exalted among the heathen - That is, among the nations. The nations abroad that do not worship me, but worship idols, shall see in these deeds full proof that I am the true God, and that I am worthy of universal adoration.

These words are thought by some to be spoken by the Lord to the nations of the world, to "cease from war", as the Targum renders the words; or from going up any more against Jerusalem, as Jarchi interprets them; and that they were spoken to them before the breaking of their bows, &amp;c. as Aben Ezra observes; or that they are an exhortation to them to cease from their evil works, and know that the Lord is God, and has power to raise up and to make low; which, is Kimchi's sense of the words: but they are rather a continuation of the church's address to the fearful among them, as before to behold the works of the Lord, so here to hearken to what he says, as follows, "be still"; not that they should be like sticks and stones, stupid, indolent, and unconcerned at the commotions that were in the earth, and be unaffected with the judgments of God, and be wholly silent and inactive; but that they should not be fearful, nor fretful and impatient, or restless and tumultuous; but be quiet and easy, resigned to the will of God, and live in an assured expectation of the appearance of divine Providence in their layout. And "know"; own and acknowledge that he is God, a sovereign Being that does whatsoever he pleases; that he is unchangeable in his nature, purposes, promises, and covenant; that he is omnipotent, able to help them and deliver them at the last extremity; that he is omniscient, knows their persons, cases, and troubles, and how and where to hide them till the storm is over; that he is the all wise God, and does all things after the counsel of his own will, and makes all things work together for good to them; and that he is faithful to his word and promise, and will not suffer them to be overpressed and bore down with troubles. Who further says for their encouragement, and is to be hearkened to in it, <p>I will be exalted among the Heathen; with or in the conversion of the Gentiles; when the kingdoms of this world shall become Christ's, and all nations shall come and worship before him, <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>. Or in the destruction of the Gentiles; the Papists, the antichristian states; which will cause great rejoicings, hallelujahs, and attributions of honour and glory to him, <a href="/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a>; so Jarchi interprets the words, "I will be exalted",  "in my vengeance"; that I will take upon the Heathen; <p>I will be exalted in the earth; now Christ is exalted in heaven at the right hand of God, before long he will be exalted in the earth, where he was despised and rejected, crucified and slain; he will be King over all the earth; his dominion will be from one end of it to the other; his tabernacle will be among men; and his people, as kings and priests, will reign with him on earth; by whom he, and he alone, will be exalted in the dignity of his person and offices, and, especially in his kingly office, <a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>.

As a general rule, God requires man to cooperate with him. "We are fellow-workers with God." "Aide-toi, le ecel t'aidera." But there are occasions when man must stand aloof, and all must be left to the almighty Disposer of all things. The invasion of Sennacherib was such an occasion. Human effort could not but be futile; and unless God gave deliver-ante in some strange and extraordinary way, there was no hope of escape: Judaea must cease to exist as an independent country. <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">will</span> <span class="cmt_word">be exalted among the heathen.</span> When a deliverance was plainly miraculous, the God of Israel got him special honour among the neighbouring heathen nations, who could not gainsay the fact that there had been a supernatural interposition (comp. <a href="/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4, 17, 18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will be exalted in the earth</span>. Exaltation among the neighbouring heathen had an effect upon a still wider circle (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/32-23.htm">2 Chronicles 32:23</a>, "And many brought gifts to Hezekiah, King of Judah, and he was magnified in the eyes of <span class="accented">all heathen</span> henceforth"). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 46:5-8) Just as, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>, a stream issued from Eden, to water the whole garden, so a stream makes Jerusalem as it were into another paradise: a river - whose streams make glad the city of Elohim (<a href="/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/48-9.htm">Psalm 48:9</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/101-8.htm">Psalm 101:8</a>); &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1497;&#1493; (used of the windings and branches of the main-stream) is a second permutative subject (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>). What is intended is the river of grace, which is also likened to a river of paradise in <a href="/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>. When the city of God is threatened and encompassed by foes, still she shall not hunger and thirst, nor fear and despair; for the river of grace and of her ordinances and promises flows with its rippling waves through the holy place, where the dwelling-place or tabernacle of the Most High is pitched. &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, Sanctum (cf. el-K&#803;uds as a name of Jerusalem), as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;, <a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, dwellings, like &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-2.htm">Psalm 84:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-5.htm">Psalm 132:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>, equivalent to "a glorious dwelling." In <a href="/psalms/46-6.htm">Psalm 46:6</a> in the place of the river we find Him from whom the river issues forth. Elohim helps her &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; - there is only a night of trouble, the return of the morning is also the sunrise of speedy help. The preterites in <a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a> are hypothetical: if peoples and kingdoms become enraged with enmity and totter, so that the church is in danger of being involved in this overthrow - all that God need to is to make a rumbling with His almighty voice of thunder (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493;, as in <a href="/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-8.htm">Jeremiah 12:8</a>, cf. &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, to make a lifting with the rod, <a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>), and forthwith the earth melts (muwg, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-5.htm">Amos 9:5</a>, Niph. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>, and frequently), i.e., their titanic defiance becomes cowardice, the bonds of their confederation slacken, and the strength they have put forth is destroyed - it is manifest that Jahve Tsebaoth is with His people. This name of God is, so to speak, indigenous to the Korahitic Psalms, for it is the proper name of God belonging to the time of the kings (vid., on <a href="/psalms/24-10.htm">Psalm 24:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-6.htm">Psalm 59:6</a>), on the very verge of which it occurs first of all in the mouth of Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>), and the Korahitic Psalms have a royal impress upon them. In the God, at whose summons all created powers are obliged to marshal themselves like the hosts of war, Israel has a steep stronghold, &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;, which cannot be scaled by any foe - the army of the confederate peoples and kingdoms, ere it has reached Jerusalem, is become a field of the dead. </body></html>
