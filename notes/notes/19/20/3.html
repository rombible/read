Neither the crown on the king's head, nor the grace in his heart, would make him free from trouble. Even the greatest of men must be much in prayer. Let none expect benefit by the prayers of the church, or their friends, who are capable of praying for themselves, yet neglect it. Pray that God would protect his person, and preserve his life. That God would enable him to go on in his undertakings for the public good. We may know that God accepts our spiritual sacrifices, if by his Spirit he kindles in our souls a holy fire of piety and love to God. Also, that the Lord would crown his enterprises with success. Our first step to victory in spiritual warfare is to trust only in the mercy and grace of God; all who trust in themselves will soon be cast down. Believers triumph in God, and his revelation of himself to them, by which they distinguish themselves from those that live without God in the world. Those who make God and his name their praise, may make God and his name their trust. This was the case when the pride and power of Jewish unbelief, and pagan idolatry, fell before the sermons and lives of the humble believers in Jesus. This is the case in every conflict with our spiritual enemies, when we engage them in the name, the spirit, and the power of Christ; and this will be the case at the last day, when the world, with the prince of it, shall be brought down and fall; but believers, risen-from the dead, through the resurrection of the Lord, shall stand, and sing his praises in heaven. In Christ's salvation let us rejoice; and set up our banners in the name of the Lord our God, assured that by the saving strength of his right hand we shall be conquerors over every enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Remember all thy offerings - On the meaning of the word here used, see the note at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>, where it is rendered oblations. The word occurs often in the Scriptures, and is sometimes rendered offering, and sometimes oblation. The word means an offering of any kind or anything that is presented to God, except a bloody sacrifice - anything offered as an expression of thankfulness, or with a view to obtain his favor. It is distinguished from bloody sacrifices, which are expressed by the word in the following clause. The word here employed occurs in the Psalms only in the following places: <a href="/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/96-8.htm">Psalm 96:8</a>; where it is rendered offering and offerings; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-12.htm">Psalm 45:12</a>, rendered gift; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>, rendered presents; and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, rendered sacrifice. The use of the word in this place proves that such offerings had been made to God by him who was about to go forth to the war; and the prayer of the people here is that God would remember all those offerings; that is, that he would grant the blessing which he who had offered them had sought to obtain.<p>And accept - Margin, turn to ashes, or make fat. The Hebrew word - &#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;  da&#770;she&#770;n - means properly to make fat, or marrowy, <a href="/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>; to pronounce or regard as fat; to be fat or satiated, or abundantly satisfied, <a href="/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a>. It conveys also the notion of reducing to ashes; perhaps from the fact that the victim which had been fattened for sacrifice was reduced to ashes; or, as Gesenius supposes (Lexicon, see &#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;  deshen), because "ashes were used by the ancients for fattening, that is, manuring the soil." The prayer here seems to be that God would "pronounce the burnt-offering fat;" that is, that he would regard it favorably, or would accept it. This proves, also, that a sacrifice had been made with a view to propitiate the divine favor in regard to the expedition which had been undertaken; that is, a solemn act of devotion, according to the manner of worship which then obtained, had been performed with a view to secure the divine favor and protection. The example is one which suggests the propriety of always entering upon any enterprise by solemn acts of worship, or by supplicating the divine blessing; that is, by acknowledging our dependence on God, and asking his guidance and his protecting care.<p>Thy burnt sacrifice - The word used here denotes bloody offerings; see the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>. These offerings were designed especially for the expiation of sin, and for thus securing the divine favor. They were an acknowledgment of guilt, and they were offered with a view to secure the pardon of sin, and, in connection with that, the favor of God. In similar circumstances we approach God, not by an offering which we make, whether bloody or bloodless, but through the one great sacrifice made by the Redeemer on the cross for the sins of the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. all thy offerings&#8212;or gifts, vegetable offerings.<p>accept&#8212;literally, "turn to ashes" (compare 1Ki 18:38).<p>Selah&#8212;(See on [578]Ps 3:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Remember, </span> to wit, with acceptance, as it follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy offerings; </span> offered either by thee at thy entrance upon this expedition; or by us thy people on thy behalf, or by thine appointment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Accept, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">turn to ashes</span>, by fire sent from heaven in token of his acceptance, as was usual; of which see <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm" title="And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed on the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.">Leviticus 9:24</a> <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm" title="Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.">1 Kings 18:38</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Remember all thy offerings,....

To be desired are the revealed words of God, to him who possesses them as an outward possession; and to him who has received them inwardly they are sweet. The poet, who is himself conscious of being a servant of God, and of striving to act as such, makes use of these words for the end for which they are revealed: he is &#1504;&#1494;&#1492;&#1512;, one who suffers himself to be enlightened, instructed, and warned by them. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; belongs to &#1504;&#1494;&#1492;&#1512; (according to the usual arrangement of the words, e.g., <a href="/hosea/6-11.htm">Hosea 6:11</a>), just as in <a href="/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a> it belongs to &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498;.

Thus, then, inasmuch as the Law is not only a copy of the divine will, but also a mirror of self-knowledge, in which a man may behold and come to know himself, he prays for forgiveness in respect of the many sins of infirmity, - though for the most part unperceived by him, - to which, even the pardoned one succumbs. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492; (in the terminology of the Law, &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;) comprehends the whole province of the peccatum involuntarium, both the peccatum ignoranitiae and the peccatum infirmitatis. The question delicta quis intelligit is equivalent to the negative clause: no one can discern his faults, on account of the heart of man being unfathomable and on account of the disguise, oftentimes so plausible, and the subtlety of sin. Hence, as an inference, follows the prayer: pronounce me free also &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, ab occultis (peccatis, which, however, cannot be supplied on grammatical grounds), equivalent to mee`alumiym (<a href="/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a>), i.e., all those sins, which even he, who is most earnestly striving after sanctification, does not discern, although he may desire to know them, by reason of the ever limited nature of his knowledge both of himself and of sin.<p>(Note: In the Arab proverb, "no sin which is persisted in is small, no sin great for which forgiveness is sought of God," Arab. s&#803;g&#305;&#770;rt, directly means a little and Arab. kb&#305;&#770;rt, a great sin, vid., Allgem.

For if &#1494;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; had been intended of arrogant and insolent possessors of power (Ewald), the prayer would have taken some other form than that of "keeping back" (&#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498; as in <a href="/1_samuel/25-39.htm">1 Samuel 25:39</a> in the mouth of David). &#1494;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, presumptuous sins, when they are repeated, become dominant sins, which irresistibly enslave the man (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; with a non-personal subject, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-4.htm">Isaiah 3:4</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>); hence the last member of the climax (which advances from the peccatum involuntarium to the proaereticum, and from this to the regnans): let them not have dominion over me (&#1489;&#1497; with Dech in Baer; generally wrongly marked with Munach).<p>Then (&#1488;&#1494;), when Thou bestowest this twofold favour upon me, the favour of pardon and the grace of preservation, shall I be blameless (&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; 1 fut. Kal, instead of &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, with &#1497; as a characteristic of e&#772;) and absolved (&#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; not Piel, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-13.htm">Psalm 19:13</a>, but Niph., to be made pure, absolved) from great transgression. &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; <p>(Note: The Gaja with &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; is intended in this instance, where &#1502;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1512;&#1489; are to be read in close connection, to secure distinctness of pronunciation for the unaccented &#1506;, as e.g., is also the case in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a>, &#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506; (ba&#772;k&#803;a&#8219;ja&#772;m).)<p>from &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (root &#1508;&#1513;), to spread out, go beyond the bounds, break through, trespass, is a collective name for deliberate and reigning, dominant sin, which breaks through man's relation of favour with God, and consequently casts him out of favour, - in one word, for apostasy. Finally, the psalmist supplicates a gracious acceptance of his prayer, in which both mouth and heart accord, supported by the faithfulness, stable as the rock (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;), and redeeming love (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497; redemptor, vindex, root &#1490;&#1500;, &#1495;&#1500;, to loose, redeem) of his God. &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; is a standing expression of the sacrificial tra, e.g., <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>. The &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a>, belongs to &#1500;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, stands in the second member in accordance with the "parallelism by postponement." Prayer is a sacrifice offered by the inner man. The heart meditates and fashions it; and the mouth presents it, by uttering that which is put into the form of words. </body></html>
