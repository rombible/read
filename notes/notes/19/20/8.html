Neither the crown on the king's head, nor the grace in his heart, would make him free from trouble. Even the greatest of men must be much in prayer. Let none expect benefit by the prayers of the church, or their friends, who are capable of praying for themselves, yet neglect it. Pray that God would protect his person, and preserve his life. That God would enable him to go on in his undertakings for the public good. We may know that God accepts our spiritual sacrifices, if by his Spirit he kindles in our souls a holy fire of piety and love to God. Also, that the Lord would crown his enterprises with success. Our first step to victory in spiritual warfare is to trust only in the mercy and grace of God; all who trust in themselves will soon be cast down. Believers triumph in God, and his revelation of himself to them, by which they distinguish themselves from those that live without God in the world. Those who make God and his name their praise, may make God and his name their trust. This was the case when the pride and power of Jewish unbelief, and pagan idolatry, fell before the sermons and lives of the humble believers in Jesus. This is the case in every conflict with our spiritual enemies, when we engage them in the name, the spirit, and the power of Christ; and this will be the case at the last day, when the world, with the prince of it, shall be brought down and fall; but believers, risen-from the dead, through the resurrection of the Lord, shall stand, and sing his praises in heaven. In Christ's salvation let us rejoice; and set up our banners in the name of the Lord our God, assured that by the saving strength of his right hand we shall be conquerors over every enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They are brought down and fallen - That is, those who trust in chariots and horses. The reference here is undoubtedly to the enemies against whom the king was about to wage war, and the language here is indicative of his certain conviction that they would be vanquished. So certain was he now of this that he could speak of it as if it were already done. "They "are" brought down." He sees them in anticipation prostrate and subdued; he goes forth to war with the certainty on his mind that this would occur. The word rendered "brought down" - &#1499;&#1512;&#1506;  ka&#770;ra&#8219; - means "to bend," "to bow" (as the knees); and then it refers to one who bows down before an enemy, that is, one who is subdued, <a href="/isaiah/10-4.htm">Isaiah 10:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-12.htm">Isaiah 65:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-31.htm">Psalm 78:31</a>.<p>But we are risen, and stand upright - That is, he sees this in anticipation.

As for those who rest on Jehovah, they are often cast down at the first onset, but an Almighty arm uplifts them, and they joyfully stand upright.

This may also include the first resurrection, which the saints will have a part in; the dead in Christ will rise first, and will stand before the Lord with confidence, and not be ashamed; when the ungodly shall not stand in judgment, nor sinners in, the congregation of the righteous; for though these words are expressed in the present tense, because of the certainty of them, they belong to future times; hence the following petitions. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/psalms/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{g}</span> They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.</span><p>(g) The worldlings who do not put their trust in God alone.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">They are brought down</span>] R.V., They are bowed down; the same word as in <a href="/psalms/18-39.htm" title="For you have girded me with strength to the battle: you have subdued under me those that rose up against me.">Psalm 18:39</a>.

The futures in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/20-2.htm">Psalm 20:2</a>, standing five times at the head of the climactic members of the parallelism, are optatives. &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/20-6.htm">Psalm 20:6</a>, also continues the chain of wishes, of which even &#1504;&#1512;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492; (cf. <a href="/psalms/69-15.htm">Psalm 69:15</a>) forms one of the links. The wishes of the people accompany both the prayer and the sacrifice. "The Name of the God of Jacob" is the self-manifesting power and grace of the God of Israel. &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; is used in poetry interchangeably with &#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;, just like &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;. Alsh&#1498;ch refers to <a href="/genesis/35-3.htm">Genesis 35:3</a>; and it is not improbable that the desire moulds itself after the fashion of the record of the fact there handed down to us. May Jahve, who, as the history of Jacob shows, hears (and answers) in the day of distress, hear the king; may the Name of the God of Jacob bear him away from his foes to a triumphant height. &#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489; alternates with &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; (<a href="/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a>) in this sense. This intercession on the behalf of the praying one is made in the sanctuary on the heights of Zion, where Jahve sits enthroned. May He send him succour from thence, like auxiliary troops that decide the victory. The king offers sacrifice. He offers sacrifice according to custom before the commencement of the battle (<a href="/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>., and cf. the phrase &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;), a whole burnt-offering and at the same time a meat or rather meal offering also, &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;;<p>(Note: This, though not occurring in the Old Testament, is the principal form of the plural, which, as even David Kimchi recognises in his Lexicon, points to a verb &#1502;&#1504;&#1495; (just as &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; point to &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1500;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1495;); whereas other old grammarians supposed &#1504;&#1495;&#1492; to be the root, and were puzzled with the traditional pronunciation menacho&#770;th, but without reason.)<p>for every whole offering and every shelamim - or peace-offering had a meat-offering and a drink-offering as its indispensable accompaniment. The word &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; is perfectly familiar in the ritual of the meal-offering. That portion of the meal-offering, only a part of which was placed upon the altar (to which, however, according to traditional practice, does not belong the accompanying meal-offering of the &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514; &#1504;&#1505;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, which was entirely devoted to the altar), which ascended with the altar fire is called &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (cf. <a href="/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>), that which brings to remembrance with God him for whom it is offered up (not "incense," as Hupfeld renders it); for the designation of the offering of jealousy, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>, as "bringing iniquity to remembrance before God" shows, that in the meal-offering ritual &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; retains the very same meaning that it has in other instances. Every meal-offering is in a certain sense a &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514; &#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; a esnes . Hence here the prayer that Jahve would graciously remember them is combined with the meal-offerings.<p>As regards the &#8219;olah, the wish "let fire from heaven (<a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>) turn it to ashes," would not be vain. But the language does not refer to anything extraordinary; and in itself the consumption of the offering to ashes (Bttcher) is no mark of gracious acceptance. Moreover, as a denominative from &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, fat ashes, &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1503; means "to clean from ashes," and not: to turn into ashes. On the other hand, &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1503; also signifies "to make fat," <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, and this effective signification is applied declaratively in this instance: may He find thy burnt-offering fat, which is equivalent to: may it be to Him a &#1512;&#1497;&#1495; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1495; [an odour of satisfaction, a sweet-smelling savour]. The voluntative ah only occurs here and in <a href="/job/11-17.htm">Job 11:17</a> (which see) and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>, in the 3 pers.; and in this instance, just as with the cohortative in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a>, we have a change of the lengthening into a sharpening of the sound (cf. the exactly similar change of forms in <a href="/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>; <a href="/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-14.htm">Proverbs 24:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/25-13.htm">Ezekiel 25:13</a>) as is very frequently the case in &#1502;&#1492; for &#1502;&#1492;. The alteration to &#1497;&#1491;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; or &#1497;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468; (Hitzig) is a felicitous but needless way of getting rid of the rare form. The explanation of the intensifying of the music here is, that the intercessory song of the choir is to be simultaneous with the presentation upon the altar (&#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1512;&#1492;). &#1506;&#1510;&#1492; is the resolution formed in the present wartime. "Because of thy salvation," i.e., thy success in war, is, as all the language is here, addressed to the king, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/21-2.htm">Psalm 21:2</a>, where it is addressed to Jahve, and intended of the victory accorded to him. It is needless to read &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; instead of &#1504;&#1491;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, after the rendering of the lxx megaluntheeso'metha. &#1504;&#1491;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; is a denominative from &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500;: to wave a banner. In the closing line, the rejoicing of hope goes back again to the present and again assumes the form of an intercessory desire. </body></html>
