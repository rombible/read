Observe, reader, when God puts grace into the heart, he puts gladness into it; nor is any joy comparable to that which gracious souls have in the communications of the divine favour, no, not the joy of harvest, even of a plentiful harvest, when the corn and wine greatly increase. This is gladness in the heart, inward, solid, substantial joy; but the mirth of carnal and worldly people is only a flash, a shadow, for even <span class="ital">in laughter their hearts are sorrowful, </span><a href="/proverbs/14-13.htm" title="Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.">Proverbs 14:13</a>. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/psalms/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:6-8 Wordly people inquire for good, not for the chief good; all they want is outward good, present good, partial good, good meat, good drink, a good trade, and a good estate; but what are all these worth? Any good will serve the turn of most men, but a gracious soul will not be put off so. Lord, let us have thy favour, and let us know that we have it, we desire no more; let us be satisfied of thy loving-kindness, and will be satisfied with it. Many inquire after happiness, but David had found it. When God puts grace in the heart, he puts gladness in the heart. Thus comforted, he pitied, but neither envied nor feared the most prosperous sinner. He commits all his affairs to God, and is prepared to welcome his holy will. But salvation is in Christ alone; where will those appear who despise him as their Mediator, and revile him in his disciples? May they stand in awe, and no longer sin against the only remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast put gladness in my heart - Thou hast made me happy, to wit, in the manner specified in <a href="/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>. Many had sought happiness in other things; he had sought it in the favor of the Lord, and the Lord had given him a degree of happiness which they had never found in the most prosperous worldly condition. This happiness had its seat in the "heart," and not in any external circumstances. All true happiness must have its seat there, for if the heart is sad, of what avail are the most prosperous external circumstances?<p>More than in the time - More than they have had in the time referred to; or, more than I should have in such circumstances.<p>That their corn and their wine increased - When they were most successful and prosperous in worldly things. This shows that when, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>, he says that many inquired who would show them any "good," what they aspired after was worldly prosperity, here expressed by an increase of grain and wine. The word rendered "corn" means grain in general; the word rendered "wine" - &#1514;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;  t&#305;&#770;yro&#770;sh - means properly "must, new wine," <a href="/isaiah/65-8.htm">Isaiah 65:8</a>. The reference here is probably to the joy of harvest, when the fruits of the earth were gathered in, an occasion among the Hebrews, as it is among most people, of joy and rejoicing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. corn and wine&#8212;literally, "new corn and wine."<p>increased&#8212;an abundant harvest giving great joy (Isa 9:3).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/4.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.<p>"It is better," said one, "to feel God's favour one hour in our repenting souls, than to sit whole ages under the warmest sunshine that this world affordeth." Christ in the heart is better than corn in the barn, or wine in the vat. Corn and wine are but fruits of the world, but the light of God's countenance is the ripe fruit of heaven. "Thou art with me," is a far more blessed cry than "Harvest home." Let my granary be empty, I am yet full of blessings if Jesus Christ smiles upon me; but if I have all the world, I am poor without Him.<p>We should not fail to remark that this verse is the saying of the righteous man, in opposition to the saying of the many. How quickly doth the tongue betray the character! "Speak, that I may see thee!" said Socrates to a fair boy. The metal of a bell is best known by its sound. Birds reveal their nature by their song. Owls cannot sing the carol of the lark, nor can the nightingale hoot like the owl.

The Ethiopic version reads it "into our heart"; in granting the above request; for, nothing so rejoices the hearts of God's people as the light of his countenance, or the enjoyment of his gracious presence: this was matter of exceeding joy to Christ himself, <a href="/psalms/21-6.htm">Psalm 21:6</a>; and so it is to all his members; this causes inward gladness, gladness of heart, and is opposed to the external rejoicings of wicked men and of hypocrites: and this is of God's putting into the heart; and indeed none can put gladness either into a wounded conscience, into the heart of a sensible sinner, or into the soul of one that is panting after the presence of God, and communion with him, but God himself; <p>more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased: meaning the time of harvest and of vintage; when there is a good harvest, and a good vintage, there is joy among men, and the contrary when it is otherwise, <a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>; these things being of general use, spread an universal joy among people; there is scarce any earthly thing that occasions more joy than these do: and yet the joy on such occasions is not to be compared with spiritual joy, that is a joy unspeakable and full of glory. Some take the to be not comparative, but causal, and render the words (s), "thou hast put gladness in ray heart from the time that their corn", &amp;c. as do the Chaldee paraphrase and Syriac versions; and the Arabic version renders it, "because of the multitude of fruits", &amp;c. and then the sense is, as if David should say concerning his enemies, <p>"I never envied their prosperity, I always rejoiced when they had a good harvest, or vintage, and still do; and yet they have rose up and rebelled against me, and requited me evil for good.'' <p>And this sense is given into by the Jewish commentators (t), and shows of what an admirable spirit, and in what a sweet disposition of mind, the psalmist was; that while his enemies were seeking his life he was rejoicing in their prosperity; and is a sad aggravation of their wickedness: and this may also be understood of the rejoicing of David, and even of the Messiah, and likewise of all good men, at the spiritual prosperity of the saints, at any increase of grace, spiritual knowledge, and joy, signified by these outward things, as in <a href="/jeremiah/31-12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>; the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, add "oil" to corn and wine. <p>(s)  "a vel ex tempore quo frumentum eorum", &amp;c.

David is an example to the de-spending ones. Notwithstanding his sufferings and calamities, God has looked on him, and so "put gladness in his heart" - a gladness which far exceeds that of his adversaries. Though they are in prosperity, and have their corn and wine increased, and enjoy all the "outward material blessings  promised to Israel - the wheat and the grape - for a supply of which he is indebted to the generosity of friends" (Kay), yet he would not change places with them. The spiritual joy which fills his own heart is preferable to any amount of material comforts and pleasures. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 4:2) Jahve is &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, the possessor of righteousness, the author of righteousness, and the vindicator of misjudged and persecuted righteousness. This God of righteousness David believingly calls his God (cf. <a href="/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-11.htm">Psalm 59:11</a>); for the righteousness he possesses, he possesses in Him, and the righteousness he looks for, he looks for in Him. That this is not in vain, his previous experience assures him: Thou hast made a breadth (space) for me when in a strait. In connection with this confirmatory relation of &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512; &#1492;&#1512;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; it is more probable that we have before us an attributive clause (Hitz.), than that we have an independent one, and at any rate it is a retrospective clause. &#1492;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1514; is not precative (Bttch.), for the perf. of certainty with a precative colouring is confined to such exclamatory utterances as <a href="/job/21-16.htm">Job 21:16</a> (which see). He bases his prayer on two things, viz., on his fellowship with God, the righteous God, and on His justifying grace which he has already experienced. He has been many times in a strait already, and God has made a broad place for him. The idea of the expansion of the breathing (of the stream of air) and of space is attached to the &#1495;, Arab. h&#803;, of &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;, root &#1512;&#1495; (Deutsch. Morgenl.
