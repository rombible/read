Selah.">Psalm 4:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Ye sons of men — </span>David is considered here by many commentators as addressing not mankind in general, but only <span class="ital">princes, potentates, </span>and <span class="ital">persons of high degree. </span>And perhaps, the phrase, <span class="ital">sons of men, </span>may often bear that sense in the Old Testament. But it must be observed, the Hebrew here, <span class="greekheb">בני אישׁ</span>, <span class="ital">benee ish, </span>signifies, <span class="ital">sons of man, </span>and not <span class="ital">sons of men, </span>and seems evidently to be of the same import as the phrase, <span class="ital">sons of Adam, </span>and if so, must include all mankind. Nor is there any proof from the context, or any part of the Psalm, that he is addressing merely those great men among the Jews or Israelites who revolted from him under Absalom, or even that he had Absalom’s rebellion particularly in his view when he composed this Psalm. He rather seems to be addressing the generality of his countrymen, or, rather, all into whose hands the Psalm might come, on subjects of infinite concern to all. <span class="ital">How long will ye turn my glory into shame? </span>— Or, as the Hebrew is literally rendered, <span class="ital">How long shall my glory be for a shame? </span>that is, be made by you a matter of reproach and scorn. And by his <span class="ital">glory </span>he probably meant, not only that honour which God had conferred upon him in advancing him to the throne, which, when he was in great straits and dangers, his enemies might possibly reproach and make the subject of derision; but also, and especially, the glory of God and his Messiah. For, as Dr. Horne justly observes, “If the Israelitish monarch conceived he had just cause to expostulate with his enemies for despising the royal majesty with which Jehovah had invested his anointed, of how much severer reproof shall they be thought worthy who blaspheme the essential glory of (God and) King Messiah, which shines forth by his gospel in his church.” But are not these rather to be considered as the words of God himself, here reasoning with sinners, by the psalmist, and calling them to repentance? As if he had said, You that go on in the neglect of God and his worship, and in contempt of the kingdom of Christ and his government, consider what you do. You not only disgrace yourselves, debase the dignity of your nature, the excellence of those powers with which you are endued; but you dishonour me, your Maker, and turn my glory, and that of my Son, your Messiah, into shame. Or, if they be David’s words, they may still be interpreted to the same sense, for his God was <span class="ital">his glory, </span>as he calls him <a href="/psalms/3-3.htm" title="But you, O LORD, are a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.">Psalm 3:3</a>. Idolaters are charged with <span class="ital">changing the glory of God </span>into shame, <a href="/romans/1-23.htm" title="And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beasts, and creeping things.">Romans 1:23</a>. And all wilful sinners do so by disobeying the commands of his law, despising the offers of his grace, and giving that affection and service to the creature which are due to God only. Those that profane God’s holy name, that ridicule his word and ordinances; and, while they <span class="ital">profess to know him, by works deny him, </span>do what in them lies to turn his glory into shame. <span class="ital">How long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? — </span>That is, lying or a lie. You are yourselves vain, and desire and pursue vain things, and you love to be and do so. You set your hearts upon that which will prove, at last, vanity and a lie. They that love the world and seek the things that are beneath, that please themselves with the delights of sense, and choose for their portion the wealth of this world, love vanity, and seek lies, for these things will deceive and so ruin them. How long will you do this? Will you never be wise for yourselves, never consider your duty and interest? <span class="ital">When shall it once be? </span><a href="/jeremiah/13-27.htm" title="I have seen your adulteries, and your neighings, the lewdness of your prostitution, and your abominations on the hills in the fields.

He who will not ask such blessings as pardon, and justifying righteousness, and eternal life, must perish for the want of them. Alas! that so many should make so fearful a choice. The psalmist warns against sin. Keep up holy reverence of the glory and majesty of God. You have a great deal to say to your hearts, they may be spoken with, let it not be unsaid. Examine them by serious self-reflection; let your thoughts fasten upon that which is good, and keep close to it. Consider your ways, and before you turn to sleep at night, examine your consciences with respect to what you have done in the day; particularly what you have done amiss, that you may repent of it. when you awake in the night, meditate upon God, and the things that belong to your peace. Upon a sick-bed, particularly, we should consider our ways. Be still. when you have asked conscience a question, be serious, be silent, wait for an answer. Open not the mouth to excuse sin. All confidence must be pan answer. Open not the mouth to excuse sin. All confidence only: therefore, after commanding the sacrifices of righteousness, the psalmist says, Put your trust in the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O ye sons of men - Turning from God to men; from Him in whom he hoped for protection to those who were engaged in persecuting him. We are not, of course, to suppose that they were present with him, but this is an earnest, poetic remonstrance, "as if" they were with him. The reference is doubtless to Absalom and his followers; and he calls them "sons of men," as having human feelings, passions, and purposes, in strong distinction from that righteous God to whom he had just made his solemn appeal. God was holy, true, and just, and he might appeal to Him; they were ambitious and wicked, and from them he had nothing to hope. He looked upon God as righteous altogether; he looked upon them as altogether depraved and wicked. God he regarded as his just Protector; them he regarded as seeking only to wrong and crush him.<p>How long - The phrase used here might refer either to "time" or to "extent." How long in regard to "time," - or to what "degree" or "extent" will you thus persecute me? The former, however, seems to be the true signification.<p>Will ye turn my glory into shame - My honor, or what becomes my rank and station. If this refers to the rebellion in the time of Absalom, the allusion is to the fact that his enemies were endeavoring to rob him of his scepter and his crown, and to reduce him to the lowest condition of beggary and want; and he asks with earnestness how long they intended to do him so great injustice and wrong.<p>Will ye love vanity - Compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>. That is, how long will you act as if you were in love with a vain and impracticable thing; a thing which "must" be hopeless in the end. The idea is, that God had chosen him, and anointed him, and had determined that he should be king <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>, and therefore, that their efforts "must be" ultimately unsuccessful. The object at which they were aiming could not be accomplished, and he asks how long they would thus engage in what must, from the nature of the case, be fruitless.<p>And seek after leasing - The word "leasing" is the Old English word for "lie." The idea here is, that they were pursuing a course which would yet prove to be a delusion - the hope of overturning his throne. The same question, in other respects, may be asked now. Men are seeking that which cannot be accomplished, and are acting under the influence of a lie. What else are the promises of permanent happiness in the pursuits of pleasure and ambition? What else are their attempts to overthrow religion and virtue in the world?<p>Selah - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/3-2.htm">Psalm 3:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. sons of men&#8212;men of note or prominence (compare 2Ch 21:9).<p>turn my glory&#8212;or, "royal dignity."<p>into shame&#8212;or, "reproach."<p>vanity&#8212;a foolish and hopeless enterprise (Ps 2:1).<p>leasing&#8212;a lie.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/4.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.<p>In this second division of the Psalm, we are led from the closet of prayer into the field of conflict. Remark the undaunted courage of the man of God. He allows that his enemies are great men (for such is the import of the Hebrew words translated - sons of men), but still he believes them to be foolish men, and therefore chides them, as though they were but children. He tells them that they love vanity, and seek after leasing, that is, lying, empty fancies, vain conceits, wicked fabrications. He asks them how long they mean to make his honour a jest, and his fame a mockery? A little of such mirth is too much, why need they continue to indulge in it? Had they not been long enough upon the watch for his halting? Had not repeated disappointments convinced them that the Lord's anointed was not to be overcome by all their calumnies? Did they mean to jest their souls into hell, and go on with their laughter until swift vengeance should turn their merriment into howling? In the contemplation of their perverse continuance in their vain and lying pursuits, the Psalmist solemnly pauses and inserts a Selah. Surely we too may stop awhile, and meditate upon the deep-seated folly of the wicked, their continuance in evil, and their sure destruction; and we may learn to admire that grace which has made us to differ, and taught us to love truth, and seek after righteousness. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">O ye sons of men, </span> i.e. princes and potentates, as this Hebrew phrase seems and is thought to signify, who are engaged with Saul or Absalom against me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Will ye turn my glory into shame?</span> or, shall <span class="ital">my glory</span> be <span class="ital">for a shame</span>, i.e. be made by you matter of reproach and scorn?

Only this seems to add some emphasis, and to intimate the fair hopes and promising probabilities of success which they had, and which aggravate their disappointment. Or <span class="ital">by lying</span> he may design those horrid calumnies, which the partisans either of Saul or Absalom had raised against him, and which they joined with their other endeavours to make him odious to all the people, and so the better to effect his ruin. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O ye sons of men,.... Meaning great men, the nobles of Israel; and so the Jewish interpreters (k) generally explain it; such as Ahithophel, and others, who were in the conspiracy with Absalom, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>, and so they were the kings and princes of the earth, and the rulers of the Jewish sanhedrim, the chief priests and elders, who were the enemies of Christ; and such, generally speaking, have been the persecutors of the saints; these men of power and authority, of dignity and honour, and who were in high places, and boasted of their titles and grandeur, the psalmist addresses by way of expostulation in the following words; <p>how long will ye turn my glory into shame? Meaning either God, who was his glory, <a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>; whom they reproached when they said there was no help for him in him; or his tongue, the instrument of praise, and the songs of praise he expressed by it, <a href="/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8</a>; which they jeered and scoffed at: or rather his royal glory and majesty, which they attempted to vail by casting him down from his excellency, by dethroning him, and setting up Absalom in his room. So the Jews endeavoured to turn the glory of Christ into shame, which lay in his being the only begotten of the Father; by denying his sonship, by condemning him to death; because he said he was the Son of God; and by mocking at him under that character on the cross; and also by their spitting upon, buffeting, and crucifying the Lord of glory; by reproaching his Gospel, ministers, and people; and by not acknowledging him as the Messiah, and submitting to his righteousness. And wicked men do as much as in them lies to turn the glory of the saints into shame, by aspersing their character, taking away their good name and reputation among men; by reproaching and reviling them, and speaking all manner of evil of them; and by persecuting them in the most violent manner; <p>how long will ye love vanity; or "a vain thing" (l). Such as the placing of Absalom upon the throne, on which their hearts were set; and such was the vain imagination of the Jews, with which they pleased themselves, that Jesus should die, and his name perish; and such are all the attempts of wicked men to ruin and destroy the people and interest of Christ; for no weapon formed against them shall prosper; <p>and seek after leasing? Or "a lie" (m); or that which fails and deceives, as a lie does: and such were all the counsels and designs of the great men of Israel against David: and so the Jews may be said to seek after a lie, when they seek after another Messiah besides Jesus of Nazareth: for every other proves a "Bar Cozbi", that is, the son of a lie; as the false Messiah in Adrian's time was called by themselves. And so do all such as seek after and embrace false doctrines, errors, and heresies, and are given up to believe them. Now the psalmist suggests that these great men were obstinate, and continued in these sinful practices; and that in the issue all their efforts would be vain and fruitless; and which he further strengthens by observing to them what follows. <p>Selah; on this word; see Gill on <a href="/psalms/3-2.htm">Psalm 3:2</a>. <p>(k) Jarchi, Aben Ezra, Kimchi, &amp; Ben Melech in loc.

Joab's treachery and falsehood were notorious (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8-10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 3:4-5) But cleansed by penitence he stands in a totally different relationship to God and God to him from that which men suppose. Every hour he has reason to fear some overwhelming attack but Jahve is the shield which covers him behind and before (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; constr. of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;  equals  Arab. ba&#8219;da, prop. pone, post). His kingdom is taken from him, but Jahve is his glory. With covered head and dejected countenance he ascended the Mount of Olives (<a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>), but Jahve is the "lifter up of his head," inasmuch as He comforts and helps him. The primary passage of this believing utterance "God is a shield" is <a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>). Very far from praying in vain, he is assured, that when he prays his prayer will be heard and answered. The rendering "I cried and He answered me" is erroneous here where &#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; does not stand in an historical connection. The future of sequence does not require it, as is evident from <a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>. (comp. on <a href="/psalms/120-1.htm">Psalm 120:1</a>); it is only an expression of confidence in the answer on God's part, which will follow his prayer. In constructions like &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497; &#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, Hitzig and Hupfeld regard &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497; as the narrower subject-notion beside the more general one (as <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-11.htm">Psalm 69:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/83-19.htm">Psalm 83:19</a>): my voice - I cried; but the position of the words is not favourable to this in the passage before us and in <a href="/psalms/17-10.htm">Psalm 17:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-7.htm">Psalm 27:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-17.htm">Psalm 66:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>, though it may be in <a href="/psalms/69-11.htm">Psalm 69:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/108-2.htm">Psalm 108:2</a>. According to Ew. 281, c, &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497; is an accusative of more precise definition, as without doubt in <a href="/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a> cf. <a href="/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>.; the cry is thereby described as a loud cry.<p>(Note: Bttcher, Collectanea pp. 166f., also adopts the view, that &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;, &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497; are each appositum vicarium subjecti and therefore nomin. in such passages. But 1) the fact that &#1488;&#1514; never stands beside them is explained by the consideration that it is not suited to an adverbial collateral definition. And 2) that elsewhere the same notions appear as direct subjects, just as 3) that elsewhere they alternate with the verbal subject-notion in the parallel member of the verse (<a href="/psalms/130-5.htm">Psalm 130:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-4.htm">Proverbs 8:4</a>) - these last two admit of no inference. The controverted question of the syntax is, moreover, an old one and has been treated of at length by Kimchi in his Book of Roots s. r. &#1488;&#1493;&#1492;.)<p>To this cry, as &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; as being a pure mood of sequence implies, succeeds the answer, or, which better corresponds to the original meaning of &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; (comp. Arab. &#8219;nn, to meet, stand opposite) reply;<p>(Note: Vid., Redslob in his treatise: Die Integritat der Stelle <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/7.htm">Hosea 7</a>.4-10 in Frage gestellt S. 7.) <p>and it comes from the place whither it was directed: &#1502;&#1492;&#1512; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1493;&#1468;. He had removed the ark from Kirjath Jeraim to Zion. He had not taken it with him when he left Jerusalem and fled before Absolom, <a href="/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a>. He was therefore separated by a hostile power from the resting-place of the divine presence. But his prayer urged its way on to the cherubim-throne; and to the answer of Him who is enthroned there, there is no separating barrier of space or created things. </body></html>
