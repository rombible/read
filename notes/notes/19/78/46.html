God, notwithstanding, in His compassion restrains His anger; but Israel's God-tempting conduct was continued, even after the journey through the desert, in Canaan, and the miracles of judgment amidst which the deliverance out of Egypt had been effected were forgotten. With &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in <a href="/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a><p>(Note: According to B. Kiddushin 30a, this <a href="/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a> is the middle one of the 5896 &#1508;&#1505;&#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1503;, &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, of the Psalter. According to B. Maccoth 22b, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a>, and previously <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58-59</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-8.htm">Deuteronomy 29:8</a> [9], were recited when the forty strokes of the lash save one, which according to <a href="/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a> Paul received five times, were being counted out to the culprit.)<p>begins an adversative clause, which is of universal import as far as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;, and then becomes historical. <a href="/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a> expands what lies in &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;: He expiates iniquity and, by letting mercy instead of right take its course, arrests the destruction of the sinner. With &#1493;&#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; (Ges. &#1431;&#1431;142, 2) this universal truth is supported out of the history of Israel. As this history shows, He has many a time called back His anger, i.e., checked it in its course, and not stirred up all His blowing anger (cf. <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>), i.e., His anger in all its fulness and intensity. We see that <a href="/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a> refers to His conduct towards Israel, then <a href="/psalms/78-39.htm">Psalm 78:39</a> follows with the ground of the determination, and that in the form of an inference drawn from such conduct towards Israel. He moderated His anger against Israel, and consequently took human frailty and perishableness into consideration. The fact that man is flesh (which not merely affirms his physical fragility, but also his moral weakness, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>, cf. <a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>), and that, after a short life, he falls a prey to death, determines God to be long-suffering and kind; it was in fact sensuous desire and loathing by which Israel was beguiled time after time. The exclamation "how oft!" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40</a>, calls attention to the praiseworthiness of this undeserved forbearance.<p>But with <a href="/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a> the record of sins begins anew. There is nothing by which any reference of this <a href="/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a> to the last example of insubordination recorded in the Pentateuch, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1-9</a> (Hitzig), is indicated. The poet comes back one more to the provocations of God by the Israel of the wilderness in order to expose the impious ingratitude which revealed itself in this conduct. &#1492;&#1514;&#1493;&#1492; is the causative of &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  Syriac tewa&#772;', &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1488;, to repent, to be grieved, lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;. The miracles of the tie of redemption are now brought before the mind in detail, ad exaggerandum crimen tentationis Deu cum summa ingratitudine conjunctum (Venema). The time of redemption is called &#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, as in <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a> the hexahemeron. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (synon. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;) is used as in <a href="/exodus/10-2.htm">Exodus 10:2</a>. We have already met with &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1510;&#1512; in <a href="/psalms/44-11.htm">Psalm 44:11</a>. The first of the plagues of Egypt (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/7-14.htm">Exodus 7:14-25</a>), the turning of the waters into blood, forms the beginning in <a href="/psalms/78-44.htm">Psalm 78:44</a>. From this the poet takes a leap over to the fourth plague, the &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; (lxx &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;), a grievous and destructive species of fly (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/8-20.htm">Exodus 8:20-32</a>), and combines with it the frogs, the second plague (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/8-1.htm">Exodus 8:1-15</a>). &#1510;&#1508;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1506; is the lesser Egyptian frog, Rana Mosaica, which is even now called Arab. d&#803;fd&#8219;, d&#803;ofda. Next in <a href="/psalms/78-46.htm">Psalm 78:46</a> he comes to the eighth plague, the locusts, &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; (a more select name of the migratory locusts than &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;), <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1-20</a>; the third plague, the gnats and midges, &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, is left unmentioned in addition to the fourth, which is of a similar kind. For the chastisement by means of destructive living things is now closed, and in <a href="/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a> follows the smiting with hail, the seventh plague, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-13.htm">Exodus 9:13-35</a>. &#1495;&#1504;&#1502;&#1500; (with pausal , not a&#772;, cf. in <a href="/ezekiel/8-2.htm">Ezekiel 8:2</a> the similarly formed &#1492;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1500;&#1492;) in the signification hoar-frost (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, lxx, Vulgate, Saadia, and Abulwald), or locusts (Targum &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;  equals  &#1495;&#1490;&#1489;), or ants (J. D. Michaelis), does not harmonize with the history; also the hoar-frost is called &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, the ant &#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1492; (collective in Arabic neml). Although only conjecturing from the context, we understand it, with Parchon and Kimchi, of hailstones or hail. With thick lumpy pieces of ice He smote down vines and sycamore-trees (Fayum was called in ancient Egyptian "the district of the sycamore"). &#1492;&#1512;&#1490; proceeds from the Biblical conception that the plant has a life of its own. The description of this plague is continued in <a href="/psalms/78-48.htm">Psalm 78:48</a>. Two MSS present &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; instead of &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;; but even supposing that &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; might signify the fever-burnings of the pestilence (vid., on <a href="/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a>), the mention of the pestilence follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-50.htm">Psalm 78:50</a>, and the devastation which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-19.htm">Exodus 9:19-22</a>, the hail caused among the cattle of the Egyptians is in its right place here. Moreover it is expressly said in <a href="/exodus/9-24.htm">Exodus 9:24</a> that there was conglomerate fire among the hail; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; are therefore flaming, blazing lightnings. </body></html>
