The law of God was given with a particular charge to teach it diligently to their children, that the church may abide for ever. Also, that the providences of God, both in mercy and in judgment, might encourage them to conform to the will of God. The works of God much strengthen our resolution to keep his commandments. Hypocrisy is the high road to apostacy; those that do not set their hearts right, will not be stedfast with God. Many parents, by negligence and wickedness, become murderers of their children.

That is, they took no pains to keep their heart aright, or to cherish right feelings toward God. They yielded to any sudden impulse of passion, even when it led them to revolt against God. This is as true of sinners now as it was of them, that they "take no pains" to have their hearts right with God. If they did, there would be no difficulty in doing it. It is not with them "an object of desire" to have their hearts right with God, and hence, nothing is more easy or natural than that they should rebel and go astray.<p>And whose spirit was not stedfast with God - That is, they themselves did not maintain a firm trust in God. They yielded readily to every impulse, and every passion, even when it tended to draw them away wholly from him. There was no such "strength" of attachment to him as would lead them to resist temptation, and they easily fell into the sin of idolatry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/78.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. stubborn and rebellious&#8212;(De 21:18).<p>set not their heart&#8212;on God's service (2Ch 12:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/78.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That set not their heart aright; </span> who though they outwardly and seemingly complied with the forms of worship which God had prescribed, yet <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">did not direct or prepare their hearts</span> to the obedience and service of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whose spirit was not stedfast with God; </span> who quickly discovered their hypocrisy by their apostacy from God, and from the religion which they had professed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/78.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And might not be as their fathers,....

It is not, however, with the external aspect of the history that he has to do, but with its internal teachings. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; is an allegory or parable, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;, more particularly the apophthegm as the characteristic species of poetry belonging to the Chokma, and then in general a discourse of an elevated style, full of figures, thoughtful, pithy, and rounded. &#1495;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492; is that which is entangled, knotted, involved, perlexe dictum. The poet, however, does not mean to say that he will literally discourse gnomic sentences and propound riddles, but that he will set forth the history of the fathers after the manner of a parable and riddle, so that it may become as a parable, i.e., a didactic history, and its events as marks of interrogation and nota-bene's to the present age. The lxx renders thus: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;. Instead of this the Gospel by Matthew has: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), and recognises in this language of the Psalm a prophecy of Christ; because it is moulded so appropriately for the mouth of Him who is the Fulfiller not only of the Law and of Prophecy, but also of the vocation of the prophet. It is the object-clause to &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;&#1491;, and not a relative clause belonging to the "riddles out of the age of yore," that follows in <a href="/psalms/78-3.htm">Psalm 78:3</a> with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, for that which has been heard only becomes riddles by the appropriation and turn the poet gives to it. <a href="/psalms/78-3.htm">Psalm 78:3</a> begins a new period (cf. <a href="/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-1.htm">Jeremiah 14:1</a>, and frequently): What we have heard, and in consequence thereof known, and what our fathers have told us (word for word, like <a href="/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1</a>; <a href="/judges/6-13.htm">Judges 6:13</a>), that will we not hide from their children (cf. <a href="/job/15-18.htm">Job 15:18</a>). The accentuation is perfectly correct. The Reb&#305;&#770;a by &#1502;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; has a greater distinctive force than the Reb&#305;&#770;a by &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; (&#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;); it is therefore to be rendered: telling to the later generation (which is just what is intended by the offspring of the fathers) the glorious deeds of Jahve, etc. The fut. consec. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501; joins on to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;. Glorious deeds, proofs of power, miracles hath He wrought, and in connection therewith set up an admonition in Jacob, and laid down an order in Israel, which He commanded our fathers, viz., to propagate by tradition the remembrance of those mighty deeds (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-8.htm">Exodus 13:8</a>, <a href="/exodus/13-14.htm">Exodus 13:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>, and other passages). &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;&#1501; has the same object as &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/4-22.htm">Joshua 4:22</a>. The matter in question is not the giving of the Law in general, as the purpose of which, the keeping of the laws, ought then to have been mentioned before anything else, but a precept, the purpose of which was the further proclamation of the magnalia Dei, and indirectly the promotion of trust in god and fidelity to the Law; cf. <a href="/psalms/81-5.htm">Psalm 81:5</a>., where the special precept concerning the celebration of the Feast of the Passover is described as a &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; laid down in Joseph. The following generation, the children, which shall be born in the course of the ages, were to know concerning His deeds, and also themselves to rise up (&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, not: come into being, like the &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; of the older model-passage <a href="/psalms/22-32.htm">Psalm 22:32</a>) and to tell them further to their children, in order that these might place their confidence in god (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/73-28.htm">Psalm 73:28</a>), and might not forget the mighty deeds of God (<a href="/psalms/118-17.htm">Psalm 118:17</a>), and might keep His commandments, being warned by the disobedience of the fathers. The generation of the latter is called &#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, just as the degenerate son that is to be stoned is called in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18</a>. &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, to direct one's heart, i.e., to give it the right direction or tendency, to put it into the right state, is to be understood after <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-37.htm">Psalm 78:37</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-33.htm">2 Chronicles 20:33</a>, Sir. 2:17.</body></html>
