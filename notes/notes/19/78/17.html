Sin dispirits men, and takes away the heart. Forgetfulness of God's works is the cause of disobedience to his laws. This narrative relates a struggle between God's goodness and man's badness. The Lord hears all our murmurings and distrusts, and is much displeased. Those that will not believe the power of God's mercy, shall feel the fire of his indignation. Those cannot be said to trust in God's salvation as their happiness at last, who can not trust his providence in the way to it. To all that by faith and prayer, ask, seek, and knock, these doors of heaven shall at any time be opened; and our distrust of God is a great aggravation of our sins. He expressed his resentment of their provocation; not in denying what they sinfully lusted after, but in granting it to them. Lust is contented with nothing. Those that indulge their lust, will never be estranged from it. Those hearts are hard indeed, that will neither be melted by the mercies of the Lord, nor broken by his judgments. Those that sin still, must expect to be in trouble still. And the reason why we live with so little comfort, and to so little purpose, is, because we do not live by faith. Under these rebukes they professed repentance, but they were not sincere, for they were not constant. In Israel's history we have a picture of our own hearts and lives. God's patience, and warnings, and mercies, imbolden them to harden their hearts against his word. And the history of kingdoms is much the same. Judgments and mercies have been little attended to, until the measure of their sins has been full. And higher advantages have not kept churches from declining from the commandments of God. Even true believers recollect, that for many a year they abused the kindness of Providence. When they come to heaven, how will they admire the Lord's patience and mercy in bringing them to his kingdom!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/78.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they sinned yet more against him - literally, "They added to sin against him." The idea is, that his mercies, and the proofs of his presence were only made the occasion of greater sin on their part. This may have been in two ways;<p>(1) their sin was thus more aggravated, as being committed against greater light; and<p>(2) they evinced more and more their depravity, in proportion as he bestowed mercies on them - not an uncommon thing with people.<p>By provoking the Most High - literally, "embittering." They rebelled against him. They refused to submit to him. They forgot his mercies. Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/9-22.htm">Deuteronomy 9:22</a>.<p>In the wilderness - literally, "in the dry place;" in the desert. In the very place where they were most manifestly dependent on him - where there were no natural streams of water - where their needs were met by a miraculous supply - even there did they provoke him, and rebel against him. If he had simply stopped that miraculous supply of water they must have perished. But sinners forget how dependent they are on God, when they sin against him. On what can they rely, if he withdraws from them, and leaves them to themselves? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/78.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-20. yet more&#8212;literally, "added to sin," instead of being led to repentance (Ro 2:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/78.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Where they had such strong and singular obligations to obedience, both from the great things which God had then and there done for them, and from their dependence upon God’s favour and help for their safety and subsistence.

In spite of these miracles of mercy they sinned yet more, and tempted God in their unbelief, so that while He supplied their wants He was compelled to punish them for their sin. The order is logical not chronological. The first murmurings for food (Exodus 16) preceded the giving of the water: and the narratives of Exodus 16 and Numbers 11 are fused into one.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/78.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the Most High in the wilderness.</span> The two provocations of a demand for bread (<a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>) and a demand for flesh (<a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a>) are joined together in the present passage, as the two occasions of giving water are in vers. 15, 16. Only the second of these two provocations was subsequent to the (first) giving of water; but the psalmist does not allow himself to be bound by considerations of strict chronological accuracy. He is a poet, and not an historian; though at present he is treating of history. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/78.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-9.htm">Psalm 78:9</a>, which comes in now in the midst of this description, is awkward and unintelligible. The supposition that "the sons of Ephraim" is an appellation for the whole of Israel is refuted by <a href="/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>. The rejection of Ephraim and the election of Judah is the point into which the historical retrospect runs out; how then can "the sons of Ephraim" denote Israel as a whole? And yet what is here said of the Ephraimites also holds good of the Israelites in general, as <a href="/psalms/78-57.htm">Psalm 78:57</a> shows. The fact, however, that the Ephraimites are made specially conspicuous out of the "generation" of all Israel, is intelligible from the special interest which the Psalms of Asaph take in the tribes of Joseph, and here particularly from the purpose of practically preparing the way for the rejection of Shiloh and Ephraim related further on. In <a href="/psalms/78-10.htm">Psalm 78:10</a> and <a href="/psalms/78-11.htm">Psalm 78:11</a> the Ephraimites are also still spoken of; and it is not until <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12</a>, with the words "in sight of their fathers," that we come back again to the nation at large. The Ephraimites are called &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497; &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; in the sense of &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497; &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497; &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;; the two participial construct forms do not stand in subordination but in co-ordination, as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-19.htm">2 Samuel 20:19</a>, just as in other instances also two substantives, of which one is the explanation of the other, are combined by means of the construct, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-17.htm">Job 20:17</a>, cf. <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a> Ker. It is therefore: those who prepare the bow, i.e., those arming themselves therewith (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; as in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-17.htm">2 Chronicles 17:17</a>), those who cast the vow, i.e., those shooting arrows from the bow (<a href="/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>), cf. Bttcher, 728. What is predicated of them, viz., "they turned round" (&#1492;&#1508;&#1498; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-39.htm">Judges 20:39</a>, <a href="/judges/20-41.htm">Judges 20:41</a>), stands in contrast with this their ability to bear arms and to defend themselves, as a disappointed expectation. Is what is meant thereby, that the powerful warlike tribe of Ephraim grew weary in the work of the conquest of Canaan (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1.htm">Judges 1</a>), and did not render the services which might have been expected from it? Since the historical retrospect does not enter into details until <a href="/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12</a> onwards, this especial historical reference would come too early here; the statement consequently must be understood more generally and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-57.htm">Psalm 78:57</a>, figuratively: Ephraim proved itself unstable and faint-hearted in defending and in conducting the cause of God, it gave it up, it abandoned it. They did not act as the covenant of God required of them, they refused to walk (&#1500;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;, cf. &#1500;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:7</a>) within the limit and track of His Tra, and forgot the deeds of God of which they had been eye-witnesses under Moses and under Joshua, their comrades of the same family. </body></html>
