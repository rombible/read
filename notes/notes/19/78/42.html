Let not those that receive mercy from God, be thereby made bold to sin, for the mercies they receive will hasten its punishment; yet let not those who are under Divine rebukes for sin, be discouraged from repentance. The Holy One of Israel will do what is most for his own glory, and what is most for their good. Their forgetting former favours, led them to limit God for the future. God made his own people to go forth like sheep; and guided them in the wilderness, as a shepherd his flock, with all care and tenderness. Thus the true Joshua, even Jesus, brings his church out of the wilderness; but no earthly Canaan, no worldly advantages, should make us forget that the church is in the wilderness while in this world, and that there remaineth a far more glorious rest for the people of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/78.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They remembered not his hand - His gracious interpositions; the manifestations of his power.

Yet it must have been difficult to forget it. Such displays of divine power as those which smote Egypt with astonishment, it must have needed some more than usual effort to blot from the tablets of memory. It is probably meant that they practically, rather than actually, forgot. He who forgets the natural returns of gratitude, may justly be charged with not remembering the obligation. "Nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy." The day itself was erased from their calendar, so far as any due result from it or return for it. Strange is the faculty of memory in its oblivions as well as its records. Sin perverts man's powers, makes them forceful only in wrong directions, and practically dead for righteous ends.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/78.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His hand; </span> the great and glorious works of his hand on their behalf. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Nor the day; </span> nor that remarkable and never to be forgotten day, that <span class="ital">self-same day</span>, as it is called, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/12-41.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.">Exodus 12:41</a></span>, which God had fixed four hundred years before, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;">Genesis 15:13</a></span>, in which God delivered them from their greatest enemy, the tyrant Pharaoh. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/psalms/78.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They remembered not his hand,....

But the description follows the second: &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1506; (He caused to depart, set out) after <a href="/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>. "East" and "south" belong together: it was a south-east wind from the Aelanitic Gulf. "To rain down" is a figurative expression for a plentiful giving of dispensing from above. "Its camp, its tents," are those of Israel, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>, cf. <a href="/exodus/16-13.htm">Exodus 16:13</a>.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-30.htm">Psalm 78:30-31</a> even in the construction the poet closely follows <a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a> (cf. also &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; with &#1500;&#1494;&#1512;&#1488;, aversion, loathing, <a href="/numbers/11-20.htm">Numbers 11:20</a>). The Waw unites what takes place simultaneously; a construction which presents the advantage of being able to give special prominence to the subject. The wrath of God consisted in the breaking out of a sickness which was the result of immoderate indulgence, and to which even the best-nourished and most youthfully vigorous fell a prey. When the poet goes on in <a href="/psalms/78-32.htm">Psalm 78:32</a> to say that in spite of these visitations (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;) they went on sinning, he has chiefly before his mind the outbreak of "fat" rebelliousness after the return of the spies, cf. <a href="/psalms/78-32.htm">Psalm 78:32</a> with <a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>. And <a href="/psalms/78-33.htm">Psalm 78:33</a> refers to the judgment of death in the wilderness threatened at that time to all who had come out of Egypt from twenty years old and upward (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28-34</a>). Their life devoted to death vanished from that time onwards &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, in breath-like instability, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492;, in undurable precipitancy; the mode of expression in <a href="/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a>; <a href="/job/36-1.htm">Job 36:1</a> suggests to the poet an expressive play of words. When now a special judgment suddenly and violently thinned the generation that otherwise was dying off, as in <a href="/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>., then they inquired after Him, they again sought His favour, those who were still preserved in the midst of this dying again remembered the God who had proved Himself to be a "Rock" (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37</a>) and to be a "Redeemer" (<a href="/genesis/48-16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a>) to them.
