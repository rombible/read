Sin dispirits men, and takes away the heart. Forgetfulness of God's works is the cause of disobedience to his laws. This narrative relates a struggle between God's goodness and man's badness. The Lord hears all our murmurings and distrusts, and is much displeased. Those that will not believe the power of God's mercy, shall feel the fire of his indignation. Those cannot be said to trust in God's salvation as their happiness at last, who can not trust his providence in the way to it. To all that by faith and prayer, ask, seek, and knock, these doors of heaven shall at any time be opened; and our distrust of God is a great aggravation of our sins. He expressed his resentment of their provocation; not in denying what they sinfully lusted after, but in granting it to them. Lust is contented with nothing. Those that indulge their lust, will never be estranged from it. Those hearts are hard indeed, that will neither be melted by the mercies of the Lord, nor broken by his judgments. Those that sin still, must expect to be in trouble still. And the reason why we live with so little comfort, and to so little purpose, is, because we do not live by faith. Under these rebukes they professed repentance, but they were not sincere, for they were not constant. In Israel's history we have a picture of our own hearts and lives. God's patience, and warnings, and mercies, imbolden them to harden their hearts against his word. And the history of kingdoms is much the same. Judgments and mercies have been little attended to, until the measure of their sins has been full. And higher advantages have not kept churches from declining from the commandments of God. Even true believers recollect, that for many a year they abused the kindness of Providence. When they come to heaven, how will they admire the Lord's patience and mercy in bringing them to his kingdom!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/78.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He clave the rocks in the wilderness - There were two occasions on which the rock was smitten for water; one <a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a> at Mount Horeb, shortly after they came out of Egypt; and the other <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>, when they had nearly ceased their wanderings in the wilderness.

The cleaving of the rocks is ascribed to God, which was done by the hands of Moses; and so the Targum adds, <p>"by the rod of Moses their master;'' <p>but Moses was only the instrument, it was the Lord that did it; Moses with his rod could never have done it, had not the power of God went along with it. This smiting and cleaving the rocks were an emblem of the sufferings of Christ, who was smitten of God with the rod of justice, according to the law of Moses, in a judicial way, for the sins of his people, and in order to obtain salvation for them: <p>and gave them drink as out of the great depths; such a large quantity of water flowed out of the rocks when smitten, as if it came out of the great sea, which furnished them with drink sufficient, and more than enough for them and their cattle; this was typical of the large abundance of grace, and the blessings of it, which flow freely and plentifully from Christ and his fulness, and through his sufferings and death. <p>(b) De loc.

The supposition that "the sons of Ephraim" is an appellation for the whole of Israel is refuted by <a href="/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>. The rejection of Ephraim and the election of Judah is the point into which the historical retrospect runs out; how then can "the sons of Ephraim" denote Israel as a whole? And yet what is here said of the Ephraimites also holds good of the Israelites in general, as <a href="/psalms/78-57.htm">Psalm 78:57</a> shows. The fact, however, that the Ephraimites are made specially conspicuous out of the "generation" of all Israel, is intelligible from the special interest which the Psalms of Asaph take in the tribes of Joseph, and here particularly from the purpose of practically preparing the way for the rejection of Shiloh and Ephraim related further on. In <a href="/psalms/78-10.htm">Psalm 78:10</a> and <a href="/psalms/78-11.htm">Psalm 78:11</a> the Ephraimites are also still spoken of; and it is not until <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12</a>, with the words "in sight of their fathers," that we come back again to the nation at large. The Ephraimites are called &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497; &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; in the sense of &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497; &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497; &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;; the two participial construct forms do not stand in subordination but in co-ordination, as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-19.htm">2 Samuel 20:19</a>, just as in other instances also two substantives, of which one is the explanation of the other, are combined by means of the construct, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-17.htm">Job 20:17</a>, cf. <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a> Ker. It is therefore: those who prepare the bow, i.e., those arming themselves therewith (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; as in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-17.htm">2 Chronicles 17:17</a>), those who cast the vow, i.e., those shooting arrows from the bow (<a href="/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>), cf. Bttcher, 728. What is predicated of them, viz., "they turned round" (&#1492;&#1508;&#1498; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-39.htm">Judges 20:39</a>, <a href="/judges/20-41.htm">Judges 20:41</a>), stands in contrast with this their ability to bear arms and to defend themselves, as a disappointed expectation. Is what is meant thereby, that the powerful warlike tribe of Ephraim grew weary in the work of the conquest of Canaan (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1.htm">Judges 1</a>), and did not render the services which might have been expected from it? Since the historical retrospect does not enter into details until <a href="/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12</a> onwards, this especial historical reference would come too early here; the statement consequently must be understood more generally and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-57.htm">Psalm 78:57</a>, figuratively: Ephraim proved itself unstable and faint-hearted in defending and in conducting the cause of God, it gave it up, it abandoned it. They did not act as the covenant of God required of them, they refused to walk (&#1500;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;, cf. &#1500;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:7</a>) within the limit and track of His Tra, and forgot the deeds of God of which they had been eye-witnesses under Moses and under Joshua, their comrades of the same family. </body></html>
