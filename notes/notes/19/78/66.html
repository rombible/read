God gave them his testimonies, but they turned back. Presumptuous sins render even Israelites hateful to God's holiness, and exposed to his justice. Those whom the Lord forsakes become an easy prey to the destroyer. And sooner or later, God will disgrace his enemies. He set a good government over his people; a monarch after his own heart. With good reason does the psalmist make this finishing, crowning instance of God's favour to Israel; for David was a type of Christ, the great and good Shepherd, who was humbled first, and then exalted; and of whom it was foretold, that he should be filled with the Spirit of wisdom and understanding. On the uprightness of his heart, and the skilfulness of his hands, all his subjects may rely; and of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end. Every trial of human nature hitherto, confirms the testimony of Scripture, that the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, and nothing but being created anew by the Holy Ghost can cure the ungodliness of any.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/78.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he smote his enemies in the hinder part - From behind; that is, as they fled.

In the time of the Judges the Tabernacle was set up in Shiloh (<a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>); there, consequently, was the central sanctuary of the whole people, - in the time of Eli and Samuel, as follows from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>, it had become a fixed temple building. When this building was destroyed is not known; according to <a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a>., cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12-15</a>, it was probably not until the Assyrian period. The rejection of Shiloh, however, preceded the destruction, and practically took place simultaneously with the removal of the central sanctuary to Zion; and was, moreover, even previously decided by the fact that the Ark of the covenant, when given up again by the Philistines, was not brought back to Shiloh, but set down in Kirjath Jearm (<a href="/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a>). The attributive clause &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; uses &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; as &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; is used in <a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>. The pointing is correct, for the words to not suffice to signify "where He dwelleth among men" (Hitzig); consequently &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is the causative of the Kal, <a href="/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>; <a href="/joshua/22-19.htm">Joshua 22:19</a>. In <a href="/psalms/78-61.htm">Psalm 78:61</a> the Ark of the covenant is called the might and glory of God (&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-8.htm">Psalm 132:8</a>, cf. &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, <a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21</a>.), as being the place of their presence in Israel and the medium of their revelation. Nevertheless, in the battle with the Philistines between Eben-ezer and Aphek, Jahve gave the Ark, which they had fetched out of Shiloh, into the hands of the foe in order to visit on the high-priesthood of the sons of Ithamar the desecration of His ordinances, and there fell in that battle 30,000 footmen, and among them the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>). The fire in <a href="/psalms/78-63.htm">Psalm 78:63</a> is the fire of war, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>, and frequently. The incident mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a> is reasonably (vid., Keil) left out of consideration. By &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; (lxx erroneously, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  equals  &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;  equals  &#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;) are meant the marriage-songs (cf. Talmudic &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, the nuptial tent, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; the marriage-house). "Its widows (of the people, in fact, of the slain) weep not" (word for word as in <a href="/job/27-15.htm">Job 27:15</a>) is meant of the celebration of the customary ceremony of mourning (<a href="/genesis/23-2.htm">Genesis 23:2</a>): they survive their husbands (which, with the exception of such a case as that recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-19.htm">1 Samuel 14:19-22</a>, is presupposed), but without being able to show them the last signs of honour, because the terrors of the war (<a href="/jeremiah/15-8.htm">Jeremiah 15:8</a>) prevent them.<p>With <a href="/psalms/78-65.htm">Psalm 78:65</a> the song takes a new turn. After the punitive judgment has sifted and purified Israel, God receives His people to Himself afresh, but in such a manner that He transfers the precedence of Ephraim to the tribe of Judah. He awakes as it were from a long sleep (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-24.htm">Psalm 44:24</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/73-20.htm">Psalm 73:20</a>); for He seemed to sleep whilst Israel had become a servant to the heathen; He aroused Himself, like a hero exulting by reason of wine, i.e., like a hero whose courage is heightened by the strengthening and exhilarating influence of wine (Hengstenberg). &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; is not the Hithpal. of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; in the Arabic signification, which is alien to the Hebrew, to conquer, a meaning which we do not need here, and which is also not adapted to the reflexive form (Hitzig, without any precedent, renders thus: who allows himself to be conquered by wine), but Hithpo. of &#1512;&#1504;&#1503;: to shout most heartily, after the analogy of the reflexives &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;, &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491;, &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;. The most recent defeat of the enemy which the poet has before his mind is that of the Philistines. The form of expression in <a href="/psalms/78-66.htm">Psalm 78:66</a> is moulded after <a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>. God smote the Philistines most literally in posteriora (lxx, Vulgate, and Luther). Nevertheless <a href="/psalms/78-66.htm">Psalm 78:66</a> embraces all the victories under Samuel, Saul, and David, from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-12</a> and onwards. Now, when they were able to bring the Ark, which had been brought down to the battle against the Philistines, to a settled resting-place again, God no longer chose Shiloh of Ephraim, but Judah and the mountain of Zion, which He had loved (<a href="/psalms/47-5.htm">Psalm 47:5</a>), of Benjamitish-Judaean (<a href="/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>, <a href="/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21</a>) - but according to the promise (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>) and according to the distribution of the country (vid., on <a href="/psalms/68-28.htm">Psalm 68:28</a>) Benjamitish - Jerusalem.<p>(Note: According to B. Menachoth 53b, Jedidiah (Solomon, <a href="/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>) built the Temple in the province of Jedidiah (of Benjamin, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>).)<p>There God built His Temple &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1470;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;. Hitzig proposes instead of this to read &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;; but if &#1504;&#1506;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>, signifies amaena, then &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; may signify excelsa (cf. <a href="/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45:2</a> &#1492;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a> &#1495;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;) and be poetically equivalent to &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;: lasting as the heights of heaven, firm as the earth, which He hath founded for ever. Since the eternal duration of heaven and of the earth is quite consistent with a radical change in the manner of its duration, and that not less in the sense of the Old Testament than of the New (vid., e.g., <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>), so the &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; applies not to the stone building, but rather to the place where Jahve reveals Himself, and to the promise that He will have such a dwelling-place in Israel, and in fact in Judah. Regarded spiritually, i.e., essentially, apart from the accidental mode of appearing, the Temple upon Zion is as eternal as the kingship upon Zion with which the Psalm closes. The election of David gives its impress to the history of salvation even on into eternity. It is genuinely Asaphic that it is so designedly portrayed how the shepherd of the flock of Jesse (Isai) became the shepherd of the flock of Jahve, who was not to pasture old and young in Israel with the same care and tenderness as the ewe-lambs after which he went (&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/33-13.htm">Genesis 33:13</a>, and &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1489;, cf. <a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34</a>, like &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468; and the like). The poet is also able already to glory that he has fulfilled this vocation with a pure heart and with an intelligent mastery. And with this he closes.<p>From the decease of David lyric and prophecy are retrospectively and prospectively turned towards David. </body></html>
