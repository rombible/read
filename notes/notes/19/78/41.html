Let not those that receive mercy from God, be thereby made bold to sin, for the mercies they receive will hasten its punishment; yet let not those who are under Divine rebukes for sin, be discouraged from repentance. The Holy One of Israel will do what is most for his own glory, and what is most for their good. Their forgetting former favours, led them to limit God for the future. God made his own people to go forth like sheep; and guided them in the wilderness, as a shepherd his flock, with all care and tenderness. Thus the true Joshua, even Jesus, brings his church out of the wilderness; but no earthly Canaan, no worldly advantages, should make us forget that the church is in the wilderness while in this world, and that there remaineth a far more glorious rest for the people of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/78.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, they turned back, and tempted God - They turned away from his service; they were disposed to return to Egypt, and to place themselves in the condition in which they were before they were delivered from bondage.<p>And limited the Holy One of Israel - The idea is, that they set a limit to the power of God; they fancied or alleged - (and this is a thing often done practically even by the professed people of God) - that there was a boundary in respect to power which he could not pass, or that there were things to be done which he had not the ability to perform. The original word - &#1514;&#1493;&#1492;  ta&#770;va&#770;h - occurs but three times in the Scriptures; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-13.htm">1 Samuel 21:13</a>, where it is rendered scrabbled (in the margin, made marks); in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4</a>, where it is rendered set, that is, set a mark (margin, mark); and in the place before us. It is rendered here by the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, to provoke to anger. DeWette translates it troubled. Professor Alexander, "On the Holy One of Israel (they) set a mark." The idea in the word would seem to be that of making a mark for any purpose; and then it means to delineate; to scrawl; or to set a mark for a limit or boundary. Thus it might be applied to God - as if, in estimating his character or his power, they set limits or bounds to it, as one does in marking out a farm or a house-lot in a city or town. There was a limit, in their estimation, to the power of God, beyond which he could not act; or, in other words, his power was defined and bounded, so that beyond a certain point he could not aid them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/78.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41. limited&#8212;as in Ps 78:19, 20.

It denotes that it was in His character of a Holy God that Jehovah had become the God of Israel. Though the title is not used in the Pentateuch, the thought is expressed there.

"East" and "south" belong together: it was a south-east wind from the Aelanitic Gulf. "To rain down" is a figurative expression for a plentiful giving of dispensing from above.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-30.htm">Psalm 78:30-31</a> even in the construction the poet closely follows <a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a> (cf. also &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; with &#1500;&#1494;&#1512;&#1488;, aversion, loathing, <a href="/numbers/11-20.htm">Numbers 11:20</a>). The Waw unites what takes place simultaneously; a construction which presents the advantage of being able to give special prominence to the subject. The wrath of God consisted in the breaking out of a sickness which was the result of immoderate indulgence, and to which even the best-nourished and most youthfully vigorous fell a prey. When the poet goes on in <a href="/psalms/78-32.htm">Psalm 78:32</a> to say that in spite of these visitations (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;) they went on sinning, he has chiefly before his mind the outbreak of "fat" rebelliousness after the return of the spies, cf. <a href="/psalms/78-32.htm">Psalm 78:32</a> with <a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>. And <a href="/psalms/78-33.htm">Psalm 78:33</a> refers to the judgment of death in the wilderness threatened at that time to all who had come out of Egypt from twenty years old and upward (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28-34</a>). Their life devoted to death vanished from that time onwards &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, in breath-like instability, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492;, in undurable precipitancy; the mode of expression in <a href="/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a>; <a href="/job/36-1.htm">Job 36:1</a> suggests to the poet an expressive play of words. When now a special judgment suddenly and violently thinned the generation that otherwise was dying off, as in <a href="/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>., then they inquired after Him, they again sought His favour, those who were still preserved in the midst of this dying again remembered the God who had proved Himself to be a "Rock" (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37</a>) and to be a "Redeemer" (<a href="/genesis/48-16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a>) to them.
