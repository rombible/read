Sin dispirits men, and takes away the heart. Forgetfulness of God's works is the cause of disobedience to his laws. This narrative relates a struggle between God's goodness and man's badness. The Lord hears all our murmurings and distrusts, and is much displeased. Those that will not believe the power of God's mercy, shall feel the fire of his indignation. Those cannot be said to trust in God's salvation as their happiness at last, who can not trust his providence in the way to it. To all that by faith and prayer, ask, seek, and knock, these doors of heaven shall at any time be opened; and our distrust of God is a great aggravation of our sins. He expressed his resentment of their provocation; not in denying what they sinfully lusted after, but in granting it to them. Lust is contented with nothing. Those that indulge their lust, will never be estranged from it. Those hearts are hard indeed, that will neither be melted by the mercies of the Lord, nor broken by his judgments. Those that sin still, must expect to be in trouble still. And the reason why we live with so little comfort, and to so little purpose, is, because we do not live by faith. Under these rebukes they professed repentance, but they were not sincere, for they were not constant. In Israel's history we have a picture of our own hearts and lives. God's patience, and warnings, and mercies, imbolden them to harden their hearts against his word. And the history of kingdoms is much the same. Judgments and mercies have been little attended to, until the measure of their sins has been full. And higher advantages have not kept churches from declining from the commandments of God. Even true believers recollect, that for many a year they abused the kindness of Providence. When they come to heaven, how will they admire the Lord's patience and mercy in bringing them to his kingdom!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/78.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he remembered that they were but flesh - That they were human; that they were weak; that they were prone to err; that they were liable to fall into temptation. In his dealings with them he took into view their fallen nature; their training; their temptations; their trials; their weaknesses; and he judged them accordingly. Compare <a href="/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a>. So it was with the Saviour in his treatment of his disciples, "The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak," <a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>. God will judge people as they are; he will not in his judgments forget that they are people, and that they are weak and feeble. People often judge their fellow-men with much more harshness, with much less allowance for their infirmities and weaknesses, than God shows in his dealings with mankind. And yet such are the very people who are most ready to blame God for his judgments. If God acted on the principle and in the manner according to which they act, they could hope for no mercy at his hand. It is well for them that there is not one like themselves on the throne of the universe.<p>A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again - Which blows by us, and is gone forever. What a striking description is this of man! How true of an individual! How true of a generation! How true of the race at large! God remembers this when he thinks of people, and he deals with them accordingly. He is not harsh and severe, but kind and compassionate. To man, a being so feeble - to the human race, so frail - to the generations of that race, so transitory, so soon passing off the stage of life - he is ever willing to show compassion. He does not make use of his great power to crush them; he prefers to manifest his mercy in saving them. <p><a href="/psalms/78-39.htm">Psalm 78:39</a>.Compare <a href="/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/14-10.htm">Job 14:10-11</a>.<p>And then vanisheth away - Wholly disappears. Like the dissipated vapor, it is entirely gone. There is no remnant, no outline, nothing that reminds us that it ever was. So of life. Soon it disappears altogether. The works of art that man has made, the house that he has built, or the book that he has written, remain for a little time, but the life has gone. There is nothing of it remaining - any more than there is of the vapor which in the morning climbed silently up the mountain side. The animating principle has vanished forever.

But the description follows the second: &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1506; (He caused to depart, set out) after <a href="/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>. "East" and "south" belong together: it was a south-east wind from the Aelanitic Gulf. "To rain down" is a figurative expression for a plentiful giving of dispensing from above. "Its camp, its tents," are those of Israel, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>, cf. <a href="/exodus/16-13.htm">Exodus 16:13</a>. The &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492;, occurring twice, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-29.htm">Psalm 78:29-30</a> (of the object of strong desire, as in <a href="/psalms/21-3.htm">Psalm 21:3</a>), points to Kibroth-hattaavah, the scene of this carnal lusting; &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; is the transitive of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; in <a href="/proverbs/13-12.htm">Proverbs 13:12</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-30.htm">Psalm 78:30-31</a> even in the construction the poet closely follows <a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a> (cf. also &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; with &#1500;&#1494;&#1512;&#1488;, aversion, loathing, <a href="/numbers/11-20.htm">Numbers 11:20</a>). The Waw unites what takes place simultaneously; a construction which presents the advantage of being able to give special prominence to the subject. The wrath of God consisted in the breaking out of a sickness which was the result of immoderate indulgence, and to which even the best-nourished and most youthfully vigorous fell a prey. When the poet goes on in <a href="/psalms/78-32.htm">Psalm 78:32</a> to say that in spite of these visitations (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;) they went on sinning, he has chiefly before his mind the outbreak of "fat" rebelliousness after the return of the spies, cf. <a href="/psalms/78-32.htm">Psalm 78:32</a> with <a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>. And <a href="/psalms/78-33.htm">Psalm 78:33</a> refers to the judgment of death in the wilderness threatened at that time to all who had come out of Egypt from twenty years old and upward (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28-34</a>). Their life devoted to death vanished from that time onwards &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, in breath-like instability, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492;, in undurable precipitancy; the mode of expression in <a href="/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a>; <a href="/job/36-1.htm">Job 36:1</a> suggests to the poet an expressive play of words. When now a special judgment suddenly and violently thinned the generation that otherwise was dying off, as in <a href="/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>., then they inquired after Him, they again sought His favour, those who were still preserved in the midst of this dying again remembered the God who had proved Himself to be a "Rock" (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37</a>) and to be a "Redeemer" (<a href="/genesis/48-16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a>) to them.
