The Substance must come, which is Christ, who must bring that glory to God, and that grace to man, which it was impossible the sacrifices should ever do. Observe the setting apart of our Lord Jesus to the work and office of Mediator. In the volume, or roll, of the book it was written of him. In the close rolls of the Divine decrees and counsel, the covenant of redemption was recorded. Also, in all the volumes of the Old Testament something was written of him, Joh 19:28. Now the purchase of our salvation is made, the proclamation is sent forth, calling us to come and accept it. It was preached freely and openly. Whoever undertook to preach the gospel of Christ, would be under great temptation to conceal it; but Christ, and those he calls to that work, are carried on in it.

The writer is contrasting Christ’s perfect obedience with the inefficacy of the sacrifices of the Law, and he puts these words into His mouth as the most fitting expression of the purpose of His life. The willing obedience which the Psalmist of old was taught to recognise as the divine requirement for himself and Israel was carried to its completion, was ‘fulfilled,’ in Christ. The variation of the LXX from the Hebrew may seem to present a serious difficulty. But the appropriateness of the quotation does not depend on this particular clause, and the rendering of the LXX, whatever its origin, has in effect a sense analogous to the sense of the original. As the ear is the instrument for receiving the divine command, so the body is the instrument for fulfilling it. The possession of a body implies the duty of service, in the same way that the possession of hearing implies the duty of obedience. See Bp. Westcott’s note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[17] The reading of the LXX is <span class="greekheb">σῶμα δὲ κατηρτίσω μοι</span>, <span class="ital">a body didst thou Prepare for me</span>. This reading is attested by the Vulgate. <span class="ital">Aures</span> in the Gallican Psalter is a correction. <span class="greekheb">καταρτίζεσθαι</span> occurs in the LXX as the rendering of several Hebrew words, and might easily have been chosen to represent the obscure <span class="ital">thou hart dug</span>. ‘Body’ for ‘ears’ may then have been a free paraphrase. But the reading may have originated in an ancient corruption of the Greek text. Through a repetition of the final <span class="greekheb">ϲ</span> of the preceding word and the change of ⲰⲧⲓⲀ into ⲰⲘⲀ, Ⲏ<span class="greekheb">θελ</span>ⲎⲤⲀⲤ<span class="greekheb">ω</span>Ⲧⲓⲁ might easily have become Ⲏ<span class="greekheb">θελ</span>ⲎⲤⲀⲤⲤ<span class="greekheb">ω</span>ⲘⲀ.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy Law is within my heart.</span> The obedience to be rendered will be a true and acceptable obedience, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> cheerful, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the heart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Consciously or unconsciously, David speaks as the type of Christ (see <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5-7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/psalms/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David, who, though not without some hesitation, we regard as the author, now finds himself in a situation in which, on the one hand, he has just been rescued from danger, and, on the other, is still exposed to peril.

Another figure is "mire of the marsh" (&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; found only here and in <a href="/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>), i.e., water, in the miry bottom of which one can find no firm footing - a combination like &#1502;&#1496;&#1512;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>, &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, explained in the Mishna, Mikvaoth ix. 2, by &#1496;&#1497;&#1496; &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; (mire of the cisterns). Taking them out of this, Jahve placed his feet upon a rock, established his footsteps, i.e., removed him from the danger which surrounded him, and gave him firm ground under his feet. The high rock and the firm footsteps are the opposites of the deep pit and the yielding miry bottom. This deliverance afforded him new matter for thanksgiving (cf. <a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>), and became in his mouth "praise to our God;" for the deliverance of the chosen king is an act of the God of Israel on behalf of His chosen people. The futures in <a href="/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a> (with an alliteration similar to <a href="/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>) indicate, by their being thus cumulative, that they are intended of the present and of that which still continues in the future. </body></html>
