The Substance must come, which is Christ, who must bring that glory to God, and that grace to man, which it was impossible the sacrifices should ever do. Observe the setting apart of our Lord Jesus to the work and office of Mediator. In the volume, or roll, of the book it was written of him. In the close rolls of the Divine decrees and counsel, the covenant of redemption was recorded. Also, in all the volumes of the Old Testament something was written of him, Joh 19:28. Now the purchase of our salvation is made, the proclamation is sent forth, calling us to come and accept it. It was preached freely and openly. Whoever undertook to preach the gospel of Christ, would be under great temptation to conceal it; but Christ, and those he calls to that work, are carried on in it. May we believe his testimony, trust his promise, and submit to his authority.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then said I-- In <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7</a>, the apostle applies this to the Messiah. See the notes at that verse. This is the most simple and satisfactory interpretation of the passage. The word "then" in this verse means, "since this is the case;" or, "things being thus." It does not refer to time, but to the condition of things. "Since it was certain that the work needful to be done could not be accomplished by bloody offerings - the sacrifice of animals - under these circumstances I said;" that is, I resolved or purposed to come.<p>Lo, I come - It is difficult to see how this could be applied to David; it is easy to see how it could be applied to the Messiah. When all bloody offerings under the law - all the sacrifices which men could make - did not avail to put away sin, it was true of the Messiah that he came into the world to perform a higher work that would meet the case - a lofty work of obedience, extending even unto death, <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>. This is precisely the use which the apostle makes of the passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7</a>, and this is clearly the most obvious meaning. It is in no sense applicable to David; it is fully applicable to the Messiah.<p>In the volume of the book - literally, "in the roll of the book." See the notes at <a href="/luke/4-17.htm">Luke 4:17</a>. The phrase would most naturally denote the "scroll of the law;" but it might include any volume or roll where a record or prophecy was made. In a large sense it would embrace all that had been written at the command of God at the time when this was supposed to be spoken. That is, as spoken by the Messiah, it would include all the books of the Old Testament. See the notes at <a href="/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7</a>.<p>It is written of me - It is recorded; or, there is a record made of me; to wit, in this respect, that his great delight would be to do the will of God. The proper interpretation of this expression must he, that there must be some record to be found in the "book" or" volume" referred to, which was designed to describe him in this respect, or which had an original reference to him. The meaning is not that there was a general record on the point of obedience which might be applied to him as well as to others, but that the record was intended to be applied to him, and to describe his character. This is one of the passages in the Psalms which cannot with any propriety be applied to David himself. There was no such antecedent record in regard to him; no statement in any "book" or "volume" that this would be his character. There is no promise - no intimation - in any of the books of Scripture written before the time of David that he would come to do the will of God with a view to effect that which could not be done by the sacrifices and offerings under the law.<p>The reference of the language, therefore, must be to the Messiah - to some place where it is represented or affirmed that he would come to accomplish by his obedience what could not be done by the sacrifices and oblations made under the law. Thus understood, and regarded as the language of the Messiah himself, the reference might be to all the books of the Old Testament (for all were completed before he came), and not merely to those which had been written in the time of David. But still, it is true that no such declaration, in so many words, can now be found in any of those books; and the meaning must be that this was the language which was everywhere implied respecting the Messiah; that this was the substance of the description given of him; that this characterized his work as predicted there; to wit, that when all sacrifices and offerings under the law failed; when they had all shown that they were not efficacious to put away sin, One would come to perform some higher work that would be effectual in putting away transgression, and that this work might, in the highest sense, be described as "obedience," or as "doing the will of God." This was true. The language and the institutions of the Old Testament contemplated him as the One who only could put away sin. The entire spirit of the Mosaic economy supposed that a Saviour would come to do the will of God by making an atonement for the sin of the world. The meaning then is, "I come to do thy will in making an atonement, for no other offering would expiate sin; that I would do this, is the language of the Scriptures in predicting my coming, and of the whole spirit and design of the ancient dispensation." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Such rolls, resembling maps, are still used in the synagogues.<p>written of me&#8212;or on me, prescribed to me (2Ki 22:13). The first is the sense adopted by Paul. In either case, the Pentateuch, or law of Moses, is meant, and while it contains much respecting Christ directly, as Ge 3:15; 49:10; De 18:15, and, indirectly, in the Levitical ritual, there is nowhere any allusion to David.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then, </span> when I understood and considered thy mind and will therein, expressed <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/40-6.htm" title="Sacrifice and offering you did not desire; my ears have you opened: burnt offering and sin offering have you not required.">Psalm 40:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Said I; </span> either within myself, by a firm purpose; or unto thee by way of promise or engagement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Lo, I come.</span> He may seem to speak like a servant, answering to the call of his master, and signifying his readiness to obey him; in which sense it may be accommodated to David.

Besides, this phrase in that sense seems not to be proper in this place, but rather, <span class="ital">Lo, I hear</span>, which best suits with the foregoing words, mine <span class="ital">ears hast thou opened</span>.

Now this <span class="ital">volume of the book, is meant</span>, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of the book of predestination, in which Christ was written, as being foreordained before the foundation of the world, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1 Peter 1:20</a></span>. But that is a secret book, not to be read by any man living, and therefore not fitly alleged as an evidence in this matter. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Of a legal instrument, wherein the contract was drawn between God and him, wherein he did oblige himself to serve God, and to execute his will in all things; it being the manner of the Hebrews to write their contracts in a little <span class="ital">volume or book</span>. But, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. We read of no such usage among the Hebrew in the contracts between master and servant, but only of the boring of the servant’s ear, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/21-6.htm" title="Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.">Exodus 21:6</a></span>. So the foundation of this allusion is destroyed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. At least there was no such contract written between God and him. And if it be said that he only speaks thus by way of allusion, that is but a supposition without ground. And when the words may be properly understood as they sound, of a thing really done, why should we forsake the plain sense without necessity? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. The phrase here used doth not agree to this sense; for then he should have said, <span class="ital">I am written in the volume of the book</span>, i.e. in the catalogue of thy servants; for in that case the persons or their names are constantly said to be <span class="ital">written</span>, as <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/32-32.htm" title="Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.">Exodus 32:32</a>,33 Psa 69:28 <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm" title="And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which stands for the children of your people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time your people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.">Daniel 12:1</a> <a href="/luke/10-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.">Luke 10:20</a> <a href="/hebrews/12-23.htm" title="To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,">Hebrews 12:23</a> <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm" title="And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.">Revelation 13:8</a> 20:15 21:27</span>, and not any thing to be written of them, as it is here. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Of the Holy Scriptures; in which something indeed was written concerning David; namely, that he was <span class="ital">a man after God’s own heart</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm" title="But now your kingdom shall not continue: the LORD has sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be captain over his people, because you have not kept that which the LORD commanded you.">1 Samuel 13:14</a></span>. But it must be remembered that those books were not written till after David’s death, in whose time here was no other book of Scripture extant but the five books of Moses, unless you will except the book of Job. And therefore this is meant of the law of Moses, which is commonly and emphatically called <span class="ital">the book</span>, and was made up in the form of a roll or volume, as the Hebrew books generally were. See <span class="bld"><a href="/context/ezekiel/3-1.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel....">Ezekiel 3:1-3</a> <a href="/zechariah/5-1.htm" title="Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.">Zechariah 5:1</a>,2 Lu 4:17,20</span>.

Under such circumstances praise rightly occupies the first place, as in general, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>, gratitude is the way to salvation. His hope, although &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; &#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1492; (<a href="/proverbs/13-12.htm">Proverbs 13:12</a>), has not deceived him; he is rescued, and can now again sing a new song of thanksgiving, an example for others, strengthening their trust. &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, I waited with constancy and perseverance. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is the accusative as in <a href="/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/130-5.htm">Psalm 130:5</a>, and not the vocative as in <a href="/psalms/39-8.htm">Psalm 39:8</a>. &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493; is to be supplied in thought to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1496;, although after the analogy of <a href="/psalms/17-6.htm">Psalm 17:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3</a>, one might have looked for the Hiph. wayaT instead of the Kal. &#1489;&#1493;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; does not mean a pit of roaring (of water), since &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; standing alone (see, on the other hand, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/65-8.htm">Psalm 65:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>.) has not this meaning; and, moreover, "rushing, roaring" (Hengstenberg), tumultuous waters of a pit or a cistern does not furnish any idea that is true to nature; neither does it mean a pit of falling in, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; does not exhibit the signification deorsum labi; but the meaning is: a pit of devastation, of destruction, of ruin (<a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-17.htm">Jeremiah 46:17</a>), vid., supra on <a href="/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>. Another figure is "mire of the marsh" (&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; found only here and in <a href="/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>), i.e., water, in the miry bottom of which one can find no firm footing - a combination like &#1502;&#1496;&#1512;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>, &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, explained in the Mishna, Mikvaoth ix. 2, by &#1496;&#1497;&#1496; &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; (mire of the cisterns). Taking them out of this, Jahve placed his feet upon a rock, established his footsteps, i.e., removed him from the danger which surrounded him, and gave him firm ground under his feet. The high rock and the firm footsteps are the opposites of the deep pit and the yielding miry bottom. This deliverance afforded him new matter for thanksgiving (cf. <a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>), and became in his mouth "praise to our God;" for the deliverance of the chosen king is an act of the God of Israel on behalf of His chosen people. The futures in <a href="/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a> (with an alliteration similar to <a href="/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>) indicate, by their being thus cumulative, that they are intended of the present and of that which still continues in the future. </body></html>
