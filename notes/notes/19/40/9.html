The Substance must come, which is Christ, who must bring that glory to God, and that grace to man, which it was impossible the sacrifices should ever do. Observe the setting apart of our Lord Jesus to the work and office of Mediator. In the volume, or roll, of the book it was written of him. In the close rolls of the Divine decrees and counsel, the covenant of redemption was recorded. Also, in all the volumes of the Old Testament something was written of him, Joh 19:28. Now the purchase of our salvation is made, the proclamation is sent forth, calling us to come and accept it. It was preached freely and openly. Whoever undertook to preach the gospel of Christ, would be under great temptation to conceal it; but Christ, and those he calls to that work, are carried on in it.

Under such circumstances praise rightly occupies the first place, as in general, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>, gratitude is the way to salvation.

Another figure is "mire of the marsh" (&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; found only here and in <a href="/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>), i.e., water, in the miry bottom of which one can find no firm footing - a combination like &#1502;&#1496;&#1512;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>, &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, explained in the Mishna, Mikvaoth ix. 2, by &#1496;&#1497;&#1496; &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; (mire of the cisterns). Taking them out of this, Jahve placed his feet upon a rock, established his footsteps, i.e., removed him from the danger which surrounded him, and gave him firm ground under his feet. The high rock and the firm footsteps are the opposites of the deep pit and the yielding miry bottom. This deliverance afforded him new matter for thanksgiving (cf. <a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>), and became in his mouth "praise to our God;" for the deliverance of the chosen king is an act of the God of Israel on behalf of His chosen people. The futures in <a href="/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a> (with an alliteration similar to <a href="/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>) indicate, by their being thus cumulative, that they are intended of the present and of that which still continues in the future. </body></html>
