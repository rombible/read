But see the frightful view the psalmist had of sin. This made the discovery of a Redeemer so welcome. In all his reflections upon each step of his life, he discovered something amiss. The sight and sense of our sins in their own colours, must distract us, if we have not at the same time some sight of a Saviour. If Christ has triumphed over our spiritual enemies, then we, through him, shall be more than conquerors. This may encourage all that seek God and love his salvation, to rejoice in him, and to praise him. No griefs nor poverty can render those miserable who fear the Lord. Their God, and all that he has or does, is the ground of their joy. The prayer of faith can unlock his fulness, which is adapted to all their wants. The promises are sure, the moment of fulfilment hastens forward. He who once came in great humility, shall come again in glorious majesty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let all those that seek thee - All those who desire to know thee; to understand thy ways; to be thy friends.

He has proclaimed to all Israel the evangel of Jahve's justifying and gracious rule, which only changes into retribution towards those who despise His love; and he can appeal to the Omniscient One (<a href="/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>), that neither through fear of men, nor through shame and indolence, has he restrained his lips from confessing Him. God's conduct, in accordance with the prescribed order of redemption, is as a matter of fact called &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, and as an attribute of His holy love, &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;; just as &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is His faithfulness which fulfils the promises made and which does not suffer hope to be put to shame, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is His salvation as it is manifested in facts. This rich matter for the preaching of the evangel, which may be comprehended in the two words &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; &#1493;&#1506;&#1502;&#1514;, the Alpha and Omega of God's self-attestation in the course of the redemptive history, he has not allowed to slumber as a dead, unfruitful knowledge hidden deep down in his heart. The new song which Jahve put into his mouth, he has also really sung. Thus far we have the first part of the song, which renders thanks for past mercies. </body></html>
