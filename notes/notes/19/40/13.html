But see the frightful view the psalmist had of sin. This made the discovery of a Redeemer so welcome. In all his reflections upon each step of his life, he discovered something amiss. The sight and sense of our sins in their own colours, must distract us, if we have not at the same time some sight of a Saviour. If Christ has triumphed over our spiritual enemies, then we, through him, shall be more than conquerors. This may encourage all that seek God and love his salvation, to rejoice in him, and to praise him. No griefs nor poverty can render those miserable who fear the Lord. Their God, and all that he has or does, is the ground of their joy. The prayer of faith can unlock his fulness, which is adapted to all their wants.

To this question he first of all gives a negative answer: God delights not in outward sacrifices. The sacrifices are named in a twofold way: (a) according to the material of which they consist, viz., &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;, the animal sacrifice, and &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;, the meal or meat offering (including the &#1504;&#1505;&#1498;, the wine or drink offering, which is the inalienable accessory of the accompanying mincha); (b) according to their purpose, in accordance with which they bring about either the turning towards one of the good pleasure of God, as more especially in the case of the &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, or, as more especially in the case of the &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; (in this passage &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1492;), the turning away of the divine displeasure. The fact of the &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; and &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; standing first, has, moreover, its special reason in the fact that &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; specially designates the shelam&#305;&#770;m offerings, and to the province of these latter belongs the thank-offering proper, viz., the to&#770;da-shelam&#305;&#770;m offering; and that &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; as the sacrifice of adoration (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;), which is also always a general thanksgiving (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;), is most natural, side by side with the shalemim, to him who gives thanks. When it is said of God, that He does not delight in and desire such non-personal sacrifices, there is as little intention as in <a href="/jeremiah/7-22.htm">Jeremiah 7:22</a> (cf. <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21</a>.) of saying that the sacrificial Tra is not of divine origin, but that the true, essential will of God is not directed to such sacrifices.<p>Between these synonymous utterances in <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a> and <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a> stands the clause &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;. In connection with this position it is natural, with Rosenmller, Gesenius, De Wette, and Stier, to explain it "ears hast Thou pierced for me"  equals  this hast Thou engraven upon my mind as a revelation, this disclosure hast Thou imparted to me. But, although &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, to dig, is even admissible in the sense of digging through, piercing (vid., on <a href="/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>), there are two considerations against this interpretation, viz.: (1) that then one would rather look for &#1488;&#1494;&#1503; instead of &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; after the analogy of the phrases &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; &#1488;&#1494;&#1503;, &#1495;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1488;&#1494;&#1503;, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; &#1488;&#1494;&#1503;, since the inner sense, in which the external organs of sense, with their functions, have their basis of unity, is commonly denoted by the use of the singular; (2) that according to the syntax, &#1495;&#1508;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468; are all placed on the same level. Thus, therefore, it is with this very &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1497; that the answer is intended, in its positive form, to begin; and the primary passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, favours this view: "Hath Jahve delight in whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in one's obeying the voice of Jahve? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, to attend better than the fat of rams!" The assertion of David is the echo of this assertion of Samuel, by which the sentence of death was pronounced upon the kingship of Saul, and consequently the way of that which is well-pleasing to God was traced out for the future kingship of David. God - says David - desires not outward sacrifices, but obedience; ears hath He digged for me, i.e., formed the sense of hearing, bestowed the faculty of hearing, and given therewith the instruction to obey.<p>(Note: There is a similar expression in the Tamul Kural, Graul's translation, S. 63, No. 418: "An ear, that was not hollowed out by hearing, has, even if hearing, the manner of not hearing." The "hollowing out" meaning in this passage an opening of the inward sense of hearing by instruction.)<p>The idea is not that God has given him ears in order to hear that disclosure concerning the true will of God (Hupfeld), but, in general, to hear the word of God, and to obey that which is heard. God desires not sacrifices but hearing ears, and consequently the submission of the person himself in willing obedience. To interpret it "Thou hast appropriated me to Thyself &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;," after <a href="/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-17.htm">Deuteronomy 15:17</a>, would not be out of harmony with the context; but it is at once shut out by the fact that the word is not &#1488;&#1494;&#1503;, but &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. Concerning the generalizing rendering of the lxx, &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, following which Apollinaris renders it &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x392;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, and the Italic (which is also retained in the Psalterium Romanum), corpus autem perfecisti mihi; vide on <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5</a>, Commentary, S. 460f. transl. vol. ii. p. 153.<p>The &#1488;&#1494; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, which follows, now introduces the expression of the obedience, with which he placed himself at the service of God, when he became conscious of what God's special will concerning him was. With reference to the fact that obedience and not sacrifice has become known to him as the will and requirement of God, he has said: "Lo, I come," etc. By the words "Lo, I come," the servant places himself at the call of his master, <a href="/numbers/22-38.htm">Numbers 22:38</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-21.htm">2 Samuel 19:21</a>. It is not likely that the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514; &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; then form a parenthesis, since <a href="/psalms/40-9.htm">Psalm 40:9</a> is not a continuation of that "Lo, I come," but a new sentence. We take the Beth, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/66-13.htm">Psalm 66:13</a>, as the Beth of the accompaniment; the roll of the book is the Tra, and more especially Deuteronomy, written upon skins and rolled up together, which according to the law touching the king (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>) was to be the vade-mecum of the king of Israel. And &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; cannot, as synonymous with the following &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;, signify as much as "written upon my heart," as De Wette and Thenius render it-a meaning which, as Maurer has already correctly replied, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; obtains elsewhere by means of a conception that is altogether inadmissible in this instance. On the contrary, this preposition here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>, denotes the object of the contents; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500; signifies to write anything concerning any one, so that he is the subject one has specially in view (e.g., of the judicial decision recorded in writing, <a href="/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>). Because Jahve before all else requires obedience to His will, David comes with the document of this will, the Tra, which prescribes to him, as a man, and more especially as the king, the right course of conduct. Thus presenting himself to the God of revelation, he can say in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-9.htm">Psalm 40:9</a>, that willing obedience to God's Law is his delight, as he then knows that the written Law is written even in his heart, or, as the still stronger expression used here is, in his bowels. The principal form of &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;, does not occur in the Old Testament; it was &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1502;&#1506;, &#1502;&#1506;&#1492;, or even &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;), according to current Jewish pronunciation &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (which Kimchi explains dual); and the word properly means (vid., on <a href="/isaiah/48-19.htm">Isaiah 48:19</a>) the soft parts of the body, which even elsewhere, like &#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, which is synonymous according to its original meaning, appear pre-eminently as the seat of sympathy, but also of fear and of pain. This is the only passage in which it occurs as the locality of a mental acquisition, but also with the associated notion of loving acceptance and cherishing protection (cf. the Syriac phrase &#1505;&#1501; &#1489;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1488;, som begau meajo, to shut up in the heart  equals  to love). That the Tra is to be written upon the tables of the heart is even indicated by the Deuteronomion, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6</a>, cf. <a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-3.htm">Proverbs 7:3</a>. This reception of the Tra into the inward parts among the people hitherto estranged from God is, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, the characteristic of the new covenant. But even in the Old Testament there is among the masses of Israel "a people with My law in their heart" (<a href="/isaiah/51-7.htm">Isaiah 51:7</a>), and even in the Old Testament, "he who hath the law of his God in his heart" is called righteous (<a href="/psalms/37-31.htm">Psalm 37:31</a>). As such an one who has the Tra within him, not merely beside him, David presents himself on the way to the throne of God. </body></html>
