There is power enough in God to help the weakest, and grace enough to help the unworthiest of all that trust in him. The psalmist waited patiently; he continued believing, hoping, and praying. This is applicable to Christ. His agony, in the garden and on the cross, was a horrible pit and miry clay. But those that wait patiently for God do not wait in vain. Those that have been under religious melancholy, and by the grace of God have been relieved, may apply ver. 2 very feelingly to themselves; they are brought up out of a horrible pit. Christ is the Rock on which a poor soul can alone stand fast. Where God has given stedfast hope, he expects there should be a steady, regular walk and conduct. God filled the psalmist with joy, as well as peace in believing. Multitudes, by faith beholding the sufferings and glory of Christ, have learned to fear the justice and trust in the mercy of God through Him. Many are the benefits with which we are daily loaded, both by the providence and by the grace of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he hath put a new song in my mouth - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>. The idea is, that he had given a new or fresh "occasion" for praise. The deliverance was so marked, and was such an addition to former mercies, that a new expression of thanks was proper. It was an act of such surprising intervention on the part of God that the language used on former occasions, and which was adapted to express the mercies then received, would not be sufficient to convey the sense of gratitude felt for the present deliverance. As applied to the Messiah, and referring (as it was supposed in the notes at <a href="/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>) to his being raised up to glory after the depth of his sorrows, it would mean that no language hitherto employed to express gratitude to God would be adequate to the occasion, but that the language of a new song of praise would be demanded to celebrate so great an event.<p>Even praise unto our God - "To our God;" identifying himself, as the Messiah does, with his people, and expressing the idea that the new song of praise was appropriate to them as well as to "himself," since they would be benefited by his work, and since God was their God as well as his. Compare <a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>.<p>Many shall see it - Great numbers of the human race shall be made acquainted with the occasion which there was for such a song.<p>And fear - Learn to reverence, to worship, to honor God, as the result of what had been done.<p>And shall trust in the Lord - Shall confide in God; shall put their trust in him; shall become his true worshippers and friends:<p>(a) as the effect of this merciful interposition in behalf of him who had been thus in trouble or distress, and who was enabled to triumph;<p>(b) as the result of the work accomplished by him.<p>The effect of the Redeemer's sorrows, and of God's merciful help, would be that great numbers would learn to put their trust in God, or would become his true friends. No man, in fact, can compute the "numbers" of those who, in consequence of the work of the Messiah, will turn to God and become his true worshippers and friends. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. a new song&#8212;(See on [585]Ps 33:3).<p>fear, and &#8230; trust&#8212;revere with love and faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He hath put a new song in my mouth; </span> partly by giving me new matter or occasion for a song; and partly by inspiring me with the very words of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall see it, </span> i.e. shall observe God’s wonderful mercies vouchsafed to me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And fear, </span> i.e. shall stand in awe of that God, who by this instance they see to have so great power, either to save or to destroy, and tremble at his judgments, and give him that reverence, and worship, and obedience which he requires.

Mercy and praise are cause and effect. The deliverance recorded in ver. 2 produces the praise of vers. 3-5. The phrase, "our God," shows us how David instinctively identifies himself with his people.

The answer to this question which he himself throws out is, that Jahve is the goal of his waiting or hoping. It might appear strange that the poet is willing to make the brevity of human life a reason for being calm, and a ground of comfort. But here we have the explanation. Although not expressly assured of a future life of blessedness, his faith, even in the midst of death, lays hold on Jahve as the Living One and as the God of the living. It is just this which is so heroic in the Old Testament faith, that in the midst of the riddles of the present, and in the face of the future which is lost in dismal night, it casts itself unreservedly into the arms of God. While, however, sin is the root of all evil, the poet prays in <a href="/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a> before all else, that God would remove from him all the transgressions by which he has fully incurred his affliction; and while, given over to the consequences of his sin, he would become, not only to his own dishonour but also to the dishonour of God, a derision to the unbelieving, he prays in <a href="/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a> that God would not permit it to come to this. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a>, has Mercha, and is consequently, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-10.htm">Psalm 35:10</a>, to be read with  (not o&#774;), since an accent can never be placed by Kametz chatu&#770;ph. Concerning &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a>, see on <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>. As to the rest he is silent and calm; for God is the author, viz., of his affliction (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, used just as absolutely as in <a href="/psalms/22-32.htm">Psalm 22:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/52-11.htm">Psalm 52:11</a>, <a href="/lamentations/1-21.htm">Lamentations 1:21</a>). Without ceasing still to regard intently the prosperity of the ungodly, he recognises the hand of God in his affliction, and knows that he has not merited anything better. But it is permitted to him to pray that God would suffer mercy to take the place of right. &#1504;&#1490;&#1506;&#1498; is the name he gives to his affliction, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/38-12.htm">Psalm 38:12</a>, as being a stroke (blow) of divine wrath; &#1514;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491;&#1498;, as a quarrel into which God's hand has fallen with him; and by &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, with the almighty (punishing) hand of God, he contrasts himself the feeble one, to whom, if the present state of things continues, ruin is certain. In <a href="/psalms/39-12.htm">Psalm 39:12</a> he puts his own personal experience into the form of a general maxim: when with rebukes (&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; from &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514;, collateral form with &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;) Thou chastenest a man on account of iniquity (perf. conditionale), Thou makest his pleasantness (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>), i.e., his bodily beauty (<a href="/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21</a>), to melt away, moulder away (&#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1505;, fut. apoc. from &#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1492; to cause to melt, <a href="/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>), like the moth (<a href="/hosea/5-12.htm">Hosea 5:12</a>), so that it falls away, as a moth-eaten garment falls into rags. Thus do all men become mere nothing. They are sinful and perishing. The thought expressed in <a href="/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a> is here repeated as a refrain. The music again strikes in here, as there. </body></html>
