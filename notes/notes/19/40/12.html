But see the frightful view the psalmist had of sin. This made the discovery of a Redeemer so welcome. In all his reflections upon each step of his life, he discovered something amiss. The sight and sense of our sins in their own colours, must distract us, if we have not at the same time some sight of a Saviour. If Christ has triumphed over our spiritual enemies, then we, through him, shall be more than conquerors. This may encourage all that seek God and love his salvation, to rejoice in him, and to praise him. No griefs nor poverty can render those miserable who fear the Lord. Their God, and all that he has or does, is the ground of their joy. The prayer of faith can unlock his fulness, which is adapted to all their wants. The promises are sure, the moment of fulfilment hastens forward. He who once came in great humility, shall come again in glorious majesty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For innumerable evils have compassed me about - Have surrounded me, or have beset me on every side. The evils here referred to, understood as being those which came upon the Messiah, were sorrows that came upon him in consequence of his undertaking to do what could not be done by sacrifices and offerings <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>; that is, his undertaking to save men by his own "obedience unto death." The time referred to here, I apprehend, is that when the full effects of his having assumed the sins of the world to make expiation for them came upon him; when he was about to endure the agonies of Gethsemane and Calvary.<p>Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me - On this passage, as constituting one of the main objections, and the strongest objection, to the application of the psalm to the Messiah, and on the way in which such objection may be met, see introduction to this psalm (3b).<p>So that I am not able to look up - This is not the exact idea of the Hebrew word. That is simply, I am not able to see; and it refers to the dimness or failure of sight caused by distress, weakness, or old age. <a href="/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-15.htm">1 Samuel 4:15</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-4.htm">1 Kings 14:4</a>; compare <a href="/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>. The idea here is, not that he was unable to look up, but that the calamities which came upon him were so heavy and severe as to make his sight dim, or to deprive him of vision. Either by weeping, or by the mere pressure of suffering, he was so affected as almost to be deprived of the power of seeing.<p>They are more than the hairs of mine head - That is, the sorrows that come upon me in connection with sin. The idea is that they were innumerable - the hairs of the head, or the sands on the seashore; being employed in the Scriptures to denote what cannot be numbered. See <a href="/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>. Compare <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-11.htm">2 Samuel 17:11</a>.<p>Therefore my heart faileth me - Margin, as in Hebrew: "forsaketh." The idea is that he sank under these sufferings; he could not sustain them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. evils&#8212;inflicted by others.<p>iniquities&#8212;or penal afflictions, and sometimes calamities in the wide sense. This meaning of the word is very common (Ps 31:11; 38:4; compare Ge 4:13, Cain's punishment; Ge 19:15, that of Sodom; 1Sa 28:10, of the witch of En-dor; also 2Sa 16:12; Job 19:29; Isa 5:18; 53:11). This meaning of the word is also favored by the clause, "taken hold of me," which follows, which can be said appropriately of sufferings, but not of sins (compare Job 27:20; Ps 69:24). Thus, the difficulties in referring this Psalm to Christ, arising from the usual reading of this verse, are removed. Of the terrible afflictions, or sufferings, alluded to and endured for us, compare Lu 22:39-44, and the narrative of the scenes of Calvary.<p>my heart faileth me&#8212;(Mt 26:38), "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death."<p>cannot look up&#8212;literally, "I cannot see," not denoting the depression of conscious guilt, as Lu 18:13, but exhaustion from suffering, as dimness of eyes (compare Ps 6:7; 13:3; 38:10). The whole context thus sustains the sense assigned to iniquities.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Mine iniquities; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

And therefore it is not probable that the Holy Ghost would use such an expression concerning the sinless Christ of God, as is never used in Scripture, but either of a man’s own sins, or of the punishment deserved by his own sins. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Have taken hold upon me:</span> men’s sins are figuratively said to follow them, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/5-24.htm" title="Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.">1 Timothy 5:24</a></span>, and to find them out, <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/32-23.htm" title="But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.">Numbers 32:23</a></span>, and here <span class="ital">to take hold of them</span>, as a serjeant takes hold of a man whom he arrests. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To look up</span> unto God or men, with any comfort and confidence; I am ashamed and confounded, by reason of my numberless sins.

His doings towards Israel were from of old a fulness of wondrous deeds and plans of deliverance, which was ever realizing and revealing itself. There is not &#1506;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, a possibility of comparison with Thee, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; (Ew. 321, c) &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; - &#1506;&#1512;&#1498; as in <a href="/psalms/89-7.htm">Psalm 89:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a> - they are too powerful (&#1506;&#1510;&#1501; of a powerful sum, as in <a href="/psalms/69-5.htm">Psalm 69:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>) for one to enumerate. According to Rosenmller, Stier, and Hupfeld, &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; even affirms the same thing in other words: it is not possible to lay them forth to Thee (before Thee); but that man should "lay forth" (Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) before God His marvellous works and His thoughts of salvation, is an unbecoming conception. The cohortative forms, which follow, &#1488;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492; &#1493;&#1488;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; ,wollof h, admit of being taken as a protasis to what follows, after the analogy of <a href="/job/19-18.htm">Job 19:18</a>; <a href="/job/16-6.htm">Job 16:6</a>; <a href="/job/30-26.htm">Job 30:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a> : if I wish to declare them and speak them forth, they are too powerful (numerous) to be enumerated (Ges. 128, 1, d). The accentuation, however, renders it as a parenthetical clause: I would (as in <a href="/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-13.htm">Psalm 55:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/6-10.htm">Psalm 6:10</a>) declare them and speak them forth. He would do this, but because God, in the fulness of His wondrous works and thoughts of salvation, is absolutely without an equal, he is obliged to leave it undone - they are so powerful (numerous) that the enumeration of them falls far short of their powerful fulness. The words alioqui pronunciarem et eloquerer have the character of a parenthesis, and, as <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a> shows, this accords with the style of this Psalm. </body></html>
