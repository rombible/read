Let us then bless his name. The Lord is my strength, to support me, and carry me on through all my services and sufferings. The heart that truly believes, shall in due time greatly rejoice: we are to expect joy and peace in believing. God shall have the praise of it: thus must we express our gratitude. The saints rejoice in others' comfort as well as their own: we have the less benefit from the light of the sun, nor from the light of God's countenance, for others' sharing therein. The psalmist concludes with a short, but comprehensive prayer. God's people are his inheritance, and precious in his eyes. He prays that God would save them; that he would bless them with all good, especially the plenty of his ordinances, which are food to the soul. And direct their actions and overrule their affairs for good. Also, lift them up for ever; not only those of that age, but his people in every age to come; lift them up as high as heaven. There, and there only, will saints be lifted up for ever, never more to sink, or be depressed. Save us, Lord Jesus, from our sins; bless us, thou Son of Abraham, with the blessing of righteousness; feed us, thou good Shepherd of the sheep, and lift us up for ever from the dust, O thou, who art the Resurrection and the Life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord is my strength - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1</a>.<p>And my shield - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>.

That is, the author both of natural and spiritual strength; that gave him strength of body, and fortitude of mind, to bear up under all the exercises he was tried with; the strength of his life, spiritual and temporal, and of his salvation; the strength of his heart under present distresses, and who he knew would be so in the hour of death, when his heart and strength would fail; <p>and my shield; to protect and defend him; as were the love, power, and faithfulness of God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, his power and fulness, his blood, righteousness, and salvation; <p>my heart trusted in him; in the Lord as his strength and shield; not in any creature, nor in his own strength and righteousness; but in the Lord God, in whom are righteousness and strength: and it is plain he did not trust in his own heart, since his heart trusted in the Lord; and which shows that his trust was an hearty one, his faith was a faith unfeigned, he believed with the heart unto righteousness; <p>and I am helped: this was the fruit of his trust, even a gracious experience of divine assistance: saints are helpless in themselves, and are also as to the help of man; God is the only helper of them; he helps them out of all their troubles; in whatsoever he calls them unto, and to what they want; and the help he affords is sometimes quick, and always seasonable; and sometimes by means, and sometimes without them; <p>therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; that is, in the Lord, the ground of which was the help he had from him; and this joy was very great, a joy unspeakable, and full of glory; it was not carnal, but spiritual, a heart joy, joy in the Holy Ghost; <p>and with my song will I praise him; praise is due to God, what glorifies him, and is acceptable to him; it becomes the saints, is comely for them, and it is pleasant work to them, when grace is in exercise; see <a href="/psalms/69-30.htm">Psalm 69:30</a>; this may be understood of one of his songs, and one of the best of them, and of one better than this, as a Jewish writer (u) observes. <p>(u) R.

The preposition &#1502;&#1503; in connection with the verbs &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to be deaf, dumb, and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, to keep silence, is a pregnant form of expression denoting an aversion or turning away which does not deign to give the suppliant an answer. Jahve is his &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, his ground of confidence; but if He continues thus to keep silence, then he who confides in Him will become like those who are going down (<a href="/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>), or are gone down (<a href="/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>) to the pit. The participle of the past answers better to the situation of one already on the brink of the abyss. In the double sentence with &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;, the chief accent falls upon the second clause, for which the first only paratactically opens up the way (cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>); in Latin it would be ne, te mihi non respondente, similis fiam. Olshausen, and Baur with him, believes that because &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; has not the accent on the ultima as being perf. consec., it must be interpreted according to the accentuation thus, "in order that Thou mayst no longer keep silence, whilst I am already become like..." But this ought to be &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, or at least &#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;. And if &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; were to be taken as a real perfect, it would then rather have to be rendered "and I should then be like." But, notwithstanding &#1493;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is Milel, it is still perf. consecuticum ("and I am become like"); for if, in a sentence of more than one member following upon &#1508;&#1503;, the fut., as is usually the case (vid., on <a href="/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>), goes over into the perf., then the latter, in most instances, has the tone of the perf. consec. (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-25.htm">Judges 18:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/5-9.htm">Proverbs 5:9-12</a>, <a href="/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a>), but not always. The penultima-accentuation is necessarily retained in connection with the two great pausal accents, Silluk and Athnach, <a href="/deuteronomy/8-12.htm">Deuteronomy 8:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a>; in this passage in connection with Rebia mugrash, just as we may say, in general, the perf. consec. sometimes retains its penultima-accentuation in connection with distinctives instead of being accented on the ultima; e.g., in connection with Rebia mugrash, <a href="/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a>; with Rebia, <a href="/proverbs/19-14.htm">Proverbs 19:14</a> (cf. <a href="/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a> with <a href="/ezekiel/14-17.htm">Ezekiel 14:17</a>); with Zakeph. <a href="/1_samuel/29-8.htm">1 Samuel 29:8</a>; and even with Tiphcha Obad. Oba 1:10, <a href="/joel/3-21.htm">Joel 3:21</a>. The national grammarians are ignorant of any law on this subject.<p>(Note: Aben-Ezra (Moznajim 36b) explains the perfect accented on the penult. in <a href="/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a> from the conformity of sound, and Kimchi (Michlol 6b) simply records the phenomenon.)<p>The point towards which the psalmist stretches forth his hands in prayer is Jahve's holy &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;. Such is the word (after the form &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, &#1506;&#1496;&#1497;&#1503;) used only in the Books of Kings and Chronicles, with the exception of this passage, to denote the Holy of Holies, not as being &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (Aquila and Symmachus), or &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, oraculum (Jerome), as it were, Jahve's audience chamber (Hengstenberg) - a meaning that is not in accordance with the formation of the word, - but as the hinder part of the tent, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, Arabic dabara, to be behind, whence dubr (Talmudic &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;), that which is behind (opp. kubl. kibal, that which is in the front), cf. Jesurun p. 87f. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-3.htm">Psalm 28:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/28-4.htm">Psalm 28:4</a> the prayer is expanded. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; (instead of which we find &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; in <a href="/psalms/26-9.htm">Psalm 26:9</a>), to draw any one down forcibly to destruction, or to drag him to the place of judgment, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-20.htm">Ezekiel 32:20</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>; <a href="/job/24-22.htm">Job 24:22</a>. The delineation of the ungodly David borrows from his actual foes, Should he succumb to them, then his fate would be like that which awaits them, to whom he is conscious that he is radically unlike. He therefore prays that God's recompensing justice may anticipate him, i.e., that He may requite them according to their desert, before he succumbs, to whom they have feigned &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, a good understanding, or being on good terms, whereas they cherished in their heart the &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; that is now unmasked (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>). &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, used of an official adjudication, as in <a href="/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>. The epanaphora of &#1514;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1500;&#1492;&#1501; is like <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>.<p>(Note: This repetition, at the end, of a significant word that has been used at the beginning of a verse, is a favourite custom of Isaiah's (Comment. S. 387; transl. ii.134).)<p>The phrase &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;), which occurs frequently in the prophets, signifies to recompense or repay to any one his accomplishing, his manifestation, that is to say, what he has done and merited; the thoughts and expression call to mind more particularly <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8-11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>. The right to pray for recompense (vengeance) is grounded, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>, upon their blindness to God's just and merciful rule as it is to be seen in human history (cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>). The contrast of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1495;&#1512;&#1505;, to pull down (with a personal object, as in <a href="/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a>), is like Jeremiah's style (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/42-10.htm">Psalm 42:10</a>, cf. 1:10; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, and frequently, Sir. 49:7). In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/28-5.htm">Psalm 28:5</a>, the prominent thought in David's mind is, that they shamefully fail to recognise how gloriously and graciously God has again and again acknowledged him as His anointed one. He has (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>) received the promise, that God would build him a house, i.e., grant perpetual continuance to his kingship. The Absolomites are in the act of rebellion against this divine appointment. Hence they shall experience the very reverse of the divine promise given to David: Jahve will pull them down and not build them up, He will destroy, at its very commencement, this dynasty set up in opposition to God. </body></html>
