Thus Tyre (or Tsûr) is built on a broad shelf of rock. We see from <a href="/context/deuteronomy/32-30.htm" title="How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?">Deuteronomy 32:30-31</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-2.htm" title="There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside you: neither is there any rock like our God.">1Samuel 2:2</a>, that “rock” was a common metaphor for a tutelary deity, and it is adopted frequently for Jehovah in the Psalms and poetical books.

The LXX. (followed by Vulg.) here, as generally, apparently through timidity, suppresses the metaphor, and renders “my God.” In the song of Moses in Deuteronomy, the metaphor occurs nine times, and Stanley thinks it was derived from the granite peaks of Sinai (<span class= "ital">Jewish Church, </span>p. 195).<p><span class= "bld">Be not silent to me.</span>—Vulg. and margin, rightly, “from me.” The word rendered “silent” appears, like <span class= "greekheb">κωφὸς </span>in Greek, to have the double meaning of deaf and dumb, and is apparently from an analogous derivation. (See Gesenius, <span class= "ital">Lex., sub voce.</span>) Hence we might render, “turn not a deaf ear to me,” or “turn not from me in silence.”<p><span class= "bld">Them that go down into the pit</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., the dead, </span>or <span class= "ital">those just about to die </span>(<a href="/psalms/30-3.htm" title="O LORD, you have brought up my soul from the grave: you have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.">Psalm 30:3</a>). In <a href="/psalms/88-4.htm" title="I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that has no strength:">Psalm 88:4</a>, the expression is parallel to “My life draweth nigh unto the grave;” pit (<span class= "ital">bôr</span>) is either the sepulchre (as <a href="/isaiah/14-19.htm" title="But you are cast out of your grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.">Isaiah 14:19</a>), or the world of the dead (<a href="/psalms/88-4.htm" title="I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that has no strength:">Psalm 88:4</a>).

Observe his faith in prayer; God is my rock, on whom I build my hope. Believers should not rest till they have received some token that their prayers are heard. He prays that he may not be numbered with the wicked. Save me from being entangled in the snares they have laid for me. Save me from being infected with their sins, and from doing as they do. Lord, never leave me to use such arts of deceit and treachery for my safety, as they use for my ruin. Believers dread the way of sinners; the best are sensible of the danger they are in of being drawn aside: we should all pray earnestly to God for his grace to keep us. Those who are careful not to partake with sinners in their sins, have reason to hope that they shall not receive their plagues. He speaks of the just judgments of the Lord on the workers of iniquity, ver. 4. This is not the language of passion or revenge. It is a prophecy that there will certainly come a day, when God will punish every man who persists in his evil deeds. Sinners shall be reckoned with, not only for the mischief they have done, but for the mischief they designed, and did what they could to effect. Disregard of the works of the Lord, is the cause of the sin of sinners, and becomes the cause of their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto thee will I cry - That is, under the consciousness of the danger to which I am exposed - the danger of being drawn away into the society of the wicked. In such circumstances his reliance was not on his own strength; or on his own resolutions; on his own heart; or on his fellowmen. He felt that he was safe only in God, and he appeals to Him, therefore, in this earnest manner, to save him.<p>O Lord my rock - See the notes at <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>.<p>Be not silent to me - Margin, "from me." So the Hebrew. The idea is that of one who will not speak to us, or who will not attend to us. We pray, and we look for an "answer" to our prayers, or, as it were, we expect God to "speak" to us; to utter words of kindness; to assure us of His favor; to declare our sins forgiven.<p>Lest, if thou be silent to me - If thou dost not answer my supplications.<p>I become like unto them that go down into the pit - Like those who die; or, lest I be crushed by anxiety and distress, and die. The word "pit" here refers to the grave. So it is used in <a href="/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-4.htm">Psalm 88:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15</a>, <a href="/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>. The meaning is, that if he did not obtain help from God he despaired of life. His troubles would overwhelm and crush him.

An earnest cry for divine aid against his enemies, as being also those of God, is followed by the Psalmist's praise in assurance of a favorable answer, and a prayer for all God's people.<p>1. my rock&#8212;(Ps 18:2, 31).<p>be not silent to me&#8212;literally, "from me," deaf or inattentive.<p>become like them, &c.&#8212;share their fate.<p>go down into the pit&#8212;or, "grave" (Ps 30:3).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/28.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 Unto thee will I cry, O Lord my rock; be not silent to me, lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.<p>2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.<p><a href="/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a><p>"Unto thee will I cry, O Lord my rock." - A cry is the natural expression of sorrow, and is a suitable utterance when all other modes of appeal fail us; but the cry must be alone directed to the Lord, for to cry to man is to waste our entreaties upon the air. When we consider the readiness of the Lord to hear, and his ability to aid, we shall see good reason for directing all our appeals at once to the God of our salvation, and shall use language of firm resolve like that in the text, "I will cry." The immutable Jehovah is our rock, the immovable foundation of all our hopes and our refuge in time of trouble: we are fixed in our determination to flee to him as our stronghold in every hour of danger. It will be in vain to call to the rocks in the day of judgment, but our rock attends to our cries. "Be not silent to me." Mere formalists may be content without answers to their prayers, but genuine suppliants cannot; they are not satisfied with the results of prayer itself in calming the mind and subduing the will - they must go further and obtain actual replies from heaven, or they cannot rest; and those replies they long to receive at once, if possible; they dread even a little of God's silence. God's voice is often so terrible that it shakes the wilderness; but his silence is equally full of awe to an eager suppliant. When God seems to close his ear, we must not therefore close our mouths, but rather cry with more earnestness; for when our note grows shrill with eagerness and grief, he will not long deny us a hearing. What a dreadful case should we be in if the Lord should become for ever silent to our prayers! This thought suggested itself to David, and he turned it into a plea, thus teaching us to argue and reason with God in our prayers. "Lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit." Deprived of the God who answers prayer, we should be in a more pitiable plight than the dead in the grave, and should soon sink to the same level as the lost in hell. We must have answers to prayer: ours is an urgent case of dire necessity; surely the Lord will speak peace to our agitated minds, for he never can find it in his heart to permit his own elect to perish.<p><a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a><p>This is much to the same effect as the first verse, only that it refers to future as well as present pleadings. Hear me! Hear me! "Hear the voice of my supplications!" This is the burden of both verses. We cannot be put off with a refusal when we are in the spirit of prayer; we labour, use importunity, and agonise in supplications until a hearing is granted us. The word "supplications," in the plural, shows the number, continuance, and variety of a good man's prayers, while the expression, "hear the voice," seems to hint that there is an inner meaning, or heart-voice, about which spiritual men are far more concerned than for their outward and audible utterances. A silent prayer may have a louder voice than the cries of those priests who sought to awaken Baal with their shouts. "When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle:" which holy place was the type of our Lord Jesus; and if we would gain acceptance, we must turn ourselves evermore to the blood-besprinkled mercy seat of his atonement. Uplifted hands have ever been a form of devout posture, and are intended to signify a reaching upward towards God, a readiness, an eagerness to receive the blessing sought after. We stretch out empty hands, for we are beggars; we lift them up, for we seek heavenly supplies; we lift them towards the mercy seat of Jesus, for there our expectation dwells. O that whenever we use devout gestures, we may possess contrite hearts, and so speed well with God. <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm seems to be made upon the same occasion with the former, and is mixed, as many others of his Psalms are, of hopes and fears, of prayers and praises. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>David prayeth earnestly for himself, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/28-1.htm" title="To you will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if you be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.">Psalm 28:1</a>,2</span>, that he might not be led away with the wicked, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/28-3.htm" title="Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbors, but mischief is in their hearts.">Psalm 28:3</a>,4</span>.
