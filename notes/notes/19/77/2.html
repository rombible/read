In this he is an example for our imitation. When under any trouble, and especially trouble of mind for sin, we must apply to God and spread our case before him. We must not endeavour to get rid of our trouble some other way, but must entreat him to remove it by lifting up the light of his countenance upon us. This, and only this, will give us peace of mind, and put joy and gladness into our hearts. <span class="ital">My sore ran — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ידי נגרה</span>, <span class="ital">jadi</span> <span class="ital"> ah, my hand flowed, </span>or <span class="ital">poured forth, </span>that is, was spread abroad, or stretched out to God in prayer <span class="ital">and ceased not. — </span>So Hammond, Patrick, Waterland, and Houbigant. <span class="ital">In the night — </span>Which to others was a time of rest and refreshment, but to me of sorrow and distress. <span class="ital">My soul refused to be comforted — </span>Without a gracious answer from God, and an assurance that he had not cast me off, but was again reconciled to me, <a href="/context/psalms/77-7.htm" title="Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more?...">Psalm 77:7-9</a>.

In the day of his trouble the psalmist did not seek for the diversion of business or amusement, but he sought God, and his favor and grace. Those that are under trouble of mind, must pray it away. He pored upon the trouble; the methods that should have relieved him did but increase his grief. When he remembered God, it was only the Divine justice and wrath. His spirit was overwhelmed, and sank under the load. But let not the remembrance of the comforts we have lost, make us unthankful for those that are left. Particularly he called to remembrance the comforts with which he supported himself in former sorrows. Here is the language of a sorrowful, deserted soul, walking in darkness; a common case even among those that fear the Lord, Isa 50:10. Nothing wounds and pierces like the thought of God's being angry. God's own people, in a cloudy and dark day, may be tempted to make wrong conclusions about their spiritual state, and that of God's kingdom in the world. But we must not give way to such fears. Let faith answer them from the Scripture. The troubled fountain will work itself clear again; and the recollection of former times of joyful experience often raises a hope, tending to relief. Doubts and fears proceed from the want and weakness of faith. Despondency and distrust under affliction, are too often the infirmities of believers, and, as such, are to be thought upon by us with sorrow and shame. When, unbelief is working in us, we must thus suppress its risings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/77.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord - Compare the notes at <a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>. This trouble may have been either mental or bodily; that is, it may have arisen from some form of disease, or it may have been that which sprang from difficulties in regard to the divine character, government, and dealings. That it "assumed" the latter form, even if it had its beginning in the former, is apparent from the following verses. Whether it was connected with any form of bodily disease must be determined by the proper interpretation of the next clause in this verse.<p>My sore ran in the night - Margin, "My hand." It is evident that our translators sup. posed that there was some bodily disease - some running sore - which was the cause of his trouble. Hence, they so rendered the Hebrew word. But it is now generally agreed that this is without authority. The Hebrew word is "hand" - &#1497;&#1491;  ya&#770;d - a word which is never used in the sense of sore or wound. The Septuagint renders it, "my hands are before him." The Vulgate renders it in the same manner. Luther, "My hand is stretched out at night." DeWette, "My hand is stretched out at night unwearied." The word which is rendered in our version "ran" - &#1504;&#1490;&#1512;  na&#770;gar - means to "flow;" and, in Niphil, to be poured out, and then, "to be stretched out;" which is evidently its meaning here. The idea is, that his hand was stretched out in earnest supplication, and that this continued in the night when these troubles came most upon him. See <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/77-4.htm">Psalm 77:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/77-6.htm">Psalm 77:6</a>. In his painful meditations in the night. watches - in thinking on God and his ways, as he lay upon his bed, he stretched out his hand in fervent prayer to God.<p>And ceased not - The word used here - &#1508;&#1493;&#1490;  pu&#770;g - means properly to be cold; then, to be torpid, sluggish, slack. Here it means that the hand did not become weary; it did not fall from exhaustion; or, in other words, that he did not give over praying through weariness or exhaustion.<p>My soul refused to be comforted - I resisted all the suggestions that came to my own mind, that might have comforted me. My heart was so melancholy and downcast; my spirits were so crushed; my mind was so dark; I had become so morbid, that I loved to cherish these thoughts. I chose to dwell on them. They had obtained possession of me, and I could not let them go. There was nothing that my own mind could suggest, there was nothing that occurred to me, that would relieve the difficulty or restore peace to my soul. These sad and gloomy thoughts filled all my soul, and left no room for thoughts of consolation and peace. A truly pious man may, therefore, get into a state of mind - a sad, dispirited, melancholy, morbid state - in which nothing that can be said to him, nothing that will occur to himself, will give him comfort and peace.

Not the creature, for help, and creature amusements to drive away trouble, but the Lord, in private, by prayer and supplication; a time of trouble is a time for prayer, <a href="//biblehub.com/james/5-13.htm">James 5:13</a>, all men have their trouble, but the people of God more especially; and there are some particular times in which they have more than usual, and then it may be said to be "a day of trouble" with them; which sometimes arises from themselves, the strength of their corruptions, the weakness of their graces, their backwardness to duties, or poor performance of them; sometimes from others, from the profaneness or persecutions of the men of the world, from the heretical notions or wicked lives of professors; sometimes from the temptations of Satan, and at other times from the Lord himself more immediately, by his withdrawing his presence from them, or by laying his afflicting hand upon them; but, let the trouble come from what quarter it may, it is always right to seek the Lord. Some think reference is had to the time of trouble mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, <p>my sore ran in the night; my "stroke", or "wound" (i); so Kimchi interprets it; the wound that was made in his soul, and the pain and anguish, grief and trouble, which flowed from it; see <a href="/jeremiah/6-7.htm">Jeremiah 6:7</a> though the word may be literally rendered "my hand" (k); and the sense is, either that his hand flowed or was wet with wiping his eyes, or with the tears that flowed from his eyes, which ran down to his fingers' ends; so the Targum, <p>"in the night my eye dropped with tears;'' <p>or rather that his hand was stretched out, as waters, that are poured out and run, are spread, that is, in prayer; the stretching out of the hand being a prayer gesture: <p>and ceased not; was not remiss and feeble, or was not let down, as Moses's, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/17-11.htm">Exodus 17:11</a>, it denotes the constancy of prayer, and his continuance in it; he prayed without ceasing: <p>my soul refused to be comforted: such was the greatness of his distress, like that of Jacob's and Rachel's, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>, it is right to refuse comfort and peace, which men speak to themselves upon the false foundation of their own merit and works; or any but what comes from the God of all comfort, and through Christ, in whom is all solid consolation, and by his Spirit, who is the Comforter; but it is wrong to refuse any that comes from hence, and by means of the promises, the word and ordinances and ministries of the Gospel, or Christian friends; this shows the strength of unbelief. <p>(i) "plaga mea", Pagninus, Muis.
