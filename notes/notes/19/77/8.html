In the day of his trouble the psalmist did not seek for the diversion of business or amusement, but he sought God, and his favor and grace. Those that are under trouble of mind, must pray it away. He pored upon the trouble; the methods that should have relieved him did but increase his grief. When he remembered God, it was only the Divine justice and wrath. His spirit was overwhelmed, and sank under the load. But let not the remembrance of the comforts we have lost, make us unthankful for those that are left. Particularly he called to remembrance the comforts with which he supported himself in former sorrows. Here is the language of a sorrowful, deserted soul, walking in darkness; a common case even among those that fear the Lord, Isa 50:10. Nothing wounds and pierces like the thought of God's being angry. God's own people, in a cloudy and dark day, may be tempted to make wrong conclusions about their spiritual state, and that of God's kingdom in the world. But we must not give way to such fears. Let faith answer them from the Scripture. The troubled fountain will work itself clear again; and the recollection of former times of joyful experience often raises a hope, tending to relief. Doubts and fears proceed from the want and weakness of faith. Despondency and distrust under affliction, are too often the infirmities of believers, and, as such, are to be thought upon by us with sorrow and shame. When, unbelief is working in us, we must thus suppress its risings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/77.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is his mercy clean gone for ever? - The word rendered "clean gone" means to fail; to fail utterly. The idea is, Can it be that the compassion of God has become exhausted - that no more mercy is to be shown to mankind - that henceforth all is to be left to stern and severe justice? What would the world be if this were so! What must be the condition of mankind if mercy were no more to be shown to the race!<p>Doth his promise fail for evermore? - Margin, as in Hebrew, "to generation and generation." The original Hebrew rendered "promise" means "word;" and the question is, whether it can be that what God has spoken is to be found false. Can we no longer rely on what he has said? All the hopes of mankind depend on that, and if that should fail, all prospect of salvation in regard to our race must be at an end. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/77.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. holdest &#8230; waking&#8212;or, "fast," that I cannot sleep.

Or "his grace" (q); and mercy is no other than grace to objects in misery; Unbelief says it is gone, that no more will be shown, and that the treasures of it are exhausted; but Faith says it is not gone, and observes that God is the God of all grace, is rich in mercy, and abundant in goodness; that his Son is full of grace and truth, and so is the covenant; and that though there is an abundance of it given in conversion, and there are continual supplies of it afterwards; yet this grace is still sufficient, and this mercy abundant; salvation is by it, as for millions past, so for millions present and to come; the mercy of God is new every morning, it endures for ever, it is from everlasting to everlasting: <p>doth his promise fail for evermore? or word (r); his words of consolation, as Kimchi interprets it; the sense may be, will he speak never a word of comfort more? Unbelief says he will not, but Faith says he will; and that though he brings into the wilderness, yet he will speak comfortably there; and as he answered the Angel of the covenant with good and comfortable words, so he orders his ministers to speak, and by them he does speak comfortably to his people: or, in general, the word of the Gospel is meant; which though it may be sometimes scarce and rare, and there may be few preachers of it; yet it lives and abides for ever, it is the everlasting Gospel; or, in particular, the promise or promises of the Gospel: Faith says not one of these shall fail, grounding it upon the ability of God, and his power to perform: and upon his faithfulness, which he will never suffer to fail; and the promises of God are so far from failing for evermore, that they never fail at all; there never was any instance of any; not one of the good things which God has spoken of, from the creation of the world to this present time, have ever failed; the promises are yea and amen in Christ; see <a href="/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>.

According to the pointing, &#1493;&#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; appears to be meant to be imperative after the form &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1500;, which occurs instead of &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500; and &#1492;&#1511;&#1514;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, cf. <a href="/psalms/94-1.htm">Psalm 94:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-18.htm">Jeremiah 17:18</a>, and the mode of writing &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-6.htm">2 Kings 8:6</a>, and frequently; therefore et audi  equals  ut audias (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/21-3.htm">2 Samuel 21:3</a>). But such an isolated form of address is not to be tolerated; &#1493;&#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; has been regarded as perf. consec. in the sense of ut audiat, although this modification of &#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; into &#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; in connection with the appearing of the Waw consec. cannot be supported in any other instance (Ew. &#1431;234, e), and Kimchi on this account tries to persuade himself to that which is impossible, viz., that &#1493;&#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; in respect of sound stands for &#1493;&#1497;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;. The preterites in <a href="/psalms/77-3.htm">Psalm 77:3</a> express that which has commenced and which will go on. The poet labours in his present time of affliction to press forward to the Lord, who has withdrawn from him; his hand is diffused, i.e., stretched out (not: poured out, for the radical meaning of &#1504;&#1490;&#1512;, as the Syriac shows, is protrahere), in the night-time without wearying and leaving off; it is fixedly and stedfastly (&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, as it is expressed in <a href="/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>) stretched out towards heaven. His soul is comfortless, and all comfort up to the present rebounds as it were from it (cf. <a href="/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>). If he remembers God, who was once near to him, then he is compelled to groan (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-18.htm">Psalm 55:18</a>, <a href="/psalms/55-3.htm">Psalm 55:3</a>; and on the cohortative form of a Lamed He verb, cf. Ges. &#1431;75, 6), because He has hidden Himself from him; if he muses, in order to find Him again, then his spirit veils itself, i.e., it sinks into night and feebleness (&#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1507; as in <a href="/psalms/107-5.htm">Psalm 107:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/143-4.htm">Psalm 143:4</a>).
