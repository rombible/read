That word which stills the stormy ocean, and speaks it into a calm, can silence our enemies. How contrary soever light and darkness are to each other, it is hard to say which is most welcome. Does the watchman wait for the morning? so does the labourer earnestly desire the shades of evening. Some understand it of the morning and evening sacrifices. We are to look upon daily worship, both alone and with our families, to be the most needful of our daily occupations, the most delightful of our daily comforts. How much the fruitfulness of this lower part of the creation depends upon the influence of the upper, is easy to observe; every good and perfect gift is from above. He who enriches the earth, which is filled with man's sins, by his abundant and varied bounty, can neither want power nor will to feed the souls of his people. Temporal mercies to us unworthy creatures, shadow forth more important blessings. The rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring forth of the influences of the Holy Spirit, that river of God, full of the waters of life and salvation, render the hard, barren, worthless hearts of sinners fruitful in every good work, and change the face of nations more than the sun and rain change the face of nature. Wherever the Lord passes, by his preached gospel, attended by his Holy Spirit, his paths drop fatness, and numbers are taught to rejoice in and praise him. They will descend upon the pastures of the wilderness, all the earth shall hear and embrace the gospel, and bring forth abundantly the fruits of righteousness which are, through Jesus Christ, to the glory of the Father. Manifold and marvellous, O Lord, are thy works, whether of nature or of grace; surely in loving-kindness hast thou made them all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness - The waste places, or the waste parts of the land; the uncultivated places, the places of rocks and sands. The word wilderness in the Scriptures does not mean, as with us, a tract of country covered with trees, but a place of barren rocks or sands - an uncultivated or thinly inhabited region. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>; notes at <a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>. In those wastes, however, there would be valleys, or places watered by springs and streams that would afford pastures for flocks and herds. Such are the "pastures of the wilderness" referred to here. God's passing along those valleys would seem to "drop," or distil, fertility and beauty, causing grass and flowers to spring up in abundance, and clothing them with luxuriance.<p>And the little hills rejoice on every side - Margin, as in Hebrew, are girded with joy. That is, Joyful, happy scenes surround them; or, they seem to be full of joy and happiness. The valleys and the hills alike seem to be made glad. The following remarks of Professor Hackett ("Illustrations of Scripture," p. 30), will explain this passage. "Another peculiarity of the desert is that, though the soil is sandy, it rarely consists, for successive days together, of mere sand; it is interspersed, at frequent intervals, with clumps of coarse grass and low shrubs, affording very good pasturage, not only for camels, the proper tenants of the desert, but for sheep and goats. The people of the villages on the borders of the desert are accustomed to lead forth their flocks to the pastures found there. We frequently passed on our way shepherds so employed; and it was interesting to observe as a verification of what is implied in the Saviour's statement <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/25-33.htm">Matthew 25:33</a>, that the sheep and goats were not kept distinct, but intermixed with one another. The shepherds not only frequent the parts of the desert near their places of abode, but go often to a considerable distance from them; they remain absent for weeks and months, only changing their station from time to time, as their needs in respect to water and herbage may require. The incident related of Moses shows that the pastoral habits of the people were the same in his day: 'Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the further part of the desert, even to Horeb,' <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>. It is of the desert in this sense, as supplying to some extent the means of pasturage, that the prophet Joel speaks in <a href="/joel/1-19.htm">Joel 1:19</a>; <a href="/joel/2-22.htm">Joel 2:22</a>. The psalmist also says <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/65-12.htm">Psalm 65:12-13</a>, with the same reference:<p>Thou crownest the year with thy goodness,<p>And thy paths drop fatness;<p>They drop fatness on the pastures of the wilderness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. wilderness&#8212;places, though not inhabited by men, fit for pasture (Le 16:21, 22; Job 24:5).<p>pastures&#8212;is literally, "folds," or "enclosures for flocks"; and in Ps 65:13 it may be "lambs," the same word used and so translated in Ps 37:20; so that "the flocks are clothed with lambs" (a figure for abundant increase) would be the form of expression.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/65.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They, </span> God’s paths, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">drop upon the pastures of the wilderness; </span> which, though neglected by men, are furnished by God with food for wild beasts, which, being his creatures, he careth for by this means. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The little hills; </span> the hills of Canaan, which for the generality of them were but small, if compared with the great and high mountains in divers parts of the world.

God answers the prayer of His people superabundantly.

"The sea (&#1497;&#1501; construct state, as is frequently the case, with the retention of the ) of the distant ones" is that of the regions lying afar off (cf. <a href="/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1</a>). Venema observes, Significatur, Deum esse certissimum praesidium, sive agnoscatur ab hominibus et ei fidatur, sive non (therefore similar to &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>; Psychol. S. 347; tr. p. 408). But according tot he connection and the subjective colouring the idea seems to have, &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is to be understood of the believing acknowledgment which the God of Israel attains among all mankind by reason of His judicial and redemptive self-attestation (cf. <a href="/isaiah/33-13.htm">Isaiah 33:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-22.htm">2 Chronicles 32:22</a>.). In the natural world and among men He proves Himself to be the Being girded with power to whom everything must yield. He it is who setteth fast the mountains (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>) and stilleth the raging of the ocean. In connection with the giant mountains the poet may have had even the worldly powers (vid., <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>) in his mind; in connection with the seas he gives expression to this allegorical conjunction of thoughts. The roaring of the billows and the wild tumult of the nations as a mass in the empire of the world, both are stilled by the threatening of the God of Israel (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-14</a>). When He shall overthrow the proud empire of the world, whose tyranny the earth has been made to feel far and wide, then will reverential fear of Him and exultant joy at the end of the thraldom (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4-8</a>) become universal. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514; (from the originally feminine &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;  equals  a&#774;wa&#774;jat, from &#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, to mark, <a href="/numbers/34-10.htm">Numbers 34:10</a>), &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;, is the name given here to His marvellous interpositions in the history of our earth. &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1497;, <a href="/psalms/65-6.htm">Psalm 65:6</a> (also in <a href="/isaiah/26-15.htm">Isaiah 26:15</a>), out of construction is &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;. "The exit places of the morning and of the evening" are the East and West with reference to those who dwell there. Luther erroneously understands &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497; as directly referring to the creatures which at morning and evening "sport about (webern), i.e., go safely and joyfully out and in." The meaning is, the regions whence the morning breaks forth and where the evening sets. The construction is zeugmatic so far as &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, not &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, is said of the evening sun, but only to a certain extent, for neither does one say &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; (Ewald). Perret-Gentil renders it correctly: les lieux d'o surgissent l'aube et le crepuscule. God makes both these to shout for joy, inasmuch as He commands a calm to the din of war. </body></html>
