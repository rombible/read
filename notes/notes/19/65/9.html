That word which stills the stormy ocean, and speaks it into a calm, can silence our enemies. How contrary soever light and darkness are to each other, it is hard to say which is most welcome. Does the watchman wait for the morning? so does the labourer earnestly desire the shades of evening. Some understand it of the morning and evening sacrifices. We are to look upon daily worship, both alone and with our families, to be the most needful of our daily occupations, the most delightful of our daily comforts. How much the fruitfulness of this lower part of the creation depends upon the influence of the upper, is easy to observe; every good and perfect gift is from above. He who enriches the earth, which is filled with man's sins, by his abundant and varied bounty, can neither want power nor will to feed the souls of his people. Temporal mercies to us unworthy creatures, shadow forth more important blessings. The rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring forth of the influences of the Holy Spirit, that river of God, full of the waters of life and salvation, render the hard, barren, worthless hearts of sinners fruitful in every good work, and change the face of nations more than the sun and rain change the face of nature. Wherever the Lord passes, by his preached gospel, attended by his Holy Spirit, his paths drop fatness, and numbers are taught to rejoice in and praise him. They will descend upon the pastures of the wilderness, all the earth shall hear and embrace the gospel, and bring forth abundantly the fruits of righteousness which are, through Jesus Christ, to the glory of the Father. Manifold and marvellous, O Lord, are thy works, whether of nature or of grace; surely in loving-kindness hast thou made them all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou visitest the earth - God seems to come down that he may attend to the needs of the earth; survey the condition of things; arrange for the welfare of the world which he has made; and supply the needs of those whom he has created to dwell upon it. See the notes at <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>.<p>And waterest it - Margin, After thou hadst made it to desire rain. This difference between the translations in the text and in the margin can be accounted for by the various meanings of the original word. The Hebrew term - &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1511;  shu&#770;q - means properly:<p>(a) to run;<p>(b) to run after anything, to desire, to look for;<p>(c) to run over, to overflow; and then,<p>(d) to cause to overflow.<p>The meaning here evidently is, he drenched the earth, or caused the water to run abundantly. The reference is to a copious rain after a drought.<p>Thou greatly enrichest it - That is, Thou givest to it abundance; thou pourest water upon it in such quantities, and in such a manner, as to make it rich in its productions.<p>With the river of God - A river so abundant and full that it seems to come from God; it is such as we should expect to flow from a Being infinite in resources and in benevolence. Anything great is in the Scriptures often described as belonging to God, or his name is added to it to denote its greatness. Thus, hills of God mean lofty hills; cedars of God, lofty cedars, etc.<p>Which is full of water - The waters are so abundant that it seems as if they must come from God.<p>Thou preparest them corn - Grain. Thou givest to those who cultivate the earth an abundant harvest.<p>When thou hast so provided for it - Or rather, When thou hast thus prepared the earth, to wit, by sending down abundant rains upon it. God prepares the earth to bear an abundant harvest, and then he gives that harvest. The preparation of the earth for the harvest, and then the givinq of the harvest, are alike from him. The harvest could not be without the previous rain, and neither the rain nor the harvest could be without God. He does not create a harvest by miracle, but follows the order which he has himself ordained, and has respect to his own laws. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. visitest&#8212;in mercy (compare Ps 8:4).<p>river of God&#8212;His exhaustless resources.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/tod/psalms/65.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.<p>10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.<p>11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.<p>12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness; and the little hills rejoice on every side.<p>13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.<p><a href="/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9</a><p>"Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it." God's visits leave a blessing behind; this is more than can be said of every visitor. When the Lord goes on visitations of mercy, he has abundance of necessary things for all his needy creatures. He is represented here as going round the earth, as a gardener surveys his garden, and as giving water to every plant that requires it, and that not in small quantities, but until the earth is drenched and soaked with a rich supply of refreshment. O Lord, in this manner visit thy church, and my poor, parched, and withering piety. Make thy grace to overflow towards my graces; water me, for no plant of thy garden needs it more.<p>"My stock lies dead, and no increase<p>Doth my dull husbandry improve;<p>O let thy graces without cease<p>Drop from above."<p>"Thou greatly enrichest it." Millions of money could not so much enrich mankind as the showers do. The soil is made rich by the rain, and then yields its riches to man; but God is the first giver of all. How truly rich are those who are enriched with grace; this is great riches. "With the river of God, which is full of water." The brooks of earth are soon dried up, and all human resources, being finite, are liable to failure; but God's provision for the supply of rain is inexhaustible; there is no bottom or shore to his river. The deluge poured from the clouds yesterday may be succeeded by another tomorrow, and yet the waters above the firmament shall not fail. How true is this in the realm of grace; there "the river of God is full of water," and "of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace." The ancients in their fables spake of Pactolus, which flowed over sands of gold; but this river of God, which flows above and from which the rain is poured, is far more enriching; for, after all, the wealth of men lies mainly in the harvest of their fields, without which even gold would be of no value whatever. "Thou preparest them corn." Corn is specially set apart to be the food of man. In its various species it is a divine provision for the nutriment of our race, and is truly called the staff of life. We hear in commerce of "prepared corn-flour" but God prepared it long before man touched it. As surely as the manna was prepared of God for the tribes, so certainly is corn made and sent by God for our daily use. What is the difference whether we gather wheat-ears or manna, and what matters it if the first comes upward to us and the second downward? God is as much present beneath as above; it is as great a marvel that food should rise out of the dust, as that it should fall from the skies. "When thou hast so provided for it." When all is prepared to produce corn, the Lord puts the finishing stroke, and the grain is forthcoming; not even, when all the material is prepared, will the wheat be perfected without the continuous and perfecting operation of the Most High. Blessed be the Great Householder; he does not suffer the harvest to fail, he supplies the teeming myriads of earth with bread enough from year to year. Even thus does he vouchsafe heavenly food to his redeemed ones: "He hath given meat unto them that fear him; he is ever mindful of his covenant."<p><a href="/psalms/65-10.htm">Psalm 65:10</a><p>"Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof." Ridge and furrow are drenched. The ridges beaten down and settled, and the furrows made to stand like gutters flooded to the full. "Thou makest it soft with showers." The drought turned the clods into iron, but the plenteous showers dissolve and loosen the soil. "Thou blessest the springing thereof." Vegetation enlivened by the moisture leaps into rigour, the seed germinates and sends forth its green shoot, and the smell is that of a field which the Lord has blessed. All this may furnish us with a figure of the operations of the Holy Spirit in beating down high thoughts, filling our lowly desires, softening the soul, and causing every holy thing to increase and spread.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/65.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Visitest, </span> to wit, in mercy, or with thy favour, as this word is oft used. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The earth; </span> the whole earth, which is full of thy bounty.

According to some, the whole poem is essentially a harvest thanksgiving, and the poet now "comes at last to the point aimed at from the first." He traces the whole process by which the glorious termination is arrived at. First, the "early rain" descending from "the river of God," or the reservoir for rain which God guards in the heavens (<a href="/job/38-37.htm">Job 38:37</a>), moistening the furrows, softening the ridges, and preparing the land for the seed-corn. Then the sowing, which, being man's work, is but just touched on (ver. 9, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). After that, the "latter rain" - the gentle showers of March and April - which cause the grain to burst and the blade to spring, and the ear to form itself, and turn the dull fallow into a mass of greenery (vers. 10, 12). At last, the full result - pastures clothed with flocks; valleys, the "long broad sweeps between parallel ranges of hills," covered over with corn; all nature laughing and shouting for joy (ver. 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it (comp. <a href="/job/36-27.htm">Job 36:27, 28</a>; <a href="/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a>; <a href="/job/38-26.htm">Job 38:26-28</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-18.htm">Psalm 147:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>).

The lxx renders &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, but &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, tibi par est, h. e. convenit laus (Ewald), is not a usage of the language (cf. <a href="/psalms/33-1.htm">Psalm 33:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-7.htm">Jeremiah 10:7</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; signifies, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>, silence, and as an ethical notion, resignation, <a href="/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>. According to the position of the words it looks like the subject, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; like the predicate. The accents at least (Illuj, Shalsheleth) assume the relationship of the one word to the other to be that of predicate and subject; consequently it is not: To Thee belongeth resignation, praise (Hengstenberg), but: To Thee is resignation praise, i.e., resignation is (given or presented) to Thee as praise. Hitzig obtains the same meaning by an alteration of the text: &#1500;&#1498; &#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; &#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;; but opposed to this is the fact that &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1500; is not found anywhere in the Psalter, but only in the writings of the chronicler. And since it is clear that the words &#1500;&#1498; &#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; belong together (<a href="/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>), the poet had no need to fear any ambiguity when he inserted dmyh between them as that which is given to God as praise in Zion. What is intended is that submission or resignation to God which gives up its cause to God and allows Him to act on its behalf, renouncing all impatient meddling and interference (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>). The second member of the sentence affirms that this praise of pious resignation does not remain unanswered. Just as God in Zion is praised by prayer which resigns our own will silently to His, so also to Him are vows paid when He fulfils such prayer. That the answers to prayer are evidently thought of in connection with this, we see from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/65-3.htm">Psalm 65:3</a>, where God is addressed as the "Hearer or Answerer of prayer." To Him as being the Hearer and Answerer of prayer all flesh comes, and in fact, as &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; implies (cf. <a href="/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>), without finding help anywhere else, it clear a way for itself until it gets to Him; i.e., men, absolutely dependent, impotent in themselves and helpless, both collectively and individually (those only excepted who are determined to perish or despair), flee to Him as their final refuge and help. Before all else it is the prayer for the forgiveness of sin which He graciously answers. The perfect in <a href="/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a> is followed by the future in <a href="/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a>. The former, in accordance with the sense, forms a hypothetical protasis: granted that the instances of faults have been too powerful for me, i.e., (cf. <a href="/genesis/4-13.htm">Genesis 4:13</a>) an intolerable burden to me, our transgressions are expiated by Thee (who alone canst and also art willing to do it). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; is not less significant than in <a href="/psalms/35-20.htm">Psalm 35:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>, cf. <a href="/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/11-18.htm">2 Samuel 11:18</a>.: it separates the general fact into its separate instances and circumstances. How blessed therefore is the lot of that man whom (supply &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;) God chooses and brings near, i.e., removes into His vicinity, that he may inhabit His courts (future with the force of a clause expressing a purpose, as e.g., in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a>, which see), i.e., that there, where He sits enthroned and reveals Himself, he may have his true home and be as if at home (vid., <a href="/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1</a>)! The congregation gathered around Zion is esteemed worthy of this distinction among the nations of the earth; it therefore encourages itself in the blessed consciousness of this its privilege flowing from free grace (&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;), to enjoy in full draughts (&#1513;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506; with &#1489;&#1468; as in <a href="/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>) the abundant goodness or blessing (&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;) of God's house, of the holy (&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) of His temple, i.e., of His holy temple (&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>, cf. <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>). For for all that God's grace offers us we can give Him no better thanks than to hunger and thirst after it, and satisfy our poor soul therewith. </body></html>
