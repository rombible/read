That word which stills the stormy ocean, and speaks it into a calm, can silence our enemies. How contrary soever light and darkness are to each other, it is hard to say which is most welcome. Does the watchman wait for the morning? so does the labourer earnestly desire the shades of evening. Some understand it of the morning and evening sacrifices. We are to look upon daily worship, both alone and with our families, to be the most needful of our daily occupations, the most delightful of our daily comforts. How much the fruitfulness of this lower part of the creation depends upon the influence of the upper, is easy to observe; every good and perfect gift is from above. He who enriches the earth, which is filled with man's sins, by his abundant and varied bounty, can neither want power nor will to feed the souls of his people. Temporal mercies to us unworthy creatures, shadow forth more important blessings. The rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring forth of the influences of the Holy Spirit, that river of God, full of the waters of life and salvation, render the hard, barren, worthless hearts of sinners fruitful in every good work, and change the face of nations more than the sun and rain change the face of nature. Wherever the Lord passes, by his preached gospel, attended by his Holy Spirit, his paths drop fatness, and numbers are taught to rejoice in and praise him. They will descend upon the pastures of the wilderness, all the earth shall hear and embrace the gospel, and bring forth abundantly the fruits of righteousness which are, through Jesus Christ, to the glory of the Father. Manifold and marvellous, O Lord, are thy works, whether of nature or of grace; surely in loving-kindness hast thou made them all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/psalms/65.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The pastures are clothed with flocks - The flocks stand so thick together, and are spread so far, that they seem to be a clothing for the pasture; or, the fields are entirely covered with them.<p>The valleys also are covered over with corn - With grain.

What a beautiful image is this! How well does it express the loveliness of nature; how appropriately does it describe the goodness of God!

Strange that there should be an atheist in such a world as this; - strange that there should be an unhappy man; - strange that amidst such beauties, while all nature joins in rejoicing and praise - pastures, cultivated fields, valleys, hills - there can be found a human being who, instead of uniting in the language of joy, makes himself miserable by attempting to cherish the feeling that God is not good! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/65.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. wilderness&#8212;places, though not inhabited by men, fit for pasture (Le 16:21, 22; Job 24:5).<p>pastures&#8212;is literally, "folds," or "enclosures for flocks"; and in Ps 65:13 it may be "lambs," the same word used and so translated in Ps 37:20; so that "the flocks are clothed with lambs" (a figure for abundant increase) would be the form of expression.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/psalms/65.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is added as the effect of these comfortable rains, that they fill the pastures with grass for cattle, and the valleys (which he mentions as the most fruitful places, though he doth not exclude the rest) with corn for the use of man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They shout for joy, </span> they also sing, i.e. they are abundantly satisfied with thy goodness, and in their manner sing forth the praises and declare the goodness of their Creator and Benefactor.

"The sea (&#1497;&#1501; construct state, as is frequently the case, with the retention of the ) of the distant ones" is that of the regions lying afar off (cf. <a href="/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1</a>). Venema observes, Significatur, Deum esse certissimum praesidium, sive agnoscatur ab hominibus et ei fidatur, sive non (therefore similar to &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>; Psychol. S. 347; tr. p. 408). But according tot he connection and the subjective colouring the idea seems to have, &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is to be understood of the believing acknowledgment which the God of Israel attains among all mankind by reason of His judicial and redemptive self-attestation (cf. <a href="/isaiah/33-13.htm">Isaiah 33:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-22.htm">2 Chronicles 32:22</a>.). In the natural world and among men He proves Himself to be the Being girded with power to whom everything must yield. He it is who setteth fast the mountains (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>) and stilleth the raging of the ocean. In connection with the giant mountains the poet may have had even the worldly powers (vid., <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>) in his mind; in connection with the seas he gives expression to this allegorical conjunction of thoughts. The roaring of the billows and the wild tumult of the nations as a mass in the empire of the world, both are stilled by the threatening of the God of Israel (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-14</a>). When He shall overthrow the proud empire of the world, whose tyranny the earth has been made to feel far and wide, then will reverential fear of Him and exultant joy at the end of the thraldom (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4-8</a>) become universal. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514; (from the originally feminine &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;  equals  a&#774;wa&#774;jat, from &#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, to mark, <a href="/numbers/34-10.htm">Numbers 34:10</a>), &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;, is the name given here to His marvellous interpositions in the history of our earth. &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1497;, <a href="/psalms/65-6.htm">Psalm 65:6</a> (also in <a href="/isaiah/26-15.htm">Isaiah 26:15</a>), out of construction is &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;. "The exit places of the morning and of the evening" are the East and West with reference to those who dwell there. Luther erroneously understands &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497; as directly referring to the creatures which at morning and evening "sport about (webern), i.e., go safely and joyfully out and in." The meaning is, the regions whence the morning breaks forth and where the evening sets. The construction is zeugmatic so far as &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, not &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, is said of the evening sun, but only to a certain extent, for neither does one say &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; (Ewald). Perret-Gentil renders it correctly: les lieux d'o surgissent l'aube et le crepuscule. God makes both these to shout for joy, inasmuch as He commands a calm to the din of war. </body></html>
