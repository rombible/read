Jerusalem, except on the north, is encompassed with hills or mountains, so that although the city was built on hills - Zion, Moriah, Bezethah, Acra - it was itself surrounded by hills higher than any of these, and was, in a certain sense, in a valley. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>. Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1-14</a>.<p>So the Lord is round about his people ... - As Jerusalem is thus protected by the hills around, so the people of God are protected by Yahweh. He surrounds the church; he is exalted far above the church; he guards the approaches to the church; he can defend it from all its foes. Under his protection it is safe. Jerusalem, as surrounded by hills and mountains, has thus become an emblem of the church at all times; its security was an emblem of the security of all who trust in the Lord. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/psalms/125.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 125<p>Ps 125:1-5.

There was Mount Zion on the side of the north, and the mount of Olives on the east, and other mountains on the other sides of it; so that it was encompassed with them, and was naturally as well as artificially fortified. Tacitus (k) describes Jerusalem as inaccessible, walls and mountains, rocks and towers, surrounding it: and the poet Coerilus (l) makes mention of a people that spoke the Phoenician language, by whom he plainly means the Jews, '  , "that inhabited the mountains of Solyma"; which are spoken of by Homer (m), from whence, according to Tacitus (n), Jerusalem had its name: yet, as Kimchi observes, this did not hinder the enemy from taking it; wherefore the Lord is a greater security to his people; <p>so the Lord is round about his people, from henceforth even for ever; he encompasses them with his favour and lovingkindness as a shield; he encircles them in the arms of everlasting love; he guards them by his providence all around, and keeps a wakeful and watchful eye over them, that nothing hurts them: he keeps them, as in a garrison, by his almighty power: these are the walls that are around them, yea, he himself is a wall of fire about them, and the glory in the midst of them, <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>; and so he continues; he never leaves his people, nor forsakes them, but is their God and guide even unto death.

The mountains that am "round about Jerusalem" are, on the east, the Mount of Olives; on the south, the Hill of Evil Counsel; on the west, the ridge beyond the valley of Jehoshaphat; and on the north, the high ground about Scopas.

But, notwithstanding the subject that is placed first (cf. <a href="/genesis/23-13.htm">Genesis 23:13</a>), the &#1513;&#1473; belongs to the &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;; since in the Aramaizing Hebrew (cf. on the other hand <a href="/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>) &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473; (cf. Arab. lawla&#770; an) signifies nisi (prop. nisi quod), as in the Aramaic (&#1491;&#1468;) &#1513;&#1473; (&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;) &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;, o si (prop. o si quod). The &#1488;&#1494;&#1497;, peculiar to this Psalm in the Old Testament, instead of &#1488;&#1494; follows the model of the dialectic &#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;, Arab. id&#817;an, Syr. ha&#772;den (&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;, &#1492;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503;). In order to begin the apodosis of &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; (&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;) emphatically the older language makes use of the confirmatory &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-10.htm">Genesis 43:10</a>; here we have &#1488;&#1494;&#1497; (well rendered by the lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;), as in <a href="/psalms/119-92.htm">Psalm 119:92</a>.

When men (&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;) rose up against Israel and their anger was kindled against them, they who were feeble in themselves over against the hostile world would have been swallowed up alive if they had not had Jahve for them, if they had not had Him on their side. This "swallowing up alive" is said elsewhere of Hades, which suddenly and forcibly snatches away its victims, <a href="/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>; here, however, as <a href="/psalms/124-6.htm">Psalm 124:6</a> shows, it is said of the enemies, who are represented as wild beasts. In <a href="/psalms/124-4.htm">Psalm 124:4</a> the hostile power which rolls over them is likened to an overflowing stream, as in <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>., the Assyrian. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, a stream or river, is Milel; it is first of all accusative: towards the stream (<a href="/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>); then, however, it is also used as a nominative, like &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;, and the like (cf. common Greek &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;); so that  &#1514;&#1492;- is related to  &#1514;- ( &#1492;-) as  &#1504;&#1492;-,  &#1502;&#1493;- to  &#1503;- and  &#1501;- (Bttcher, 615).
