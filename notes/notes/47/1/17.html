The question meets us, however, When had the Corinthians heard of the plan thus detailed? It had been already abandoned, as we have seen, before the first Epistle was despatched. Had it been communicated in a lost letter (see Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="I wrote to you in an letter not to company with fornicators:">1Corinthians 5:9</a>)? or was this what Timotheus, who started before the first letter was written (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For this cause have I sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.">1Corinthians 4:17</a>), had been authorised to announce? Either alternative is possible, and there is no evidence to enable us to decide which is most probable.<p><span class= "bld">Do I purpose according to the flesh . . .?</span>—The construction is somewhat involved. He may mean: (1) “Do I form my purposes after the flesh” (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from worldly motives), “so as to catch the praise of consistency from those who harp on the rule that ‘Yes should be yes, and No, no’?” or (2) “Am I weak and worldly in my purpose, changing my plans, and saying <span class= "ital">‘</span>Yes’ and ‘No’ in almost the same breath?” On the whole, (2) seems to give the better sense. It is obvious that the words on which he dwells had been used of him by others. Some teacher of the party of the circumcision had, apparently, quoted the rule of the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm" title="But let your communication be, Yes, yes; No, no: for whatever is more than these comes of evil.">Matthew 5:37</a>) and of St. James (<a href="/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">James 5:12</a>), and had asked, with a sneer, when the First Epistle came and showed that the original plan had been abandoned, whether this was the way in which St. Paul acted on it? The passage has accordingly the interest of being indirectly a reference to our Lord’s teaching, showing, like <a href="/acts/20-35.htm" title="I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.">Acts 20:35</a>, that “the words of the Lord Jesus” were habitually cited as rules of life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and no no?...">2 Corinthians 1:17-20</a></span>. <span class="ital">When I therefore was thus minded </span>— Having, therefore, purposed this; <span class="ital">did I use lightness </span>— Did I lightly change my purpose? or, <span class="ital">the things that I purpose </span>in general; <span class="ital">do I purpose according to the flesh </span>— Are my purposes grounded on carnal or worldly considerations? <span class="ital">that with me there should be yea and nay </span>— Sometimes one, sometimes the other; that is, variableness and inconstancy in my counsels and actions, that none should know how to depend upon me for what they had to expect from me? <span class="ital">But as God is true </span>— I solemnly protest, that, as the God whom I serve is faithful; <span class="ital">our word to you </span>— On this and other occasions, and the doctrine we have preached to you; <span class="ital">was not yea and nay — </span>Wavering and uncertain; but that my behaviour and testimony have been always uniform, invariable, and consistent with my professions. <span class="ital">For the Son of God, who was preached by us </span>— That is, our preaching concerning him, <span class="ital">was not yea and nay </span>— Was not variable and inconsistent with itself; <span class="ital">but in him was yea </span>— As he is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, the declarations of his Word, and the engagements of his covenant, are inviolably the same. <span class="ital">For all the promises of God </span>— Many and precious as they are; <span class="ital">in him are</span> <span class="ital">yea and amen </span>— Are made with truth, and fulfilled with fidelity; or are surely established and accomplished in and through him.

Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When I therefore was thus minded - When I formed this purpose; when I willed this, and expressed this intention.<p>Did I use lightness? - The word &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  elaphria (from &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  elaphros) means properly lightness in weight. Here it is used in reference to the mind; and in a sense similar to our word levity, as denoting lightness of temper or conduct; inconstancy, changeableness, or fickleness. This charge had been probably made that he had made the promise without any due consideration, or without any real purpose of performing, it; or that he had made it in a trifling and thoughtless manner. By the interrogative form here, he sharply denies that it was a purpose formed in a light and trifling manner.<p>Do I purpose according to the flesh - In such a manner, as may suit my own convenience and carnal interest. Do I form plans adapted only to promote my own ease and gratification, and to be abandoned when they are attended with inconvenience? The phrase "according to the flesh" here seems to mean "in such a way as to promote my own ease and gratification; in a manner such as the people of the world form; such as would be formed under the influence of earthly passions and desires, and to be forsaken when those plans would interfere with such gratifications." Paul denies in a positive manner that he formed such plans; and they should have known enough of his manner of life to be assured that that was not the nature of the schemes which he had devised? Probably no man ever lived who formed his plans of life less for the gratification of the flesh than Paul.<p>That with me there should be yea, yea, and nay, nay? - There has been a great variety in the interpretation of this passage; see Bloomfield, Critical Digest in loco. The meaning seems to be, "that there should be such inconstancy and uncertainty in my counsels and actions, that no one could depend on me, or know what they had to expect from me." Bloomfield supposes that the phrase is a proverbial one, and denotes a headstrong, self-willed spirit which will either do things, or not do them as pleases, without giving any reasons. He supposes that the repetition of the words "yea and nay" is designed to denote positiveness of assertion - such positiveness as is commonly shown by such persons, as in the phrases, "what I have written I have written," "what I have done I have done." It seems more probable, however, that the phrase is designed to denote the ready compliance which an inconstant and unsettled man is accustomed to make with the wishes of others; his expressing a ready assent to what they propose; falling in with their views; readily making promises; and instantly, through some whim, or caprice, or wish of others, saying "yea, nay," to the same thing; that is, changing his mind, and altering his purpose without any good reason, or in accordance with any fixed principle or settled rule of action. Paul says that this was not his character. He did not affirm a thing at one time and deny it at another; he did not promise to do a thing one moment and refuse to do it the next. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. use lightness&#8212;Was I guilty of levity? namely, by promising more than I performed.<p>or &#8230; according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea, yea &#8230; nay, nay?&#8212;The "or" expresses a different alternative: Did I act with levity, or (on the other hand) do I purpose what I purpose like worldly (fleshly) men, so that my "yea" must at all costs be yea, and my "nay" nay [Bengel, Winer, Calvin], (Mt 14:7, 9)? The repetition of the "yea" and "nay" hardly agrees with Alford's view, "What I purpose do I purpose according to the changeable purposes of the fleshly (worldly) man, that there may be with me the yea yea, and the nay nay (that is, both affirmation and negation concerning the same thing)?" The repetition will thus stand for the single yea and nay, as in Mt 5:37; Jas 5:12. But the latter passage implies that the double "yea" here is not equivalent to the single "yea": Bengel's view, therefore, seems preferable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness?</span> Though the apostle doth not in so many words tell us so, yet it is apparent from this verse, that some of the Corinthians had taken occasion from his not coming at this time to Corinth, to charge him with levity and inconstancy, as if his words were not to be regarded. It is very observable, how little things the men of the world will take advantage from, to vilify and lessen the reputation of God’s faithful ministers and people. How many others might have promised to be in such a place at such a time, and have failed, without the reproach of the men of the world! Who would have been so charitable to them, as to have excused them, by saying: They spake according to their present intentions and resolutions, but they were hindered by the providence of God; but if Paul fails, they will interpret it to be from the lightness and inconstancy of his mind: so charitable is the world to its own; so uncharitable to those who are not of the world, but by God called out of the world. From this imputation the apostle cleareth himself, denying that he used <span class="ital">lightness, </span> and that his not coming proceeded from any levity or inconstancy of mind; for he did fully purpose to have come. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh?</span> Or (saith he) did I purpose after the manner of carnal men, who make no conscience of their word, who promise and deny both in a breath? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay; </span> should there be in me such a spirit as to speak a thing with my lips which my heart doth not agree to?

Billroth errs in thinking that in this explanation <span class="greekheb">καί</span> must be taken as <span class="ital">also</span>. That it means <span class="ital">and</span>, is proved by <a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="But as God is true, our word toward you was not yes and no....">2 Corinthians 1:18-19</a>. The <span class="ital">duplication</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ναί</span> and <span class="greekheb">οὔ</span> strengthens the picture of the untrustworthy man who affirms just as fervently as he afterwards denies. Failing to discern this, Grotius and Estius wished to prefer the reading of the Vulgate, <span class="greekheb">τὸ ναὶ καὶ τὸ οὔ</span>, which has very weak attestation. The article marks the <span class="greekheb">ναὶ ναί</span> and the <span class="greekheb">οὒ οὔ</span> as well-known and solemn formulae of affirmative and negative asseveration (as they were also in <span class="ital">Jewish</span> usage; see Wetstein, <span class="ital">ad</span> <span class="ital"><a href="/matthew/5-37.htm" title="But let your communication be, Yes, yes; No, no: for whatever is more than these comes of evil.">Matthew 5:37</a></span>). Comp. on <span class="greekheb">ναὶ ναί</span>, Soph. <span class="ital">O. C.</span> 1743. As to the main point, namely, that the <span class="greekheb">ναὶ ναί</span> and the <span class="greekheb">οὒ οὔ</span> are taken as the subject of <span class="greekheb">ᾖ</span>, this explanation has the support of Erasmus, Beza, Calvin, Estius (though conjecturing <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μή</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>), Cornelius a Lapide, Grotius, Mill, Wolf, and others; also of Rosenmüller, Emmerling, Flatt, Schrader, Rückert, de Wette, Osiander, Neander, Maier, and others; even Olshausen, who, however, sets up for <span class="greekheb">ναί</span> and <span class="greekheb">οὔ</span> the “peculiar” signification (assumed without any instance of its being so used) of “truth” and “falsehood.” The <span class="ital">diplasiasmus</span> <span class="greekheb">ναὶ ναί</span> and <span class="greekheb">οὒ οὔ</span> is not without reason (as Billroth and Hofmann object), but quite accords with the passionate excitement of the moral consciousness; whereas afterwards, in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="But as God is true, our word toward you was not yes and no.">2 Corinthians 1:18</a>, where his words go on quietly with a glance towards the faithful God, the bare <span class="greekheb">ναὶ καὶ οὔ</span> is quite in its place. Note, further, that the simple expression of the <span class="ital">coexistence of the yea and nay</span> (to which Hofmann objects) is more <span class="ital">striking</span>, than if Paul had given a more precise explanation of the maxims of yea and nay. The readers knew him, and even his evil-wishers could not but know that he was no yea-and-nay man. Others consider the second <span class="greekheb">ναί</span> and the second <span class="greekheb">οὔ</span> as predicates, so that a wholly opposite sense is made out of the words: <span class="ital">in order that with me the Yea may be yea, and the Nay be nay, i.e.</span> in order that I may stubbornly carry through what I have proposed to myself. Comp. <a href="/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">Jam 5:12</a>. So Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Oecumenius, Erasmus, Castalio, Bengel, and others, and recently Billroth; Winer, p. 429 [E. T. 481], gives no decision. The context, however, before (“levitatis et inconstantiae, non autem pertinaciae crimen hic a se depellere studet,” Estius) and after (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="But as God is true, our word toward you was not yes and no....">2 Corinthians 1:18-19</a>), is decisive against this view. Hofmann imports into <span class="greekheb">παρʼ ἐμοί</span> a contrast to <span class="greekheb">παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ</span>, so that the idea would be: to assent to or refuse anything <span class="ital">on grounds taken from one’s own self</span>, without reservation, because purely as an <span class="ital">expression of self-will</span>, with which <a href="/james/4-13.htm" title="Go to now, you that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:">Jam 4:13</a> is compared.[132] Such a contrast could not but be based upon what went before, in itself as well as in the sense assumed. Besides, to this pretended emphasis on <span class="greekheb">παρʼ ἐμοί</span> the order <span class="greekheb">ἵνα παρʼ ἐμοὶ ᾖ</span> would have been suitable; and the idea of speaking no absolute yea or nay, would have demanded not <span class="greekheb">καί</span> but <span class="greekheb">ἤ</span> between the <span class="greekheb">ναί</span> and the <span class="greekheb">οὔ</span>. And was Paul, then, the man in whose resolves “the yea is always meant with the reservation of a nay”? Luther’s translation (comp. Ambrosiaster and Erasmus) comes back to the result, that the mark of interrogation is placed after <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σ</span>. <span class="greekheb">βουλ</span>., and in that case there is supplied <span class="ital">nequaquam</span>, of which negation <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. specifies the purpose. This is intolerably arbitrary.

The reproach of fickleness was cast upon the Apostle for his change of purpose. It is to be remarked that <span class="ital">this</span> is the only charge he is attempting to meet in this and the next six verses. One of the special features of this Epistle, according to Robertson, is its exhibition of “the way in which a Christian may defend himself when maligned or misrepresented … An uncontradicted slander is believed readily, and often for long, and meanwhile influence is crippled or lost. Conceive what might have ensued, had St Paul not met the slander against his character with denial at once! For few persons take the trouble to sift a charge which is not denied.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to the flesh</span>] i.e. ‘Are they the decisions of my human will, which is subject to change through caprice, or are they decisions made according to the promptings of God’s Spirit, and, as such, removed out of the region of human inconstancy of purpose?’ Cf. <a href="/acts/19-21.htm" title="After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.">Acts 19:21</a>.

But the context is against this. Chrysostom, who adopts this view, lays the stress upon the words ‘with me,’ as though St Paul’s private and individual will were contrasted with the dictates of the Spirit, which he was bound to follow, whether they laid him open to the charge of inconsistency or not. But the best way is (2) <span class="bld">to</span> interpret the passage in the usual manner, and to regard the Apostle as denying that he was infirm of purpose, and as reminding the Corinthians that he had but one definite end in view which he was resolutely bent upon attaining, namely, the ministering to them the Spirit of Jesus Christ To this one purpose all minor plans and resolutions must give way. See last note on <span class="ital"><a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2 Corinthians 1:19</a></span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and no no?">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τῇ ἐλαφρίᾳ</span>, <span class="ital">lightness</span>) by promising more than I performed.—<span class="greekheb">ἢ</span>) <span class="ital">or?</span> [<span class="ital">an?</span> the second part of a disjunctive interrogation].—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span>, <span class="ital">according to the flesh</span>) Paul gives them to understand that, if he were to consult according to [to listen to the suggestions of] the flesh, he must rather have come, than not; for they who consult according to the flesh, endeavour by all means to make the <span class="ital">yea</span> of the promise, whatever may occur, to appear in the fulfilment, for the purpose of maintaining their consistency [<span class="ital">whether good or evil may result</span> from it.—V. g.] But the Apostle was neither inconsistent, nor carnally consistent: either of which might have been suspected by persons under the influence of prejudice against him. He had made a conditional promise, and afterwards he delayed his visit for an important reason, which had occurred to prevent it.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ναὶ καὶ τὸ οὐ</span>) See Appendix. Crit. Ed. ii. on this passage. Simple <span class="ital">yea and nay</span>[6] is quite approved of by Paul in the following verse, in which he denies the <span class="ital">yea and nay</span>, concerning the same things; but he affirms it, <a href="/2_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and no no?">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>, concerning different things. The word <span class="greekheb">ᾖ</span>, <span class="ital">should be</span>, is emphatic; as it may be said, for example, of an unsteady [inconsistent] person. <span class="ital">You can never be sure of finding either his</span> “It is,” <span class="ital">or his</span> “it is not,” <span class="ital">to be as he says</span>—that is, no one can trust his word; or as if it were to be said of a consistent man, <span class="ital">His</span> “It is,” <span class="ital">and his</span> “It is not,” always hold good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[6] Although this reading is declared to be not quite so good in the margin of 2d Ed., yet, with the previous concurrence of the Gnomon, it is introduced into the Germ.

The Corinthians were aware that he no longer meant to come to them direct from Ephesus. They had certainly been informed of this by Titus, and he had indeed briefly stated it in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>. Their disappointment had led some of them into angry criticisms upon the "indecision" of the apostle, the more so because he had (out of kindness, as he here shows) spared them the pain of expressing his <span class="accented">reasons</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Did I use lightness?</span> Was this change of plan a sign of "the levity" with which some of you charge me? <span class="cmt_word">Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh,</span> etc.? Every phrase in this clause is of ambiguous meaning. For instance, the "or" may imply <span class="accented">another</span> charge, namely, that his purposes are <span class="accented">carnal</span>, and therefore capricious; or it may be the alternative view of his conduct, stated by way of self-defence - namely, "Does my change of plan imply that I am frivolous? or, on the contrary, are not my plans of necessity mere <span class="accented">human</span> plans, and therefore liable to be overruled by God's will?" Thus the meaning of the "or" is doubtful, and also the meaning of" <span class="accented">according to the flesh</span>." Generally this phrase is used in a bad sense, as in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-2.htm">2 Corinthians 10:2</a> and <a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; but it may also be used to mean "in a human way," as in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-16.htm">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay.</span> There is probably no clause in the New Testament of which the certain sense must be left so indeterminate as this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Authorized Version gives one way of taking the clause. The grammar equally admits of the rendering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">That with me the yea should be yea, and the nay nay</span>. Whichever rendering we adept, it may be explained in accordance with the view indicated in the last note. "I was not showing the levity which my opponents speak of, but my purposes are necessarily mere human purposes, and therefore my 'yes' and 'no' can be only 'yes' and 'no' when I make a plan. My 'yes' or 'no' may be overruled by the Spirit (<a href="/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a>) or even hindered by Satan, and that more than once (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>)." "With me," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as far as I am concerned, I can only say "yes" or" no;" but <span class="accented">l'homme propose, Dieu dispose</span>. His intended double visit to them was prevented, not by any frivolity of his, but, as he afterwards shows, by their own unfaithfulness and his desire to spare them. There is yet a third way of taking it which involves a different meaning - "In order that with me the 'yea yea ' may be also ' nay nay,'" Am I inconsistent? or, are my purposes merely carnal purposes, in order that my "yes yes" may be, as far as I am concerned, no better than "no no" - like the mere shifting feebleness of an aimless man? A fourth way of taking the clause, adopted by St. Chrysostom and many others, is, "Do I plan after the flesh, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with carnal obstinacy, so that my ' yea' and 'nay' must be carried out at all costs?' This suggestion can hardly be right; for St. Paul was charged, not with obstinacy, but with indecision. The phrases, "yea" and "nay," as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a> and <a href="/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>, throw no light on the passage, unless indeed some one had misquoted against St. Paul our Lord's words as a reason for adhering inviolably to a plan once formed. Of these various methods I adopt the first, because it seems to be, on the whole, most in accordance with the context. For on that view of the passage he contents himself with the remark that it cannot be inconsistency or levity on his part to alter plans which are liable to all the chance and change of ordinary circumstances; and then tells them that there was one part of his teaching which has nothing to do with mere human weakness, but was God's everlasting , "yes;" after which he explains to them the reason why he decided not to come to them until he had first visited Macedonia, and so to give them one visit, not two. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Did I use lightness (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., shew fickleness. &#x395;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, lightness, only here in the New Testament.
