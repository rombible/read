The Lord is able to give peace to the troubled conscience, and to calm the raging passions of the soul. These blessings are given by him, as the Father of his redeemed family. It is our Saviour who says, Let not your heart be troubled. All comforts come from God, and our sweetest comforts are in him. He speaks peace to souls by granting the free remission of sins; and he comforts them by the enlivening influences of the Holy Spirit, and by the rich mercies of his grace. He is able to bind up the broken-hearted, to heal the most painful wounds, and also to give hope and joy under the heaviest sorrows. The favours God bestows on us, are not only to make us cheerful, but also that we may be useful to others. He sends comforts enough to support such as simply trust in and serve him. If we should be brought so low as to despair even of life, yet we may then trust God, who can bring back even from death. Their hope and trust were not in vain; nor shall any be ashamed who trust in the Lord. Past experiences encourage faith and hope, and lay us under obligation to trust in God for time to come. And it is our duty, not only to help one another with prayer, but in praise and thanksgiving, and thereby to make suitable returns for benefits received. Thus both trials and mercies will end in good to ourselves and others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who delivered us from so great a death - From a death so terrible, and from a prospect so alarming. It is intimated here by the word which Paul uses, that the death which he apprehended was one of a character especially terrific - probably a death by wild beasts; note, <a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>. He was near to death; he had no hope of rescue; and the manner of the death which was threatened was especially frightful. Paul regarded rescue from such a death as a kind of resurrection: and felt that he owed his life to God as if he had raised him from the dead. All deliverance from imminent peril, and from dangerous sickness, whether of ourselves or our friends, should be regarded as a kind of resurrection from the dead. God could with infinite ease have taken away our breath, and it is only by his merciful interposition that we live.<p>And doth deliver - Continues yet to deliver us; or preserve us - intimating perhaps that danger had continued to follow him after the signal deliverance to which he particularly refers, and that he had continued to be in similar peril of his life. Paul was daily exposed to danger; and was constantly preserved by the good providence of God. In what manner he was rescued from the peril to which he was exposed he has no where intimated. It is implied, however, that it was by a remarkable divine interposition; but whether by miracle, or by the ordinary course of providence, he no where intimates. Whatever was the mode, however, Paul regarded God as the source of the deliverance, and felt that his obligations were due to him as his kind Preserver.<p>In whom we trust that he will yet deliver us - That he will continue to preserve us. We hope; we are accustomed to cherish the expectation that he will continue to defend us in the perils which we shall yet encounter. Paul felt that he was still exposed to danger. Everywhere he was liable to be persecuted (compare note, <a href="/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>), and everywhere he felt that his life was in peril. Yet he had been thus far preserved in a most remarkable manner; and he felt assured that God would continue to interpose in his behalf, until his great purpose in regard to him should be fully accomplished, so that at the close of life he could look to God as his Deliverer, and feel that all along his perilous journey he had been his great Protector. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. doth deliver&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "will deliver," namely, as regards immediately imminent dangers. "In whom we trust that He will also (so the Greek) yet deliver us," refers to the continuance of God's delivering help hereafter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">So great a death, </span> in this text, signifies no more than so great a trial of affliction; as he elsewhere saith, he was <span class="ital">in deaths often, </span> that is, in dangers of death.

Accordingly, being enabled to trust in God, when all human hope and helps failed, to believe in hope against hope, then the Lord appeared for them, and delivered them from this heavy affliction; which, because by reason of it they were not only in danger of death, and threatened with, but were even under the sentence of it, is therefore called a death, and so great an one, see <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23</a>. The apostle expresses the continuance of the mercy, <p>and doth deliver; which shows that they were still exposed to deaths and dangers, but were wonderfully preserved by the power of God, which gave great encouragement to them to hope and believe that God would still preserve them for further usefulness. The Alexandrian copy leaves out this clause, and so does the Syriac version. <p>In whom we trust that he will yet deliver us; all the three tenses, past, present, and future, are mentioned, which shows that an abiding sense of past and present deliverances serves greatly to animate faith in expectation of future ones. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who delivered us from so <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver <i>us</i>;</span><p>(g) From these great dangers.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;">2 Corinthians 1:10</a>.

But could no machinations pass over from Asia to Macedonia? and could not these be recognised by Paul as the more dangerous, in so far as they were more secret? Comp. <a href="/acts/20-3.htm" title="And there stayed three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.">Acts 20:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[125] Hofmann reads the passage: <span class="greekheb">καὶ ῥύσεται</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὃν ἠλπίκαμεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔτι ῥύσεται</span>. Accordingly, he takes the first <span class="greekheb">καί</span> as an <span class="ital">also</span>, beginning an independent sentence. With this expressive reference to the future Paul looks forward to the wide <span class="ital">voyages</span> still before him. In opposition to this we have, from a critical point of view, the facts that <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> before <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔτι</span> is wanting only in B D* 64, and that it is supported by preponderating witnesses, even by those which have the reading <span class="greekheb">ῥύσεται</span> for <span class="greekheb">ῥύεται</span>, as C and א; and, from an exegetical point of view, the fact that the repetition <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔτι ῥύσεται</span> amounts to a tautology without strengthening the thought in the least: for <span class="greekheb">ἔτι</span> follows as a matter of course from the <span class="greekheb">ῥύσεται</span> already said. Besides, against the whole reference to the shipwreck, see on ver. 8.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_corinthians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;">2 Corinthians 1:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὅς ἐκ τηλικ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver</span> (reading <span class="greekheb">ῥύσεται</span>).
