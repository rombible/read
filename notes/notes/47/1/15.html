It was because he trusted that they would judge him rightly that he had done that which had led some to judge him wrongly. His plan had been at first to go straight by sea from Ephesus to Corinth, then to pass on to Macedonia, thence to return to Corinth, and thence set sail for Jerusalem. When he wrote <a href="/context/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.">1Corinthians 16:5-6</a>, he had already modified his plan by deciding to go to Macedonia first. His original scheme had shown his wish to see as much of the Corinthians as possible. They were to have two visits (“a second <span class= "ital">favour”</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and not one only. Had he shown less regard, he asks, in the change with which he had been taunted?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;...">2 Corinthians 1:15-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">And in this confidence </span>— That is, being confident of this, namely, of our mutual affection to, and esteem for, each other; <span class="ital">I was minded — </span><span class="greekheb">Εβουλομην</span>, <span class="ital">I purposed; to come unto you before </span>— Or <span class="ital">first, </span>as <span class="greekheb">προτερον </span>seems here to signify. “As soon as the apostle was informed, by some of the family of Chloe, that dissensions had arisen among the Corinthian brethren, he determined to go to Corinth <span class="ital">first; </span>that is, before he went into Macedonia. His intention was to go straightway to Corinth by sea, because he wished to be there soon, in the expectation that his presence among the Corinthians would put an end to their divisions, either in the way of persuasion or of punishment. Wherefore, to prepare the Corinthians for his coming, he notified his resolution to them by Timothy and Erastus; but after their departure, having great success in preaching, and the messengers from Corinth arriving with a letter from the sincere part of the church, the apostle judged it prudent to delay his visit to Corinth, to give them who had sinned time to repent. And therefore, instead of going straightway to Corinth, by sea, he resolved to go by the way of Macedonia. This alteration of his purpose he signified to the Corinthians in his first epistle, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia....">1 Corinthians 16:5-7</a>.” <span class="ital">That you might have a second benefit </span>— So our translators have rendered <span class="greekheb">δευτεραν χαριν</span>; that is, a further confirmation and edification in gifts and graces, wherewith ye were enriched by my first coming to you. <span class="ital">And to pass by you into Macedonia </span>— To make you a short visit in my way thither; <span class="ital">and </span>then, having despatched my business in the churches there, <span class="ital">to come again to you </span>from <span class="ital">Macedonia, </span>and make a longer stay; <span class="ital">and of you to be brought </span>(sent) forward <span class="ital">toward Judea </span>— When I shall go thither to deliver the money raised by the contribution of the Gentile Christians, for the relief of their distressed Jewish brethren.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 The apostle clears himself from the charge of levity and inconstancy, in not coming to Corinth. Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And in his confidence - In this confidence of my integrity, and that you had this favorable opinion of me, and appreciated the principles of my conduct. I did not doubt that you would receive me kindly, and would give me again the tokens of your affection and regard. In this Paul shows that however some of them might regard him, yet that he had no doubt that the majority of the church there would receive him kindly.<p>I was minded - I willed (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;  eboulome&#772;n); it was my intention.<p>To come unto you before - Tyndale renders this: "the other time." Paul refers doubtless to the time when he wrote his former Epistle, and when it was his serious purpose, as it was his earnest wish, to visit them again; see <a href="/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>. In this purpose he had been disappointed, and he now proceeds to state the reasons why he had not visited them as he had purposed, and to show that it did not arise from any fickleness of mind. His purpose had been at first to pass through Corinth on his way to Macedonia, and to remain some time with them; see <a href="/2_corinthians/1-16.htm">2 Corinthians 1:16</a>. compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5-6</a>. This purpose he had now changed; and instead of passing through Corinth on his way to Macedonia, he had gone to Macedonia by the way of Troas <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; and the Corinthians having, as it would seem, become acquainted with this fact, had charged him with insincerity in the promise, or fickleness in regard to his plans. Probably it had been said by some of his enemies that he had never intended to visit them.<p>That ye might have a second benefit - Margin, grace. The word used here &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  charis is that which is commonly rendered grace, and means probably favor, kindness, good-will, beneficence; and especially favor to the undeserving. Here it is evidently used in the sense of gratification, or pleasure. And the idea is, that they had been formerly gratified and benefitted by his residence among them; he had been the means of conferring important favors on them, and he was desirous of being again with them, in order to gratify them by his presence, and that he might be the means of imparting to them other favors. Paul presumed that his presence with them would be to them a source of pleasure, and that his coming would do them good. It is the language of a man who felt assured that he enjoyed, after all, the confidence of the mass of the church there, and that they would regard his being with them as a favor. He had been with them formerly almost two years. His residence there had been pleasant to them and to him; and had been the occasion of important benefits to them. He did not doubt that it would be so again. Tyndale renders this: "that ye might have had a double pleasure." It may be remarked here that several mss. instead of &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  charin, "grace," read &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;  charan, "joy." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. in this confidence&#8212;of my character for sincerity being "acknowledged" by you (2Co 1:12-14).<p>was minded&#8212;I was intending.<p>before&#8212;"to come unto you before" visiting Macedonia (where he now was). Compare Note, see on [2302]1Co 16:5; also see on [2303]1Co 4:18, which, combined with the words here, implies that the insinuation of some at Corinth, that he would not come at all, rested on the fact of his having thus disappointed them. His change of intention, and ultimate resolution of going through Macedonia first, took place before his sending Timothy from Ephesus into Macedonia, and therefore (1Co 4:17) before his writing the first Epistle. Compare Ac 19:21, 22 (the order there is "Macedonia and Achaia," not Achaia, Macedonia); Ac 20:1, 2.<p>that ye might have a second benefit&#8212;one in going to, the other in returning from, Macedonia.

But before or during the composition of our first Epistle he altered this plan (as we know from <a href="/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>) to this extent, that he was not now to go first to Corinth, then to Macedonia, and from thence back to Corinth again (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-16.htm" title="And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia to you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.">2 Corinthians 1:16</a>), but through Macedonia to Corinth. The plan of travel, <a href="/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>, was accordingly not the first (Baur; comp. Lange, <span class="ital">apost. Zeitalt.</span> I. p. 200 f.), but the one already altered, which alteration was ascribed to the apostle as indecision. This is intelligible enough from the antagonistic irritation of their minds, and does not require us to presuppose an expression in the alleged intermediate Epistle (Klöpper, p. 21 f.). Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Oecumenius make the apostle say: I had, when I wrote to you <a href="/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>, the unexpressed intention to arrive still earlier than I promised, and to reach you even sooner (immediately on the journey towards Macedonia). Quite a mistaken view, since such a mere thought would not have been known to his opponents, and no excuse for his fickleness could therefore have been engrafted on i.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πρότερον</span>] belongs to <span class="greekheb">πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐλθεῖν</span>:[130] I intended to come to you <span class="ital">first of all</span>,—not, as I afterwards altered my plan, to the Macedonians first, and then from them to you. Beza, Grotius, Bengel, and others, including Rosenmüller and Rückert, connect <span class="greekheb">πρότ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ἐβουλ</span>., which, however, on the one hand is opposed to the sense (for Paul cannot say, “I intended formerly to come to you,” since his intention is still the same), and on the other would not accord with <span class="greekheb">ἵνα δευτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χάρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔχ</span>.; for not the <span class="greekheb">προτερον ἐβουλόμην</span>, but the <span class="greekheb">πρότερον πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐλθεῖν</span>, was to bring in its train a <span class="greekheb">δευτέρα χάρις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα δευτέραν χάριν ἔχητε</span>] <span class="greekheb">δευτέραυ</span> corresponds ingeniously to the <span class="greekheb">πρότερον</span>: <span class="ital">in order that you might have a second benefit of grace</span>. By <span class="greekheb">χάριν</span> is meant a <span class="ital">divine bestowal of grace</span>, with which Paul knew his coming to be connected for the church; for to whatever place he came in his official capacity, he came as the imparter of divine <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>, <a href="/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a>; comp. <a href="/romans/15-29.htm" title="And I am sure that, when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:29</a>. Chrysostom, Oecumenius, and others, including Kypke, Emmerling, Flatt, and Bleek (in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1830, p. 622), hold that <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> is equivalent to <span class="greekheb">χάρα</span> (and hence this is actually the reading of B L, some min., and Theodoret). Certainly <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> also means <span class="ital">pleasure, joy</span>, and is, as in <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/7-16.htm" title="After Raguel called his wife Edna, and said unto her, Sister, prepare another chamber, and bring her in thither.">Tob 7:16</a>, the opposite of <span class="greekheb">λύπη</span> (Eur. <span class="ital">Hel.</span> 661, and more frequently in Pindar; see Duncan, <span class="ital">Lex.</span>, ed. Rost, p. 1191; also in Plato, Ast, <span class="ital">Lex.</span> III. p. 538), but never in the N. T. This sense, besides, would be unsuitable to the apostle’s delicate and modest style of expression elsewhere. Nor, again, is a <span class="ital">benefit on the part of the apostle</span> meant (Grotius, Rosenmüller, Schrader, Billroth, comp. also Hofmann), because the expression is only in keeping with his affection and humility (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm" title="But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>) if a <span class="ital">divine</span> display of grace is meant. The comparison with <a href="/1_corinthians/16-3.htm" title="And when I come, whomsoever you shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality to Jerusalem.">1 Corinthians 16:3</a> is therefore not to the point, because there a <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> is named, of which the <span class="ital">readers</span> were givers. But what does he mean by <span class="greekheb">δευτέραν χάριν</span>? Many answer with Estius: “ut ex secundo meo adventu secundam acciperetis gratiam, qui dudum accepistis primam, quando primum istuc veniens ad fidem vos converti.” Comp. Pelagius, Calvin, Wolf, Mosheim, Bengel, Emmerling. But against this it may be urged: (1) historically, that Paul certainly had been already twice in Corinth before our two Epistles (see Introd. § 2); and (2) from the connection, that the <span class="greekheb">δευτέρα χάρις</span> in this sense can by no means appear as an aim conditioned by the <span class="greekheb">πρότερον</span>; for even a <span class="ital">later</span> coming would have had a <span class="greekheb">δευτέρα χάρις</span> in <span class="ital">this</span> sense as its result. This second reason is decisive, even if, with Schott, <span class="ital">Erörterung</span>, etc., p. 58 ff., and Anger, <span class="ital">rat. temp.</span> p. 72 f., we were to set aside the former by the supposition: “apostolum intra annum illum cum dimidio, quem, quum primum Corinthi esset, ibi transegit, per breve aliquod temporis spatium in regiones vicinas discessisse; sic enim si res se habuit, Paulus, etsi <span class="ital">bis</span> ad Corinthios venerat, ita ut in secunda, quam iis misit, epistola adventum <span class="ital">tertium</span> polliceri posset: tamen, quoniam per totum illud intervallum Corinthi potissimum docuerat, simile beneficium, quod in itinere seriore in eos collocaturus erat, jure <span class="ital">secundum</span> appellavit,” Anger, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 73. The right solution results from <a href="/2_corinthians/1-16.htm" title="And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia to you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.">2 Corinthians 1:16</a>, which is appended by the epexegetical <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, viz., that the <span class="greekheb">δευτέρα χάρις</span> appears as setting in through the <span class="greekheb">πάλιν ἀπὸ Μακεδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐλθεῖν πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span>. Paul had intended on his projected journey to visit Corinth <span class="ital">twice</span>, and had therefore proposed to himself to come to the Corinthians <span class="ital">first of all</span> (not first to the Macedonians), in order that they in this event might have a <span class="ital">second</span> <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> on his return from Macedonia (the first <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> they were to have on his journey thither). From this it is at once obvious: (1) how superfluous is the linguistically incorrect supposition that <span class="greekheb">δευτέραν</span> is here equivalent to <span class="greekheb">διπλῆν</span>, as Bleek and Neander, following Chrysostom and Theodoret,[131] take it; (2) how erroneous is the opinion of Rückert, that <span class="greekheb">ἵνα δευτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χάριν ἔχητε</span> is put in a wrong place, and should properly only come behind <span class="greekheb">ἐλθεῖν πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/1-16.htm" title="And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia to you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.">2 Corinthians 1:16</a>. No; according to the epexegetical ͅ<span class="greekheb">καί</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/1-16.htm" title="And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia to you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.">2 Corinthians 1:16</a>, <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὑμῶν ἀπελθεῖν εἰς Μακεδ</span>. serves to give exact and clear information as parallel to the <span class="greekheb">πρότερον πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐλθεῖν</span>, and then <span class="greekheb">καὶ πάλιν ἀπὸ Μακ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐλθεῖν πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span> as parallel to the <span class="greekheb">ἵνα δευτέρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χάριν ἔχητε</span>. Comp. Baur, I. p. 338, ed. 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[130] The position of <span class="greekheb">πρότερον</span>, immediately after <span class="greekheb">ἐβουλ</span>. (Lachmann, Tischendorf, Rückert), which has preponderating evidence, and is therefore to be preferred, makes no difference in this respect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[131] In other respects Theodoret, Bleek, and Neander, as also Billroth, Olshausen, and Rückert, agree in thinking that <span class="greekheb">δευτέραν</span> refers to the repeated visit to Corinth which had been intended after returning from Macedonia. But Chrys., quite against the context, explains the double joy as <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὴν διὰ τῶν γραμμάτων καὶ τὴν διὰ τῆς παρουσίας</span>. So also Erasmus, Vatablus, and others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_corinthians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;...">2 Corinthians 1:15-22</a>.

The circumstances seem to have been as follows. While St. Paul was at Ephesus (Acts 19) his intention had been to cross the Ægean to Corinth, thence to visit Macedonia, and then to come back to Corinth on his way to Judæa with the contributions which he had gathered (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/1_corinthians/16-3.htm" title="And when I come, whomsoever you shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality to Jerusalem....">1 Corinthians 16:3-4</a>). The Corinthians would thus have enjoyed a “second benefit” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="/romans/15-29.htm" title="And I am sure that, when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:29</a>), inasmuch as he would have visited them both on his way to Macedonia, and on his return journey. This project he had communicated to them, probably in the letter which is lost (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="I wrote to you in an letter not to company with fornicators:">1 Corinthians 5:9</a>). But he received bad news from Corinth (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="For it has been declared to me of you, my brothers, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.">1 Corinthians 1:11</a>), and he wrote 1 <span class="ital">Cor.</span> in reply. In this letter (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>) he incidentally mentioned that he had changed his plans, and that he now proposed to travel from Ephesus to Corinth <span class="ital">viâ</span> Macedonia, the route which he adopted in the sequel (<a href="/acts/20-1.htm" title="And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.">Acts 20:1</a> ff., chap. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fights, within were fears.">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>). When the Corinthians heard of this, they began to reproach him with fickleness of purpose (chap. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and no no?">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>), and the charge came to his ears. We have his defence in the verses (15–22) before us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>15–24. St Paul’s reason for putting off his coming<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>15. <span class="ital">And in this confidence</span>] It was the conviction of this community of interest which made St Paul desire to visit Corinth. It was (see <span class="ital"><a href="/2_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.">2 Corinthians 1:23</a></span>) the consciousness that all his converts did not realize it which made him anxious to try the effect of a letter first. See ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-3.htm" title="And I wrote this same to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.">2 Corinthians 2:3</a>, <a href="/context/2_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same letter has made you sorry, though it were but for a season....">2 Corinthians 7:8-12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I was minded to come unto you before</span>] i.e. before going to Macedonia.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that you might have a second benefit</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">grace</span>. These words would be more intelligible had they been placed at the end of the next verse. By the ‘second benefit’ is meant the effects of the visit which the Apostle hoped to have paid to the Corinthians after his return from Macedonia. It has been explained, (1) of the favour of the Apostle’s presence, (2) of the outpouring of God’s grace or favour which St Paul, as an Apostle of Christ, had the privilege of imparting.

When speaking of matters purely personal, St. Paul generally reverts to the first person. <span class="cmt_word">To come unto you before.</span> I meant to visit you, first on my way to Macedonia, and again on my return from Macedonia, as explained in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">A second benefit;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a second grace</span>.

Here, again, there is no boastfulness. St. Paul, filled as he was with the power of the Holy Spirit, was able to impart to his converts some spiritual gifts (<a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>), and this was the chief reason why his visits were so eagerly desired, and why his change of plan had caused such bitter disappointment to the Corinthians. The importance of the Church of Corinth, its central position, and its unsettled state made it desirable that he should give them as much as possible of his personal supervision. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Before (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Rather, first of all.
