(Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.">1Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1Corinthians 10:13</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil.">2Thessalonians 3:3</a>.) In other instances it is followed commonly by a statement as to some act or attribute of God. Here it is more of the nature of an oath: “As God is faithful in all His words, so my speech” (the vague term is used to include preaching, writing, personal intercourse) “is true and faithful also.” There had been no “Yes” and “No” in the same breath; no saying one thing when he meant another.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 The apostle clears himself from the charge of levity and inconstancy, in not coming to Corinth. Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But as God is true - Tyndale renders this in accordance more literally with the Greek, "God is faithful; for our preaching unto you was not yea and nay." The phrase seems to have the form of an oath, or to be a solemn appeal to God as a Witness, and to be equivalent to the expression "the Lord liveth," or "as the Lord liveth." The idea is," God is faithful and true. He never deceives; never promises that which he does not perform. So true is it that I am not fickle and changing in my purposes." This idea of the faithfulness of God is the argument which Paul urges why he felt himself bound to be faithful also. That faithful God he regarded as a witness, and to that God he could appeal on the occasion.<p>Our word - Margin, "preaching" (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  ho logos. This may refer either to his preaching, to his promises of visiting them, or his declarations to them in general on any subject. The particular subject under discussion was the promise which he had made to visit them. But he here seems to make his affirmation general, and to say universally of his promises, and his teaching, and of all his communications to them, whether orally or in writing, that they were not characterized by inconstancy and changeableness. It was not his character to be fickle, unsettled, and vacillating. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. He adds this lest they might think his DOCTRINE was changeable like his purposes (the change in which he admitted in 2Co 1:17, while denying that it was due to "lightness," and at the same time implying that not to have changed, where there was good reason, would have been to imitate the fleshly-minded who at all costs obstinately hold to their purpose).<p>true&#8212;Greek, "faithful" (1Co 1:9).<p>our word&#8212;the doctrine we preach.<p>was not&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read "is not."<p>yea and nay&#8212;that is, inconsistent with itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As God is true</span> to his promises, so he hath taught me to be true to mine.

That <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">word, </span> he saith, <span class="bld">was not yea and nay, </span> that is, he did not make it with a quite contrary intention; but when he promised, he faithfully intended to have justified his word, and indeed to have come; but the providence of God, to which all men are subjected, had otherwise ordered him and disposed of him; which was the cause why he had not yet been as good as his word. It is very observable, how careful this great apostle was to clear himself from any imputations of levity and falsehood; and it should teach us to be careful to maintain our reputation in the world for truth and steadiness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But as God is true,.... It seems that the false apostles had insinuated, that as the apostle had not kept his word in coming to them as he had promised, that he was not to be depended upon in his ministry; that he might as well contradict himself, and deceive others in the one, as well as in the other: wherefore he appeals to God in a very solemn manner, calls him to witness to the truth of his doctrine; for these words may be considered as the form of an oath; or he argues from, the truth and faithfulness of God, to the certainty and invariableness of the word preached, who is so true and faithful as that he will never suffer his word to be yea and nay: for when the apostle says, that <p>our word towards you was not yea and nay, he does not mean his word of promise to come to Corinth; but the word of his preaching, the doctrine of the Gospel, which was not uncertain, changeable, sometimes one thing, and sometimes another, and contradictory to itself. And by this the apostle would intimate, that since he was faithful and upright, uniform, consistent, and all of a piece in preaching the Gospel to them; so they ought to believe, that he was sincere in his resolutions and promises to come and see them, though as yet he had been hindered, and had not been able to perform them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> But <i>as</i> God <i>is</i> <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.</span><p>(10) He calls God as witness and as judge of his constancy in preaching and teaching one self same Gospel.<p>(r) True, and of whose faithful witness it would be horribly wicked to doubt.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="But as God is true, our word toward you was not yes and no.">2 Corinthians 1:18</a>. <span class="ital">But according to His faithfulness, God causes our speech to you to be not yea and nay, not untrustworthy.</span>[133] The <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> introduces the contrast (<span class="ital">yea rather</span>) to the state of things <span class="ital">denied</span> in the preceding question (Baeumlein, <span class="ital">Partik.</span> p. 95); and <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is equivalent to <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἐκεῖνο</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, like <a href="/john/2-18.htm" title="Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign show you to us, seeing that you do these things?">John 2:18</a>; <a href="/john/9-17.htm" title="They say to the blind man again, What say you of him, that he has opened your eyes?
