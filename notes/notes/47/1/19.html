The argument was, so to speak, one of ethical congruity. It was infinitely unlikely that one who preached Christ, the absolutely True Christ, who enforced every precept with the emphatic “Amen, Amen” (the word occurs thirty-one times in St. Matthew, fourteen times in St. Mark, seven times in St. Luke, and in its reduplicated form twenty-five times in St. John), “Verily, verily,” should afterwards be shamelessly untruthful, and use words that paltered with a double sense.<p><span class= "bld">But</span> <span class= "bld">in</span> <span class= "bld">him was yea.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">but in him Yea has been and still is so,</span> as His great characterising word.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-24 The apostle clears himself from the charge of levity and inconstancy, in not coming to Corinth. Good men should be careful to keep the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but on careful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons. Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them through Christ, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought in the life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. The Holy Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: the quickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostle desired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he had gone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letter produced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfort and joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruits which attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the Son of God - In this verse, and the following, Paul states that he felt himself bound to maintain the strictest veracity for two reasons; the one, that Jesus Christ always evinced the strictest veracity <a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>; the other, God was always true to all the promises that He made <a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>; and as he felt himself to be the servant of the Saviour and of God, he was bound by the most sacred obligations also to maintain a character irreproachable in regard to veracity on the meaning of the phrase "Son of God," see the note, <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>.<p>Jesus Christ - It is agreed, says Bloomfield, by the best commentators, ancient and modern, that by Jesus Christ is here meant his doctrine. The sense is, that the preaching respecting Jesus Christ, did not represent him as fickle, and changeable; as unsettled, and as unfaithful; but as true, consistent, and faithful. As that had been the regular and constant representation of Paul and his fellow-laborers in regard to the Master whom they served, it was to be inferred that they felt themselves bound sacredly to observe the strictest constancy and veracity.<p>By us ... - Silvanus, mentioned here, is the same person who in the Acts of the Apostles is called Silas. He was with Paul at Philippi, and was imprisoned there with him <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/16.htm">Acts 16</a>, and was afterward with Paul and Timothy at Corinth when he first visited that city; <a href="/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a>. Paul was so much attached to him, and had so much confidence in him, that he joined his name with his own in several of his epistles; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>.<p>Was not yea and nay - Our representation of him was not that he was fickle and changeable.<p>But in him was yea - Was not one thing at one time, and another at another. He is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. All that he says is true; all the promises that he makes are firm; all his declarations are faithful. Paul may refer to the fact that the Lord Jesus when on earth was eminently characterized by truth. Nothing was more striking than his veracity. He called himself "the truth," as being eminently true in all his declarations. "I am the way, and the truth, and the life;" <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>; compare <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>. And thus <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a> he is called "the faithful and true witness." In all his life he was eminently distinguished for that. His declarations were simple truth; his narratives were simple, unvarnished, uncolored, unexaggerated statements of what actually occurred. He never disguised the truth; never prevaricated; never had any mental reservation; never deceived; never used any word, or threw in any circumstance, that was suited to lead the mind astray. He himself said that this was the great object which he had in view in coming into the world. "To this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth;" <a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>. As Jesus Christ was thus distinguished for simple truth, Paul felt that he was under sacred obligations to imitate him, and always to evince the same inviolable fidelity. The most deeply felt obligation on earth is that which the Christian feels to imitate the Redeemer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Proof of the unchangeableness of the doctrine from the unchangeableness of the subject of it, namely, Jesus Christ. He is called "the Son of God" to show the impossibility of change in One who is co-equal with God himself (compare 1Sa 15:29; Mal 3:6).<p>by me &#8230; Silvanus and Timotheus&#8212;The Son of God, though preached by different preachers, was one and the same, unchangeable. Silvanus is contracted into Silas (Ac 15:22; compare 1Pe 5:12).<p>in him was yea&#8212;Greek, "is made yea in Him"; that is, our preaching of the Son of God is confirmed as true in Him (that is, through Him; through the miracles wherewith He has confirmed our preaching) [Grotius]; or rather, by the witness of the Spirit which He has given (2Co 1:21, 22) and of which miracles were only one, and that a subordinate manifestation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle here glveth a reason why he had made truth and sincerity so much his business (which reason obligeth us also, who are as much bound as he to study a conformity to Christ); saith he: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Son of God, who was preached among you, that is, Jesus Christ; </span> who, though (as some observe) he is in these Epistles no where called God, but Lord, is here called <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the Son of God; </span> which can be understood in no other sense, than by eternal generation; for those who are only the sons of God by adoption, are not the subjects of ministers’ preaching.

He was only one and the same; his doctrine was always certain and uniform, and consistent with itself; and our conversation ought to be suitable to him and his doctrine. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ,.... The apostle having asserted that the Gospel preached by them was not yea and nay, variable and different, or what was affirmed at one time was denied at another, proceeds to point out the subject of the Gospel ministry, <p>the Son of God, Jesus Christ; that Christ is "the Son of God": this article he began his ministry with, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/9-20.htm">Acts 9:20</a>, and all the apostles affirmed the same thing; and which is of the greatest moment and importance, and ought to be abode by, insisted on, and frequently inculcated; as that he is the eternal Son of God, existed as such from everlasting, is of the same nature, and has the same perfections with his Father; and therefore is able to destroy the works of the devil, for which he was manifested in the flesh, and every way equal to the business of redemption, which he has finished; and having passed into the heavens under this character, is a powerful advocate with the Father; and which renders him a sure foundation for the church, and a proper object of faith: that the Son of God is Christ, anointed to bear and execute the office of a mediator in the several parts and branches of it; a prophet to teach his people, a priest to make atonement and intercession for them, and a King to govern and protect them: and that the Son, who is become the Lord's Christ, is Jesus, a Saviour; and that salvation is alone by him, to which he was appointed from eternity, and was sent in the fulness of time to effect it; and by his obedience, sufferings, and death, is become the author of it, and is the only able, willing, and suitable Saviour for poor sinners. This is the principal subject and strain of the Gospel ministry; and which makes it good news, and glad tidings to lost perishing sinners. The agreement between the faithful ministers of the Gospel is here plainly hinted, <p>who was preached among you by us, even by me, and Silvanus and Timotheus. These ministers being mentioned by the apostle with himself, shows his humility in putting them on a level with himself; and his modesty and candour in not monopolizing the Gospel to himself, but allowing others to be preachers of it as well as he: and his design herein seems to be for the confirmation of the Gospel, and to show that he was not singular and alone, and could not be blamed by them, without blaming others; and chiefly to express the harmony and unanimity of Gospel preachers. The prophets of the Old Testament, and the apostles of the New, agreed in all the doctrines and truths of the Gospel; so did the apostles themselves; and so all faithful dispensers of the word have in all different times and places agreed, and still do agree; which serves greatly to corroborate the truth of the Gospel. The Gospel being faithfully preached by these persons, <p>was not yea and nay; it had no contradiction in it; each part agreed together, was entirely harmonious, and consistent. Their doctrine was, that Christ is the Son of God, truly and properly God; that he took upon him the office of a Mediator, and executes it; that he is the only Saviour of sinners; that God has chosen a certain number of men in Christ before the foundation of the world, has made a covenant with them in Christ, and blessed them in him; that Christ has redeemed them by his blood; that these are regenerated by the Spirit and grace of Christ, are justified by his righteousness, and shall finally persevere, and be partakers of eternal life; which is all of a piece, and in it no yea and nay. Yea and nay doctrines are particular election, the possibility of the salvation of the non-elect, the salvability of all men, and universal redemption; justification by faith, and, as it were, by the works of the law; conversion, partly by grace, and partly by the will of man; preparatory works, offers, and days of grace; and final perseverance made a doubt of: but such is not the true ministry of Christ and his apostles, <p>but in him was yea; the Gospel, as in Christ, and as it comes from him, and has been preached by his apostles, and faithful ministers, is all of a piece; its constant and invariable strain, and by which it may be known and distinguished, is, to display the free, rich, and sovereign grace of God, to magnify and exalt the person and offices of Christ, to debase the creature, and to engage persons to the performance of good works, on Gospel principles, and by Gospel motives, and for right ends. The apostle using those words, "yea and nay", conforms to the language of the Jews, his countrymen, who to magnify their doctors and Rabbins, and to raise their credit, say such things of them; <p>""yea, yea", are the words of the house or school of Shammai; , "yea, yea", are the words of the school of Hillell (b).'' <p>And in another place (c); <p>"the receiving and giving, or the dealings of a disciple of a wise man, are in truth and faithfulness. He says,    , "concerning nay, nay, and concerning yea, yea".'' <p>But what is here said better agrees with the principles and practices of the disciples and followers of Christ. <p>(b) T. Bab.

To be God’s Son and yet <span class="greekheb">ναὶ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὔ</span> would be a contradiction. In the whole <span class="greekheb">ὁ</span> … <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. there lies a solemn, sacred emphasi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐν ὑμῖν διʼ ἡμῶν κηρυχθείς</span>] reminds the readers of the <span class="ital">first</span> preaching of Christ among them, of which Paul <span class="ital">could not but</span> remind them, if they were to become perfectly conscious, from their experience from the beginning, that Christ had not become <span class="greekheb">ναὶ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὔ</span>. But in order to make this <span class="ital">first</span> preaching come home to them with the whole personal weight of the preachers, he adds, in just consciousness of the services rendered by himself and his companions as compared with the later workers, a more precise definition of the <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἡμῶν</span>, with more weighty circumstantiality: <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἐμοῦ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Σιλουανοῦ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τιμοθέου</span>. For the two latter had been his helpers in his first labours in Corinth. See <a href="/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a>. From this it is obvious why he has not named others, as Apollos, but simply these (Calvin thinks, that these had been most <span class="ital">calumniated</span>); hence also there is no need to suppose any intention of making his assurance more <span class="ital">credible</span> (Chrysostom, Theophylact, and many others). A side glance at the Christ preached by Judaistic opponents (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-4.htm" title="For if he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit, which you have not received, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you might well bear with him.">2 Corinthians 11:4</a>) is here quite foreign to the connection (in opposition to Klöpper, p. 86 f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Σιλουανοῦ</span>] Universally so with Paul (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>); also in <a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm" title="By Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein you stand.">1 Peter 5:12</a>. In the Acts of the Apostles only the shortened name <span class="greekheb">Σιλας</span> appears. Silvanus is here <span class="ital">placed before</span> Timothy, because he was an older apostolic helper than the latter. See <a href="/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐγένετο ναὶ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὔ</span>] <span class="ital">He has not become affirmation and negation</span>, has not <span class="ital">showed Himself</span> as untrustworthy, <span class="ital">as one who affirms and also denies</span> (the fulfilment of the divine promises, <a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>), as one who had exhibited such contradiction in himself. This Paul says <span class="ital">of Christ Himself</span>, in so far as in the personal objective Christ, by means of His appearance and His whole work, the <span class="greekheb">ναί</span> in reference to the divine promises, the affirmation of their fulfilment, is given as a <span class="ital">matter of fact</span>. Wrongly most expositors (comp. Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact) understand <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span> as <span class="ital">doctrina de Christo</span> (“our gospel of Christ is not changeable, sometimes one thing, sometimes another, but it remains ever the same”), an interpretation here specially precluded by verses 20 and 21. This may be urged also against the similar interpretation of Hofmann, that, with the very fact that Christ has come to the readers <span class="ital">through preaching</span>, there has gone forth a Yea (the affirmation of all divine promises), without any intervention of Nay. Olshausen and Rückert take it rightly of Christ Himself; but the former puts in place of the simple meaning of the word the thought not quite in keeping: “Christ is the absolute truth, <span class="ital">affirmation pure and simple</span>; in Him is the real fulfilment of the divine promises; in Him <span class="ital">negation</span> is entirely wanting;” and the latter arbitrarily limits <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο</span> merely to the experience of the Corinthians (“<span class="ital">among you</span> He has not shown Himself untrustworthy”).

He was sent with Paul and Barnabas, as ‘a chief man among the brethren,’ to guarantee the authenticity of the Apostolic letter which the former brought back with them from Jerusalem to Antioch after the discussion recorded in Acts 15, since, had Paul and Barnabas returned alone, their opponents might not improbably have disputed its genuineness. See <a href="/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>; <a href="/acts/15-25.htm" title="It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,">Acts 15:25</a>; <a href="/acts/15-27.htm" title="We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.">Acts 15:27</a>.

Some have thought that he was the brother mentioned in ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2 Corinthians 8:18</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/12-18.htm" title="I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>. He is mentioned by St Paul with himself in the opening of each of the Epistles to the Thessalonians. He was with the Apostle at Philippi (<a href="/context/acts/16-19.htm" title="And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace to the rulers,...">Acts 16:19-40</a>), at Thessalonica (<a href="/acts/17-1.htm" title="Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:">Acts 17:1</a>; <a href="/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>; <a href="/acts/17-10.htm" title="And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.">Acts 17:10</a>), at Berea (<a href="/acts/17-10.htm" title="And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.">Acts 17:10</a>), at Corinth (<span class="ital">not</span> at Athens, <a href="/acts/17-15.htm" title="And they that conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.">Acts 17:15</a>, <a href="/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a>). He is not mentioned again in Scripture save by St Peter in his first Epistle (ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>), in which he speaks of him as one with whom he has little personal acquaintance, but much confidence. Silas is contracted from the fuller form Silvanus as Lucas from Lucanus. The similar signification of the two words <span class="ital">Lucas</span> and <span class="ital">Silvanus</span> have led some to suppose that St Luke and St Silas were the same person. But a perusal of the narrative in Acts 16, 17, especially <a href="/context/acts/16-4.htm" title="And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem....">Acts 16:4-8</a>; <a href="/context/acts/16-10.htm" title="And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel to them....">Acts 16:10-17</a>; <a href="/context/acts/16-19.htm" title="And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace to the rulers,...">Acts 16:19-20</a>, will shew that they were two distinct persons. See Alford, <span class="ital">Prolegomena to Acts of the Apostles</span>, for a fuller investigation of this point. We may observe that not only does St Paul, in his humility, identify himself with the Corinthians (<span class="ital"><a href="/2_corinthians/1-14.htm" title="As also you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.">2 Corinthians 1:14</a></span>) but he takes care to associate his subordinates with him as fellow labourers in a common work. Paley, <span class="ital">Horae Paulinae</span>, remarks on the undesigned coincidence between this verse and <a href="/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a>. The two books are not written by the same person. There is no particular stress laid on the fact of Silas and Timotheus having been with the Apostle in either book, but the reference to them slips out quite accidentally. But <span class="ital">both</span> declare in this accidental way that Silas and Timotheus <span class="ital">were</span> with the Apostle at Corinth. Such minute agreement is beyond the power of the compiler of fictitious narrative. See a fuller discussion of this subject in the Introduction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">was not yea and nay, but in him was yea</span>] The Son of God, the subject-matter of the Gospel, was no uncertain conception, sometimes affirmed and sometimes denied. The preaching of Him was the constant affirmation of a truth, an unchangeable blessing vouchsafed in Him to mankind. For ‘<span class="ital">in Him was</span> yea;’ the original has the perfect, ‘in Him i.e. in God, <span class="ital"><a href="/2_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="But as God is true, our word toward you was not yes and no.">2 Corinthians 1:18</a></span>) <span class="ital">hath been</span> (or <span class="ital">become</span>) yea.’ For in Him ‘is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.’ <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm" title="God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">James 1:17</a>. How then could the change of purpose in His minister be ascribed to the capricious infirmity of the mere human will? Cf. also <a href="/romans/15-8.htm" title="Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:">Romans 15:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm" title="Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.">Hebrews 13:8</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ γὰρ τοῦ Θεοῦ υἱὸς</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ιἠσοῦς Χριστὸς</span>, <span class="ital">for the Son of God, Jesus Christ</span>) who is the principal subject of our discourse. We should observe the joining together of the three appellations, thereby showing forth firmness;[7] as also their position in the natural order; for the first is evidently not the same as the third.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ Σιλουανοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">and Silvanus</span>) Luke calls him Silas; <a href="/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a> note.—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ ναὶ</span>) <span class="ital">but yea</span> pure and unmixed, on our part and yours.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, <span class="ital">in Himself</span>) <span class="ital">Christ preached</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> our preaching of Christ became <span class="ital">yea in</span> Christ <span class="ital">Himself</span>.

This is a proof of what he has just said.

"Silvanus" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>) is the "Silas" of <a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>.

"Became not (proved not to be) yes and no (in one breath, as it were, and therefore utterly untrustworthy), but in him there has been a yea."
