and to the other the smell of life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?">2Corinthians 2:16</a>, in the English as in the Greek, <span class= "ital">sufficient ministers.</span> The noun is used as carrying out the thought implied in the “ministered by us” in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.">2Corinthians 3:3</a>. In the “new covenant”—new, as implying <span class= "ital">freshness</span> of life and energy—we have a direct reference, both to our Lord’s words, as cited in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do you, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me.">1Corinthians 11:25</a>, and given in the Gospel narrative of the Last Supper (see Notes on <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>), and to <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31</a>. The Greek omits the article before all three words, “of a new covenant, one not of a written letter, but of spirit.” The idea of “spirit” comes from <a href="/ezekiel/11-19.htm" title="And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/36-26.htm" title="A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</span>—The word “letter” (<span class= "ital">gramma</span>) stands, not for what we call the literal meaning of Scripture, as contrasted with one which is allegorical or spiritual, but for the whole written code or law of Judaism. St. Paul does not contrast the literal meaning of that code with the so-called mystical exposition of it (a view which has often led to wild and fantastic interpretations), but speaks of the written code as such. So the plural “the writings, the Scriptures” (<span class= "ital">grammata</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> are used of the sacred Books of Israel (<a href="/john/5-47.htm" title="But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?">John 5:47</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm" title="And that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.">2Timothy 3:15</a>), and the scribes (<span class= "ital">grammateis</span>) were those who interpreted the writings. The contrast between the “letter” in this sense and the “spirit” is a familiar thought with St. Paul (<a href="/context/romans/2-27.htm" title="And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?">Romans 2:27-29</a>; <a href="/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a>). Of this written code St. Paul says that it “killeth.” The statement seems startlingly bold, and he does not here stop to explain its meaning. What he means is, however, stated with sufficient fulness in the three Epistles written about this time (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-56.htm" title="The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.">1Corinthians 15:56</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-10.htm" title="For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.">Galatians 3:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.">Galatians 3:21</a>; <a href="/context/romans/7-9.htm" title="For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.">Romans 7:9-11</a>; <a href="/context/romans/8-2.htm" title="For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.">Romans 8:2-3</a>, the references being given in the chronological order of the Epistles). The work of the Law, from St. Paul’s view, is to make men conscious of sin. No outward command, even though it come from God, and is “holy, and just, and good” (<a href="/romans/7-12.htm" title="Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.">Romans 7:12</a>), can, as such, do more than that. What was wanting was the life-giving power of the Spirit. The word here (as in <a href="/romans/2-27.htm" title="And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?">Romans 2:27</a>; <a href="/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a>) appears to hover between the sense of “spirit” as representing any manifestation of the Divine Life that gives life—in which sense the words of Christ are “spirit and life” (<a href="/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.">John 6:63</a>), and Christ Himself is a “quickening spirit” (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1Corinthians 15:45</a>, and <a href="/2_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.">2Corinthians 3:17</a> of this chapter)—and the more distinctly personal sense in which St. Paul speaks of “the Spirit,” the Holy Spirit, and to which we commonly limit our use of the name of “the Holy Ghost” in His relation to the Father and Son. Of that Spirit St. Paul says that “it quickens:” it can rouse into life not only the slumbering conscience, as the Law had done, but the higher spiritual element in man—can give it strength to will, the healthy energy of new affections, new prayers, new impulses. If we cannot suppose St. Paul to have been acquainted with our Lord’s teaching, as recorded in <a href="/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.">John 6:63</a> (where see Note), the coincidence of thought is, at any rate, singularly striking.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Even the appearance of self-praise and courting human applause, is painful to the humble and spiritual mind. Nothing is more delightful to faithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of their ministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom they labour. The law of Christ was written in their hearts, and the love of Christ shed abroad there. Nor was it written in tables of stone, as the law of God given to Moses, but on the fleshy (not fleshly, as fleshliness denotes sensuality) tables of the heart, Eze 36:26. Their hearts were humbled and softened to receive this impression, by the new-creating power of the Holy Spirit. He ascribes all the glory to God. And remember, as our whole dependence is upon the Lord, so the whole glory belongs to him alone. The letter killeth: the letter of the law is the ministration of death; and if we rest only in the letter of the gospel, we shall not be the better for so doing: but the Holy Spirit gives life spiritual, and life eternal. The Old Testament dispensation was the ministration of death, but the New Testament of life. The law made known sin, and the wrath and curse of God; it showed us a God above us, and a God against us; but the gospel makes known grace, and Emmanuel, God with us. Therein the righteousness of God by faith is revealed; and this shows us that the just shall live by his faith; this makes known the grace and mercy of God through Jesus Christ, for obtaining the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. The gospel so much exceeds the law in glory, that it eclipses the glory of the legal dispensation. But even the New Testament will be a killing letter, if shown as a mere system or form, and without dependence on God the Holy Spirit, to give it a quickening power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who also hath made us able ministers ... - This translation does not quite meet the force of the original. It would seem to imply that Paul regarded himself and his fellowlaborers as people of talents, and of signal ability; and that he was inclined to boast of it. But this is not the meaning. It refers properly to his sense of the responsibility and difficulty of the work of the ministry; and to the fact that he did not esteem himself to be sufficient for this work in his own strength <a href="/2_corinthians/2-16.htm">2 Corinthians 2:16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>; and he here says that God had made him sufficient: not able, talented, learned, but sufficient &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;  hikano&#772;sen he&#772;mas; he has supplied our deficiency; he has rendered us competent, or fit; if a word may be coined after the manner of the Greek here, "he has sufficienced us for this work." There is no assertion, therefore, here, that they were people of talents, or special ability, but only that God had qualified them for their work, and made them by his grace sufficient to meet the toils and responsibilites of this arduous office.<p>Of the New Testament - Of the new covenant (note, <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>), in contradistinction from the old covenant, which was established through Moses. They were appointed to go forth and make the provisions of that new covenant known to a dying world.<p>Not of the letter - Not of the literal, or verbal meaning, in contradistinction from the Spirit; see the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-27.htm">Romans 2:27</a>, <a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>. This is said, doubtless, in opposition to the Jews, and Jewish teachers. They insisted much on the letter of the Law, but entered little into its real meaning. They did not seek out the true spiritual sense of the Old Testament; and hence, they rested on the mere literal observance of the rites and ceremonies of religion without understanding their true nature and design. Their service, though in many respects conformed to the letter of the Law, yet became cold, formal, and hypocritical; abounding in mere ceremonies, and where the heart had little to do. Hence, there was little pure spiritual worship offered to God; and hence also they rejected the Messiah whom the old covenant prefigured, and was designed to set forth.<p>For the letter killeth - compare notes on <a href="/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9-10</a>. The mere letter of the Law of Moses. The effect of it was merely to produce condemnation; to produce a sense of guilt, and danger, and not to produce pardon, relief, and joy. The Law denounced death; condemned sin in all forms; and the effect of it was to produce a sense of guilt and condemnation.<p>But the spirit giveth life - The spirit, in contradistinction from the mere literal interpretation of the Scriptures. The Spirit, that is, Christ, says Locke, compare <a href="/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>. The spirit here means, says Bloomfield, that new spiritual system, the gospel. The Spirit of God speaking in us, says Doddridge. The spirit here seems to refer to the New Testament, or the new dispensation in contradistinction from the old. That was characterized mainly by its strictness of Law, and by its burdensome rites, and by the severe tone of its denunciation for sin. It did not in itself provide a way of pardon and peace. Law condemns; it does not speak of forgiveness. On the contrary, the gospel, a spiritual system, is designed to impart life and comfort to the soul. It speaks peace. It comes not to condemn, but to save. It discloses a way of mercy, and it invites all to partake and live. It is called "spirit," probably because its consolations are imparted and secured by the Spirit of God - the source of all true life to the soul. It is the dispensation of the Spirit; and it demands a spiritual service - a service that is free, and elevated, and tending eminently to purify the heart, and to save the soul; see the note on <a href="/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. able&#8212;rather, as the Greek is the same, corresponding to 2Co 3:5, translate, "sufficient as ministers" (Eph 3:7; Col 1:23).<p>the new testament&#8212;"the new covenant" as contrasted with the Old Testament or covenant (1Co 11:25; Ga 4:24). He reverts here again to the contrast between the law on "tables of stone," and that "written by the Spirit on fleshly tables of the heart" (2Co 3:3).<p>not of the letter&#8212;joined with "ministers"; ministers not of the mere literal precept, in which the old law, as then understood, consisted; "but of the Spirit," that is, the spiritual holiness which lay under the old law, and which the new covenant brings to light (Mt 5:17-48) with new motives added, and a new power of obedience imparted, namely, the Holy Spirit (Ro 7:6). Even in writing the letter of the New Testament, Paul and the other sacred writers were ministers not of the letter, but of the spirit. No piety of spirit could exempt a man from the yoke of the letter of each legal ordinance under the Old Testament; for God had appointed this as the way in which He chose a devout Jew to express his state of mind towards God. Christianity, on the other hand, makes the spirit of our outward observances everything, and the letter a secondary consideration (Joh 4:24). Still the moral law of the ten commandments, being written by the finger of God, is as obligatory now as ever; but put more on the Gospel spirit of "love," than on the letter of a servile obedience, and in a deeper and fuller spirituality (Mt 5:17-48; Ro 13:9). No literal precepts could fully comprehend the wide range of holiness which LOVE, the work of the Holy Spirit, under the Gospel, suggests to the believer's heart instinctively from the word understood in its deep spirituality.<p>letter killeth&#8212;by bringing home the knowledge of guilt and its punishment, death; 2Co 3:7, "ministration of death" (Ro 7:9).<p>spirit giveth life&#8212;The spirit of the Gospel when brought home to the heart by the Holy Spirit, gives new spiritual life to a man (Ro 6:4, 11). This "spirit of life" is for us in Christ Jesus (Ro 8:2, 10), who dwells in the believer as a "quickening" or "life-giving Spirit" (1Co 15:45). Note, the spiritualism of rationalists is very different. It would admit no "stereotyped revelation," except so much as man's own inner instrument of revelation, the conscience and reason, can approve of: thus making the conscience judge of the written word, whereas the apostles make the written word the judge of the conscience (Ac 17:11; 1Pe 4:1). True spirituality rests on the whole written word, applied to the soul by the Holy Spirit as the only infallible interpreter of its far-reaching spirituality. The letter is nothing without the spirit, in a subject essentially spiritual. The spirit is nothing without the letter, in a record substantially historical.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse plainly openeth what he had said before, and lets us know what sufficiency of God that was of which he there spake.

This is an answer to the question in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-16.htm">2 Corinthians 2:16</a> who is sufficient for these things? no man is of himself; we are indeed sufficient for them, but not of ourselves; our sufficiency is of God, he hath made us able, or sufficient ministers: such ministers as are not of men's, but God's making, are sufficient ones; and none are sufficient but whom God makes so; and those he makes able and sufficient, by giving them spiritual gifts, fitting them for the ministry: and these are ministers <p>of the New Testament, or "covenant"; the covenant of grace, of which Christ is the Mediator and surety; called "new", not because newly made, for it was made with Christ from everlasting; nor newly revealed, for it was made known to Adam after his fall, and to all the Old Testament patriarchs, and was exhibited under the legal dispensation, though but darkly, in types, shadows, sacrifices, &amp;c. which therefore waxing old is vanished away; and the covenant of grace is now more clearly revealed under the Gospel dispensation, free from all the obscurity it before laboured under; and therefore is called "new", as well as because it will always continue so, and never give way to another covenant: now the Gospel, and the ministry of it, is nothing else but an exhibition of the covenant of grace, its blessings and promises; and the work and business of those who are ministers of it is not to insist upon the covenant of works, the terms, conditions, obligations, promises, and threatenings of that covenant; but to open and explain the nature, promises, and blessings of the covenant of grace: for such who are fit and proper ministers, are ministers <p>not of the letter, but of the spirit; which is to be understood, not of any difference between the books of the Old and the New Testament, for a faithful minister of the word may and will bring forth things new and old, out of the one as well as the other; nor of the literal and allegorical, or mystical sense of the Scriptures, as if the latter and not the former was only to be attended to; nor of the difference of communicating the Gospel by letters, and preaching it by word of mouth; since both methods may be used for the spread of it, as were by the apostles themselves; but of the difference there is between the law and the Gospel. The law is "the letter", not merely because written in letters, for so likewise is the Gospel; but because it is a mere letter, hereby showing what is to be done or avoided, without any efficacy in it, or communicating any to enable persons to obey its commands, to give life to its observers, or either to sanctify or justify any who are under it, or of the works of it; it is a mere letter, as observed by an unregenerate man, who only regards the externals of it, being unacquainted with its spirituality. The Gospel is "the spirit"; see <a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a> it contains spiritual things, and not things merely natural, moral, and civil, as does the law, but spiritual blessings and promises; it penetrates into the spirit and soul of man, and comes from, and is attended with the Spirit of God. The law is <p>the letter that <p>killeth, by irritating and provoking to sin, the cause of death, which though not the design and natural tendency of the law, and therefore not to be blamed, yet so it is, through the corruption of human nature; and by convincing of sin when the sinner is killed, and it dead in his own apprehension; and by not only threatening with death, but by cursing, condemning, and punishing with it: <p>but the Gospel is <p>the spirit, which <p>giveth life; it is a means in the hand of the Spirit of God, of quickening dead sinners, of healing the deadly wounds of sin, of showing the way of life by Christ, and of working faith in the soul, to look to him, and live upon him; it affords food for the support of the spiritual life, and revives souls under the most drooping circumstances. The apostle may allude to a distinction among the Jews, between the body and soul of the law; the words, they say, are , "the body of the law"; and the book of the law is the clothing; and besides these, there is , "the soul of the law"; which wise men look into (w). <p>(w) Zohar in Numb. fol. 63. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</span><p>(2) He amplifies his ministry and his fellows: that is to say, the ministry of the Gospel comparing it with the ministry of the Law, which he considers in the person of Moses, by whom the Law was given: against whom he sets Christ the author of the Gospel. Now this comparison is taken from the very substance of the ministry. The Law is as it were a writing in itself, dead, and without efficacy: but the Gospel, and new Covenant, as it were the very power of God itself, in renewing, justifying, and saving men. The Law offers death, accusing all men of unrighteousness: the Gospel offers and gives righteousness and life. The administration of the Law served for a time to the promise: the Gospel remains to the end of the world. Therefore what is the glory of the Law in comparison of the majesty of the Gospel?<p>(f) Not of the Law but of the Gospel.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὃς καὶ ἱκάνωσεν ἡμᾶς</span>] <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span>, <span class="ital">he who</span>, in the sense of <span class="greekheb">οὗτος γάρ</span>.

God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.">Galatians 3:21</a>, where he notes that the law is not able, <span class="greekheb">ζωοποιεῖν</span>, “to give life”). It will be observed that the article is wanting before <span class="greekheb">καινῆς διαθήκης</span>, as it is before <span class="greekheb">γράμματος</span> and <span class="greekheb">πνεύματος</span>; but we need not on that account with the Revisers translate “<span class="ital">a</span> new covenant”. The expression “New Covenant,” like the words “Letter” (for the Law) and “Spirit” for the Holy Spirit, was a technical phrase in the theology of the day; and so might well dispense with the article. The contrast between “letter” and “Spirit” here (so often misunderstood, as if it pointed to a contrast between what is verbally stated and what is really implied, and so justified an appeal from the bare “letter” of the law to the principles on which it rests) is exactly illustrated by <a href="/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a>, where St. Paul declares that the service of a Christian is <span class="greekheb">ἐν καινότητι πνεύματος καὶ οὐ παλαιότητι γράμματος</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, “in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter”. And (though not so plainly) the same contrast is probably intended in <a href="/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>. In St. Paul’s writings <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, when used for the human spirit, is contrasted with <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1 Corinthians 5:3</a>), <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>) and <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-14.htm" title="For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.">1 Corinthians 14:14</a>), but <span class="ital">never</span> with <span class="greekheb">γράμμα</span>. This is a technical term for the “Law” (like <span class="greekheb">γραφή</span>, Scripture; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm" title="But if the ministration of death, written and engraved in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν γράμμασιν</span>), and is properly set over against the “Spirit” of God, whose office and work were first plainly revealed in the Gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>6. <span class="ital">Who also hath made us able ministers</span>] None of the old English versions have given the threefold repetition of the word by St Paul, who writes, ‘Who hath made us <span class="ital">sufficient</span> ministers.’ The word St Paul uses signifies the having <span class="ital">reached a certain standard</span> of ability.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the new testament</span>] We must dismiss all notions here of the book called the “New Testament.” The word in the original (see note on <a href="/1_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do you, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me.">1 Corinthians 11:25</a>) signifies both <span class="ital">testament</span> and <span class="ital">covenant</span>. The latter should be the rendering here. St Paul is contrasting the Mosaic with the Christian covenant. There is also no article. The Apostle’s meaning may be thus paraphrased: ‘Who hath endowed us with qualifications sufficient for us to become the ministers of a new covenant.’ It is not to the covenant, but to its <span class="ital">newness</span>, that the Apostle would here ask our attention.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not of the letter, but of the spirit</span>] See <a href="/context/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:...">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/11-19.htm" title="And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:">Ezekiel 11:19</a>, before cited. There is an obvious reference to these passages in the text. The difference between the old covenant and the new was that the former <span class="ital">prescribed</span>, the latter <span class="ital">inspired</span>; the former gave written precepts, the latter the power to fulfil them; the former laid down the rules, the latter brought man’s heart into the condition in which such rules became a part of his nature. “The old form was superseded by the <span class="ital">principle</span>. Instead of saying, ‘Thou shalt not say Fool, or Raca,’ Christ gave the principle of Love.” Robertson. The words ‘of the letter,’ and ‘of the spirit,’ however, depend not on the word <span class="ital">covenant</span>, but on the word <span class="ital">ministers</span>. See also <a href="/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us which are saved it is the power of God.">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm" title="But to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.">1 Corinthians 1:24</a> and notes.

With this comp. the following verse, <span class="ital">of death</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who also.</span> Either, "And he it is who;" or, "Who besides <span class="accented">this</span> power, has made us adequate ministers." <span class="cmt_word">Hath made us able ministers;</span> rather, <span class="accented">made us sufficient ministers</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Of the new testament;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of a fresh covenant</span> (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>). The "new testament" has not the remotest connection with what we call "The New Testament," meaning thereby the book - which, indeed, had at this time no existence. The word "testament" means a will, and in this sense implies neither the Hebrew <span class="accented">berith</span> nor the Greek <span class="accented">diatheke</span>, both of which mean "covenant." In one passage only of the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/9-16.htm">Hebrews 9:16, 17</a>) does <span class="accented">diatheke</span> mean a "testament" or "will." For the thought, see <a href="/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-25.htm">Colossians 1:25</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11, 12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Not of the letter, but of the spirit.</span> In other words, "not of the Law, but of the gospel;" not of that which is dead, but of that which is living; not of that which is deathful, but of that which is life-giving; not of bondage, but of freedom; not of mutilation, but of self-control; not of the outward, but of the inward; not of works, but of grace; not of menace, but of promise; not of curse, but of blessing; not of wrath, but of love; not of Moses, but of Christ. This is the theme which St. Paul develops especially in the Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians (see <a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6, 10, 11</a>; <a href="/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>, etc.). <span class="accented">Not of the letter</span>. Not, that is, of the Mosaic Law regarded as a yoke of externalism; a hard and unhelpful "thou shalt" and "thou shalt not;" a system that possessed no life of its own and inspired no life into others; a "categoric imperative," majestic, indeed, but unsympathetic and pitiless. Both the Law and the gospel were <span class="accented">committed to writing</span>; each covenant had its own <span class="accented">book</span>; but in the case of the Mosaic Law there was the book and nothing more; in the case of the gospel the book was nothing compared to the spirit, and nothing without the spirit. <span class="accented">Out of the spirit</span>. That is, of the gospel which found its pledge and consummation in the gift of the Spirit. The Law, too, was in one sense "spiritual" (<a href="/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14</a>), for it was given by God, who is a Spirit, and it was a holy Law; but though such in itself (<span class="accented">in se</span>) it was relatively (<span class="accented">per aceidens</span>) a cause of sin and death, because it was addressed to a fallen nature, and inspired no spirit by which that nature could be delivered (see  <a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-25</a>). But in the gospel the spirit is everything; the mere letter is as nothing (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</span> This is one of the very numerous "texts" which have been first misinterpreted and have then been made, for whole centuries, the bases of erroneous systems. On this text more than any other, Origen, followed by the exegetes of a thousand years, built his dogma that the Scripture must be interpreted allegorically, not literally, because "the letter" of the Bible kills. The misinterpretation is extravagantly inexcusable, and, like many others, arose solely from rending words away from their context and so reading new senses into them. The contrast is not between "the outward" and the inward sense of Scripture at all. "The letter" refers exclusively to "the Law," and therefore has so little reference to "the Bible" that it was written before most of the New Testament existed, and only touches on a small portion of the Old Testament. <span class="accented">Killeth</span>.

It says, "He who doeth these things shall live in them;" and therefore implies, as well as often says, that he who disobeys them shall be cut off. It is, therefore, a deathful menace. For none <span class="accented">can</span> obey this Law with perfect obedience. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the sting of death being sin, the Law kills by directly leading to sin, in that it stirs into existence the principle of concupiscence (<a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10, 21</a>). <span class="accented">But the spirit giveth life</span>.
