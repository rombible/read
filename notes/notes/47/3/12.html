Or, as <span class="greekheb">πολλη παρρησια </span>may be rendered, <span class="ital">we use great liberty of address. And not as Moses </span>— We do not act as he did; <span class="ital">who put a veil over his face </span>— Which is to be understood with regard to his writings also; so <span class="ital">that Israel could not look steadfastly to the end of that </span>dispensation; <span class="ital">which is </span>now <span class="ital">abolished </span>— The end of this was Christ. The whole Mosaic dispensation tended to, and terminated in, him. But the Israelites had only a dim wavering sight of him, of whom Moses spake in an obscure, covert manner. Macknight explains this more at large thus: “Here the apostle intimates that Moses put a veil on his face while he delivered the law, to show the darkness of the types and figures of the law, of which he was the minister. And as he veiled his face, that the children of Israel might not see the vanishing of the glory from his face, it signified that the abrogation of the law, typified by the vanishing of the glory, would be hidden from them. So the apostle hath interpreted these emblems, <a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm" title="But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil not taken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ.">2 Corinthians 3:14</a>. Further, to show that the gospel is a clear dispensation, and that it is never to be abolished, and that the ministers of the covenant of the Spirit were able at all times to speak plainly concerning it, they did not, while ministering that covenant, veil their faces like Moses.” <span class="ital">But their minds were blinded </span>— Besides the obscurity of that dispensation, there was evidently blindness on their minds. They rested in the outward letter, and did not understand or apprehend the spiritual sense of the law. <span class="ital">For until this day — </span>Notwithstanding the many extraordinary miracles that have been wrought, and the wonderful events which have taken place; <span class="ital">remaineth the same veil </span>on their understanding <span class="ital">untaken away </span>— <span class="greekheb">Μη ανακαλυπτομενον</span>, literally, <span class="ital">not folded back, </span>namely, so as to admit a little glimmering light; <span class="ital">in </span>or during, <span class="ital">the reading of the old testament </span>— Which contains such distinct prophecies of Christ, and such lively descriptions of him, that one would think it to be impossible that he should not be immediately acknowledged and adored by all that profess to believe its authority. That is, in other words, “The thing typified by the veil on Moses’s face, hath taken place from that time to this day. For when the Israelites read Moses’s account of the old covenant of the law, a veil lieth on that covenant; its types, and figures, and prophecies, are as dark to them as ever; it not being discovered to them that they are fulfilled in Christ, and consequently that the old covenant itself is abolished by him. Further, as the apostle observes in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart.">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>, a veil lieth also on the hearts of the Jews when they read Moses. Besides the natural obscurity of the old covenant, there is a second veil formed by their own prejudices and lusts, which blind them to such a degree, that they cannot discern the intimations which God in the law itself hath given of his intention to abrogate it by Christ.” <span class="ital">Which veil </span>— Of obscurity upon the old testament, and of prejudice and blindness on their own minds; <span class="ital">is done away in Christ </span>— By the knowledge of him, and the illumination of his Spirit, with respect to all that truly believe in him. <span class="ital">Nevertheless, when it </span>— Their heart; <span class="ital">shall turn to the Lord </span>— To Christ by living faith; <span class="ital">the veil shall be taken away </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">is taken away, </span>and that <span class="ital">from around their heart, </span>as <span class="greekheb">περιαιρειται</span>, signifies; or is taken away entirely, and the genuine sense of the sacred oracles breaks in upon their minds with irresistible light, and they see with the utmost clearness how all the types and prophecies of the law are fully accomplished in him. And this, we may observe, not only will happen at the general conversion of the Jews, but actually does happen as often as any one of that nation is converted. In the expression, <span class="ital">when it shall turn to the Lord, </span>&c., there is a manifest allusion to Moses’s taking the veil off from his face, when he turned from the people to go into the tabernacle before the Lord, where by he received a new irradiation from the glory of the Lord. See <a href="/exodus/34-34.htm" title="But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.">Exodus 34:34</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-18 It is the duty of the ministers of the gospel to use great plainness, or clearness, of speech. The Old Testament believers had only cloudy and passing glimpses of that glorious Saviour, and unbelievers looked no further than to the outward institution. But the great precepts of the gospel, believe, love, obey, are truths stated as clearly as possible. And the whole doctrine of Christ crucified, is made as plain as human language can make it. Those who lived under the law, had a veil upon their hearts. This veil is taken away by the doctrines of the Bible about Christ. When any person is converted to God, then the veil of ignorance is taken away. The condition of those who enjoy and believe the gospel is happy, for the heart is set at liberty to run the ways of God's commandments. They have light, and with open face they behold the glory of the Lord. Christians should prize and improve these privileges. We should not rest contented without knowing the transforming power of the gospel, by the working of the Spirit, bringing us to seek to be like the temper and tendency of the glorious gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and into union with Him. We behold Christ, as in the glass of his word; and as the reflection from a mirror causes the face to shine, the faces of Christians shine also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seeing then that we have such hope - Hope properly is a compound emotion, made up of a desire for an object, and an expectation of obtaining it. If there is no desire for it; or if the object is not pleasant and agreeable, there is no hope, though there may be expectation - as in the expectation of the pestilence, of famine, or sickness, or death. If there is no expectation of it, but a strong desire, there is no hope, as in cases where there is a strong desire of wealth, or fame, or pleasure; or where a man is condemned for murder, and has a strong desire but no prospect of pardon; or where a man is shipwrecked, and has a strong desire, but no expectation of again seeing his family and friends. In such cases, despondency or despair are the results. It is the union of the two feelings in proper proportions which constitutes hope. There has been considerable variety of views among expositors in regard to the proper meaning of the word in this place. Mr. Locke supposes that Paul here means the honorable employment of an apostle and minister of the gospel, or the glory belonging to the ministry in the gospel; and that his calling it "hope," instead of "glory," which the connection would seem to demand, is the language of modesty. Rosenmuller understands it of the hope of the perpetual continuance of the gospel dispensation. Macknight renders it" persuasion," and explains it as meaning the full persuasion or assurance that the gospel excels the Law in the manner of its introduction; its permanency, &amp;c, A few remarks may, perhaps, make it clear:<p>(1) It refers primarily to Paul, and the other ministers of the gospel. It is not properly the Christian hope as such to which he refers, but it is that which the ministers of the gospel had.<p>(2) it refers to all that he had said before about the superiority of the gospel to the Law; and it is designed to express the result of all that on his mind, and on the minds of his fellow-laborers.<p>(3) It refers to the prospect, confidence, persuasion, anticipation which he had as the effect of what he had just said. It is the prospect of eternal life; the clear expectation of acceptance, and the anticipation of heaven, based on the fact that this was a ministry of the Spirit <a href="/2_corinthians/3-8.htm">2 Corinthians 3:8</a>; that it was a ministry showing the way of justification <a href="/2_corinthians/3-9.htm">2 Corinthians 3:9</a>; and that it was never to be done away, but to abide forever <a href="/2_corinthians/3-11.htm">2 Corinthians 3:11</a>. On all these this strong hope was founded; and in view of these, Paul expressed himself clearly, not enigmatically; and not in types and figures, as Moses did. Everything about the gospel was clear and plain; and this led to the confident expectation and assurance of heaven. The word "hope," therefore, in this place will express the effect on the mind of Paul in regard to the work of the ministry, produced by the group of considerations which he had suggested, showing that the gospel was superior to the Law; and that it was the ground of more clear and certain confidence and hope than anything which the Law could furnish.<p>We use - We employ; we are accustomed to. He refers to the manner in which he preached the gospel.<p>Great plainness of speech - Margin, boldness. We use the word "plainness" as applied to speech chiefly in two senses:<p>(1) To denote boldness, faithfulness, candor; in opposition to trimming, timidity, and unfaithfulness; and,<p>(2) To denote clearness, intelligibleness, and simplicity, in opposition to obscurity, mist, and highly-worked and labored forms of expression.<p>The connection here shows that the latter is the sense in which the phrase here is to be understood: see <a href="/2_corinthians/3-13.htm">2 Corinthians 3:13</a>. It denotes openness, simplicity, freedom from the obscurity which arises from enigmatical and parabolical, and typical modes of speaking. This stands in opposition to figure, metaphor, and allegory - to an affected and labored concealment of the idea in the manner which was common among the Jewish doctors and pagan philosophers, where their meaning was carefully concealed from the common, and from all except the initiated. It stands opposed also to the necessary obscurity arising from typical institutions like those of Moses. And the doctrine of the passage is, that such is the clearness and fulness of the Christian revelation, arising from the fact, that it is the last economy, and that it does not look to the future, that its ministers may and should use clear and intelligible language. They should not use language abounding in metaphor and allegory. They should not use unusual terms. They should not draw their words and illustrations from science. They should not use mere technical language. They should not attempt to veil or cloak their meaning. They should not seek a refined and overworked style. They should use expressions which other people use; and express themselves as far as possible in the language of common life. What is preaching worth that is not understood? Why should a man talk at all unless he is intelligible? Who was ever more plain and simple in his words and illustrations than the Lord Jesus? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. such hope&#8212;of the future glory, which shall result from the ministration of the Gospel (2Co 3:8, 9).<p>plainness of speech&#8212;openness; without reserve (2Co 2:17; 4:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hope</span> here signifieth nothing but a confident, certain expectation of something that is hereafter to come to pass.

Having this confidence, and being fully persuaded that God has made us able and sufficient ministers of the Gospel, has called and qualified us for such service; and since we have such a ministry committed to us, which so much exceeds in glory the ministry of Moses, a ministry not of death and condemnation, but of the Spirit and of righteousness; not which is abolished and done away, but which does and will remain, in spite of all the opposition of hell and earth: <p>we use great plainness of speech; plain and intelligible words, not ambiguous ones: or "boldness"; we are not afraid of men nor devils; we are not terrified by menaces, stripes, imprisonment, and death itself: or "freedom of speech"; we speak out all our mind, which is the mind of Christ; we declare the whole counsel of God, hide and conceal nothing that may be profitable to the churches; we are not to be awed by the terror, or drawn by the flatteries of men to cover the truth; we speak it out plainly, clearly, with all evidence and perspicuity.

THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW COVENANT IS (<span class="ital">b</span>) OPEN, NOT VEILED, AS WAS THAT OF THE OLD. The illustration from the O.T. which is used in these verses has been obscured for English readers by the faulty rendering of the A.V. in <a href="/exodus/34-33.htm" title="And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.">Exodus 34:33</a>. It would appear from that rendering, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, “<span class="ital">till</span> Moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face,” that the object of the veil was to conceal from the people the Divine glory reflected in his face. But this is to misrepresent the original Hebrew, and is not the rendering given either by the LXX or by modern scholars. The R.V substitutes <span class="ital">when</span> for <span class="ital">till</span> in the verse just quoted, thus bringing out the point that the veil was used to conceal <span class="ital">not</span> the glory on the face of Moses, but its <span class="ital">evanescence</span>; it was fading even while he spoke, and this by his use of the veil he prevented the people from perceiving. When he “went in unto the Lord” again he took the veil off. The Apostle applies all this to the Israel of his day. Still a veil is between them and the Divine glory—a veil “upon their hearts” which prevents them from seeing the transitoriness of the Old Covenant; yet, as it was of old, if they turn to the Lord, the veil is removed, and an open vision is granted. St. Paul is fond of such allegorisings of the history of the Exodus; <span class="ital">cf., e.g.</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-2.htm" title="And were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea;">1 Corinthians 10:2</a>, <a href="/galatians/4-25.htm" title="For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.">Galatians 4:25</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>12. <span class="ital">Seeing then that we have such hope</span>] i.e. the hope that the Christian covenant is one of which the glory is permanent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we use great plainness of speech] Trist</span> (i.e. trust) Wiclif. <span class="ital">Boldness</span>, Tyndale and Cranmer. The translation <span class="ital">boldness of speech</span> we owe to the Geneva version. The word means originally (1) fulness or frankness of <span class="ital">speech</span>. Hence it comes to mean (2) openness, frankness generally, and hence (3) boldness, intrepidity. The former is the meaning here. St Paul contrasts the fulness and frankness of the Gospel on all matters relating to the future of man with the mysterious silence of the Law (i.e. the books of Moses), which hardly in the most distant manner allude to a future life. It may be remarked that even Jesus Christ himself used much reserve (<a href="/matthew/8-4.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, See you tell no man; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.">Matthew 8:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-30.htm" title="And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straightly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.">Matthew 9:30</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-16.htm" title="And charged them that they should not make him known:">Matthew 12:16</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/13-10.htm" title="And the disciples came, and said to him, Why speak you to them in parables?...">Matthew 13:10-13</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-20.htm" title="Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.">Matthew 16:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/17-9.htm" title="And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.">Matthew 17:9</a>) until His work on earth was finished.
