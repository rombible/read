Here, again, we have to read between the lines. Titus has told St. Paul what has been said of him at Corinth. Referring, probably, to what he had said in his First Epistle as to the “wisdom” which he preached (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6</a>), his having “laid the foundation” (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.">1Corinthians 3:10</a>), his dwelling on his sufferings (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-11.htm" title="Even to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place;">1Corinthians 4:11</a>), his preaching without payment (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-15.htm" title="But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.">1Corinthians 9:15</a>) as a thing he gloried in, they had sneered at him as always “commending himself.” They had added that it was no wonder that he did so when he had no authoritative letters of commendation from other churches, such as were brought by other teachers. As soon as the words “We are not as the many” had passed his lips, the thought occurs that the same will be said again. He <span class= "ital">hears</span> it said, as it were, and makes his answer.<p><span class= "bld">Need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you?</span>—We are left to conjecture who are thus referred to. Possibly some of the Apollos party had contrasted the letters which he had brought from Ephesus (<a href="/acts/18-27.htm" title="And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brothers wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:">Acts 18:27</a>) with St. Paul’s want of them. Possibly the Judaising teachers who meet us in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.">2Corinthians 11:13</a> had come with credentials of this nature from the Church of Jerusalem. The indignant tone in which St. Paul speaks indicates the latter view as the more probable. The “letters of commendation” deserve notice as an important element in the organisation of the early Church. A Christian travelling with such a letter from any Church was certain to find a welcome in any other. They guaranteed at once his soundness in the faith and his personal character, and served to give a reality to the belief in the “communion” of saints, as the necessary sequel to the recognition of a Catholic or universal Church. It is significant of the part they had played in the social victory of the Christian Church that Julian tried to introduce them into the decaying system which he sought to galvanise into an imitative life (Sozomen. <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> v. 16).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?...">2 Corinthians 3:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Do we begin again </span>— While we thus speak and avow our integrity; <span class="ital">to commend </span>— Or recommend; <span class="ital">ourselves </span>— As some insinuate we do?

As if he had said, Do I indeed want such recommendation? Nay, <span class="ital">ye are our epistle </span>— Our recommendatory letter, more convincing than any bare words could be, as being a testimonial from God himself. He means that the change which had been produced in their hearts and lives, in their dispositions, words, and actions, by his ministry, and that of his fellow-labourers, a change which could not have been effected except by the power of God, was a demonstration that God had sent them, and was present with them, giving efficacy to the word of his grace, a letter <span class="ital">written in our hearts </span>— Deeply engraven there, so that we never can forget it; <span class="ital">known and read of all men </span>— Who knew what immoral persons you once were, and observe what you are now. By speaking as the apostle does in this and the preceding verse, he intimates that his apostleship did not depend on the testimony of men, and that he could go to no church where he was not known to be an apostle of Christ, and to have been instrumental in converting many to the faith, and making them new creatures in Christ.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Even the appearance of self-praise and courting human applause, is painful to the humble and spiritual mind. Nothing is more delightful to faithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of their ministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom they labour. The law of Christ was written in their hearts, and the love of Christ shed abroad there. Nor was it written in tables of stone, as the law of God given to Moses, but on the fleshy (not fleshly, as fleshliness denotes sensuality) tables of the heart, Eze 36:26. Their hearts were humbled and softened to receive this impression, by the new-creating power of the Holy Spirit. He ascribes all the glory to God. And remember, as our whole dependence is upon the Lord, so the whole glory belongs to him alone. The letter killeth: the letter of the law is the ministration of death; and if we rest only in the letter of the gospel, we shall not be the better for so doing: but the Holy Spirit gives life spiritual, and life eternal. The Old Testament dispensation was the ministration of death, but the New Testament of life. The law made known sin, and the wrath and curse of God; it showed us a God above us, and a God against us; but the gospel makes known grace, and Emmanuel, God with us. Therein the righteousness of God by faith is revealed; and this shows us that the just shall live by his faith; this makes known the grace and mercy of God through Jesus Christ, for obtaining the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. The gospel so much exceeds the law in glory, that it eclipses the glory of the legal dispensation. But even the New Testament will be a killing letter, if shown as a mere system or form, and without dependence on God the Holy Spirit, to give it a quickening power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Do we begin again - This is designed evidently to meet an objection. He had been speaking of his triumph in the ministry <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>, and of his sincerity and honesty, as contrasted with the conduct of many who corrupted the Word of God, <a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>. It might be objected that he was magnifying himself in these statements, and designed to commend himself in this manner to the Corinthians. To this he replies in the following verses.<p>To commend ourselves? - To recommend ourselves; do we speak this in our own praise, in order to obtain your favor.<p>Or need we, as some others - Probably some who had brought letters of recommendation to them from Judea. The false teachers at Corinth had been originally introduced there by commendatory letters from abroad. These were letters of introduction, and were common among the Greeks, the Romans, and the Jews, as they are now. They were usually given to persons who were about to travel, as there were no inns. and as travelers were dependent on the hospitality of those among whom they traveled.<p>Of commendation from you - To other congregations. It is implied here by Paul, that he sought no such letter; that he traveled without them; and that he depended on his zeal, and self-denial, and success to make him known, and to give him the affections of those to whom he ministered - a much better recommendation than mere introductory letters. Such letters were, however, sometimes given by Christians, and are by no means improper, <a href="/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a>. Yet, they do not appear to have been sought or used by the apostles generally. They depended on their miraculous endowments, and on the attending grace of God to make them known. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>2Co 3:1-18. The Sole Commendation He Needs to Prove God's Sanction of His Ministry He Has in His Corinthian Converts: His Ministry Excels the Mosaic, as the Gospel of Life and Liberty Excels the Law of Condemnation.<p>1.

(Compare 2Co 10:18). The "some" refers to particular persons of the "many" (2Co 2:17) teachers who opposed him, and who came to Corinth with letters of recommendation from other churches; and when leaving that city obtained similar letters from the Corinthians to other churches. The thirteenth canon of the Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451) ordained that "clergymen coming to a city where they were unknown, should not be allowed to officiate without letters commendatory from their own bishop." The history (Ac 18:27) confirms the existence of the custom here alluded to in the Epistle: "When Apollos was disposed to pass into Achaia [Corinth], the brethren [of Ephesus] wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him." This was about two years before the Epistle,and is probably one of the instances to which Paul refers, as many at Corinth boasted of their being followers of Apollos (1Co 1:12).<span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?...">2 Corinthians 3:1-3</a></span> To obviate the imputation of vain glory, Paul showeth<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>that the gifts and graces of the Corinthians were a<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>sufficient commendation of his ministry,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/3-4.htm" title="And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:">2 Corinthians 3:4</a>,5</span> the efficacy of which he ascribeth entirely to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life....">2 Corinthians 3:6-11</a></span> He proveth the superior excellency of the gospel<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>ministry to that of the law,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/3-12.htm" title="Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:...">2 Corinthians 3:12-18</a></span> and thereupon justifieth his plain speaking, as under<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>a dispensation of greater light and liberty than that<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>of Moses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The apostle, in the former Epistle, had spoken much in the vindication of himself and of his office; he seeth reason to return again to something of the like discourse, being provoked by the many imputations which the false apostles and teachers, in this church, had laid upon him: therefore he saith: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Do we begin again?</span> Or else these words may have a special reference to the last verse of the former chapter; where he had commended himself, as being none of those who corrupted the word of God, but had preached as of God, and in the sight of God. No, (saith the apostle), though some others stand in need of commendatory letters, and are very careful to procure them, (by which <span class="ital">others</span> he very probably means the false apostles and teachers, which were Paul’s great enemies), yet I trust I need not any letters commendatory to recommend me to you, any more than letters of recommendation from you to commend me unto any other churches of Christ. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Do we begin again to commend ourselves?.... The apostle having asserted that he and his fellow ministers always triumphed in Christ, and made manifest the savour of his knowledge in every place; were a sweet savour of Christ to God, did not corrupt the word of God, as some did, but sincerely and faithfully preached Christ; some might insinuate from hence, that he was guilty of arrogance and vain glory; wherefore to remove such a charge, or prevent its being brought, he asks, "do we begin again to commend ourselves?" we do not; what we say, we say honestly, sincerely, in the simplicity of our hearts, without any view to our own glory and applause among men, or for any worldly profit and advantage, or to ingratiate ourselves into your affections; we have no such views: some read these words without an interrogation, "we do begin again to commend ourselves"; as we have done already, in this and the former epistles; and as it is but just and right that we should vindicate our characters, support our good name and reputation, and secure and maintain our credit, which some would maliciously deprive us of: <p>though we have no need, as some others, of epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you; our persons, characters, and usefulness are too well known, to require commendatory letters front others to you, or from you to others. The false apostles are here struck at, whose practice it was to get letters of commendation from place to place; which they carried about and made use of for their temporal advantage, having nothing truly good and excellent in them to recommend them to others. The apostle does not hereby condemn letters of recommendation, which in proper cases may be very lawfully given, and a good use be made of them; only that he and other Gospel ministers were so well known, as to stand in no need of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀρχόμεθα</span>] namely, through what was said in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>, regarding which Paul foresaw that his opponents would describe it as the beginning of another recommendation of himself.

He anticipates the malignant and meaning smiles with which they would hear such words. The word "again" implies that this charge had already been brought against him, perhaps in consequence of such passages as <a href="/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-11.htm">1 Corinthians 4:11-14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15-23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-18.htm">1 Corinthians 14:18</a>, etc. Such passages might be called self-laudatory and egotistical, were it not that (as St. Paul here explains) they arose only from a sense of the grandeur of his office, of which he was the almost involuntary agent, used by God as it seemed best to him. Hence he says later on (<a href="/2_corinthians/7.htm">2 Corinthians 7</a>:18) that self-praise is no commendation, and that the true test of a man is God's commendation. The verb "I commend," technically used in the same sense as our "commendatory letters," occurs also in <a href="/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Or need we,</span> etc.? The reading, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, thus translated, is better supported than <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, unless, which would have a somewhat ironical force. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> in the reading <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> implies, "Can you possibly think that we need," etc.? Generally, when a stranger came to some Church to which he was not personally known, he carried with him some credentials in the form of letters from accredited authorities. St. Paul treats it as absurd to suppose that he or Timothy should need such letters, either <span class="accented">from</span> the Corinthians or to them. <span class="cmt_word">As some</span>. He will not name them, but he refers to the Judaists, who vaunted of their credentials in order to disparage St. Paul, who was too great to need and too independent to use them. We can hardly, perhaps, realize the depth and bitterness of antagonism concealed under that word "some" in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-18.htm">1 Corinthians 4:18</a> <a href="/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>. It is not meant that there was anything discreditable in using such letters (for Apollos had used them, <a href="/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a>), but the disgraceful thing was that St. Paul should be disparaged for not bringing them. <span class="cmt_word">Epistles of commendation.</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x28;</span> "introductory letters" - was familiar in later Greek. In days when there were few public hostels, and when it was both a duty and a necessity for small and persecuted communities like those of the Jews and Christians to practise hospitality (<a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>. etc.), it was customary both for synagogues and Churches to provide their friends and emissaries with authentic testimonials. Otherwise they might have been deceived by wandering impostors, as, in fact, the Christians were deceived by the vagabond quack Peregrinus. We can easily see how the custom of using such letters might be abused by idle, restless, and intriguing persons, who have never found it very difficult to procure them. We find traces of their <span class="accented">honest</span> use by Phoebe, by Silas and Jude, by Apollos, by Mark, and by Zenas, in <a href="/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>; <a href="/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a>; <a href="/acts/15-25.htm">Acts 15:25</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>; and of their unfair use by certain Judaists, in <a href="/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a> and Galatians 2:12. Nothing can more forcibly illustrate the necessity for St. Paul's protest against the idle vaunt of possessing such letters, than the fact that, <span class="accented">more than a century afterwards</span>, we find malignant innuendoes aimed at St. Paul in the pseudo-Clementines, under the name of" the enemy" and "Simon Magus" and "a deceiver." He is there spoken of as using letters from the high priest (which, indeed, St. Paul had done as Saul of Tarsus, <a href="/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1, 2</a>); and the Churches are warned never to receive any one who cannot bring credentials from James; so deep-rooted among the Judaists was the antagonism to the independent apostolate and daring originality of the apostle of the Gentiles! Dr. Plumptre quotes Sozomen ('H.E.', 5:16) for the curious fact that the Emperor Julian tried to introduce the system of "commendatory letters" into his revived paganism. <span class="cmt_word">Or letters of commendation from you.</span> The substitution of "letters" for "epistles" is an instance of the almost childish fondness for unnecessary synonyms, which is one of the defects of the Authorized Version. The true reading probably is "to you or from you" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C). The word "commendatory" (<span class="accented">sustatikon</span>) is omitted in A, B, C. <span class="accented">Or from you</span>. It was worse than absurd to suppose that St. Paul should need those <span class="accented">literae formatae</span> to a Church of which he was the thunder; and nothing but the boundless "inflation" which characterized the Corinthians could have led them to imagine that he needed letters <span class="accented">from</span> them to other Churches, as though, forsooth, they were the primary Church or the only church (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-36.htm">1 Corinthians 14:36</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Do we begin again<p>Rev., are we beginning. As if anticipating, the taunt so often repeated, that he had no commendatory letters, and therefore was forced to commend himself by self-laudation and by dishonest means.
