We apply the term “Lord,” it is true, as a predicate of the Holy Spirit when we speak, as in the Nicene Creed, of the Holy Ghost as “the Lord, and Giver of life,” or say, as in the pseudo-Athanasian, that “the Holy Ghost is Lord;” but using the term “the Lord” as the subject of a sentence, those who have been trained in the theology of those creeds would hardly say, “The Lord” (the term commonly applied to the Father in the Old Testament, and to the Son in the New) “is the Spirit.” We have, accordingly, to remember that St. Paul did not contemplate the precise language of these later formularies. He had spoken, in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.">2Corinthians 3:16</a>, of Israel’s “turning to the Lord;” he had spoken also of his own work as “the ministration of the Spirit” (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-8.htm" title="How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?">2Corinthians 3:8</a>). To turn to the Lord—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to the Lord Jesus—was to turn to Him whose essential being, as one with the Father, was Spirit (<a href="/john/4-24.htm" title="God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.">John 4:24</a>), who was in one sense, <span class= "ital">the</span> Spirit, the life-giving energy, as contrasted with the letter that killeth. So we may note that the attribute of “quickening,” which is here specially connected with the name of the Spirit (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2Corinthians 3:6</a>), is in <a href="/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21</a> connected also with the names of the Father and the Son. The thoughts of the Apostle move in a region in which the Lord Jesus, not less than the Holy Ghost, is contemplated as Spirit. This gives, it is believed, the true sequence of St. Paul’s thoughts. The whole verse may be considered as parenthetical, explaining that the “turning to the Lord” coincides with the “ministration of the Spirit.” Another interpretation, inverting the terms, and taking the sentence as “the Spirit is the Lord,” is tenable grammatically, and was probably adopted by the framers of the expanded form of the Nicene Creed at the Council of Constantinople (A.D. 380). It is obvious, however, that the difficulty of tracing the sequence of thought becomes much greater on this method of interpretation.<p><span class= "bld">Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</span>—The Apostle returns to the more familiar language. To turn to the Lord, who is Spirit, is to turn to <span class= "ital">the</span> Spirit which is His, which dwelt in Him, and which He gives. And he assumes, almost as an axiom of the spiritual life, that the presence of that Spirit gives freedom, as contrasted with the bondage of the letter—freedom from slavish fear, freedom from the guilt and burden of sin, freedom from the tyranny of the Law. Compare the aspect of the same thought in the two Epistles nearly contemporary with this:—the Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God, those children being partakers of a glorious liberty (<a href="/context/romans/8-16.htm" title="The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:">Romans 8:16-21</a>); the connection between walking in the Spirit and being called to liberty (<a href="/context/galatians/5-13.htm" title="For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.">Galatians 5:13-16</a>). The underlying sequence of thought would seem to be something like this: “Israel, after all, with all its seeming greatness and high prerogatives, was in bondage, because it had the letter, not the Spirit; we who have the Spirit can claim our citizenship in the Jerusalem which is above and which is free” (<a href="/context/galatians/4-24.htm" title="Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which engenders to bondage, which is Agar.">Galatians 4:24-31</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty....">2 Corinthians 3:17-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now the Lord </span>Christ <span class="ital">is that Spirit </span>— Of the law of which I spake before, to whom the letter of it was intended to lead; and it is the office of the Spirit of God, as the great agent in his kingdom, to direct the minds of men to it. <span class="ital">And where the Spirit of the Lord is </span>— Enlightening and renewing men’s minds; <span class="ital">there is liberty </span>— Not the veil, the emblem of slavery.

Only by those from whose faces the veil of ignorance, prejudice, and unbelief is removed; so that <span class="ital">with open, </span><span class="greekheb">ανεκεκαλυμμενω</span>, <span class="ital">with unveiled face, </span>and with the eyes of their understanding opened, they behold, view attentively, and contemplate this <span class="ital">glory of the Lord.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, observe the effect produced on those who behold this glory; they <span class="ital">are changed into the same image. </span>While we steadfastly and with open face behold the divine likeness exhibited in these glasses, we discern its amiableness and excellence, and the necessity of a conformity thereto, in order to our happiness here and hereafter. And hence arises sincere and earnest desire after that conformity, and an endeavour to imitate such perfections as are imitable by us. Add to this, the very beholding and meditating on the divine glories, has a transforming efficacy. For instance, by contemplating his wisdom, as manifested in his works and word, we are enlightened and made wise: by viewing his power, and by faith arming ourselves with it, we become strong; able to withstand our enemies, as also to do and suffer his will. The contemplation of his truth, justice, mercy, and holiness, inspires us with the same amiable and happy qualities, and knowing and believing the love that he hath to us, and all his people, we learn to <span class="ital">love him who hath first loved us; </span>and <span class="ital">loving him that beget, </span>we are disposed and enabled also to <span class="ital">love all that are begotten of him; </span>and even all mankind, if not with a love of approbation and complacency, yet with a love of benevolence and beneficence, knowing that he is <span class="ital">the Father of the spirits of all flesh, </span>and that the whole race of Adam <span class="ital">are his offspring. </span>Thus we become godlike, and <span class="ital">put on the new man, which is renewed in </span>and by this spiritual <span class="ital">knowledge, after the image of him that</span> <span class="ital">created him, </span><a href="/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a>.

But it implies also, 3d, from grace, (which is glory in the bud,) to glory in heaven, which is the ripe fruit. It is of importance to notice likewise the grand agent in this work, namely, <span class="ital">the Spirit of the Lord. </span>1st, He hath prepared these glasses, particularly the two last mentioned, the Holy Scriptures, indited by his inspiration, and the human nature of Christ, formed by his agency in the womb of the virgin. And he causes the glory of the Lord to be reflected from them. 2d, He rends the veil from our minds, and opens the eyes of our understanding, that we may be enabled to behold the divine glory in these glasses. 3d, He causes the sight to be transforming, communicating his own renewing and sanctifying influences, and thereby imparting his likeness and nature. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-18 It is the duty of the ministers of the gospel to use great plainness, or clearness, of speech. The Old Testament believers had only cloudy and passing glimpses of that glorious Saviour, and unbelievers looked no further than to the outward institution. But the great precepts of the gospel, believe, love, obey, are truths stated as clearly as possible. And the whole doctrine of Christ crucified, is made as plain as human language can make it. Those who lived under the law, had a veil upon their hearts. This veil is taken away by the doctrines of the Bible about Christ. When any person is converted to God, then the veil of ignorance is taken away. The condition of those who enjoy and believe the gospel is happy, for the heart is set at liberty to run the ways of God's commandments. They have light, and with open face they behold the glory of the Lord. Christians should prize and improve these privileges. We should not rest contented without knowing the transforming power of the gospel, by the working of the Spirit, bringing us to seek to be like the temper and tendency of the glorious gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and into union with Him. We behold Christ, as in the glass of his word; and as the reflection from a mirror causes the face to shine, the faces of Christians shine also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now the Lord is that Spirit - The word "Lord" here evidently refers to the Lord Jesus; see <a href="/2_corinthians/3-16.htm">2 Corinthians 3:16</a>. It may be observed in general in regard to this word, that where it occurs in the New Testament unless the connection require us to understand it of God, it refers to the Lord Jesus. It was the common name by which he was known; see <a href="/john/20-13.htm">John 20:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>, <a href="/john/21-12.htm">John 21:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>, <a href="/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5</a>. The design of Paul in this verse seems to be to account for the "liberty" which he and the other apostles had, or for the boldness, openness, and plainness <a href="/2_corinthians/3-12.htm">2 Corinthians 3:12</a> which they evinced in contradistinction from the Jews. who so little understood the nature of their institutions. He had said <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>, that he was a minister "not of the letter, but of the Spirit;" and he had stated that the Old Testament was not understood by the Jews who adhered to the literal interpretation of the Scriptures. He here says, that the Lord Jesus was "the Spirit" to which he referred, and by which he was enabled to understand the Old Testament so as to speak plainly, and without obscurity. The sense is, that Christ was the Spirit; that is, the sum, the substance of the Old Testament. The figures, types, prophecies, etc. all centered in him, and he was the end of all those institutions. If contemplated as having reference to him, it was easy to understand them. This I take to be the sentiment of the pas sage, though expositors have been greatly divided in regard to its meaning. Thus explained, it does not mean absolutely and abstractly that the Lord Jesus was "a Spirit," but that he was the sum, the essence, the end, and the purport of the Mosaic rites, the spirit of which Paul had spoken in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>, as contradistinguished from the letter of the Law.<p>And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty - This is a general truth designed to illustrate the particular sentiment which he had just advanced. The word "liberty" here (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  eleutheria) refers, I think, to freedom in speaking; the power of speaking openly, and freely, as in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-12.htm">2 Corinthians 3:12</a>. It states the general truth, that the effect of the Spirit of God was to give light and clearness of view; to remove obscurity from a subject, and to enable one to see it plainly. This would be a truth that could not be denied by the Jews, who held to the doctrine that the Spirit of God revealed truth, and it must be admitted by all. Under the influence of that Spirit, therefore, Paul says, that he was able to speak with openness, and boldness; that he had a clear view of truth, which the mass of the Jews had not; and that the system of religion which he preached was open, plain, and clear. The word "freedom," would perhaps, better convey the idea. "There is freedom from the dark and obscure views of the Jews; freedom from their prejudices, and their superstitions; freedom from the slavery and bondage of sin; the freedom of the children of God, who have clear views of him as their Father and Redeemer and who are enabled to express those views openly and boldly to the world." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. the Lord&#8212;Christ (2Co 3:14, 16; 2Co 4:5).<p>is that Spirit&#8212;is THE Spirit, namely, that Spirit spoken of in 2Co 3:6, and here resumed after the parenthesis (2Co 3:7-16): Christ is the Spirit and "end" of the Old Testament, who giveth life to it, whereas "the letter killeth" (1Co 15:45; Re 19:10, end).<p>where the Spirit of the Lord is&#8212;in a man's "heart" (2Co 3:15; Ro 8:9, 10).<p>there is liberty&#8212;(Joh 8:36).

They are free to serve God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus (Php 3:3): they have no longer the spirit of bondage, but of free sonship (Ro 8:15; Ga 4:7). "Liberty" is opposed to the letter (of the legal ordinances), and to the veil, the badge of slavery: also to the fear which the Israelites felt in beholding Moses' glory unveiled (Ex 34:30; 1Jo 4:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Lord Christ was a man, but not a mere man; but one who had the Divine nature personally united to his human nature, which is called the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Spirit, <a href="/mark/2-8.htm" title="And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said to them, Why reason you these things in your hearts?">Mark 2:8</a></span>.

That this was meant not of <span class="ital">hypostatical</span> identity, but according to the dynamical <span class="ital">oeconomic</span> point of view, that the fellowship of Christ, into which we enter through conversion, is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, was obvious of itself to the believing consciousness of the readers, and is also put beyond doubt by the following <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα κυρίου</span>. And Christ is the Spirit <span class="ital">in so far as at conversion, and generally in the whole arrangements of salvation, He communicates Himself in the Holy Spirit, and this Spirit is His Spirit, the living principle of the influence and indwelling of Christ</span>,—certainly the <span class="ital">living ground of life</span> in the church, and the <span class="ital">spirit of its life</span> (Hofmann), but as such just the <span class="ital">Holy</span> Spirit, in whom the Lord reveals Himself as present and savingly active.

As respects His <span class="ital">immanence</span>, therefore, in His people, Christ is the Spirit. Comp. also Krummel, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 97, who rightly remarks that, if Christ calls Himself the light, the way, the truth, etc., all this is included in the proposition: “the Lord is the Spirit.” Fritzsche, <span class="ital">Dissert.</span> I. p. 42, takes it: <span class="ital">Dominus est ita Sp. St. perfusus, ut totus quasi</span> <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span> <span class="ital">sit</span>. So also Rückert, who nevertheless (following Erasmus and Beza) believes it necessary to explain the article before <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> by retrospective reference to <a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-8.htm" title="How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?">2 Corinthians 3:8</a>.[178] But in that case the whole expression would be reduced to a mere <span class="ital">quasi</span>, with which the further inference <span class="greekheb">οὗ δὲ τὸ πνεῦμα κυρίου</span> would not be logically in accord; besides, according to analogy of Scripture elsewhere, it cannot be said of the <span class="ital">exalted</span> Christ (and yet <span class="ital">it is He</span> that is meant), “<span class="ital">Spiritu sancto perfusus est</span>,” or “<span class="ital">Spiritu gaudet divino</span>,” an expression which can only belong to Christ in His earthly state (<a href="/luke/1-35.htm" title="And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come on you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God.">Luke 1:35</a>; <a href="/mark/1-10.htm" title="And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending on him:">Mark 1:10</a>; <a href="/acts/1-2.htm" title="Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen:">Acts 1:2</a>; <a href="/acts/10-38.htm" title="How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.">Acts 10:38</a>); whereas the glorified Christ is the sender of the Spirit, the possessor and disposer (comp. also <a href="/revelation/3-1.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things said he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.">Revelation 3:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-5.htm" title="And out of the throne proceeded lightning and thunder and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.">Revelation 4:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>), and therewith <span class="ital">Lord</span> of the Spirit, <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>. The weakened interpretation: “Christ, however, <span class="ital">imparts the Spirit</span>” (Piscator, L. Cappellus, Scultetus, and others, including Emmerling and Fiatt), is at variance with the words, and is not to be supported by passages like <a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>, since in these the predicates are not concretes but abstracts. In keeping with the view and the expression in the present passage are those Johannine passages in which Christ promises the communication of the Spirit to the disciples as His own return (<a href="/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.">John 14:18</a>, <span class="ital">al.</span>). Others have departed from the simple sense of the words “Christ is the Spirit,” <span class="ital">either</span> by importing into <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span> another meaning than that of the Holy Spirit, <span class="ital">or</span> by not taking <span class="greekheb">ὁ κύριος</span> to signify the personal Christ. The <span class="ital">former</span> course is inadmissible, partly on account of the following <span class="greekheb">οὗ δὲ τὸ πνεῦμα κυρίον</span>, partly because the absolute <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span> admits of no other meaning whatever than the habitual one; the <span class="ital">latter</span> is made impossible by <a href="/2_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.">2 Corinthians 3:16</a>. Among those adhering to the <span class="ital">former</span> view are Morus: “Quum Dominum dico, intelligo illam divinitus datam religionis scientiam;” Erasmus and Calvin: “that <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span> is the spirit <span class="ital">of the law</span>, which only becomes <span class="ital">viva et vivifica, si a Christo inspiretur</span>, whereby the spirit comes to the body;” also Olshausen: “the Lord now is just the Spirit, of which there was mention above” (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>); by this is to be understood the spiritual institute, the economy of the Spirit; Christ, namely, fills His church with Himself; hence it is itself Christ. Comp. Ewald, according to whom Christ is designated, in contrast to the letter and compulsion of law, as the Spirit absolutely (just as God is, <a href="/john/4-24.htm" title="God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.">John 4:24</a>). Similarly Neander. To this class belongs also the interpretation of Baur, which, in spite of the article in <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῖμα</span>, amounts to this, that Christ in His substantial existence is <span class="ital">spirit</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">an immaterial substance composed of light</span>;[179] comp. his <span class="ital">neut. Theol.</span> p. 18 7 f. See, on the contrary, Räbiger, <span class="ital">Christol. Paul.</span> p. 36 f.; Krummel, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 79 ff. Among the adherents of the <span class="ital">second</span> mode of interpretation are Vorstius, Mosheim, Bolten: “<span class="greekheb">ὁ κύριος</span> is the <span class="ital">doctrine of Jesus</span>;” also Billroth, who recognises as its meaning: “in the kingdom of the Lord the Spirit rules; the essence of Christianity is the Spirit of the Lord, which He confers on His own.” For many other erroneous interpretations (among which is included that of Estius, Calovius, and others, who refer <span class="greekheb">ὁ κύριος</span> to God, and so explain the words of the <span class="ital">divinity of the Holy Spirit</span>), see Pole and Wol.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐλευθερία</span>] spiritual <span class="ital">freedom in general</span>, without special limitation.[180] To have a veil on the heart (see <a href="/2_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart.">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>), and to be spiritually free, are <span class="ital">opposite</span>; hence the statement <span class="greekheb">περιαιρεῖται τὸ κάλυμμα</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.">2 Corinthians 3:16</a>, obtains elucidation by our <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΛΕΥΘΕΡΊΑ</span></span></span>. The veil on the heart hinders the spiritual activity, and makes it fettered; where, therefore, there is <span class="ital">freedom</span>, the veil must be away; but freedom must have its seat, <span class="ital">where the Spirit of the Lord</span> is, which Spirit carries on and governs all the thinking and willing, and removes all barriers external to its sway. That Paul has regard (Erasmus, Beza, Grotius, Bengel, Fritzsche) to the conception that the veil is an outward sign of subjection (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.">1 Corinthians 11:10</a>), is to be denied all the more, seeing that here what is spoken of is not a covering of the <span class="ital">head</span> (which would be the sign of a foreign <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span>), as 1 Cor. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, but a veiling of the <span class="ital">heart</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart.">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[175] Bengel aptly says: “Particula <span class="ital">autem</span> ostendit, hoc versn declarari praecedentem. Conversio fit ad Dominum ut spiritual.” Theodoret rightly furnishes the definition of the <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> as making the transition to an explanation by the intermediate question: <span class="greekheb">τίς δὲ οὗτος πρὸς ὅν δεῖ ἀποβλέψαι</span>;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[176] There is implied, namely, in ver. 17 a syllogism, of which the <span class="ital">major premiss</span> is: <span class="greekheb">οὗ δὲ τὸ πνεῦμα κυρίου</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐλευθερία</span>, “where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty;” the <span class="ital">minor premiss</span> is: “this Spirit he who is converted to the Lord has, because the Lord is the Spirit;” the <span class="ital">conclusion</span>: “consequently that <span class="greekheb">κάλυμμα</span> can no longer have a place with the converted, but only freedom.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[177] For the most complete, historical, and critical conspectus of the many different interpretations of this passage, see Krummel, p. 58 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[178] Quite erroneously, since no reader could hit on this retrospective reference, and also the following <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα κυρίον</span> is said without any such reference. Paul, if he wished to express himself so as to be surely intelligible, <span class="ital">could not do otherwise than put the article</span>; for, if he had written <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ κύριος πνεῦμα ἐστι</span>, he might have given rise to quite another understanding than he wished to express, namely: <span class="ital">the Lord is spirit, a spiritual being</span>, as <a href="/john/4-24.htm" title="God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.">John 4:24</a>, <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ὁ Θεός</span>,—a possible misinterpretation, which is rejected already by Chrysostom. Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>. We may add that <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span> is to be explained simply according to hallowed usage of the Holy Spirit, not, as Lipsius (<span class="ital">Rechtfertigungsl</span>. p. 167) unreasonably presses the article, “the <span class="ital">whole full</span> <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>.” So also Ernesti, <span class="ital">Uspr. d. Sünde</span>, I. p. 222.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[179] Weiss also, <span class="ital">bibl. Theol</span>. p. 308, explains it to the effect, that Christ in His resurrection received a pneumatic body composed of light, and therefore became entirely <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>). But the article is against this also. Besides, the body of Christ in His resurrection was not yet the body of light, which it is in heaven (<a href="/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Php 3:21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[180] Grotius understands it as <span class="ital">libertas a vitiis</span>; while Rückert, de Wette, and others, after Chrysostom, make it the freedom from the law of Moses.

Biog.</span>, iii., 115<span class="ital">a.</span>—<span class="greekheb">οὖ δὲ τὸ πνεῦμα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">and where the Spirit of the Lord is</span>, there <span class="ital">is liberty; sc.</span>, in contradistinction to the servile fear of <a href="/exodus/34-30.htm" title="And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.">Exodus 34:30</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/john/8-32.htm" title="And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.">John 8:32</a>, <a href="/romans/8-15.htm" title="For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.">Romans 8:15</a>, <a href="/galatians/4-7.htm" title="Why you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.">Galatians 4:7</a>, in all of which passages the freedom of Christian service is contrasted with the bondage of the Law. The thought here is not of the freedom of the Spirit’s action (<a href="/john/3-8.htm" title="The wind blows where it wants, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.">John 3:8</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="But all these works that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.">1 Corinthians 12:11</a>), but of the freedom of access to God under the New Covenant, as exemplified in the removal of the veil, when the soul turns itself to the Divine glory. “The Spirit of the Lord” is an O.T. phrase (see reff.). We now return to the thought of <a href="/2_corinthians/3-12.htm" title="Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:">2 Corinthians 3:12</a>, the openness and boldness of the Apostolical service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>17. <span class="ital">Now the Lord is that Spirit</span>] Literally <span class="bld">the</span> <span class="ital">spirit</span>, i.e. the spirit which was to replace the letter. The sense is as follows: ‘The Lord (of whom I have just spoken—see last verse) is the spirit of which I have said (<span class="ital"><a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a></span>) that it should be substituted for the letter.’ For the Lord, even Jesus Christ, is Himself that new power—that higher inspiration—through which man finds what he ought to do written, no longer in precepts external to himself, but in his own regenerate heart. The new birth of the Spirit is but the implanting in man the humanity of Jesus Christ. ‘The last Adam was made a life-giving spirit.’ <a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>. This expression like <a href="/john/4-24.htm" title="God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.">John 4:24</a>, refers, not to the <span class="ital">person</span>, but to the <span class="ital">essential nature</span> of God, just as in <a href="/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.">John 6:63</a>, the expression is applied even to the words of God, when they communicate to man essential principles of God’s spiritual kingdom. Cf. also <a href="/john/1-13.htm" title="Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.">John 1:13</a>; <a href="/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3</a>; <a href="/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a>; <a href="/romans/8-2.htm" title="For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.">Romans 8:2</a>; <a href="/romans/8-4.htm" title="That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:4</a>. Other explanations of this most difficult passage have been given. (1) ‘The Spirit is the Lord,’ (Chrysostom); and he remarks on the order of the words in the Greek of <a href="/john/4-24.htm" title="God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.">John 4:24</a> in support of his translation. (2) ‘The Lord is identical with the Holy Spirit.’ (3) ‘The Lord with Whom Moses spoke is the Holy Spirit.’ (4) ‘The Lord is the Holy Ghost in so far as the Holy Ghost is the living principle of the indwelling of Christ.’ (5) ‘The Lord no dout is a sprete,’ Tyndale, whom Cranmer follows. It seems on the whole best to interpret the words as above. St Paul now boldly declares that the ‘spirit’ of which he has spoken is nothing less than Christ Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and where the Spirit of the Lord is</span>] Hitherto St Paul has been speaking of the <span class="ital">Divine Nature</span> of Him who transforms the heart of man. He now speaks of the <span class="ital">personal agency</span> through Whom that work is achieved. Christ does these things by His Spirit, who is also the Spirit of the Father. <a href="/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.">Romans 8:9</a>. Cf. also <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1 Peter 1:11</a>, with <a href="/context/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;...">John 14:16-17</a>; <a href="/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>; <a href="/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/2-10.htm" title="But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God....">1 Corinthians 2:10-12</a>, &c. This interpretation involves no incongruity with the rest of the passage. The Three Persons in the Blessed Trinity are one in essence, and that essence is Spirit. But the personal agency whereby God works His purpose in man’s heart is the Holy Spirit, as Scripture everywhere declares. See the passages cited above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">there is liberty</span>] Liberty not only to speak openly (<span class="ital"><a href="/2_corinthians/3-12.htm" title="Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:">2 Corinthians 3:12</a></span>), but (<span class="ital"><a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2 Corinthians 3:18</a></span>) to gaze with unveiled face upon the glory of God, and thus to learn how to fulfil the law of man’s being. This liberty is the special privilege assured to man by the Gospel.

The particle <span class="ital">but</span>, or <span class="ital">now</span>, shows that the preceding is explained by this verse. The <span class="ital">turning</span> (conversion) takes place [is made] to the Lord, as the Spirit.—<span class="greekheb">οὗ δὲ τὸ πνεῦμα Κυρίου</span>, <span class="ital">and where the Spirit of the Lord is</span>) Where Christ is, there the Spirit of Christ is; where the Spirit of Christ is, there Christ is; <a href="/context/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

To whom shall they turn? To the Lord. "But the Lord is the Spirit." The word "spirit" could not be introduced thus abruptly and vaguely; it must refer to something already said, and therefore to the last mention of the word "spirit" in ver. 3. The Lord is the Spirit, who giveth life and freedom, in antithesis to the spirit of death and legal bondage (see ver. 6; and comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>). The best comment on the verse is <a href="/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>, "For the law of the <span class="accented">spirit of life in Christ Jesus</span> hath made me free from the law of sin and death." All life and all religion had become to St. Paul a vision of all things in Christ. He has just said that the spirit giveth life, and, after the digression about the moral blindness which prevented the Jews from being emancipated from the bondage of the letter, it was quite natural for him to add, "Now the Lord <span class="accented">is</span> the Spirit to which I alluded." The connection in which the verse stands excludes a host of untenable meanings which have been attached to it. <span class="cmt_word">There is liberty.</span> The liberty of confidence (ver. 4), and of frank speech (ver. 12), and of sonship (<a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6, 7</a>), and of freedom from guilt (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>); so that the Law itself, obeyed no longer in the mere letter but also in the spirit, becomes a royal law of liberty, and not a yoke which gendereth to bondage (<a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>; <a href="/james/2-12.htm">James 2:12</a>) - a service, indeed, but one which is perfect freedom (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-21</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Now the Lord is that Spirit<p>&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; the Lord is used in <a href="/exodus/34-34.htm">Exodus 34:34</a> for Jehovah.
