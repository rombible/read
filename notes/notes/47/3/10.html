Nothing is more delightful to faithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of their ministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom they labour. The law of Christ was written in their hearts, and the love of Christ shed abroad there. Nor was it written in tables of stone, as the law of God given to Moses, but on the fleshy (not fleshly, as fleshliness denotes sensuality) tables of the heart, Eze 36:26. Their hearts were humbled and softened to receive this impression, by the new-creating power of the Holy Spirit. He ascribes all the glory to God. And remember, as our whole dependence is upon the Lord, so the whole glory belongs to him alone. The letter killeth: the letter of the law is the ministration of death; and if we rest only in the letter of the gospel, we shall not be the better for so doing: but the Holy Spirit gives life spiritual, and life eternal. The Old Testament dispensation was the ministration of death, but the New Testament of life. The law made known sin, and the wrath and curse of God; it showed us a God above us, and a God against us; but the gospel makes known grace, and Emmanuel, God with us. Therein the righteousness of God by faith is revealed; and this shows us that the just shall live by his faith; this makes known the grace and mercy of God through Jesus Christ, for obtaining the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. The gospel so much exceeds the law in glory, that it eclipses the glory of the legal dispensation. But even the New Testament will be a killing letter, if shown as a mere system or form, and without dependence on God the Holy Spirit, to give it a quickening power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For even that which was made glorious - (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  to dedoxasmenon). That was splendid, excellent, or glorious. This refers doubtless, to the laws and institutions of Moses, especially to the primary giving of the Law. Paul does not deny that it had an honor and majesty such, in some respects, as the Jews claimed for it. It was glorious in the manner in which it was given; it was glorious in the purity of the Law itself; and it was glorious, or splendid in the magnificent and imposing ritual in which the worship of God was celebrated. But all this was surpassed in the brighter glory of the gospel.<p>Had no glory - Greek: "Was not glorious, or splendid" (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  oude deoxastai. It had comparatively no glory or splendor. Its glory was all eclipsed. It was like the splendor of the moon and stars compared with the bright light of the sun.<p>By reason of the glory that excelleth - In the gospel; in the incarnation, life, sufferings, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus; in the pardon of sin; in the peace and joy of the believer; and in the glories of the heavenly world to which the gospel elevates dying men. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. For even the ministration of condemnation, the law, 2Co 3:7 (which has been glorified at Sinai in Moses' person), has now (English Version translates less fitly, "was made &#8230; had") lost its glory in this respect by reason of the surpassing glory (of the Gospel): as the light of the stars and moon fades in the presence of the sun.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The law had in it something of intrinsic glory and excellency, as it was the revelation of the will of God to and concerning his creatures; there was an inseparable glory attending it upon that account: and it was made glorious in the ministration of it; as it pleased God that the giving of it should be attended with thunder and lightning, fire and smoke, and an earthquake, and a voice like to the sound of a trumpet, as we read, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled....">Exodus 19:16-18</a></span>: this was an accidental and adventitious glory, and made that which was glorious in itself, glorious also in the eyes of the people, that saw and heard these things. But yet, saith the apostle, if we compare it with the glory of the gospel, it had comparatively no glory; so much doth that excel. For though the law was the revelation of the Divine will, as well as the gospel, yet the law was the revelation of the Divine will but as to duty, and wrath, in case of the nonperformance of that duty: but the gospel is the revelation of the Divine will, as to grace and mercy, as to remission of sin, and eternal life. And although the gospel came not into the world as the law, with thunder, and lightning, and earthquakes; yet that was ushered in by angels, foretelling the birth and office of John the Baptist, and of Christ; by the great sign of the virgin’s conceiving and bringing forth a Son; by a voice from heaven, proclaiming Christ the Father’s only begotten Son, in whom he was well pleased. But that which the apostle doth here principally intend, is the exceeding excellency of it, in regard of its further usefulness and comfortable nature. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For even that which was made glorious,.... The apostle grants that there was a glory in the law: it "was made glorious"; it was glorious in the author of it, who is God; it was of his appointing and ordaining, agreeable to his nature, and a declaration of his will; his authority was stamped upon it, and it was written by himself, which cannot be said of any other law whatever; it was glorious in its promulgation, God himself appeared in great glory at the giving of it; Christ was then present; it was ordained by angels, and by them delivered into the hands of Moses, on whose face such a glory was left as could not be steadfastly looked upon; and it was attended with thunderings, lightnings, the sound of a trumpet, &amp;c. it was glorious in the matter of it, it contained great and excellent things; the substance of it is love to God, and to our neighbour; and it was glorious in its properties, being, in its nature and substance, holy, just, good, spiritual, perfect, immutable, and eternal; but yet <p>had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. There is such an excelling glory in the Gospel, that the other is swallowed up and lost in it; it excels it in those things in which it was so glorious: in the author of it, which, though the same, yet with this difference; the law was given by God as a judge, the Gospel by him as a Father, as the Father of Christ, and of his people in him; the law is the birth of his holiness and righteousness, the Gospel of his wisdom, grace, and love; the law declares his will with respect to duty, the Gospel with respect to salvation; the authority of God is stamped on the law, but the Gospel is the image of Christ; the law was written by the finger of God, but the Gospel was hid in his heart, and came from thence: in the promulgation of it, through the long train of patriarchs and prophets, that went before it to usher it in; it was published by Christ, the Son of God himself, confirmed by the gifts and miracles of the Holy Ghost, and in it is a greater display of the glory of God; it was attended with angels too, and a voice from heaven delightful and not terrible; and there was a glory on Christ's countenance, far exceeding that of Moses's: in the matter of it; which is the love, grace, and mercy of God; the Lord Jesus Christ, in all the glories and fulness of his person and offices; salvation by him, spiritual blessings, exceeding great and precious promises; neither of which are to be observed in the law: the ordinances of it vastly exceed the legal ones; and it has greatly the advantage of it in its effects on the souls of men, when accompanied by the Spirit of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excels.">2 Corinthians 3:10</a>.

If, again, with Ewald, we take <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει</span> as “<span class="ital">in all that is Jewish</span>, apart from what is Christian,” and refer it to the then still subsisting state of the temple, synagogue, etc., how enigmatically Paul would have expressed himself, without any hint of his meaning in the context! Following Chrysostom (<span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν τῆς συγκρίσεως λόγον</span>) and Theodoret (<span class="greekheb">ἀποβλέπων εἰς τούτους</span>, namely, to the ministers of the N. T.), most commentators (including Billroth, Olshausen, Osiander, Hofmann) join it with <span class="greekheb">οὐ δεδόξ</span>., so that it would indicate the reference in which the sentence <span class="greekheb">οὐ δεδόξ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ δεδοξ</span>. holds good (see Hofmann), and consequently would have the meaning: “<span class="ital">over against the office of Moses</span>.” But how utterly superfluous, and in fact cumbrous, would this <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μερ</span>. be if so taken, especially seeing that there still follows <span class="greekheb">ἕνεκεν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπερβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δοξ</span>., which serves to throw light upon the relation asserted! How surprising would this amplification be at this very point, where the comparison is carried to the highest pitch, and the representation is so forcibly and pithily begun by the oxymoron <span class="greekheb">οὐ δεδόξ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ δεδοξ</span>.! Rückert (following Flatt) connects also with <span class="greekheb">οὐ δεδόξασται</span>, but explains it: <span class="ital">in this respect</span>, that is, <span class="ital">in so far as the first</span> <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> <span class="ital">was the</span> <span class="greekheb">διακονία τῆς κατακρίσεως</span>. At variance with the connection. For not in so far as the Mosaic <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> ministered to condemnation and death, is its splendour darkened, but in so far as its splendour is outshone by a far greater splendour,—that of the <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> of the N. T. Besides, if the assumed reference of <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει</span> were to be held correct, the <span class="greekheb">κατάκρισις</span> would necessarily be the principal element (predicate) in what precedes, not merely an attributive definition of the subject. On the whole, the following explanation, against which none but quite irrelevant objections[163] are made, seems to be the right one: <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει</span> is certainly to be connected with <span class="greekheb">οὐ δεδόξασται</span>; <span class="greekheb">τὸ δεδοξασμένον</span>, however, is not to be taken as a designation of the Mosaic <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> <span class="ital">in concreto</span>, but signifies <span class="ital">that which is glorified generally, in abstracto</span>; so that, in addition to the <span class="greekheb">οὐ δεδόξασται</span> said of it, there is also given with <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει</span> the reference to the particular concrete thing of which the apostle is speaking, the reference to the ministry of Moses, namely, thus: “<span class="ital">for in this respect, i.e.</span> in respect of the relation of glory in which the Mosaic <span class="greekheb">δισκονία</span> stands to the Christian (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-9.htm" title="For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.">2 Corinthians 3:9</a>), <span class="ital">it is even the case that what is glorified is unglorified</span>.” Analogously, the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> of the moon, for instance, is no <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>, when the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> of the sun beams forth (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm" title="And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἕνεκεν τῆς ὑπερβαλλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόξης</span>] <span class="ital">by reason of</span> (Stallbaum, <span class="ital">ad Plat. Rep.</span> p. 329 B) <span class="ital">the superabundant glory</span>, which obscures the <span class="greekheb">δεδοξασμένον</span>, exhibits its <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> as relatively no <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>. This applies to the future glory of the N. T. <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span>, setting in at the <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν μέλλων</span>, but already conceived as present.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[163] The objection made by Osiander is a dilemma logically incorrect. Hofmann urges that <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει</span> cannot mean: <span class="ital">in this case</span>. But it is not at all alleged to have that meaning, but rather: <span class="ital">in this point</span>, i. e. <span class="ital">hoc respectu</span>, in the relation under discussion.

Other explanations of the passage have been given, but Bp. Wordsworth, who places this passage and the LXX. of Exodus 34 in parallel columns, shews how St Paul throughout this chapter is using the very words of the LXX., which must therefore be the index to his meaning. He paraphrases thus: “that was <span class="ital">glorified</span>, but glorious as it was, it was not glorified in one respect—that is, it was not glorified relatively to and in comparison with the <span class="ital">Evangelical</span> Ministry, which far transcends its glory, and absorbs it.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excels.">2 Corinthians 3:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐδὲ δεδόξασται</span>, <span class="ital">was not even glorified</span> [<span class="ital">had no glory</span>]) The limitation immediately follows, <span class="ital">in this respect</span>.

He proceeds to show that the latter ministration was far more superabundant in glory. <span class="cmt_word">That which was made glorious,</span> etc. Many various interpretations have been offered of this text. The meaning almost undoubtedly is, "For even that which has been glorified [namely, the Mosaic ministry, as typified by the splendour of his face] has not been glorified in this respect [i.e. in the respect of its relation to <span class="accented">another</span> ministry], because of the surpassing glory [of the latter]." In other words, the glory of Mosaism is so completely outdazzled by the splendour of the gospel, that, relatively speaking, it has no glory left; the moon and the stars cease to shine, they "pale their ineffectual fires" when the sun is in the zenith. The phrase, "in this respect," occurs again in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-3.htm">2 Corinthians 9:3</a> and <a href="/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>That which was made glorious had no glory in this respect (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious. The peculiar form of expression is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-35.htm">Exodus 34:35</a>, Sept., "Moses knew not that the appearance of the skin of his face was glorified." "The children of Israel saw the face of Moses that it was glorified." Much unnecessary difficulty has been made, chiefly about the connection and meaning of in this respect. That which hath been made glorious is the ministry of death and condemnation (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/3-9.htm">2 Corinthians 3:9</a>), the ministry of Moses in the giving of the law, which ministry was temporarily glorified in the shining of Moses' face. Hath not been made glorious is only another way of expressing was passing away (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>): of saying that the temporary glory of Moses' ministry faded and paled before the glory of the ministry of Christ. The figure which pervades the whole passage (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7-11</a>) is that of a glorified face. The ministration of the law, impersonated in Moses, is described as having its face glorified. It is to this that in this respect refers. Paul says that the ministry of the law, which was temporarily glorified in the face of Moses, is no longer glorified in this respect; that is, it no longer appears with glorified face, because of the glory that excelleth, the glory of Christ ministering the Gospel, before which it fades away and is as if it had not been. This accords with ch. 4, where the theme is the same as here, ministry or ministration (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1</a>); and where the christian revelation is described as "the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>). This is the key to our passage. To the same purpose is <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>, where the Christian is represented as gazing, through the Gospel, with unveiled face, upon the glory of God in Christ, and as being changed thereby into the image of Christ. The glory of the law in the face of Moses has faded before the glory of the Gospel in the face of Jesus Christ. </body></html>
