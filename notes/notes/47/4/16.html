The “outward man,” the material framework of the body, is undergoing a gradual process of decay, but the “inward man,” the higher spiritual life, is “day by day” passing through successive stages of renewal, gaining fresh energies. This verb also, and its derivative “renewal,” are specially characteristic of St. Paul. (Comp. <a href="/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>.) The verb in <a href="/ephesians/4-23.htm" title="And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;">Ephesians 4:23</a>, though not the same, is equivalent in meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day....">2 Corinthians 4:16-17</a></span>. <span class="ital">For which cause </span>— Because of which abounding grace that supports us; <span class="ital">we faint not </span>— Under any of our present pressures; <span class="ital">but though our outward man </span>— The body; <span class="ital">perish </span>— Be worn out and brought to dust prematurely, by our continual labours and sufferings; our <span class="ital">inward man </span>— The soul; <span class="ital">is renewed day by day </span>— After the divine nature and likeness, receiving fresh degrees of spiritual strength, purity, and consolation, in proportion as the body grows weaker, and we feel our dissolution approaching. And it is reasonable that this should be the case; <span class="ital">for our light affliction </span>— <span class="greekheb">Το παραυτικα ελαφρον της θλιψεως</span>, <span class="ital">momentary lightness, </span>or <span class="ital">light thing </span>(as Macknight renders it) <span class="ital">of our affliction; worketh, </span>or rather <span class="ital">worketh out, for us a far more exceeding weight of glory </span>— That is, a weight of glory far exceeding the affliction, both in degree and duration: or, far greater than we could have received if we had not passed through the affliction. For the affliction, by correcting our faults, exercising and thereby increasing our graces, and purging us as gold and silver are purified in the furnace, increases our holiness and conformity to God, and thereby prepares us for a greater degree of future felicity than could otherwise have been assigned us; God also as certainly rewarding his people hereafter for their sufferings patiently endured, as for their labours diligently and cheerfully accomplished. “The Hebrew word,” as Macknight justly observes, “answering to <span class="ital">glory, </span>signifies both <span class="ital">weight </span>and <span class="ital">glory. </span>Here the apostle joins the two significations in one phrase; and describing the happiness of the righteous, calls it not <span class="ital">glory </span>simply, but <span class="ital">a weight of glory, </span>in opposition to <span class="ital">the light thing of our affliction; </span>and <span class="ital">an eternal weight of glory, </span>in opposition to <span class="ital">the momentary duration of our affliction: </span>and <span class="ital">a more exceeding eternal weight of glory, </span>as beyond comparison greater than all the dazzling glories of riches, fame, power, pleasure, or any thing which can be possessed in the present life. And after all it is a glory not yet to be revealed; it is not yet fully known.” But, as Blackwell (<span class="ital">Sacred Classics, </span>vol. 1. p. 332) well expresses it, “This is one of the most emphatic passages in all St. Paul’s writings, in which he speaks as much like an orator, as he does as an apostle. The lightness of the trial is expressed by <span class="greekheb">το ελαφρον της θλιψεως</span>, <span class="ital">the lightness of our affliction, which is but for a moment; </span>as if he had said, It is even levity itself in such a comparison. On the other hand, the <span class="greekheb">καθ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">υπερβολην εις υπερβολην</span>, which we render <span class="ital">far more exceeding, </span>is infinitely emphatical, and cannot be fully expressed by any translation. It signifies that all hyperboles fall short of describing that weighty, eternal glory, so solid, so lasting, that you may pass from hyperbole to hyperbole, and yet when you have gained the last, you are infinitely below it.” Indeed, as another eminent writer observes, the beauty and sublimity of St. Paul’s expressions here, as descriptive of heavenly glory, opposed to temporal afflictions, surpass all imagination, and cannot be preserved in any translation or paraphrase, which after all must sink far, very far below the astonishing original.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 The grace of faith is an effectual remedy against fainting in times of trouble. They knew that Christ was raised, and that his resurrection was an earnest and assurance of theirs. The hope of this resurrection will encourage in a suffering day, and set us above the fear of death. Also, their sufferings were for the advantage of the church, and to God's glory. The sufferings of Christ's ministers, as well as their preaching and conversation, are for the good of the church and the glory of God. The prospect of eternal life and happiness was their support and comfort. What sense was ready to pronounce heavy and long, grievous and tedious, faith perceived to be light and short, and but for a moment. The weight of all temporal afflictions was lightness itself, while the glory to come was a substance, weighty, and lasting beyond description. If the apostle could call his heavy and long-continued trials light, and but for a moment, what must our trifling difficulties be! Faith enables to make this right judgment of things. There are unseen things, as well as things that are seen. And there is this vast difference between them; unseen things are eternal, seen things but temporal, or temporary only. Let us then look off from the things which are seen; let us cease to seek for worldly advantages, or to fear present distresses. Let us give diligence to make our future happiness sure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For which cause - With such an object in view, and sustained by such elevated purposes and desires. The sense is, that the purpose of trying to save as many as possible would make toil easy, privations welcome, and would be so accompanied by the grace of God, as to gird the soul with strength, and fill it with abundant consolations.<p>We faint not - For an explanation of the word used here, see the note on <a href="/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1</a>. We are not exhausted, desponding, or disheartened. We are sustained, encouraged, emboldened by having such an object in view.<p>But though our outward man perish - By outward man, Paul evidently means the body. By using the phrases, "the outward man," and the "inward man," he shows that he believed that man was made up of two parts, body and soul. He was no materialist. He has described two parts as constituting man, so distinct: that while the one perishes, the other is renewed; while the one is enfeebled, the other is strengthened; while the one grows old and decays, the other renews its youth and is invigorated. Of course, the soul is not dependent on the body for its vigor and strength, since it expands while the body decays; and of course the soul may exist independently of the body, and in a separate state.<p>Perish - Grows old; becomes weak and feeble; loses its vigor and elasticity under the many trials which we endure, and under the infirmities of advancing years. It is a characteristic of the "outer man," that it thus perishes. Great as may be its vigor, yet it must decay and die. It cannot long bear up under the trials of life, and the wear and tear of constant action, but must soon sink to the grave.<p>Yet the inward man - The soul; the undecaying, the immortal part.<p>Is renewed - Is renovated, strengthened, invigorated. His powers of mind expanded; his courage became bolder; he had clearer views of truth; he had more faith in God. As he drew nearer to the grave and to heaven, his soul was more raised above the world, and he was more filled with the joys and triumphs of the gospel. The understanding and the heart did not sympathize with the suffering and decaying body; but, while that became feeble, the soul acquired new strength, and was fitting for its flight to the eternal world. This verse is an ample refutation of the doctrine of the materialist, and proves that there is in man something that is distinct from decaying and dying matter, and that there is a principle which may gain augmented strength and power, while the body dies; compare note, <a href="/romans/7-22.htm">Romans 7:22</a>.<p>Day by day - Constantly. There was a daily and constant increase of inward vigor. God imparted to him constant strength in his trials, and sustained him with the hopes of heaven, as the body was decaying, and tending to the grave. The sentiment of this verse is, that in an effort to do good, and to promote the salvation of man, the soul will be sustained in trials, and will be comforted and invigorated even when the body is weary, grows old, decays, and dies. It is the testimony of Paul respecting his own experience; and it is a fact which has been experienced by thousands in their efforts to do good, and to save the souls of people from death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. we faint not&#8212;notwithstanding our sufferings.

But with this there is also the admission: <span class="ital">even if our outward man</span>, our phenomenal existence, our visible bodily nature, whose immediate condition of life is the <span class="greekheb">ψυχή</span>, <span class="ital">is destroyed, i.e.</span> is in process of being wasted away, of being swept off, namely, through the continual sufferings and persecutions, <span class="greekheb">μαστιζόμενος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐλαυνόμενος</span>, <span class="greekheb">μυρία πάσχων δεινά</span>, Chrysostom. For though the continual life-rescues reveal the life of Jesus in the body of the apostle (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-11.htm" title="For we which live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.">2 Corinthians 4:11</a>), yet there cannot thereby be done away the gradually destructive physical influence of suffering on the bodily nature. There is here a noble testimony to the consciousness of a continuous independence of the development of spiritual life on the passivity of the body; but the view of Billroth, who finds in <span class="greekheb">ἀνακαιν</span>. <span class="ital">the growth of the infinite, the true resurrection</span>, is just as un-Pauline as is the opinion of <span class="ital">an inward invisible body</span> (Menken), or even of a <span class="ital">corporeality</span> of the soul (Tertullian). On the point whether the inward man includes in itself the germ of the resurrection of the body (Osiander), the N. T. says nothing. Rückert diverges wholly from the usual interpretation, and thinks that <span class="greekheb">διὸ οὐκ ἐκκακ</span>. is only an accessory, half parenthetical inference from what precedes, and that a new train of thought does not begin till <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ</span>: “I have that hope, and hence do not become despondent.
