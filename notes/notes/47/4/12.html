We trace in the words something of the same pathos as in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.">1Corinthians 4:8-13</a>, without the irony which is there perceptible. “You,” he seems to say, “reap the fruit of my sufferings. The ‘dying’ is all my own; you know nothing of that conflict with pain and weakness; but the ‘life’ which is the result of that experience works in you as well as in me, and finds in you the chief sphere of its operation.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:8-12 The apostles were great sufferers, yet they met with wonderful support. Believers may be forsaken of their friends, as well as persecuted by enemies; but their God will never leave them nor forsake them. There may be fears within, as well as fightings without; yet we are not destroyed. The apostle speaks of their sufferings as a counterpart of the sufferings of Christ, that people might see the power of Christ's resurrection, and of grace in and from the living Jesus. In comparison with them, other Christians were, even at that time, in prosperous circumstances.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So then death worketh in us - We are exposed to death. The preaching of the gospel exposes us to trials which may be regarded as death working in us. Death has an energy over us (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  energeitai, is at work, is active, or operates); it is constantly employed in inflicting pains on us, and subjecting us to privation and trials. This is a strong and emphatic mode of saying that they were always exposed to death. We are called to serve and glorify the Redeemer, as it were, by repeated deaths and by constantly dying.<p>But life in you - You live as the effect of our being constantly exposed to death. You reap the advantage of all our exposure to trials, and of all our sufferings. You are comparatively safe; are freed from this exposure to death; and will receive eternal life as the fruit of our toils, and exposures. Life here may refer either to exemption from danger and death; or it may refer to the life of religion; the hopes of piety; the prospect of eternal salvation. To me it seems most probable that Paul means to use it in the latter sense, and that he designs to say that while he was exposed to death and called to endure constant trial, the effect would be that they would obtain, in consequence of his sufferings, the blessedness of eternal life; compare <a href="/2_corinthians/4-15.htm">2 Corinthians 4:15</a>. Thus understood, this passage means, that the sufferings and self-denials of the apostles were for the good of others, and would result in their benefit and salvation; and the design of Paul here is to remind them of his sufferings in their behalf, in order to conciliate their favor and bind them more closely to him by the remembrance of his sufferings on their account. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. The "death" of Christ manifested in the continual "perishing of our outward man" (2Co 4:16), works peculiarly in us, and is the means of working spiritual "life" in you. The life whereof we witness in our bodily dying, extends beyond ourselves, and is brought by our very dying to you.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> You see the difference between us and you; either the real difference, or the fancied difference. We are killed all the day long, in deaths often, delivered to death always; you are rich, and full, and want nothing; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">life, </span> that is, security, happiness, and prosperity, attends you. Or the fancied difference: You bless yourselves, that you are not in so much jeopardy as we are, and some of you are ready to curse us, because vipers stick to our hands, and we are in continually renewed and repeated troubles. Very good interpreters think these words a smart ironical expression, by which the apostle reflecteth upon a party in this church, who from his sufferings concluded against the truth of his doctrine, or his favour with God; and for themselves, because of their immunity and freedom from such sufferings. Others think the sense this, our death is your life; our sufferings are your spiritual advantage. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So then death worketh in us,.... This is the conclusion of the foregoing account, or the inference deduced from it; either the death, or dying of Christ, that is, the sufferings of his body, the church, for his sake,  "is wrought in us"; fulfilled and perfected in us; see <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a> or rather a corporeal death has seized upon us; the seeds of death are in us; our flesh, our bodies are mortal, dying off apace; death has already attacked us, is working on our constitutions gradually, and unpinning our tabernacles, which in a short time will be wholly took down and laid in the dust: <p>but life in you. Some understand these words as spoken ironically, like those in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-8.htm">1 Corinthians 4:8</a> but the apostle seems not to be speaking in such a strain, but in the most serious manner, and about things solemn and awful; and his meaning is, ours is the sorrow, the trouble, the affliction, and death itself, yours is the gain, the joy, the pleasure, and life; what we get by preaching the Gospel are reproach, persecution, and death; but this Gospel we preach at such expense is the savour of life unto life to you, and is the means of maintaining spiritual life in your souls, and of nourishing you up unto eternal life; and which is no small encouragement to us to go on in our work with boldness and cheerfulness: or these words regard the different state and condition of the apostle, and other ministers, and of the Corinthians; the one were in adversity, and the other in prosperity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</span><p>(7) A very wise conclusion: as if he would say, Therefore, to be short, we die that you may live by our death, because they ventured into all those dangers for the building of the Church's sake, and they ceased not to strengthen and encourage all the faithful with the examples of their patience.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/4-12.htm" title="So then death works in us, but life in you.">2 Corinthians 4:12</a>. An inference from <a href="/2_corinthians/4-11.htm" title="For we which live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.">2 Corinthians 4:11</a>; hence the meaning can be no other than: <span class="ital">Accordingly</span>, since we are continually exposed to death, <span class="ital">it is death whose working clings to us</span>; but since the revelation of the life of Jesus in us goes to benefit <span class="ital">you</span> through our work in our vocation, the power opposed to death, <span class="ital">life, is that which exercises its working on you</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ θάνατος</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἡ ζωή</span> can, according to <a href="/context/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body....">2 Corinthians 4:10-11</a>, be nothing else than the <span class="ital">bodily</span> death and the <span class="ital">bodily</span> life, both conceived of as personal powers, and consequently the life not as <span class="ital">existent in Jesus</span> (Hofmann). It was death to which Paul and those like him were ever given up, and it was life which, in spite of all deadly perils, retained the victory and remained preserved. And this victorious power of life, presenting in His servants the life of the risen Lord, was active (comp. <a href="/philippians/1-22.htm" title="But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.">Php 1:22</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-24.htm" title="Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.">Php 1:24</a>) through the continuance thereby rendered possible of the apostolic working among the Christians, and especially among the Corinthians (<span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>), although they were not affected in like manner by that working of death. Estius (following Lombard) and Grotius (comp. Olshausen) take <span class="greekheb">ἐνεργ</span>. <span class="ital">passively:</span> “in nobis … mors agitur et exercetur … ut vicissim … per nostra pericula nostramque quotidianam mortem vobis gignitur, augetur, perficitur vita spiritualis” (Estius). But in the N. T. <span class="greekheb">ἐνεργ</span>. never occurs in a passive sense (see on <a href="/2_corinthians/1-6.htm" title="And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.">2 Corinthians 1:6</a>), and according to <a href="/context/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body....">2 Corinthians 4:10-11</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ ζωή</span> cannot be <span class="ital">vita spiritualis</span>, as even Osiander (comp. Ewald) here again interprets it. Calvin, Menochius, and Michaelis find in it something <span class="ital">ironical:</span> we are in continual deadly peril, while you are <span class="ital">in comfort</span>. Comp. Chrysostom, who, however, does not expressly signalize the ironical character of the passage. On <span class="greekheb">ζῆν</span>, <span class="ital">vita frui</span>, see Jacobs, <span class="ital">ad Anthol.</span> X. p. 70; comp. <span class="greekheb">ζῆν καὶ εἶναι</span>, Dissen, <span class="ital">ad Dem. de Cor</span>. p. 239. But the context gives no suggestion whatever of irony or of any such reference of <span class="greekheb">ἡ ζωή</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς δὲ ἐν ἀνέσει</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐκ τούτων τῶν κινδύνων καρπούμενοι ζωήν</span>, Chrysostom). As foreign to it is Rückert’s view, which refers the first half of the verse to Paul’s alleged sickness, and the second half to <span class="ital">the state of health of the Corinthians</span>, which, as Paul had recently learned through Titus, had considerably improved after a sickness that had been prevalent (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may add that the first clause is set down <span class="ital">without</span> <span class="greekheb">μέν</span>, because Paul purposely avoids paving the way for the contrast, in order thereupon to bring it forward by way of surprise. “Infert particula <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> <span class="ital">novam</span> rem cum aliqua oppositione,” Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar.</span> p. 356.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_corinthians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/4-12.htm" title="So then death works in us, but life in you.">2 Corinthians 4:12</a>.

The Apostle here enunciates a principle common to the material and the spiritual world. From death comes life, from decay regeneration. The death of Christ was the life of the world; the daily dying (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-31.htm" title="I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>) of His disciples, by virtue of the same Spirit that lives in Him, is the means whereby that life spreads among mankind. Death may be said to be working in Christ’s ministers, because of their visible sorrows, anxieties, persecutions (but see <span class="ital"><a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2 Corinthians 4:16</a></span>); life in their converts, because of the visible change in their character and acts.
