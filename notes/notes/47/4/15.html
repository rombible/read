The passage is, however, obscure in its construction, and two other renderings of the Greek are grammatically possible, which is more than can be said of the English version: (1) “that grace having abounded, may, for the sake of the thanksgiving of the greater part of you, redound . . .”; and (2) “that grace having abounded, may, by means of the greater part of you, cause thanksgiving to redound . . .” What has been given above is, it is believed, the closest to St. Paul’s meaning.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 The grace of faith is an effectual remedy against fainting in times of trouble. They knew that Christ was raised, and that his resurrection was an earnest and assurance of theirs. The hope of this resurrection will encourage in a suffering day, and set us above the fear of death. Also, their sufferings were for the advantage of the church, and to God's glory. The sufferings of Christ's ministers, as well as their preaching and conversation, are for the good of the church and the glory of God. The prospect of eternal life and happiness was their support and comfort. What sense was ready to pronounce heavy and long, grievous and tedious, faith perceived to be light and short, and but for a moment. The weight of all temporal afflictions was lightness itself, while the glory to come was a substance, weighty, and lasting beyond description. If the apostle could call his heavy and long-continued trials light, and but for a moment, what must our trifling difficulties be! Faith enables to make this right judgment of things. There are unseen things, as well as things that are seen. And there is this vast difference between them; unseen things are eternal, seen things but temporal, or temporary only. Let us then look off from the things which are seen; let us cease to seek for worldly advantages, or to fear present distresses. Let us give diligence to make our future happiness sure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For all things are for your sakes - All these things; these glorious hopes, and truths, and prospects; these self-denials of the apostles, and these provisions of the plan of mercy.<p>For your sakes - On your account. They are designed to promote your salvation. They are not primarily for the welfare of those who engage in these toils and self-denials; but the whole arrangement and execution of the plan of salvation, and all the self-denial evinced by those who are engaged in making that plan known, are in order that you might be benefitted. One object of Paul in this statement, doubtless, is, to conciliate their favor, and remove the objections which had been made to him by a faction in the church at Corinth.<p>That the abundant grace - Grace abounding, or overflowing. The rich mercy of God that should be manifested by these means. It is implied here, that grace would abound by means of these labors and self-denials of the apostles. The grace referred to here is that which would be conferred on them in consequence of these labors.<p>Through the thanksgiving of many - That many may have occasion of gratitude to God; that by these labors more persons may be led to praise him. It was an object with Paul so to labor that as many as possible might be led to praise God, and have occasion to thank him to all eternity.<p>Redound to the glory of God - That God may have augmented praise; that his glory in the salvation of people may abound. The sentiment of the passage is, that it would be for the glory of God that as many as possible should be brought to give praise and thanksgivings to him; and that, therefore, Paul endeavored to make as many converts as possible. He denied himself; he welcomed toil; he encountered enemies; he subjected himself to dangers; and he sought by all means possible to bring as many as could be brought to praise God. The word "redound" (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#837;  perisseue&#772;) here means abound, or be abundant; and the sense is, that the overflowing grace thus evinced in the salvation of many would so abound as to promote the glory of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

[Chrysostom] (2Co 1:11; 9:11, 12). The Greek is susceptible also of this translation, "That grace, being made the greater (multiplied) on account of the thanksgiving of the greater number (for grace already received), may abound (abundantly redound) to," &c. Thus the Greek for "abound" has not to be taken in an active sense, but in its ordinary neuter sense, and so the other Greek words. Thanksgiving invites more abundant grace (2Ch 20:19-22; Ps 18:3; 50:23).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All things</span> that Christ hath done and suffered, his death, and his resurrection from the dead, and all things that I have done or suffered, all <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">are for your sakes; </span> that the greater benefit it be which you receive from God, the greater praise, honour, and glory might redound to him by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the thanksgiving of many; </span> for God can be no otherwise glorified by us, than by the predicating of his mercy and goodness, and the praising of hint for the mercies which we receive from him.

So, in the main, Hofmann also: (2) <span class="ital">in order that the grace, since it has shown itself so richly, may, through the increasing number, make the thanksgiving abundant to the honour of God</span>. So Emmerling, de Wette, Neander.

Besides, both are less in keeping with the symmetry of the discourse, which, in structure and expression, is carefully chosen and terse—features seen also in the collocation: “<span class="ital">increased through the increasing number</span>.” These <span class="greekheb">πλείονες</span> are those who have been <span class="ital">converted</span> by the apostolic ministry, and in particular those <span class="ital">advanced in the Christian life</span>, who were just <span class="ital">individualized</span> by <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὑμᾶς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[200] The position of the genitive, inverted for the sake of emphasis, would have occasioned no difficulty according to <span class="ital">classical</span> usage.

The A.V. “that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God” can hardly be possible, and the position of <span class="greekheb">πλεονάσασα</span> in the sentence seems to require that the words be connected as in R.V. For the transitive significance of <span class="greekheb">περισσεύω</span> see reff.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>15. <span class="ital">For all things are for your sakes</span>] Cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/3-22.htm" title="Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>, as well as the numerous passages in that Epistle where the well-being of mankind is represented as St Paul’s (and indeed God’s) only object, e.g. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.">1 Corinthians 6:12</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm" title="All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.">1 Corinthians 10:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that the abundant grace</span>] Literally, that <span class="bld">grace having abounded</span>. There is a very similar passage in ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>. And this passage, like that, is capable of being construed in various ways. We may either take it (1) <span class="ital">that grace, having abounded, might multiply on account of the thanksgiving of the greater number</span>; or (2) <span class="ital">that grace, having abounded, may by means of the greater number, multiply the thanksgiving to the glory of God</span>, or (3) <span class="ital">that grace, having abounded through the greater number, may multiply the thanksgiving to the glory of God</span>. The last would seem the preferable rendering. For (1) God’s grace or favour abounds the more, the greater the number who are turned to Him, (2) the larger the number of converts, the greater the thanksgiving to God (for this use of ‘the greater number, see <a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm" title="For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more.">1 Corinthians 9:19</a>); and (3) the word translated ‘redound’ in the A.

Through (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;) should govern the many, not thanksgiving; and redound should be transitive, cause to abound, and governing thanksgiving. So Rev., the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound. The thought is on the line of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-12.htm">2 Corinthians 4:12</a>, that the sufferings and risks of the apostles promote spiritual life in the Church. The grace of God, thus manifest in the apostles, shall be multiplied through the increasing number of those who share it, and shall thus make thanksgiving more abundant for the fruits of this grace as exhibited in the apostles and in the Church.<p>Redound (A.V.) is from the Latin redundare to surge back. Therefore, primarily, of a fullness or overflow from the setting back of a tide. So Milton:<p>"The evil, soon<p>Driven back, redounded as a flood on those<p>From whom it sprang."<p>Generally, to abound. From this arises the secondary sense, to conduce, contribute to; that is, to make the causes mount up, or abound, so as to produce the effect. So Addison: "The care of our national commerce redounds more to the riches and prosperity of the public," etc. </body></html>
