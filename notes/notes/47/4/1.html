Two thoughts rise up in the Apostle’s mind in immediate association with this: (1) His own utter unworthiness of it, which finds expression in “as we have received mercy” (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1Timothy 1:12</a>); and (2) the manifold trials and difficulties in the midst of which it had to be accomplished.

The apostle does not mean that they actually recommended themselves to the conscience of every man, so that they had the approbation of every man; but that they behaved in such a manner as ought to have convinced every man of their honesty and fidelity in their preaching, and in the exercise of every other branch of their ministry.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The best of men would faint, if they did not receive mercy from God. And that mercy which has helped us out, and helped us on, hitherto, we may rely upon to help us even to the end. The apostles had no base and wicked designs, covered with fair and specious pretences. They did not try to make their ministry serve a turn. Sincerity or uprightness will keep the favourable opinion of wise and good men. Christ by his gospel makes a glorious discovery to the minds of men. But the design of the devil is, to keep men in ignorance; and when he cannot keep the light of the gospel of Christ out of the world, he spares no pains to keep men from the gospel, or to set them against it. The rejection of the gospel is here traced to the wilful blindness and wickedness of the human heart. Self was not the matter or the end of the apostles' preaching; they preached Christ as Jesus, the Saviour and Deliverer, who saves to the uttermost all that come to God through him. Ministers are servants to the souls of men; they must avoid becoming servants to the humours or the lusts of men. It is pleasant to behold the sun in the firmament; but it is more pleasant and profitable for the gospel to shine in the heart. As light was the beginning of the first creation; so, in the new creation, the light of the Spirit is his first work upon the soul. The treasure of gospel light and grace is put into earthen vessels. The ministers of the gospel are subject to the same passions and weaknesses as other men. God could have sent angels to make known the glorious doctrine of the gospel, or could have sent the most admired sons of men to teach the nations, but he chose humbler, weaker vessels, that his power might be more glorified in upholding them, and in the blessed change wrought by their ministry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - &#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;  Dia touto. On account of this. That is, because the light of the gospel is so clear; because it reveals so glorious truths, and all obscurity is taken away, and we are permitted to behold as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>. Since the glories of the gospel dispensation are so great, and its effects on the heart are so transforming and purifying. The object is, to show the "effect" of being entrusted with such a ministry, on the character of his preaching.<p>Seeing we have this ministry - The gospel ministry, so much more glorious than that of Moses <a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>; which is the ministry by which the Holy Spirit acts on the hearts of people <a href="/2_corinthians/3-8.htm">2 Corinthians 3:8</a>; which is the ministry of that system by which people are justified <a href="/2_corinthians/3-9.htm">2 Corinthians 3:9</a>; and which is the ministry of a system so pure and unclouded, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-9.htm">2 Corinthians 3:9-11</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>.<p>As we have received mercy - Tyndale renders this: "even as mercy is sure in us." The idea is, that it was by the mere mercy and favor of God, that he had been entrusted with the ministry, and the object of Paul is doubtless to prevent the "appearance" of arrogance and self-confidence by stating that it was to be traced entirely to God that he was put into the ministry. He doubtless had his eye on the fact that he had been a persecutor and blasphemer; and that it was by the mere favor of God that he had been converted and entrusted with the ministry, <a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>. Nothing will more effectually humble a minister, and prevent his assuming any arrogant and self-confident airs, than to look over his past life; especially if his life was one of blasphemy, vice, or infidelity; and to remember that it is by the mere mercy of God that he is entrusted with the high office of an ambassador of Jesus Christ. Paul never forgot to trace his hope, his appointment to the ministerial office, and his success, to the mere grace of God.<p>We faint not - This is one of the effects of being entrusted with such a ministry. The word used here (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  ekkakoumen) means, properly, to turn out a coward; to lose one's courage; then to be fainthearted, to faint, to despond, in view of trial, difficulty, etc. - Robinson. Here it means, that by the mercy of God, he was not disheartened by the difficulties which he met; his faith and zeal did not flag; he was enabled to be faithful, and laborious, and his courage always kept up, and his mind was filled with cheerfulness; see note on <a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>. He was deterred by no difficulties; embarrassed by no opposition; driven from his purpose by no persecution; and his strength did not fail under any trials. The consciousness of being entrusted with "such" a ministry animated him; and the mercy and grace of God sustained him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>2Co 4:1-18.

The apostle having largely insisted on the difference between the law and the Gospel, the ministration of the one and of the other, proceeds to give an account of his own conduct, and that of his fellow apostles and ministers: "we", says he, "faint not"; under all the reproaches cast upon us, persecutions raised against us, and tribulations that attend us; we do not sink in our spirits, or give out from the ministry; we go on cheerfully in our work, in the thee of all opposition, encouraged by the consideration of the excellency of the ministry, which they had from the Lord, were put into, and continued in; which was so valuable in itself, and so useful in its effects; being the ministration of the Spirit and of righteousness, having in it such an excelling glory to the law, and attended with so much light and liberty: to which he adds the consideration of the mercy of God they were partakers of, <p>as we have received mercy; which may refer either to the grace and mercy of God, which they had received in conversion; a sense of which abiding upon them, so influenced their minds, to hold forth the riches of abounding grace and mercy to poor sinners in the Gospel, that nothing could deter them from it; or to the grace, favour, and good will of God, in making, supporting, and continuing them as ministers of the word; all which, they were sensible, was owing not to men, but God; not to their merit, but to his mercy; not to their worthiness, parts, learning, &amp;c. but to his free gift, favour, and grace, by which only they were what they were, as preachers of the Gospel. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> faint not;</span><p>(1) Now he plainly witnesses that both he and his associates<p>(through the mercy of God) do their vocation and duty uprightly and sincerely, neglecting all dangers.<p>(a) Though we are broken in pieces with miseries and calamities, yet we do not yield.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;">2 Corinthians 4:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ τοῦτο</span>] Paul now reverts, it is true, to what had been begun in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-12.htm" title="Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:">2 Corinthians 3:12</a> f., but had, owing to the comparison with Moses and the discussion thence arising about the hardening of the Jews and the freedom contrasted with it (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/3-14.htm" title="But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil not taken away in the reading of the old testament;

But this appears to be a correction, since only <span class="greekheb">ἐγκακεῖν</span>, and not <span class="greekheb">ἐκκακεῖν</span> (which is here the reading of C D*** E K L), occurs for certain out of the N.

Probably <span class="greekheb">ἐκκακεῖν</span> was at that time only in oral use, and came first through Paul and Luke into the language of ecclesiastical writings.

Hence Rückert is mistaken in holding that, for the sake of the contrast, we must assume the general signification: to abandon oneself to badness, a signification which cannot elsewhere be made good for <span class="greekheb">ἐγκακ</span>. or for <span class="greekheb">ἐκκακ</span>. (in Polybius, iv. 19. 10, <span class="greekheb">ἐνεκάκησαν</span> means, “they were lazy”). Chrysostom is in substance correct: <span class="greekheb">οὐ κστσπίπτομεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καὶ χαίρομεν καὶ παῤῥησιαζόμεθα</span>.

This is clear from the two passages (ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2 Corinthians 1:19</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>) in which he defines who ‘we’ are. The genuine Apostles of Christ, he would say, do not lose heart when all does not go smoothly with them. Nay, the very fact that they have sufferings to undergo stamps them the more unmistakeably as followers of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;">2 Corinthians 4:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τήν διακονίαν ταύτην</span>, <span class="ital">this ministry</span>) of which <a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>, etc.—<span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἠλεήθημεν</span>, <span class="ital">as we have received mercy</span>) The mercy of God, by which the <span class="ital">ministry</span> is received, makes men active and sincere.
