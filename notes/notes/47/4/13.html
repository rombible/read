They knew that Christ was raised, and that his resurrection was an earnest and assurance of theirs. The hope of this resurrection will encourage in a suffering day, and set us above the fear of death. Also, their sufferings were for the advantage of the church, and to God's glory. The sufferings of Christ's ministers, as well as their preaching and conversation, are for the good of the church and the glory of God. The prospect of eternal life and happiness was their support and comfort. What sense was ready to pronounce heavy and long, grievous and tedious, faith perceived to be light and short, and but for a moment. The weight of all temporal afflictions was lightness itself, while the glory to come was a substance, weighty, and lasting beyond description. If the apostle could call his heavy and long-continued trials light, and but for a moment, what must our trifling difficulties be! Faith enables to make this right judgment of things. There are unseen things, as well as things that are seen. And there is this vast difference between them; unseen things are eternal, seen things but temporal, or temporary only. Let us then look off from the things which are seen; let us cease to seek for worldly advantages, or to fear present distresses. Let us give diligence to make our future happiness sure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We having the same spirit of faith - The same spirit that is expressed in the quotation which he is about to make; the same faith which the psalmist had. We have the very spirit of faith which is expressed by David. The sense is, we have the same spirit of faith which he had who said, "I believed," etc. The phrase, "spirit of faith," means substantially the same as faith itself; a believing sense or impression of the truth.<p>According as it is written - This passage is found in <a href="/psalms/116-10.htm">Psalm 116:10</a>. When the psalmist uttered the words, he was greatly afflicted; see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/116-3.htm">Psalm 116:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/116-6.htm">Psalm 116:6-8</a>. In these circumstances, he prayed to God, and expressed confidence in him, and placed all his reliance on him. In his affliction he spoke to God; he spoke of his confidence in him; he proclaimed his reliance on him; and his having spoken in this manner was the result of his belief, or of his putting confidence in God. Paul, in quoting this, does not mean to say that the psalmist had any reference to the preaching of the gospel; nor does he mean to say that his circumstances were in all respects like those of the psalmist. The circumstances resembled each other only in these respects:<p>(1) That Paul, like the psalmist, was in circumstances of trial and affliction; and,<p>(2) That the language which both used was that which was prompted by faith - faith, which led them to give utterance to the sentiments of their hearts; the psalmist to utter his confidence in God, and the holms by which he was sustained, and Paul to utter his belief in the glorious truths of the gospel; to speak of a risen Saviour, and to show forth the consolations which were thus set before people in the gospel.<p>The sentiments of both were the language of faith. Both, in afflictions, uttered the language of faith; and Paul uses here, as he often does, the language of the Old Testament, as exactly expressing his feelings, and the principles by which he was actuated.<p>We also believe ... - We believe in the truths of the gospel; we believe in God, in the Saviour, in the atonement, in the resurrection, etc. The sentiment is, that they had a firm confidence in these things, and that, as the result of that confidence they boldly delivered their sentiments. It prompted them to give utterance to their feelings. "Out of the abundance of the heart," said the Saviour, "the mouth speaketh," <a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>. No man should attempt to preach the gospel who has not a firm belief of its truths; and he who does believe its truths will be prompted to make them known to his fellow-men. All successful preaching is the result of a firm and settled conviction of the truth of the gospel; and when such a conviction exists, it is natural to give utterance to the belief, and such an expression will be attended with happy influences on the minds of other people; see the note on <a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

Though "death worketh in us, and life in you" (2Co 4:12), yet as we have the same spirit of faith as you, we therefore [believingly] look for the same immortal life as you [Estius], and speak as we believe. Alford not so well translates, "The same &#8230; faith with that described in the Scriptures" (Ps 116:10). The balance of the sentence requires the parallelism to be this, "According to that which is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak," namely, without fear, amidst "afflictions" and "deaths" (2Co 4:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The same spirit of faith</span> signifieth the same faith, or faith proceeding from the same spirit; thus, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a></span>, <span class="ital">the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord, </span> signifieth wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, &c. It is a question whom the apostle meaneth when he saith: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">We having the same faith.</span> Some think he meaneth the saints under the Old Testament, whose faith was the same with the faith of believers under the New Testament; and that which guideth them to that interpretation, is the apostle’s following quotation out of <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/116-10.htm" title="I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:">Psalm 116:10</a></span>. But the scope of the quotation seemeth to be, to prove that all good men will speak as they believe; they therefore seem better to interpret the text, that make this the sense of it: Though God, in the wisdom of his providence, hath assigned us in this world a different lot from you, that you are full, we empty; you in prosperity, we in adversity; yet we are partakers of the same faith with you, and are acted from the same spirit that you are: and as David’s spirit guided him to a profession of his faith, and a speaking what he believed; so we also speak, and must speak, according to what we believe. And this is manifestly the sense of the words, if we consider what followeth in the next verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>We having the same Spirit of faith,.... By faith here is meant, not the doctrine, but the grace of faith; a believing in the doctrines of the Gospel, and in the person of Christ; an exercise of that grace upon the death and resurrection of Christ; and particularly a looking by faith in full expectation of the saints' resurrection from the dead, and eternal glory, together with a reliance on the power, faithfulness, and promises of God to support under the afflictions of this life. Now of this faith the Spirit of God is the author; this is not of ourselves, of our own power, it is the free gift of God, and a valuable gift it is; it is of the operation of God, and the produce of his almighty power; and of this the Spirit of God, in conversion, is the powerful operator: hence he is here called the "Spirit of faith". So the "third" number in the Cabalistic tree of the Jews, the intelligence sanctifying, which answers to the third person in our doctrine of the Trinity, is called (x), <p>"Nmwa hnwma and , "the artificer of faith", and "the author or parent of faith", because from its power faith flows.'' <p>Which is the "same" in all saints; the Spirit is the same in one as in another, and so is the faith which he is the author of; see <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>. Faith is the same in all the saints that have been from the beginning of the world, under the Old and New Testament dispensations; it was the same in all the churches in the apostle's time, in Rome as at Ephesus, in Ephesus as at Rome, and in Thessalonica as at Rome and Ephesus, and so in all the other churches; though it may be, the apostle may chiefly design the sameness of faith, and of the Spirit, in him and his fellow ministers, and in these Corinthians, though death was working in the one, and life in the other; which appeared in their free and bold ministration of the word, notwithstanding all they met with on account of it, in imitation and encouraged by the example of David, <p>according as it is written, <a href="/psalms/116-10.htm">Psalm 116:10</a>. <p>I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak: where there is true faith, and the true Spirit of faith, there will be a speaking of, for, and in the name of Christ, as there ought to be: for as "with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, so with the mouth confession is made unto salvation". This is true of believers in common, sooner or later, at one time or another; but more especially of the ministers of the word, who have a firm and well grounded belief in the doctrines of the Gospel, and person of Christ; and therefore speak freely, and without any doubt and hesitation about these things, boldly, and without the fear of men, and sincerely and faithfully, as in the sight of God: hence they make Christ the main subject of their ministry, because they believe in him, and nothing can stop their mouths from speaking of him; faith, and a spirit of faith, fit for public work and service, and give freedom and boldness in the ministration of the Gospel, and are a great support under persecution for the sake of it. <p>(x) Sepher Jetzirah, Semit 3. p. 6. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> We having the same <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;</span><p>(8) He declares the former sentence, showing that he and his associates die in a way to purchase life for others, but yet nonetheless they are partakers of the same life with them: because they themselves do first believe that which they offer to others to believe, that is, that they also will be saved together with them in Christ.<p>(m) The same faith, by the inspiration of the same Spirit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/4-13.htm" title="We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>.

For through the <span class="greekheb">πιστεύομεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">διὸ καὶ λαλοῦμεν</span>, is that very <span class="greekheb">ἡ ζωὴ ἐν ὑμῖν ἐνεργεῖται</span> rendered possible and brought about. The connection of ideas is frequently taken thus: “Though death works in us and life in you, we have yet the certain confidence that we too will partake of the life.” Comp. Estius, Flatt, Rückert. But in that case the relation of the two verses, 13 and 14, would be logically inverted, and the participial clause in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.">2 Corinthians 4:14</a> would be made the principal clause; Paul must logically have written: “<span class="ital">Because, however, we have the same spirit of faith, which David expresses in the words</span>, etc., <span class="ital">we know</span>,” etc. According to Olshausen, Paul wishes to represent the thought that his career, so full of suffering, is a source of life to the Corinthians, as a living certainty wrought in him from above. But apart from the erroneous explanation of <span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ ζωὴ ἐν ὑμῖν</span>, on which this is based (see on <a href="/2_corinthians/4-12.htm" title="So then death works in us, but life in you.">2 Corinthians 4:12</a>), the very fact—the <span class="greekheb">ἡ ζωὴ ἐν ὑμῖν ἐνεργεῖται</span>—was something <span class="ital">consonant to experience</span>, and hence Paul in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-13.htm" title="We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;">2 Corinthians 4:13</a> gives nothing else than an elucidation <span class="ital">consonant to experience</span>. According to de Wette (comp. before him, Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr.</span>, who inserts the intermediate thought: <span class="ital">nec tamen ob id nos poenitet evangelii</span>), the course of thought is: “<span class="ital">But this working of death hinders us not from preaching the gospel boldly, since the hope of the resurrection strengthens us.</span>” In this way, however, he arbitrarily passes over the immediately preceding thought, <span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ ζωὴ ἐν ὑμῖν</span>, to which, nevertheless, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-13.htm" title="We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;">2 Corinthians 4:13</a> supplies an appropriate elucidation. According to Hofmann, Paul brings in a modification of the contrast contained in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-12.htm" title="So then death works in us, but life in you.">2 Corinthians 4:12</a>, when he says that he has, while death works in him, still the same spirit as exists in those in whom life works. But there is no hint of this retrospective reference of <span class="greekheb">τὸ αὐτό</span> (which would have required a <span class="greekheb">σὺν ὑμῖν</span> or something similar); and not even the thought in itself would he suitable, since his being in possession of the same spirit which his disciples, in whom his life was in fact at work, possessed, would be self-evident, and not a special point to be brought into prominence and asserted by the apostle. This also in opposition to Erasmus, Estius, Bengel, Schrader, and others, who explain <span class="greekheb">τὸ αὐτό</span>: <span class="ital">the same spirit, which you have</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ αὐτό πνεῦμα τῆς τίστεως</span>] <span class="ital">i.e. the same Holy Spirit working faith</span>, not: the believing <span class="ital">frame of mind</span> (de Wette, comp. also Lipsius, <span class="ital">Rechtfertigungsl.</span> p. 176), which is not the meaning of <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> in <a href="/romans/8-15.htm" title="For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="/romans/11-8.htm" title="(According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) to this day.">Romans 11:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ αὐτό</span> is the same <span class="ital">which is made known in the following saying of Scripture</span>, consequently the same <span class="ital">as the Psalmist had</span>.

He speaks openly, because he has reason to believe what he says. And the thought is connected with the last verse by the fact that it is to his speaking that the Corinthians owe their life.

And this faith inspires him with the conviction that, after "the body of this death," and after this death in life, there should begin for him also the life in death. St. Paul says nothing as to the authorship of the psalm, which probably belongs to a period far later than that of David.
