It is great grace and favour from God, if we are made useful to others, and forward to any good work. He commends the charity of the Macedonians. So far from needing that Paul should urge them, they prayed him to receive the gift. Whatever we use or lay out for God, it is only giving him what is his own. All we give for charitable uses, will not be accepted of God, nor turn to our advantage, unless we first give ourselves to the Lord. By ascribing all really good works to the grace of God, we not only give the glory to him whose due it is, but also show men where their strength is. Abundant spiritual joy enlarges men's hearts in the work and labour of love. How different this from the conduct of those who will not join in any good work, unless urged into it!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Praying us with much entreaty - Earnestly entreating me to receive the contribution and convey it to the poor and afflicted saints in Judea.<p>And take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints - Greek, "that we would take the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints."

They were so willing in the matter that they entreated me, as a favour (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), to allow them to have a share in this contribution, because it was to be given to the saints, that is, the suffering peer in the Church of Jerusalem. This Church suffered from chronic poverty. Even the Jewish population were liable to famines, in one of which they had only been kept alive by the royal munificence of a proselyte, Queen Helena,of Adiabene. The Christians would, of course, suffer even more deeply, because they were drawn from the humblest classes and had fewer friends. This was one of the reasons why, as an act of common humanity, it was incumbent on the Gentile Christians to help them (<a href="/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29</a>; <a href="/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25, 26</a>).
