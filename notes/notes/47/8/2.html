<a href="/context/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5-6</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1Thessalonians 2:14</a>) makes it almost certain that they would carry on at least a petty persecution with more or less persistency. The “poverty” at Philippi may possibly be connected with the preponderance of women in the Church there, as indicated in <a href="/acts/16-13.htm" title="And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spoke to the women which resorted thither.">Acts 16:13</a>. In the absence of the bread-winners of a household, Christian women in a Græco-Roman city would find but scanty means of subsistence. In part, however, the churches were but sharers in a widely-spread distress. Macedonia and Achaia never recovered from the three wars between Cæsar and Pompeius, between the Triumvirs and Brutus and Cassius, and between Augustus and Antonius. Under Tiberius, they petitioned for a diminution of their burdens, and were accordingly transferred for a time from the jurisdiction of the senate to that of the emperor, as involving a less heavy taxation.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the riches of their liberality.</span>—The primary meaning of the word, as in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2Corinthians 1:12</a> (where see Note), is simplicity, or singleness of purpose. That singleness, when shown in gifts, leads to “liberality,” and so the word had acquired the secondary sense in which it seems here to be used. Tyndale, and Cranmer, however, give “singleness,” and the Rhemish version “simplicity.” “Liberality” first appears in that of Geneva.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The grace of God must be owned as the root and fountain of all the good in us, or done by us, at any time. It is great grace and favour from God, if we are made useful to others, and forward to any good work. He commends the charity of the Macedonians. So far from needing that Paul should urge them, they prayed him to receive the gift. Whatever we use or lay out for God, it is only giving him what is his own. All we give for charitable uses, will not be accepted of God, nor turn to our advantage, unless we first give ourselves to the Lord. By ascribing all really good works to the grace of God, we not only give the glory to him whose due it is, but also show men where their strength is. Abundant spiritual joy enlarges men's hearts in the work and labour of love. How different this from the conduct of those who will not join in any good work, unless urged into it!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How that, in a great trial of affliction - When it might be supposed they were unable to give; when many would suppose they needed the aid of others; or when it might be supposed their minds would be wholly engrossed with their own concerns. The trial to which the apostle here refers was doubtless some persecution which was excited against them, probably by the Jews; see <a href="/acts/16-20.htm">Acts 16:20</a>; <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5</a>.<p>The abundance of their joy - Their joy arising from the hopes and promises of the gospel. Notwithstanding their persecutions, their joy has abounded, and the effect of their joy has been seen in the liberal contribution which they have made. Their joy could not be repressed by their persecution, and they cheerfully contributed largely to the aid of others.<p>And their deep poverty - Their very low estate of poverty was made to contribute liberally to the needs of others. It is implied here:<p>(1) That they were very poor - a fact arising probably from the consideration that the poor generally embraced the gospel first, and also because it is probable that they were molested and stripped of their property in persecutions (compare Heb). <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>);<p>(2) That notwithstanding this they were enabled to make a liberal contribution - a fact demonstrating that a people can do much even when poor if all feel disposed to do it, and that afflictions are favorable to the effort; and,<p>(3) That one cause of this was the joy which they had even in their trials.<p>If a people have the joys of the gospel; if they have the consolations of religion themselves, they will somehow or other find means to contribute to the welfare of others. They will be willing to labor with reference to it, or they will find something which they can sacrifice or spare. Even their deep poverty will abound in the fruits of benevolence.<p>Abounded - They contributed liberally. Their joy was manifested in a large donation, notwithstanding their poverty.<p>Unto the riches of their liberality - Margin, "Simplicity." The word (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  haplote&#772;s) used here means properly sincerity, candor, probity; then Christian simplicity, integrity; then liberality; see <a href="/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a> (Margin,); <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-11.htm">2 Corinthians 9:11</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>. The phrase "riches of liberality," is a Hebraism, meaning rich, or abundant liberality. The sense is, their liberality was much greater than could be expected from persons so poor; and the object of the apostle is, to excite the Corinthians to give liberally by their example. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. trial of affliction&#8212;The Greek expresses, "in affliction (or, 'tribulation') which tested them"; literally, "in a great testing of affliction."<p>abundance of their joy&#8212;The greater was the depth of their poverty, the greater was the abundance of their joy.

The apostle proceeds to show the condition these churches were in when, and the manner in which, they contributed to the relief of others. They were in affliction: they received the Gospel at first in much affliction, as did the church at Thessalonica, which was one of them; and afterwards suffered much from their countrymen for the profession of it, by reproaches, persecutions, imprisonments, confiscation of goods, &amp;c. They were under trying afflictions, which tried their faith and patience, and in many of them. Now for persons in prosperity, when all things go well with them, to be liberal is no such great matter; but for persons in adversity, under trying dispensations of Providence, amidst many afflictive ones to communicate generously to the relief of others, is something very remarkable, and worthy of notice and imitation, which was the case of these churches: for notwithstanding this, <p>the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty, abounded unto the riches of their liberality; so that it appears likewise that they were not only in great afflictions, but in deep poverty; had but an handful of meal in the barrel, and a little oil in the cruse, their purses almost empty, and their coffers almost exhausted; they had gotten to the bottom of their substance, had but very little left; and yet freely gave, with joy, even with an abundance of it. The allusion seems to be to the words of David, in <a href="/1_chronicles/22-14.htm">1 Chronicles 22:14</a> now behold, which the Septuagint render by  , "according to my poverty, I have prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand talents of gold", &amp;c. for by "the abundance of their joy", is not so much meant the joy they felt in the midst of their afflictions, so that they could glory in them, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God, as the cheerfulness of their spirits in contributing to the necessities of others; glad at heart they were that they had hearts to do good, and an opportunity of doing it; which they gladly laid hold on, observing the divine rule, "he that sheweth mercy", let him do it "with cheerfulness": and this they did, considering the small pittance they were possessed of, very largely; for though their poverty was deep, and their purses low, their hearts were large and full, and their hands ready to communicate; so that their poverty "abounded to the riches of their liberality": though their poverty was great, their liberality was rich and large; though it might be but little they gave in quantity, it was much in quality, much in liberality; like the poor widow, who, of her want and penury, cast in more than all the rich besides, not in quantity, but in liberality; they only giving some, and a disproportionate part, she her all. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">How that in a <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</span><p>(b) For those manifold afflictions with which the Lord tried them did not stop their joyful readiness, but also made it much more excellent and well-known.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>. A more precise explanation of <span class="greekheb">τὴν χάριν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., so that <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> (<span class="ital">that, namely</span>) is dependent on <span class="greekheb">γνωρίζομεν</span>. This exposition consists, as was seen by Chrysostom, Theodoret, Erasmus, Luther, Grotius, and many others, of <span class="ital">two</span> statements, so that after <span class="greekheb">τῆς χαρᾶς αὐτῶν</span> we must mentally supply the simple <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span>.[265] This scheme of the passage, which Osiander and Hofmann also follow, is indicated by <span class="greekheb">ἡ περισσεία</span> in the one half, and <span class="greekheb">ἐπερίσσευσεν</span> in the other, whereby two parallel predicative relations are expressed, as well as by the fact that, if the whole be taken as one sentence, and consequently <span class="greekheb">ἡ περισσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χαρᾶς αὐτῶν</span> be taken along with the following <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ κατὰ βάθους πτωχεία αὐτῶν</span> as the subject of <span class="greekheb">ἐπερίσσευσεν</span> (so by most expositors since Beza), this subject would embrace two very diverse elements, and, besides, there would result the combination not elsewhere occurring: <span class="greekheb">ἡ περισσεία ἐπερίσσευσεν</span>. Hence it is to be explained: <span class="ital">that</span>, namely, <span class="ital">in much attestation of affliction the abundance of their joyfulness is, i.e.</span> that, while they are much put to the test by <span class="ital">sufferings</span>, their <span class="ital">joy</span> is plentifully present, <span class="ital">and (that) their deep poverty became abundant unto the riches of their single-heartedness, i.e.</span> that they, in their deep <span class="ital">poverty</span>, plentifully showed how <span class="ital">rich</span> their single-heartedness wa.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν πολλῇ δοκιμῇ θλίψεως</span>] Instead of writing simply <span class="greekheb">ἐν πολλῇ θλίψει</span>, Paul designates this situation according to the wholesome <span class="ital">moral</span> aspect, in which it showed itself amongst the Macedonians to their praise. <span class="greekheb">Δοκιμή</span>, namely, is here also not: trial, but, as Paul always uses it, verification (<a href="/romans/5-4.htm" title="And patience, experience; and experience, hope:">Romans 5:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.">2 Corinthians 2:9</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-13.htm" title="Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution to them, and to all men;">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-22.htm" title="But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.">Php 2:22</a>). Chrysostom aptly says: <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ γὰρ ἁπλῶς ἐθλίβησαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ οὕτως ὡς καὶ δόκιμοι γενέσθαι διὰ τῆς ὑπομονῆς</span>. The <span class="ital">verification</span> of their Christian character, which the <span class="greekheb">θλίψις</span> effected in them, was just the moral element, in which the joyfulness <span class="greekheb">πολλὴ καὶ ἄφατος ἐβλάστησεν ἐν αὐτοῖς</span> (Chrysostom), and existed among them in spite of the <span class="greekheb">θλίψις</span> itself, which, moreover, would have been calculated to produce the opposite of <span class="greekheb">χαρά</span>. Regarding the <span class="greekheb">θλίψις</span> of the Macedonians, see <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a> ff.; <a href="/acts/16-20.htm" title="And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,">Acts 16:20</a> ff; <a href="/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>.

The whole of Greece, except the Roman colonies of Patrae and Corinth, was in a dire condition of poverty and distress at this period (see Arnold’s <span class="ital">Roman Commonwealth</span>, ii., 382, quoted by Stanley); and the contribution of the Macedonian Christians was really comparable to the giving of the widow’s mite (<a href="/mark/12-44.htm" title="For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.">Mark 12:44</a>).

Dean Stanley remarks on the fact that both the Greek word translated <span class="ital">liberality</span>, and its English equivalent, have a double meaning, the original meaning of the Greek word being <span class="ital">singlettess of heart</span>, absence of all selfish motives (see ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>), and that of the English word the habit of mind engendered by a state of freedom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Θλίψεως</span>, <span class="ital">of distress</span> (pressuræ) [<span class="ital">of affliction</span>]) joined to poverty, <a href="/2_corinthians/8-13.htm" title="For I mean not that other men be eased, and you burdened:">2 Corinthians 8:13</a>, <span class="greekheb">θλιψις</span>, a <span class="ital">burden of distress</span>.—<span class="greekheb">περισσεία καὶ πτωχεία</span>, <span class="ital">abundance and poverty</span>) An oxymoron and hendiadys pleasantly interwoven.—<span class="greekheb">Κατὰ βάθους</span>) <span class="greekheb">Βάθους</span> is the genitive, governed by <span class="greekheb">κατὰ</span>: comp. <span class="greekheb">κατὰ</span>, <a href="/matthew/8-32.htm" title="And he said to them, Go.

There is not the least necessity to understand the verb "is" or "was" after this clause. "The abundance...  abounded" is indeed a pleonasm, but is not at all unlike the style of St. Paul.
