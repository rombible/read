It is needful, in the first place, to act uprightly in the sight of God, but things honest in the sight of men should also be attended to. A clear character, as well as a pure conscience, is requisite for usefulness.

Not only famous for preaching the Gospel, but he was also appointed by the joint suffrages of the churches, which were made by the lifting up or stretching out of the hand, as the word here used signifies; this brother was not chosen to this service by a few private persons, or by a single church only, but by several churches; which does not refer to the churches at Jerusalem and Antioch, as if the apostles were appointed, and others were appointed by these churches to travel with them, in order to collect money for the poor saints at Jerusalem; of which no mention is any where made, only of their being sent out by them to preach the Gospel. James, Cephas, and John indeed, when they gave to Paul and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that they might go to the Heathen, desired them to "remember the poor"; <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a> but these were not the churches. The church at Antioch did collect for the brethren in Judea, at the time of the famine among them, and sent their bounty by the hands of Barnabas and Saul, which seems to be the case here. This brother was chosen by the churches who collected, and not by the churches in Judea, for whom the collections were made; for it was usual, and what was right and proper, that the churches chose whom they thought fit to carry their liberality to Jerusalem; see <a href="/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">1 Corinthians 16:3</a>. Now this brother had the honour to be chosen by these churches, <p>to travel, says the apostle, <p>with us, with this grace; bounty or beneficence of the churches, what they had freely and liberally contributed for the supply of the poor, from a principle of grace, and by the assistance of it; <p>which is administered by us; not given by the apostles, but collected by them; or what was procured by their means, in the several churches to whom they had moved it, and by proper arguments had excited them to it, with which they cheerfully complied: and this was done on a two fold account, both <p>to the glory of the same Lord: Jesus Christ, who is the one Lord over all; the same Lord of the apostles, and the church at Corinth; the same Lord of the Corinthians, and the Macedonian and other churches; and the same Lord of the poor saints at Jerusalem, and the rich members of the several churches that contributed to them: and also to <p>the declaration of your ready mind; or to stir up their ready mind to increase it and promote it in them, as well to make it manifest, and that it might appear to others, how readily and freely they came into this service; so that the apostle's concern in this administration was not from any sinister and selfish ends; no, nor so much for the relief of the poor, though this was greatly designed, as for the glory of Christ, and the honour of his churches. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And not <i>that</i> only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and <i>declaration of</i> your ready mind:</span><p>(k) These alms which are bestowed for the relief of the church of Jerusalem.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/8-19.htm" title="And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:">2 Corinthians 8:19</a>.

The election of this brother had as its object, that by his co-operation in this matter Christ should be honoured[281] and our desire and love for the work should not be lessened “<span class="ital">ob metum reprehensionis illius, de qua mox loquitur</span>” (Bengel), but should be maintained and advanced by freedom from such hindering anxiety, and by a fellow-worker thus authorized.

Gr</span>. p. 252 [E.

Besides, his being elected was not the ground, but a consequence of his general repute, although it was the special ground for Paul’s sending him to Corinth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[281] Rückert, though following likewise our mode of connection, holds that to the <span class="greekheb">δίξα κυρίου</span> this companionship could only have contributed <span class="ital">negatively</span>, in so far as it was a precaution against any suspicion falling on the apostle, which suspicion—according to a mode of view also Pauline—would have been transferred to Christ. Why, then, not <span class="ital">positively</span> also? The brother had in fact been chosen as a travelling associate <span class="ital">co-operating</span> in the work of collection, so that by his election the work might be prosecuted more extensively and more successfully.
