They ought to introduce their younger brethren to the esteem and confidence of the people, by giving the praise which is due to them. For, as Doddridge observes, they will most effectually strengthen their own hands and edify the church, by being instrumental in setting forward others, who, on account of their faithfulness and diligence in the ministry, will in time merit the illustrious appellation of being <span class="ital">the glory of Christ.” </span>— Macknight. <span class="ital">Wherefore show before the churches — </span>Present by their messengers; <span class="ital">the proof of your love </span>to me and the saints — That is, an evidence that it is sincere; <span class="ital">and of our boasting on your behalf — </span>That it was not without foundation. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:16-24 The apostle commends the brethren sent to collect their charity, that it might be known who they were, and how safely they might be trusted. It is the duty of all Christians to act prudently; to hinder, as far as we can, all unjust suspicions. It is needful, in the first place, to act uprightly in the sight of God, but things honest in the sight of men should also be attended to. A clear character, as well as a pure conscience, is requisite for usefulness. They brought glory to Christ as instruments, and had obtained honour from Christ to be counted faithful, and employed in his service.

The Greek may mean either, "if any do inquire about Titus," or it may mean "if anything is to be said about Titus." The sense of the passage may either be, that some of the faction at Corinth might be disposed to inquire about the authority of Titus to engage in this work, or that Paul having said so much in commendation of the persons who went with Titus, it seemed proper also to say something in his favor also. The idea is, "If any inquiry is made from any quarter about him, or if it is necessary from any cause to say any thing about him, I would say he is my partner," etc.<p>He is my partner ... - He partakes with me in preaching the gospel, and in establishing and organizing churches; compare <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>. To the Corinthians this fact would be a sufficient commendation of Titus.<p>Or our brethren be inquired of - That is, the brethren who accompanied Titus. If any inquiry was made about their character, or if it was necessary to say anything in regard to them.<p>They are the messengers of the churches - They have the entire confidence of the churches, having been selected and appointed by them to a work of labor and responsibility; compare <a href="/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>. The words here rendered "messengers of the churches," are in the original "apostles of the churches," (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  apostoloi ekkle&#772;sio&#772;n). The word "apostles" here is used evidently in its proper sense, to denote one who is sent out to transact any business for others, or as an agent or legate. These persons were not apostles in the technical sense, and this is an instance where the word is applied in the New Testament to those who had no claim to the apostolic office. It is also applied in a similar way to Apollos and Barnabas, though neither, strictly speaking, were apostles.<p>And the glory of Christ - That is, they have a character so well known and established for piety; they are so eminent Christians and do such honor to the Christian name and calling, that they may be called the glory of Christ. It is an honor to Christ that he has called such persons into his church, and that he has so richly endowed them. Every Christian should so live as that it would appear to all the world that it was an honor and glory to the Redeemer that he had such followers; an honor to his gospel that it had converted such and brought them into his kingdom. It is sufficient honor, moreover, to any man to say that he is "the glory of Christ." Such a character should be, and will be, as it was here, a recommendation sufficient for any to secure them the confidence of others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. fellow helper concerning you&#8212;Greek, "fellow worker towards you."<p>our brethren&#8212;the two mentioned in 2Co 8:18, 22.<p>messengers&#8212;rather, as the Greek, "apostles": in the less strict sense (Ac 14:14).<p>of the churches&#8212;sent by the churches, as we are by the Lord (Php 2:25). There was in the synagogue an ecclesiastical officer, called "the angel of the Church," whence the title seems derived (compare Re 2:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse contains the apostle’s credential letters, given to Titus, and the other two persons, sent about the business of making this collection in the church of Corinth. Many, in matters where the drawing of their purses is solicited and concerned, are very scrupulous and inquisitive, seeking all advantages to excuse themselves; one while pleading their own poverty, another while objecting against the state, or want, or quality of those for whom they are solicited; again, questioning whether their charity shall ever come to those persons for whom it is desired, objecting against the persons intrusted with the conveyance or distribution of it. The apostle having, therefore, before obviated some objections, he here obviateth the last mentioned, letting them know, that the persons intrusted with this service were unexceptionable persons. He calleth Titus his <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">partner and fellow-helper concerning</span> them, that is, in the business of the gospel, and promoting the salvation of their souls. For the others, he tells them they were such as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the churches</span> had thought fit to make their <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">messengers; </span> so had the credit of the churches, whose messengers they were, who would not have intrusted them if they had not judged them faithful. He calleth either the churches, or them, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the glory of Christ.</span> If the words be to be understood of the <span class="ital">messengers.</span> (which seemeth the fairest application of them), the meaning is, that they were instruments of the glory of Christ: or persons who, by their grace, did bring much glory to Christ.

The acts and exercises of grace are indeed our acts, but the power by which we do them is from Christ: we glory in Christ, and by our holy conversations glorify Christ; and Christ glorieth in every pious and holy person, as God did concerning Job, <span class="bld"><a href="/job/1-8.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and eschews evil?">Job 1:8</a> 2:3</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Whether any do inquire of Titus,.... The apostle here sums up the characters of each of the above persons; as for Titus, he says, <p>he is my partner; he had been his companion in his travels, a partner with him in preaching the Gospel, as well as in the troubles and persecutions he had met with; and was one with whom he had had sweet communion and fellowship: <p>and fellow helper; or worker, <p>concerning you; he had been a joint instrument with him, either in their conversion, or consolation, and correction; or for their edification and instruction, and setting things right, which had been out of order among them: <p>or our brethren be inquired of; if their characters are asked after, as well as Titus's; by whom are meant not his fellow apostles, but the two brethren who were sent along with Titus; what may be truly said of them is, <p>they are the messengers of the churches; they were chosen and sent forth by the churches, not only to preach the Gospel, but particularly to take care of the ministration to the poor saints. They were messengers appointed by the churches for this service, and were also appointed to the service of the churches; respect seems to be had to the public minister in the synagogues, who was called  "the messenger of the congregation", or "church" (z); whose business was to take care about the reading of the law and the prophets, to pray in public, and also to preach if there was no other; so we read (a) also of  , "the messengers of the sanhedrim"; who were sent at the proper time to reap the sheaf of the first fruits, and of others who swore the high priest before the day of atonement (b); and of , "the messengers of the commandment" (c); who went to hear the exposition (of the traditions) and visit the head of the captivity: <p>and the glory of Christ: meaning either that the churches were the glory of Christ, in whom he is glorified, where his glory is seen, and his presence enjoyed; or rather the messengers of them, on whom the image of Christ was stamped, who faithfully performed the work of Christ, in all things sought his glory and not their own; and in and by whom his glory was displayed, and held forth to others. <p>(z) T.
