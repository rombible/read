The tense, “he went,” is what is known as the epistolary aorist. Titus was to start, probably, as the bearer of this letter.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:16-24 The apostle commends the brethren sent to collect their charity, that it might be known who they were, and how safely they might be trusted. It is the duty of all Christians to act prudently; to hinder, as far as we can, all unjust suspicions. It is needful, in the first place, to act uprightly in the sight of God, but things honest in the sight of men should also be attended to. A clear character, as well as a pure conscience, is requisite for usefulness. They brought glory to Christ as instruments, and had obtained honour from Christ to be counted faithful, and employed in his service.

The ground of Paul's thankfulness here seems to have been this, He apprehended probably some difficulty in obtaining the collection there, He was acquainted with the distracted state of the church, and feared that Titus might have some reluctance to engage in the service. He was therefore very agreeably surprised when he learned that Titus was willing to make another journey to Corinth and to endeavor to complete the collection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. being more forward&#8212;more earnest than to need such exhortation.<p>he went&#8212;Greek, "went forth."
