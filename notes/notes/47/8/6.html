Encouraged by the report of that success, St. Paul had now entreated Titus to return to Corinth, and to bring the good work to its completion. “This grace <span class= "ital">also</span>” practically means—this work of liberality, as well as that of repentance and loyal obedience already spoken of in 2 Corinthians 7.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also....">2 Corinthians 8:6-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Insomuch that </span>— Seeing this forwardness in them; <span class="ital">we desired Titus, that as he had begun </span>— When he was with you before; <span class="ital">so he would also </span>now <span class="ital">finish </span>among <span class="ital">you the same grace </span>— That is, fruit of grace, or charity; <span class="ital">also.

It is great grace and favour from God, if we are made useful to others, and forward to any good work. He commends the charity of the Macedonians. So far from needing that Paul should urge them, they prayed him to receive the gift. Whatever we use or lay out for God, it is only giving him what is his own. All we give for charitable uses, will not be accepted of God, nor turn to our advantage, unless we first give ourselves to the Lord. By ascribing all really good works to the grace of God, we not only give the glory to him whose due it is, but also show men where their strength is. Abundant spiritual joy enlarges men's hearts in the work and labour of love.

We were surprised at the extent of their liberality. And encouraged by this, we requested Titus to go among you and finish the collection which you had proposed and which you had begun. Lest you should be outstripped in liberality by the comparatively poor Macedonian Christians, we were anxious that you should perform what you had promised and contemplated, and we employed Titus, therefore, that he might go at once and finish the collection among you."<p>The same grace also - Margin, "Gift;" see the note on <a href="/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1</a>. The word refers to the contribution which he wished to be made. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Insomuch that&#8212;As we saw the Macedonians' alacrity in giving, we could not but exhort Titus, that as we collected in Macedonia, so he in Corinth should complete the work of collecting which he had already begun there, lest ye, the wealthy people of Corinth, should be outdone in liberality by the poor Macedonians.<p>as he had begun&#8212;Greek, "previously begun," namely, the collection at Corinth, before the Macedonians began to contribute, during the visit to Corinth from which he had just returned.<p>finish in you the same grace&#8212;complete among you this act of grace or beneficence on your part.<p>also&#8212;as well as other things which he had to do among them [Alford].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The same grace, </span> in this place, signifieth no more than the same gift, or the same good work, in collecting in the church of Corinth. If by <span class="ital">grace</span> here be understood the grace of God, the cause is put for the effect (as we had it in the first verse); but tou yeou being not here added, possibly it had been better translated gift, or free contribution; for how a minister should finish the grace of God, is hard to conceive; and the phrase is at best very hard, but he may be an instrument for completing a good work, which is done from a habit of Divine grace, by exhortations and arguments, which he may use to press the performance of it. Titus (it seemeth) had been diligent in some other places to make this collection; going to Corintlh the apostle presseth him to go on with it there also. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Insomuch that we desired Titus,.... Observing the very great readiness, cheerfulness, and liberality of the poor Macedonians in this matter, the apostles could do no other than desire Titus to forward, hasten, and accomplish a like liberal contribution among the Corinthians; or the sense is, that the Macedonians not only prayed with much entreaty, as in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-4.htm">2 Corinthians 8:4</a> that the apostle would be pleased to take their collection, and send or carry it to Jerusalem; but also that they would entreat Titus, <p>that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also; that is, that as he had already moved this affair to the Corinthians while he was with them, and had made some progress in it, though what, through one thing or another, it had been retarded, and lay in some measure neglected; that he might be desired to go again, on purpose to complete so good a work, so acceptable to God, and so useful to the poor saints; which carries in it a new and strong argument to stir up the Corinthians to this service; since they had not only the example of the Macedonian churches, but it was even at their request that Titus was desired to go upon this errand; and to this sense read the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>. <span class="ital">In order that we should exhort Titus</span>, etc. Comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/8-17.htm" title="For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went to you.">2 Corinthians 8:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τό</span> with the infinitive is here, as in all passages (see on <a href="/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a>), to be taken, not as <span class="ital">so that</span> (so usually, and by Winer), but as <span class="ital">telic: in order that</span>.

Certainly the <span class="greekheb">παρακαλέσαι ἡμᾶς τίτον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. was a <span class="ital">consequence</span> of the beyond expectation successful course of the matter in Macedonia, in accordance with which Paul might promise himself no less a success among the Corinthians; but delicately and piously he presents the state of the case, as if this further prosecution of the work of collection, amidst the self-sacrificing liberality of the Macedonians effected by the divine will, had lain in God’s <span class="ital">purpose</span>, and was therefore a consequence that had been <span class="ital">aimed at by God</span>. This flows from the <span class="greekheb">διὰ θελήμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεοῦ</span> immediately preceding. Comp. Hofmann also. Paul sees in the fact, that the divinely-willed success of the collecting work in Macedonia has encouraged him to the continuance of it expressed in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>, the fulfilment of the divine counsel and will, which he is thereby servin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>] Design in the <span class="greekheb">παρακαλέσαι</span>, and consequently its content.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καθὼς προενήρξατο</span>] <span class="ital">as he formerly has begun</span>, without doubt during his sojourn in Corinth after our first Epistle, see Introd. § 1.

The emphasis lies, as before on <span class="greekheb">προενήρξατο</span>, so here on <span class="greekheb">ἐπιτελέσῃ</span>. With the verb of rest <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> associates the thought of the previous arrival, so that <span class="greekheb">ἐλθέν</span> may for clearness be supplied. See Kühner, § 622 <span class="ital">b</span>; Jacobs, <span class="ital">ad Anthol.</span> XIII. p. 71; Ellendt, <span class="ital">Lex. Soph.</span> I. p. 537. The correlation of <span class="greekheb">ἐνάρχεσθαι</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐπιτελεῖν</span> is simply as in <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm" title="Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:">Php 1:6</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-3.htm" title="Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect by the flesh?">Galatians 3:3</a>; we should anticipate (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;">2 Corinthians 9:12</a>) by importing the idea of <span class="ital">sacrifice</span> (Osiander).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τὴν χάριν ταύτην</span>] not <span class="ital">hanc quoque gratiam</span> (Beza, Calvin, comp.

He shall complete among you—in addition to whatever else he has already begun and has still to complete—<span class="ital">also</span> this <span class="ital">benefit</span>. This better suits the context, namely, the connection of the <span class="greekheb">οὕτω καὶ ἐπιτελ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">καθὼς προενήρξατο</span>, than the interpretation of Estius: “dicit <span class="ital">etiam</span>, ut innuat Titum alia quaedam apud ipsos jam perfecisse.” So also Flatt. It is quite superfluous to invoke, with Hofmann, an involution of two sentences in order to explain the double <span class="greekheb">καί</span>. And since <span class="greekheb">καί</span> refers to the activity of <span class="ital">Titus</span>, Billroth is wrong in explaining it: “they are to distinguish themselves in this good deed, as in all things.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The work of collection is designated as <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>, for on the side of the givers it was a <span class="ital">showing of kindness</span>, a work of love, an <span class="ital">opus charitativum</span>. Observe that here and in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take on us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.">2 Corinthians 8:4</a>;

The Greek word is the same in both instances. The grace or favour is either (1) (see last note) the work of love which St Paul had accomplished in Macedonia, that of stirring up their zeal in giving; or (2) it may refer to the good work which God performed in their souls by means of His ministers, in drawing out all the best qualities of their renewed humanity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς</span>) Not the end, but the consequence is intended [“insomuch that”].—<span class="greekheb">καθῶς προενήρξατο</span>, <span class="ital">as he formerly began</span>) in regard to spiritual things, ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.">2 Corinthians 7:15</a>.
