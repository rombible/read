It is needful, in the first place, to act uprightly in the sight of God, but things honest in the sight of men should also be attended to. A clear character, as well as a pure conscience, is requisite for usefulness.

He knew how easy it might be for his enemies to raise the charge that he had embezzled the funds and appropriated them to his own use. He therefore insisted on having associated with him some one who had the entire confidence of the churches, and who should be appointed by them, and thus he was certain of being forever free from blame on the subject. A most important example for all ministers in regard to the pecuniary benefactions of the churches.<p>In this abundance ... - In this large amount which is contributed by the churches and committed to our disposal. Large sums of money are in our time committed to the ministers of the gospel in the execution of the objects of Christian benevolence.

The apostle here commendeth to all ministers and Christians, a prudent foresight of such scandalous imputations, as they may be exposed to (be their sincerity what it will) from the men of the world, who have no good will towards them; and a provision against them. Paul could have trusted Titus in the distribution of these alms, but he did not know what the world might say, had he discharged the trust alone; he therefore takes in one with him, to be a witness of his actions. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Avoiding this, that no man should blame us,.... There is an allusion in these words to mariners, who, when sensible of danger, steer their course another way, in order to shun a rock and secure themselves. So the apostles being aware of the censorious spirits of some persons, and to prevent all suspicion of their converting any part of what they had collected to their own private use, sent Titus with it, a man of known probity and integrity; and he not by himself only, but another brother with him, one who had obtained a good report as a minister of the Gospel in all the churches: and, besides, was appointed not by the apostles, but by the churches themselves, to this service. This shows the good conduct, and great prudence of the apostle, and his care and solicitude that the ministry be not blamed; he knew he had many enemies, and how subject such are to suspicion and jealousy, when persons are intrusted with much, which was the case here; for it is added, <p>in this abundance which is administered by us: which designs the very large contributions which were made by the churches, through the means of the apostle's moving, exciting, and encouraging them thereunto; and which were committed to their care and trust, and at their entreaty they had accepted of. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> abundance which is administered by us:</span><p>(l) In this plentiful liberality of the churches, which is committed to our trust.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/8-20.htm" title="Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:">2 Corinthians 8:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Στελλόμενοι τοῦτο</span>] goes along with <span class="greekheb">συνεπέμψαμεν</span> in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2 Corinthians 8:18</a>.

He knew that he lived in a censorious age, that he was as a city set on a hill, that the world would scan his every act and his every word, and attribute all conceivable and even inconceivable evil to what he did in all honour.

Yet with all his noble carefulness, St. Paul did not escape this very slander (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In this abundance.</span> The word, which occurs here only, means literally "succulence," but in the LXX. the adjective means "rich" (<a href="/1_kings/1-9.htm">1 Kings 1:9</a>). It here implies that the sum which had been collected by St. Paul's exertion was a large one. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Avoiding this (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>The verb, which occurs only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>, means to arrange or provide for.

Lit., thickness, and so, of the vigor or strength of the human body or of plants. Thus Hesiod speaks of the ears of corn nodding in their thickness. Herodotus: "When the harvest was ripe or full grown, (&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), he (Alyattes) marched his army into Milesia" (i. 17).

Herodotus uses it of thickly-falling snow (iv. 31). In the Septuagint it is used of the rich or great, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-9.htm">1 Kings 1:9</a>, princes (A.V., men of Judah); <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-6.htm">2 Kings 10:6</a>, great men. The A.V. abundance is better than Rev. bounty, which, though properly implying abundance, is currently taken as synonymous with gift. The reference is to the large contribution. </body></html>
