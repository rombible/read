To the Greek, Hades was a world of shadows.

In our Father's house there are many mansions, whose Builder and Maker is God. The happiness of the future state is what God has prepared for those that love him: everlasting habitations, not like the earthly tabernacles, the poor cottages of clay, in which our souls now dwell; that are mouldering and decaying, whose foundations are in the dust. The body of flesh is a heavy burden, the calamities of life are a heavy load. But believers groan, being burdened with a body of sin, and because of the many corruptions remaining and raging within them. Death will strip us of the clothing of flesh, and all the comforts of life, as well as end all our troubles here below. But believing souls shall be clothed with garments of praise, with robes of righteousness and glory. The present graces and comforts of the Spirit are earnests of everlasting grace and comfort. And though God is with us here, by his Spirit, and in his ordinances, yet we are not with him as we hope to be. Faith is for this world, and sight is for the other world. It is our duty, and it will be our interest, to walk by faith, till we live by sight. This shows clearly the happiness to be enjoyed by the souls of believers when absent from the body, and where Jesus makes known his glorious presence. We are related to the body and to the Lord; each claims a part in us. But how much more powerfully the Lord pleads for having the soul of the believer closely united with himself! Thou art one of the souls I have loved and chosen; one of those given to me. What is death, as an object of fear, compared with being absent from the Lord!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If so be that being clothed - This passage has been interpreted in a great many different ways. The view of Locke is given above. Rosenmuller renders it, "For in the other life we shall not be wholly destitute of a body, but we shall have a body." Tyndale renders it, "If it happen that we be found clothed, and not naked." Doddridge supposes it to mean, "since being so clothed upon, we shall not be found naked, and exposed to any evil and inconvenience, how entirely soever we may be stripped of everything we can call our own here below." Hammond explains it to mean, "If, indeed, we shall, happily, be among the number of those faithful Christians, who will be found clothed upon, not naked." Various other expositions may be seen in the larger commentaries. The meaning is probably this:<p>(1) The word "clothed" refers to the future spiritual body of believers; the eternal habitation in which they shall reside.<p>(2) the expression implies an earnest desire of Paul to be thus invested with that body.<p>(3) it is the language of humility and of deep solicitude, as if it were possible that they might fail, and as if it demanded their utmost care and anxiety that they might thus be clothed with the spiritual body in heaven.<p>(4) it means that in that future state, the soul will not be naked; that is, destitute of any body, or covering. The present body will be laid aside. It will return to corruption, and the disembodied Spirit will ascend to God and to heaven. It will be disencumbered of the body with which it has been so long clothed. But we are not thence to infer that it will be destitute of a body; that it will remain a naked soul. It will be clothed there in its appropriate glorified body; and will have an appropriate habitation there. This does not imply, as Bloomfield supposes, that the souls of the wicked will be destitute of any such habitation as the glorified body of the saints; which may be true - but it means simply that the soul shall not be destitute of an appropriate body in heaven, but that the union of body and soul there shall be known as well as on earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

But considering the clothing before mentioned was not this clothing, but the superinducing of an immortal, incorruptible, glorious state of body, upon our mortal, corruptible state, some judicious interpreters think, that the clothing here mentioned is the clothing of the soul with the body. It is manifest that the apostles apprehended Christ’s second coming much nearer than it hath proved. Therefore he saith, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a></span>: <span class="ital">We that are alive</span> (supposing that generation might live) to Christ’s second coming; and <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a></span>: <span class="ital">We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.</span> This some think (and that not improbably) is the cause of this passage; the sense of which they judge to be this: If so be that we be, at the resurrection, found in the flesh, clothed still with our bodies, and shall not be found naked, that is, stripped of our flesh, and dead before that time. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If so be that being clothed,.... This supposition is made with respect to the saints who shall be alive at Christ's second coming, who will not be stripped of their bodies, and so will "not be found naked", or disembodied, and shall have a glory at once put upon them, both soul and body; or these words are an inference from the saints' present clothing, to their future clothing, thus; "seeing we are clothed", have not only put on the new man, and are clothed and adorned with the graces of the Spirit, but are arrayed with the best robe, the wedding garment, the robe of Christ's righteousness, <p>we shall not be found naked; but shall be clothed upon with the heavenly glory, as soon as we are dismissed from hence. Some read these words as a wish, "O that we were clothed, that we might not be found naked!" and so is expressive of one of the sighs, and groans, and earnest desires of the saints in their present situation after the glories of another world. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</span><p>(2) An exposition of the former saying: we do not without reason desire to be clad with the heavenly house, that is, with that everlasting and immortal glory, as with a garment.

And therefore we do not sigh because of the weariness of this life, but because of the desire of a better life.

After <a href="/2_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed on with our house which is from heaven:">2 Corinthians 5:2</a> a comma only is to be placed, for <a href="/2_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.">2 Corinthians 5:3</a> contains a supplementary definition to what precedes (comp. Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell.</span> I. pp. 391, 395 f.), inasmuch as the presupposition is stated under which the <span class="greekheb">ἐπενδύσασθαι ἐπιποθοῦμεν</span> takes place: <span class="ital">in the presupposition</span>, namely, <span class="ital">that we shall be found also clothed, not naked</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">that we shall be met with at the Parousia really clothed with a body, and not bodiless</span>. The apostle’s view is that, while Christ at the Parousia descends from heaven, the Christians already dead first rise, then those still alive are transformed, whereupon both are then caught away into the higher region of the air (<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀέρα</span>) to meet the Lord, so that they thus <span class="ital">at their meeting with the Lord shall be found not bodiless</span> (<span class="greekheb">οὐ γυμνοί</span>), <span class="ital">but clothed with a corporeal covering</span>[211] (<span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμενοι</span>).

This belief is here laid down as certainty by <span class="greekheb">εἴγε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and as such it conditions and justifies the longing desire expressed in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed on with our house which is from heaven:">2 Corinthians 5:2</a>, which, on the contrary, would be vain and empty dreaming, if that belief were erroneous, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> if we at the Parousia should be found as mere spirits without corporeality; so that thus those still living, instead of being transformed, would have to die, in order to appear as spirits before the descending Christ. We cannot fail to see in the words an incidental reference to those of the Corinthians who denied the resurrection, and without the thought of them Paul would have had no occasion for adding <a href="/2_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>; but the reference is such, as takes for granted that the deniers are set aside and the denied fact is certain. As the whole of this explanation is quite in keeping with the context and the conceptions of the apostle, so is it with the words, regarding which, however, it is to be observed that the certainty of what is posited by <span class="greekheb">εἴγε</span>, <span class="ital">if namely</span>, is not implied in this particle by itself (in opposition to Hermann’s canon, <span class="ital">ad Viger.</span> p. 834), but in the connection of the conception and discourse.

The participle <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμενοι</span> refers, however, to the act of clothing previous to the <span class="greekheb">εὑρεθησόμεθα</span>, so that the <span class="ital">aorist</span> is quite in its right place (in opposition to Hofmann’s objection, that the <span class="ital">perfect</span> is required); and finally, the <span class="ital">asyndeton</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμ</span>., <span class="greekheb">οὐ γυμνοί</span> makes the contrasts come into more vivid prominence, like <span class="greekheb">γάλα</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐ βρῶμα</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.">1 Corinthians 3:2</a>; <a href="/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="But we, brothers, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>, and often; comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm" title="(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>. See Kühner, II. p. 461; Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Marc.</span> p. 31; Hermann, <span class="ital">ad Viger.</span> p. 887.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The most current exposition on the part of others is: “Si nos iste dies deprehendet cum corpore, non exutos a corpore, <span class="ital">si erimus inter mutandos, non inter mortuos</span>,” Grotius. So, following Tertullian (<span class="ital">de Resurr</span>. 41, though he reads <span class="greekheb">ἐκδυσ</span>.), Cajetanus, Castalio, Estius, Wolf, Bengel, Mosheim, Emmerling, Schrader, Rinck, and others, and, in the main, Billroth also, who, however, decides in favour of the reading <span class="greekheb">εἴπερ</span>, and deletes the comma after <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμ</span>.: “which (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> the being clothed upon) takes place, <span class="ital">if we shall be found</span> (on the day of the Lord) <span class="ital">otherwise than already once clothed</span> (with the earthly body), <span class="ital">not naked</span> (like the souls of the dead),” so that <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐ γυμνοὶ εὑρ</span>. together would be: <span class="ital">utpote jam semel induti non nudi inveniemur</span>. Against that common explanation, which J. Müller, <span class="ital">von der Sünde</span>, II. p. 422 f., ed. 5, also follows with the reading <span class="greekheb">εἴπερ</span>, the aorist participle is decisive (it must have been <span class="greekheb">ἐνδεδυμένοι</span>).[212] Billroth, however, quite arbitrarily imports the <span class="ital">already once</span>, and, what could be more unnecessary, nay, vapid, than to give a reason for <span class="greekheb">οὐ γυμνοί</span> by means of <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμ</span>. in the assumed sense: <span class="ital">since we indeed have already once received a body!</span> which would mean nothing else than: <span class="ital">since we indeed are not born bodiless</span>. Against Billroth, besides, see Reiche, p. 357 f. According to Fritzsche, <span class="ital">Diss.</span> I. p. 55 ff., <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμ</span>. is held to be in essential meaning equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἐπενδυσάμ</span>.: “<span class="ital">Superinduere</span> (immortale corpus vivi ad nos recipere) <span class="ital">volumus, quandoquidem</span> (quod certo scimus et satis constat, <span class="greekheb">εἴγε</span>) <span class="ital">etiam superinduti</span> (immortali corpore) <span class="ital">non nudi</span> sc. hoc immortali corpore, <span class="ital">sumus futuri</span> h. e. <span class="ital">quandoquidem vel sic ad regni Mess</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀφθαρσίαν</span> <span class="ital">perveniemus</span>.” But while the <span class="greekheb">ἐπενδυσάμενοι</span> may be included as a species among the <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμενοι</span>, as opposed to the <span class="greekheb">γυμνοί</span>, they cannot be meant exclusively. Besides, the thought: “<span class="ital">since we too clothed upon will not be without the immortal body</span>,” would be without logical import, because the <span class="ital">superinduere</span> is just the assumption of the future body, with which we attain to the <span class="greekheb">ἀφθαρσία</span> of the Messianic kingdom. According to de Wette, Paul says: “<span class="ital">if, namely, also</span> (in reality) <span class="ital">clothed, we shall be found not naked</span> (bodiless), <span class="ital">i.e.</span> as we then certainly presuppose <span class="ital">that that heavenly habitation will be also a body</span>.” So, in the main, Lechler, <span class="ital">Apost. u. nachapost. Zeitalt.</span> p. 138 f., Ernesti, <span class="ital">Urspr. d. Sünde</span>, I. p. 118, the latter taking <span class="greekheb">εἴγε καί</span> as <span class="ital">although indeed</span>. But the whole explanation is absurd, since the <span class="greekheb">ἔνδυσις</span> <span class="ital">could</span> not at all be conceived as at the same time its opposite, as <span class="greekheb">γυμνότης</span>; and had Paul wished to lay emphasis on the fact that the clothing would be none other than with a <span class="ital">body</span> (which, however, was quite obvious of itself), he must have used not the simple <span class="greekheb">γυμνοί</span> (not the simple opposite of <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμ</span>.), but along with it the more precise definition with which he was concerned, something, therefore, like <span class="greekheb">οὐ σώματος γυμνοί</span> (Plato, <span class="ital">Crat</span>. p. 403 B, and the passages in Wetstein and Loesner). According to Delitzsch, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 436, <span class="greekheb">εἰ καί</span> is taken as <span class="ital">although</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμ</span>. as contrast of <span class="greekheb">ἐπενδυσάμ</span>., so that there results as the meaning: though, indeed, we too, having acquired the heavenly body by means of <span class="ital">clothing</span> (not <span class="ital">clothing over</span>), shall be found not naked. As if this were not quite obvious of itself! When clothed, one certainly is not naked! no matter whether we have drawn the robe on or o2Co 5:Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, and Oecumenius take <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμ</span>. as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">σῶμα ἄφθαρτον λαβόντες</span>, but <span class="greekheb">γυμνοί</span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">γυμνοὶ δόξης</span>, for the resurrection is common to all, but not the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>. So also Usteri, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr.</span> p. 392 f.: “We long after being clothed upon, which event, however, is desirable for us only under the condition or presupposition that we, though clothed, shall not be found naked in another sense,” namely, denuded of <span class="ital">the garland</span> which we should have gained. Here also we may place Olshausen (comp. Pelagius, Anselm, Calvin, Calovius, and others), who takes <span class="greekheb">οὐ γυμνοί</span> as epexegetical of <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμ</span>., and interprets the two thus: <span class="ital">if we, namely, are found also clothed with the robe of righteousness, not denuded of it</span>. Comp. also Osiander, who thinks of the spiritual ornament of justification and sanctification; further, Hofmann on the passage and in his <span class="ital">Schriftbew.</span> II. 2, p. 473, who, putting a comma after <span class="greekheb">εἴγε</span> (“<span class="ital">if we, namely, in consequence of the fact that we also have put on</span>, <span class="ital">shall be found not naked</span>”), understands <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμενοι</span> as a designation of the <span class="ital">Christian status</span> (the having put on Christ), which one must have in order not to stand forth naked and, therefore, unfitted for being clothed o2Co 5:But where in the text is there any suggestion of a garland, a robe, an ornament of righteousness, a putting on of Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-27.htm" title="For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.">Galatians 3:27</a>; <a href="/romans/13-14.htm" title="But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.">Romans 13:14</a>), or of the Christian <span class="ital">status</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm" title="Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;">Ephesians 6:14</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a>), or anything else, which does not mean simply the clothing with the future body? Olshausen, indeed, is of opinion that there lies in <span class="greekheb">καί</span> a hint of a transition to another figure; but without reason, as is at once shown by what follows; and with equal justice <span class="ital">any</span> change in the figure <span class="ital">at our pleasure</span> might be admitted! This also in opposition to Ewald’s interpretation: “<span class="ital">if we at least being also clothed</span> (after we have had ourselves clothed, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> raised again) <span class="ital">be found not naked</span>, namely, <span class="ital">guilty</span>, like Adam and Eve, <a href="/genesis/3-11.htm" title="And he said, Who told you that you were naked?

But such a reference was just as remote from the mind of the apostle, who is speaking of himself and those like him, as the idea of Adam and Eve, of whom Beza also thinks in <span class="greekheb">γυμνοί</span>, must, in the absence of more precise indication, have remained utterly remote from the mind of the reader.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[211] That is, with the <span class="ital">new</span> body, no longer with the old.

Krit.</span> 1852, p. 709; Martensen, § 276; Nitzsch, Göschel, Rinck, and others, including Reiche,[213] <span class="ital">l.c.</span>), of which conception there is no trace in the New Testament;[214] but rather, since <span class="greekheb">γυμνοί</span> can only refer to the lack of a body: <span class="ital">if we, namely, even in the case that we shall be unclothed</span> (shall have died before the Parousia), <span class="ital">shall be found not naked</span> (bodiless), in which the idea would be implied: assuming, namely, that we <span class="ital">in every case</span>, even in the event of our having died before the Parousia, will not appear before Christ without a body; hence the wish of attaining the new body <span class="ital">without</span> previous death is all the better founded (<span class="greekheb">ἐπενδύσασθαι</span>). Similarly Rückert. Kling (in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1839, p. 511) takes it inaccurately: “<span class="ital">although we, even if an unclothing has ensued, will not be found bare</span>,” by which Paul is held to say: “even if the severing process of death has ensued, yet the believers will not appear bodiless on the day of the Lord, since God gives them the resurrection-body.”[215] The error of this view lies in <span class="ital">although</span>. No doubt Kling, with Lachmann, reads <span class="greekheb">εἴπερ</span>. But even this never means <span class="ital">quamvis</span> (not even in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-5.htm" title="For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)">1 Corinthians 8:5</a>), and the Homeric use of <span class="greekheb">εἴπερ</span> in the sense: <span class="ital">if also nevertheless, if even ever so much</span> (<span class="ital">Odyss.</span> i. 167; <span class="ital">Il.</span> i. 81, and Nägelsbach’s note thereon, p. 43, ed. 3), especially with a negative apodosis (see Hartung, I. p. 339; Kühner, II. p. 562), passed neither into the Attic writers nor into the N. T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[213] Reiche, p 364: “<span class="ital">Quo certior nobis est gloriosae immortalitatis spes</span> (<span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>, c. 2), <span class="ital">eo impensiore quidem desiderio, ut morte non intercedente propediem ad summum beatitudinis fastigium evehamur, flagramus; attamen vero etiam corpore hoc per mortem exuti sentiendi agendique instrumento non carebimus</span>.” <span class="greekheb">εἴγε καί</span> is, in his view, <span class="ital">concessive, moderating</span> the desire to assume the heavenly body without previously dying (<span class="greekheb">ἐπενδύσασθαι</span>, ver. 2): “Si igitur Deus votis (ver. 2) non annuerit, animum haud despondemus anxiive futura anhelamus, persuasi scilicet, et post mortem illico mentem nostram immortalem in statum beatissimum evectum iri,” etc. It is true that Reiche himself declares against the view that Paul here speaks of a <span class="ital">body intermediate</span> between death and resurrection; but his own view amounts to much the same thing, since Paul, according to it, is supposed to grant that we, unclothed of the earthly body by death, will yet “post mortem illico” be found not naked,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[214] The manner also in which the origin of this corporeality has been conceived, namely, as the soul’s self-embodiment by putting on the elements of the higher world (see, especially, Güder, <span class="ital">Ersch. Chr. unt. d. Todten</span>, p. 336, also West. in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1858, p. 280), has nowhere in Scripture any basis whatever. See, in opposition to it, Delitzsch, p. 438; Thomasius, <span class="ital">Chr. Pers. u. Werk</span>, III. 2, p. 436, who, however (p. 74 f.), for his part, answers in the affirmative the question, whether we are to think of “a change of clothing and clothing over of the new man <span class="ital">out of the transfigured corporeality of the Lord</span>, whose communion is <span class="ital">the blessed bread and the blessed cup</span>.” In any case, <span class="greekheb">γυμνοί</span> the <span class="ital">negation</span> of corporeality. But the question remains untouched (comp. the cautious remarks of J. Müller, p. 425), what organ of its activity the soul retains in death, when it is divested of the body. On this point we have no instruction in Scripture, and conjectures (like Weisse’s conception of the nerve-spirit) lead to nothing. The opinion that the <span class="ital">Lord’s Supper</span> has a transfiguring power over the body goes partly <span class="ital">against</span> Scripture (because it presupposes the participation of the <span class="ital">transfigured</span> body of Christ) and partly <span class="ital">beyond</span> Scripture (because the latter contains nothing regarding any power of the Lord’s Supper over the body). <span class="ital">Ultra quod scriptum est</span> is also the conception in Delitzsch of the <span class="ital">body-like appearance</span> of the bodiless soul itself, or of an <span class="ital">outline</span> of the same resembling in form its true inward state. Such theories bring us into the realm of phantasmagoric hypotheses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[215] So in the main did Chrysostom interpret the reading <span class="greekheb">ἐκδυσάμινοι</span> (for so we are to read in the explanation first quoted by him, comp.

This passage has been variously explained. Some regard it (1) as asserting that at the last day we are certain to receive a Resurrection-body, and not to be left as disembodied spirits. Others, as Bp Wordsworth, remembering that <span class="greekheb">γυμνός</span> does not mean literally <span class="ital">naked</span>, but (<a href="/john/21-7.htm" title="Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat to him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.">John 21:7</a>; cf. Xen. <span class="ital">Anab</span>. iv. iv. 12) <span class="ital">destitute of the upper garment</span>, interpret it (2) ‘if we shall be found in the Resurrection-body at the last day,’ not in the frail mortal tenement which we must otherwise resume. The chief objection to these interpretations is that the word ‘found’ applies rather to the condition in which we <span class="ital">are</span>, than to that in which we <span class="ital">are to be</span> when Christ comes. It will therefore be best to follow the interpretation which regards the passage as referring to the possibility of St Paul and those to whom he is speaking being alive at the coming of Christ (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a> and note on <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>), and to translate <span class="ital">if</span> (in that day) <span class="ital">we shall be found clothed</span> (with the body), <span class="ital">not naked</span> (i.e. disembodied). The various readings which are found in this passage increase the difficulty of explaining it. For (1) the word translated <span class="ital">if so be</span> is found in two different forms in the early Greek copies of this Epistle, the one expressing a greater, the other a less degree of uncertainty. Then (2) some copies read ‘unclothed’ for ‘clothed,’ so that the passage then runs <span class="ital">if when unclothed</span> (of the body) <span class="ital">we shall not be found naked</span>. But this reading was probably introduced by some copyist who could not comprehend the passage as it stood.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἴγε καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">if indeed even</span> [<span class="ital">if so be</span>]) That, which is wished for, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed on with our house which is from heaven:">2 Corinthians 5:2</a>, has place [holds good] should the last day find us alive.—<span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμενοι</span>, <span class="ital">being clothed</span>) We are clothed with the body, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed on, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>, in the beginning.—<span class="greekheb">οὐ γυμνοὶ</span>) <span class="ital">not naked</span>, in respect to [not stripped of] this body, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> dead.—<span class="greekheb">εὐρεθησόμεθα</span>, <span class="ital">we shall be found</span>) by the day of the Lord.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If so be that.</span> The verse may be rendered, "If, that is, being clothed, we shall not be found naked." The word "naked" must then mean "bodiless," and the reference will be to those whom, at his coming, Christ shall find <span class="accented">clothed in these mortal bodies</span>, and not separated from them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> quick and not dead (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>). This seems to be the simplest and most natural of the multitude of strange interpretations with which the pages of commentators are filled. It is true that the aorist <span class="accented">endusamenoi</span>, means literally, "having clothed ourselves," and that, in taking this meaning, we should have expected the perfect participle <span class="accented">endedumenoi</span>, having been clothed. If this be thought an insuperable difficulty, we must suppose the verse to mean "If, that is, in reality we shall be found [at Christ's coming] after having put on some intermediate body, and therefore not as mere disembodied spirits." But there is no allusion in Scripture to any intermediate body, nor is any gleam of light shed on the mode of life among the dead between death and resurrection, though the Church rejects the dream of Psychopannychia, or an interval of unconscious sleep. The uncertainty of the meaning is increased by two various readings, <span class="accented">ei per</span> instead of <span class="accented">ei ge</span>, which latter expresses greater doubt about the matter; and <span class="accented">ekdusamenoi</span> (D, F, G), which would mean "if in reality, after <span class="accented">unclothing</span> ourselves [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> after 'shuffling off this mortal coil'], we shall not be found naked." This seems to be the conjecture of some puzzled copyists, who did not see that a <span class="accented">contrast</span>, and not a coincidence, between the two expressions is intended. If this reading were correct, it would mean, as Chrysostom says, "Even if we would lay aside the body. we shall not there be presented <span class="accented">without a</span> body, but with the <span class="accented">same</span> body which has then become incorruptible." It is quite untenable to make "clothed" mean "clothed <span class="accented">with righteousness</span>," as Olshausen does. In the Talmud, 'Shabbath' (f. 152, 2), the righteous are compared to men who keep from stain the robes given them by a king (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> their bodies), which robes the king deposits in his treasury and sends the wearers away (bodiless) in peace; but foolish servants stain these robes, and the king sends the robes to the wash, and the wearers in prison. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>If so be (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;)<p>Assuming that.<p>Being clothed<p>Compare <a href="/job/10-11.htm">Job 10:11</a>.<p>Naked (&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;)<p>Without a body. The word was used by Greek writers of disembodied spirits. See the quotation from Plato's "Gorgias" in note on <a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>; also "Cratylus," 403, where, speaking of Pluto, Socrates says: "The foolish fears which people have of him, such as the fear of being always with him after death, and of the soul denuded (&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;) of the body going to him." Stanley cites Herodotus' story of Melissa, the Corinthian queen, who appeared to her husband after death, entreating him to burn dresses for her as a covering for her disembodied spirit (v., 92). The whole expression, being clothed - naked is equivalent to we shall not be found naked because we shall be clothed. </body></html>
