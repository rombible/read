(See Notes on <a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-8.htm" title="For we would not, brothers, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life:">2Corinthians 1:8-9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Earnestly desiring to be clothed upon.</span>—The words have suggested the question whether St. Paul spoke of the “spiritual body” to be received at the resurrection (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-42.htm" title="So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:">1Corinthians 15:42-49</a>), or of some intermediate stage of being, like that represented in the visions which poets have imagined and schoolmen theorised about, in the visions of the world of the dead in the <span class= "ital">Odyssey</span> (Book 11), in the <span class= "ital">Æneid</span> (Book vi.), in Dante’s <span class= "ital">Divina Commedia</span> throughout. The answer to that question is found in the manifest fact that the intermediate state occupied but a subordinate position in St. Paul’s thoughts. He would not speak overconfidently as to times and seasons, but his practical belief was that he, and most of those who were then living, would survive till the coming of the Lord (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15</a>). He did not speculate accordingly about that state, but was content to rest in the belief that when absent from the body he would in some more immediate sense, be present with the Lord. But the longing of his soul was, like that of St. John (<a href="/revelation/22-20.htm" title="He which testifies these things said, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.">Revelation 22:20</a>), that the Lord might come quickly—that he might put on the new and glorious body without the pain and struggle of the “dissolution” of the old. In the words “be clothed upon” (literally, the verb being in the middle voice, <span class= "ital">to clothe ourselves, to put on</span>) we have a slight change of imagery. The transition from the thought of a dwelling to that of a garment is, however, as in <a href="/context/psalms/104-1.htm" title="Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with honor and majesty.">Psalm 104:1-3</a>, sufficiently natural. Each shelters the man. Each is separable from the man himself. Each answers in these respects to the body which invests the spirit.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 The believer not only is well assured by faith that there is another and a happy life after this is ended, but he has good hope, through grace, of heaven as a dwelling-place, a resting-place, a hiding-place. In our Father's house there are many mansions, whose Builder and Maker is God. The happiness of the future state is what God has prepared for those that love him: everlasting habitations, not like the earthly tabernacles, the poor cottages of clay, in which our souls now dwell; that are mouldering and decaying, whose foundations are in the dust. The body of flesh is a heavy burden, the calamities of life are a heavy load. But believers groan, being burdened with a body of sin, and because of the many corruptions remaining and raging within them. Death will strip us of the clothing of flesh, and all the comforts of life, as well as end all our troubles here below. But believing souls shall be clothed with garments of praise, with robes of righteousness and glory. The present graces and comforts of the Spirit are earnests of everlasting grace and comfort. And though God is with us here, by his Spirit, and in his ordinances, yet we are not with him as we hope to be. Faith is for this world, and sight is for the other world. It is our duty, and it will be our interest, to walk by faith, till we live by sight. This shows clearly the happiness to be enjoyed by the souls of believers when absent from the body, and where Jesus makes known his glorious presence. We are related to the body and to the Lord; each claims a part in us. But how much more powerfully the Lord pleads for having the soul of the believer closely united with himself! Thou art one of the souls I have loved and chosen; one of those given to me. What is death, as an object of fear, compared with being absent from the Lord!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For in this - In this tent, tabernacle, or dwelling. In our body here.<p>We groan - compare note, <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>. The sense is, that we are subjected to so many trials and afflictions in the present body; that the body is subjected to so many pains and to so much suffering, as to make us earnestly desire to be invested with that body which shall be free from all susceptibility to suffering.<p>Earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house ... - There is evidently here a change of the metaphor which gives an apparent harshness to the construction. One idea of the apostle is, that the body here, and the spiritual body hereafter, is a house or a dwelling. Here he speaks of it as a garment which may be put on or laid off and of himself as earnestly desiring to put on the immortal clothing or vestment which was in heaven. Both these figures are common in ancient writings, and a change in this manner in the popular style is not unusual. The Pythagoreans compared the body to a tent, or hut, for the soul; the Platonists liken it to a vestment - Bloomfield. The Jews speak of a vestment to the soul in this world and the next. They affirm that the soul had a covering when it was under the throne of God, and before it was clothed with the body. This vestment they say was "the image of God" which was lost by Adam. After the fall, they say Adam and all his posterity were regarded as naked.<p>In the future world they say the good will be clothed with a vestment for the soul which they speak of as lucid and radiant, and such as no one on earth can attain - Schoettgen. But there is no reason to think that Paul referred to any such trifles as the Jews have believed on this subject. He evidently regarded man as composed of body and soul. The soul was the more important part, and the body constituted its mere habitation or dwelling. Yet a body was essential to the idea of the complete man; and since this was frail and dying, he looked forward to a union with the body that should be eternal in the heavens, as a more desirable and perfect habitation of the soul. Mr. Locke has given an interpretation of this in which he is probably alone, but which has so much appearance of plausibility that it is not improper to refer to it. He supposes that this whole passage has reference to the fact that at the coming of the Redeemer the body will be changed without experiencing death; (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>); that Paul expected that this might soon occur; and that he earnestly desired to undergo this transformation without experiencing the pains of dying. He therefore paraphrases it, "For in this tabernacle I groan, earnestly desiring, without putting off this mortal, earthly body by death, to have that celestial body superinduced, if so be the coming of Christ shall overtake me in this life, before I put off this body."<p>With our house - The phrase "to be clothed upon with our house" seems to be harsh and unusual. The sense is plain, however, that Paul desired to be invested with that pure, spiritual, and undecaying body which was to be the eternal abode of his soul in heaven. That he speaks of as a house (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  oike&#772;te&#772;rion), a more permanent and substantial dwelling than a tent, or tabernacle. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. For in this&#8212;Greek, "For also in this"; "herein" (2Co 8:10). Alford takes it, "in this" tabernacle. 2Co 5:4, which seems parallel, favors this. But the parallelism is sufficiently exact by making "in this we groan" refer generally to what was just said (2Co 5:1), namely, that we cannot obtain our "house in the heavens" except our "earthly tabernacle" be first dissolved by death.<p>we groan&#8212;(Ro 8:23) under the body's weaknesses now and liability to death.<p>earnestly desiring to be clothed upon&#8212;translate, "earnestly longing to have ourselves clothed upon," &c., namely, by being found alive at Christ's coming, and so to escape dissolution by death (2Co 5:1, 4), and to have our heavenly body put on over the earthly. The groans of the saints prove the existence of the longing desire for the heavenly glory, a desire which cannot be planted by God within us in vain, as doomed to disappointment.<p>our house&#8212;different Greek from that in 2Co 5:1; translate, "our habitation," "our domicile"; it has a more distinct reference to the inhabitant than the general term "house" (2Co 5:1) [Bengel].<p>from heaven&#8212;This domicile is "from heaven" in its origin, and is to be brought to us by the Lord at His coming again "from heaven" (1Th 4:16).

It is against the nature of man to desire death, which is the stripping or unclothing the soul of flesh; but not to desire that the garment of immortality may be put upon mortality, which is that our house from heaven, which is mentioned in <span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2 Corinthians 5:1</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For in this we groan earnestly,.... Meaning either for this happiness we groan, or rather in this tabernacle we groan. These words are a reason of the former, proving that the saints have a building of God; and they know they have it, because they groan after it here; for the groanings of the saints are under the influence and direction of the Spirit of God, who makes intercession for them, as for grace, so for glory, according to the will of God: and this groaning is further explained by <p>desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven; by which is meant not the glorified body in the resurrection morn; for though the bodies of the saints will be glorious, incorruptible, powerful, and spiritual, they are not said to be celestial, nor will they be from heaven, but be raised out of the earth: besides, the apostle is speaking of an habitation the soul will go into, and is desirous of going into as soon as it removes out of the earthly house of the body, and of a clothing it desires to be clothed with as soon as it is stripped of the garment of the flesh: wherefore, by the house from heaven must be meant the heavenly glory, which departed souls immediately enter into, and are arrayed with, even the white and shining robes of purity, perfection, and glory they shall be clothed with, as soon as ever their tabernacles are unpinned and dissolved. The Jews indeed speak of a celestial body which the soul shall be clothed with immediately upon its separation from the earthly body, and much in such figurative terms as the apostle does in this, and the following verse; <p>"when a man's time is come, say they (d), to go out of this world, he does not depart until the angel of death has stripped him of the clothing of body, (see <a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>) and when the soul is stripped of the body, by the angel of death, it goes   , "and is clothed with that other body", which is in paradise, of which it was stripped when it came into this world; for the soul has no pleasure but in the body, which is from thence, and it rejoices because it is stripped of the body of this world,    "and is clothed with another perfect clothing".'' <p>And a little after, <p>"the holy blessed God deals well with men, for he does not strip men of their clothes until he has provided for them other clothes, more precious and better than these, except the wicked of the world, who return not to their Lord by perfect repentance; for naked they came into this world, and naked (see <a href="/2_corinthians/5-3.htm">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>) they shall return hence.'' <p>And in another place (e), <p>"the soul does not go up to appear before the Holy King, until it is worthy to be clothed , "with the clothing which is above".'' <p>(d) Zohar in Exod. fol. 62. 1, 2.((e) Zohar in Exod. fol. 92. 2.

Previously, namely, the case was supposed: <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν</span> … <span class="greekheb">καταλυθῇ</span>; to which this <span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ ἐν τούτῳ</span> now corresponds, so that the train of thought is: “we know that, in case our present body shall have one day been destroyed, we have a body in heaven; for if this were not so, we should not already <span class="ital">in</span> the present body be sighing after the being clothed upon with the heavenly.”[208] This longing is an inward assurance of the fact that, if our earthly house, et.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ ἐν τούτῳ</span>] The emphasis is on <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>: <span class="ital">for also in this</span>.

This is proved to be the right interpretation by the parallel in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed on, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>, where our <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is represented by <span class="greekheb">οἱ ὄντες ἐν</span>. On <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, <span class="ital">also</span>, in the sense of <span class="ital">already</span> or <span class="ital">already also</span>, see Hartung, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 135; Stallbaum, <span class="ital">ad Plat. Gorg</span>. p. 467 B; Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Lucian</span>. p. 5 ff. With <span class="greekheb">τούτῳ</span>, according to the supposition of Grotius and others, including Fritzsche and Schrader, <span class="greekheb">σώματι</span> is to be mentally supplied, so that, as is often the case in the classic writers, the pronoun is referred to a word which was contained only <span class="ital">as regards the sense</span> in what preceded. See Fritzsche, <span class="ital">Diss.</span> I. p. 47; Hermann, <span class="ital">ad Viger.</span> p. 714; Seidler, <span class="ital">ad Eur. El</span>. 582. Rückert wrongly thinks that Paul in that case must have written <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>. This prevalent phenomenon of language applies, in fact, equally in the case of all demonstrative and relative pronouns; see the passages in Matthiae, p. 978 f. Seeing, however, that the following <span class="greekheb">τὸ οἰκητήριον ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ</span> proves that Paul also, in <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span>, was regarding the body <span class="ital">under the figure of a dwelling</span>, and seeing that he himself in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed on, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.">2 Corinthians 5:4</a> has expressly written <span class="greekheb">τῷ σκήνει</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">τούτῳ</span>, the supplying of <span class="greekheb">τῷ σκήνει</span> is to be preferred (so Beza and others, including Olshausen, Osiander, Neander, Ewald[209]). Others take <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span> as <span class="ital">propterea</span> (see on <a href="/john/16-20.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, That you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.">John 16:20</a>; <a href="/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a>), and refer it partly to what was said in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>, as Hofmann: “on account of the death in prospect” (comp. Estius, Flatt, Lechler, p. 138), or Delitzsch, p 436: “in such position of the case;” partly to what follows, which would be the epexegesis of it (Erasmus, Usteri, Billroth, the latter with hesitation). So also Rückert: <span class="ital">in this respect</span>. But the parallel of <a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed on, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.">2 Corinthians 5:4</a> is decidedly against all these views, even apart from the fact that that over which we sigh is in Greek given by <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> with the dative or by the accusative, and hence Hofmann’s view in particular would have required <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τούτῳ</span> or <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ οἰκητήριον</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐπιποθοῦντες</span> contains the <span class="ital">reason</span> of the sighing: <span class="ital">because we long for</span>, etc. Paul himself gives further particulars in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed on, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>. Hofmann wrongly thinks that Paul <span class="ital">explains</span> his sighing from <span class="ital">the fact</span>, that his <span class="ital">longing</span> applies to that clothing upon, <span class="ital">instead of which death sets in</span>. The latter point is purely imported in consequence of his erroneous explanation of <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span>. It is the sighing of the <span class="ital">longing</span> to experience the last change by means of <span class="ital">the being clothed upon with the future body</span>. This longing to be clothed upon with the heavenly body (not, as Bengel and many of the older expositors would have it: with the <span class="ital">glory of the transfigured soul</span>, to which view Hofmann also comes in the end, since he thinks of the <span class="ital">eternal light</span> in which God dwells and Christ with Him lives) <span class="ital">extorts the sighs</span>. Against the reference of <span class="greekheb">ἐπενδύσ</span>. to an organ of the intermediate state, see on <a href="/2_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>, Remark. According to Fritzsche, the participle is only a continuation of the discourse by attaching another thought: “<span class="ital">in hoc corpore male nos habentes suspiramus et coeleste superinduere gestimus</span>.” But in that case no logical reference would be furnished for <span class="greekheb">καί</span>; besides, it seems unwarrantable to supply <span class="ital">male nos habentes</span>, since Paul himself has added quite another participle; and in general, wherever the participle seems only to continue the discourse, there exists such a <span class="ital">relation of the participle to the verb</span>, as forms <span class="ital">logically</span> a basis for the participial connection.

According to Schneckenburger, <span class="greekheb">στενάζομεν ἐπιποθοῦντες</span> stands for <span class="greekheb">ἐπιποθοῦμεν στενάζοντες</span>, so that the chief fact is expressed by the participle (Nägelsbach on the <span class="ital">Iliad</span>, pp. 234, 280, ed. 3; Seidler, <span class="ital">ad Eur. Iph. T.</span> 1411; Matthiae, p. 1295 f.). An arbitrary suggestion, against the usage of the N. T., which is different even in the passages quoted by Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut.

The latter is what is thought of in the present passag.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπενδύσασθαι</span>] With this Paul passes to another but kindred figure, namely, that of <span class="ital">a robe</span>, as also among the Rabbins (Schoettgen, <span class="ital">Hor.</span> p. 693) and the Neo-Platonists (Gataker, <span class="ital">ad Anton</span>. p. 351; Bos, <span class="ital">Exercit</span>. p. 60; Schneckenburger, <span class="ital">Beitr.</span> p. 127) the body is frequently represented as the robe of the soul. See also Jacobs, <span class="ital">ad Anthol.</span> XII. p. 239. But he does not simply say <span class="greekheb">ἐνδύσασθαι</span>, but <span class="greekheb">ἐπενδύσασθαι</span>, <span class="ital">to put on over</span> (which is not to be taken with Schneckenburger of the <span class="ital">succession</span>; see, on the contrary, Plut. <span class="ital">Pelop</span>. 11 : <span class="greekheb">ἐσθῆτας ἐπενδεδυμένοι γυναικείας τοῖς θώραξι</span>, Herod. i 195: <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τοῦτον ἄλλον εἰρίνεον κιθῶνα ἐπενδύνει</span>), because the longing under discussion is directed to the living to see the Parousia and the becoming transformed alive. This <span class="ital">transformation</span> in the living body, however, is in so far an <span class="greekheb">ἐπενδύσασθαι</span>, as this denotes the acquisition of a new body with <span class="ital">negation of the previous death</span> (the <span class="greekheb">ἐκδύσασθαι</span>).
