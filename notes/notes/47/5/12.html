He hears his enemies saying, “So he is commending himself again;” and these words are the answer to that taunt. “No,” he says, “it is not so, but in appealing to the witness of the work done in your consciences we give you an ‘occasion’ (or <span class= "ital">starting-point</span>) of a boast which we take for granted that you, the great body of the Church of Corinth, will be ready to make for us.”<p><span class= "bld">That ye may have somewhat to answer.</span>—The opponents, of whom we are to hear more hereafter (see Notes on <a href="/context/2_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Do you look on things after the outward appearance?

Well-grounded hopes of heaven will not encourage sloth and sinful security. Let all consider the judgment to come, which is called, The terror of the Lord. Knowing what terrible vengeance the Lord would execute upon the workers of iniquity, the apostle and his brethren used every argument and persuasion, to lead men to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to act as his disciples. Their zeal and diligence were for the glory of God and the good of the church. Christ's love to us will have a like effect upon us, if duly considered and rightly judged. All were lost and undone, dead and ruined, slaves to sin, having no power to deliver themselves, and must have remained thus miserable for ever, if Christ had not died. We should not make ourselves, but Christ, the end of our living and actions. A Christian's life should be devoted to Christ. Alas, how many show the worthlessness of their professed faith and love, by living to themselves and to the world!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we commend not ourselves again unto you - This refers to what he had said in the previous verse. He had there said that he had such a consciousness of integrity that he could appeal to God, and that he was persuaded that the Corinthians also approved his course, or admitted that he was influenced by right motives. He here states the reason why he had said this. It was not to commend himself to them. It was not to boast of his own character, nor was it in order to secure their praise or favor. Some might be disposed to misrepresent all that Paul said of himself, and to suppose that it was said for mere vain-glory, or the love of praise. He tells them, therefore, that his sole aim was necessary self-defense, and in order that they might have the fullest evidence that he, by whom they had been converted, was a true apostle; and that he whom they regarded as their friend and father in the gospel was a man of whom they need not be ashamed.<p>But give you occasion - This is a very happy turn of expression. The sense is, "You have been converted under my labors. You profess to regard me as your spiritual father and friend. I have no reason to doubt of your attachment to me. Yet you often hear my name slandered, and hear me accused of wanting the evidence of being an apostle, and of being vain-glorious, and self-seeking. I know your desire to vindicate my character, and to show that you are my friends. I, therefore, say these things in regard to myself in order that you may be thus able to show your respect for me, and to vindicate me from the false and slanderous accusations of my enemies. Thus doing, you will be able to answer them; to show that the man whom you thus respect is worthy of your confidence and esteem."<p>On your behalf - For your own benefit, or as it were in self-vindication for adhering to me, and evincing attachment to me.<p>That ye may have somewhat to answer them - That you may be furnished with a ready reply when you are charged with adhering to a man who has no claims to the apostleship, or who is slandered in any other way.<p>Which glory in appearance - The false teachers in Corinth. Probably they boasted of their rank, their eloquence, their talents, their external advantages; but not in the qualities of the heart - in sincerity, honesty, real love for souls. Their consciences would not allow them to do this; and they knew themselves that their boasting was mere vain pretence, and that there was no real and solid ground for it. The margin is, "in the face." The meaning is, probably, that their ground of boasting was external, and was such as can be seen of people, and was not rather the secret consciousness of right, which could exist only in the conscience and the heart. Paul, on the other hand, gloried mainly in his sincerity, his honesty, his desire for their salvation; in his conscious integrity before God; and not in any mere external advantages or professions, in his rank, eloquence, or talent. Accordingly, all his argument here turns on his sincerity, his conscious uprightness, and his real regard for their welfare. And the truth taught here is, that sincerity and conscious integrity are more valuable than any or all external advantages and endowments. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The whole phrase <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ ἀφορμὴν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. combines with all the strength of apostolic self-confidence a tender delicacy, in which, nevertheless, we cannot help seeing a touch of irony (for Paul presents the cold and adverse disposition towards him, into which a part of the church had allowed itself to be brought by the hostile teachers, as lack of occasion to make their boast on his account!).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>After <span class="greekheb">ἔχητε</span> there is supplied either <span class="greekheb">τί</span> (<a href="/acts/24-19.htm" title="Who ought to have been here before you, and object, if they had ought against me.">Acts 24:19</a>): <span class="ital">in order that you may have somewhat</span> to oppose to those who, etc. (so Calvin and the most), or <span class="greekheb">τὶ λέγειν</span> (Theodoret, de Wette, Osiander), or <span class="greekheb">καύχημα</span> (rather <span class="greekheb">καύχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἡμ</span>., for these words go together).

A very striking description of the opponents as <span class="ital">hypocritical</span> boasters, not of the making a parade of their being immediate disciples of Christ (Hilgenfeld). The object of their self-boasting is the <span class="ital">countenance</span>, the holiness, the zeal, the love, etc., which present themselves on their countenance, but of the <span class="ital">heart</span> they make no boast; for of that of which they boast, their heart is empty.[223] “Ubi autem inanis est ostentatio, illic nulla sinceritas, nulla animi rectitudo,” Calvin. It is self-evident withal to the reader that this whole description is expressed according to the true state of the case, and not according to the design of the persons described themselves; for these wished, of course, to pass at all events for persons who with their self-boasting exhibited the virtues of their hearts, and not the semblance of their faces. Comp. Theophylact (following Chrysostom): <span class="greekheb">τοιοῦτοι γὰρ ἦσαν εὐλαβείας μὲν ἔχοντες προσωπεῖον</span> (mask), <span class="greekheb">ἐν δὲ καρδίᾳ οὐδὲν φέροντες ἀγαθόν</span>. Usually (also by Emmerling, Flatt, Schrader, Rückert, Räbiger, Neander) <span class="greekheb">ἐν προσώπῳ</span> is taken in the wider sense: <span class="ital">de rebus externis</span>, to which is then opposed in <span class="greekheb">καρδίᾳ</span> the purity of the disposition. Learning, eloquence, Jewish lineage, acquaintance with the older apostles, and the like, are held to be included in <span class="greekheb">ἐν προσώπῳ</span>; comp. Holsten, who recalls the <span class="greekheb">Ἑβραῖοί εἰσιν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-22.htm" title="Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.">2 Corinthians 11:22</a>. But with what warrant from linguistic usage? Even in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/16-17.htm" title="And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.">1 Samuel 16:17</a>, <a href="/matthew/22-16.htm" title="And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, neither care you for any man: for you regard not the person of men.">Matthew 22:16</a>, <span class="greekheb">πρόσωπον</span> means nothing else than <span class="ital">countenance</span>. Paul must have chosen some such contrast as <span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκὶ καὶ οὐ πνεύματι</span>, in order to be understood. Ewald explains it: “who doubtless <span class="ital">boast me before the face</span>, when they see myself present, <span class="ital">but not in the heart</span>.” But <span class="greekheb">καυχωμένους</span> cannot mean: who boast <span class="ital">me</span>, but only: who boast <span class="ital">themselves</span>. In the N. T., too, <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> with <span class="greekheb">καυχᾶσθαι</span> always denotes the <span class="ital">object</span>,[224] of which one makes boast, even in <a href="/james/4-16.htm" title="But now you rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.">Jam 4:16</a>. Comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/39-8.htm" title="He shall shew forth that which he hath learned, and shall glory in the law of the covenant of the Lord.">Sir 39:8</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/50-20.htm" title="Then he went down, and lifted up his hands over the whole congregation of the children of Israel, to give the blessing of the Lord with his lips, and to rejoice in his name.">Sir 50:20</a>. This, at the same time, in opposition to Hofmann’s view: “they make their boast only <span class="ital">in presence of others</span>, and not <span class="ital">inwardly before themselves</span>.” Neither <span class="greekheb">προσώπῳ</span> (see Winer, p. 116 [E.

The Corinthians were being robbed of this by the interested lies of St. Paul's opponents, who thought only about outward appearances. This is why no has set forth to them the aim and glory of his ministry. Nothing could be more gentle and forbearing than such a mode of stating his object.
