Yes, he does commend himself; but how? He looks back on his life of labour and sufferings and challenges comparison. Can others, with their letters of commendation, point to anything like this? The word “ministers” in the Greek is in the nominative case, while the English at least suggests that it is in the objective after the verb. What he means is that he, as the minister of God should do, commends himself by acts and not by words. It is obvious that what follows was likely to expose him to a repetition of the cynical sneer, but of this his generous indignation makes him nobly regardless.<p><span class= "bld">In much patience . . .</span>—Better, as elsewhere, <span class= "ital">endurance.</span> The word has a much stronger meaning than our English “patience.” (See Notes on <a href="/luke/8-15.htm" title="But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.">Luke 8:15</a>; <a href="/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>.) The general term is naturally followed by a specification of details. It is not, perhaps, easy to specify what he refers to under each head. Possibly he used such words, as we habitually use them, without a formal classification. The root-idea of the first word of the triad is that of being pressed upon; of the second, that of a constraint that leaves no choice of action; of the third, that of being so hemmed in that there is no room to move.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-10 The gospel is a word of grace sounding in our ears. The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the proper time to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know not what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a day of grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in every thing suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patience in afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper and behaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm them against temptations, so as to bear the good report of men without pride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They have nothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of such differences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a variety of conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even of the poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligently employ their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion, and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, when compared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But in all things - In every respect. In all that we do. In every way, both by words and deeds. How this was done, Paul proceeds to state in the following verses.<p>Approving ourselves as the ministers of God - Margin, "Commending." Tyndale renders it, "In all things let us behave ourselves as the ministers of God." The idea is, that Paul and his fellowlaborers endeavored to live as became the ministers of God, and so as to commend the ministry to the confidence and affection of people. They endeavored to live as was appropriate to those who were the ministers of God, and so that the world would be disposed to do honor to the ministry.<p>In much patience - In the patient endurance of afflictions of all kinds. Some of his trials he proceeds to enumerate. The idea is, that a minister of God, in order to do good and to commend his ministry, should set an example of patience. He preaches this as a duty to others; and if, when he is poor, persecuted, oppressed, calumniated, or imprisoned, he should complain, or be insubmissive, the consequence would be that he would do little good by all his preaching. And no one can doubt, that God often places his ministers in circumstances of special trial, among other reasons, in order that they may illustrate their own precepts by their example, and show to their people with what temper and spirit they may and ought to suffer. Ministers often do a great deal more good by their example in suffering than they do in their preaching. It is easy to preach to others; it is not so easy to manifest just the right spirit in time of persecution and trial. People too can resist preaching, but they cannot resist the effect and power of a good example in times of suffering. In regard to the manner in which Paul says that the ministry may commend itself, it may be observed, that he groups several things together; or mentions several classes of influences or means. In this and the next verse he refers to various kinds of afflictions. In the following verses he groups several things together, pertaining to a holy life, and a pure conversation.<p>In afflictions - In all our afflictions; referring to all the afflictions and trials which they were called to bear. The following words, in the manner of a climax, specify more particularly the kinds of trials which they were called to endure.<p>In necessities - This is a stronger term than afflictions, and denotes the distress which arose from want. He everywhere endured adversity. It denotes unavoidable distress and calamity.<p>In distresses - The word used here (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  stenocho&#772;ria) denotes properly straitness of place, lack of room; then straits, distress, anguish. It is a stronger word than either of those which he had before used. See it explained in the notes on <a href="/romans/2-9.htm">Romans 2:9</a>. Paul means that in all these circumstances he had evinced patience, and had endeavored to act as became a minister of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Translate, to mark the true order of the Greek words, "in everything, as God's ministers recommending ourselves," that is, that our hearers may give our message a favorable hearing, through our consistency in every respect, not that they may glorify us. Alluding to 2Co 3:1, he implies, We commend ourselves, not like them by word, but by deed.<p>patience&#8212;(2Co 12:12). Put first. "Pure-minded" follows (2Co 6:6). Three triplets of trials exercising the "patience" (patient endurance) follow: Afflictions (or "tribulations"), necessities, distresses (or "straits"); stripes, imprisonments, tumults; labors, watchings, fastings. The first triplet expresses afflictions generally; the second, those in particular arising from the violence of men; the third, those which he brought on himself directly or indirectly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God:</span> ministers of the gospel are in the first place to be considered as <span class="ital">the ministers of God; </span> secondarily, as ministers and servants of the church; which they ought to serve so far, as in serving it they do obey Christ.

It is not sufficient for a minister of the Gospel to avoid everything that might bring any blot or scandal on his ministry; but he should in all things, and by all ways and means, proper, lawful, and laudable, approve, prove, and show himself to be a true and faithful dispenser of the word. All in such an office ought to make it appear, that they are such by behaving and conducting <p>as the ministers of God; as becomes such, whom he has chosen, called, and fitted for that service; and particularly in, or <p>by much patience; by a large, constant, and continued exercise of that grace; and by bearing patiently many things for the sake of Christ, and his Gospel, without murmuring at the hand of God, or being angry with men, and without fainting and sinking in their own spirits: <p>in afflictions; that is, in patiently bearing, them. This word may be considered as a general word, including all sorts of afflictions whatever, of which the following are particular species: <p>in necessities; want of food, drink, and raiment, being hungry, thirsty, and naked, as the apostles sometimes were: in distresses; both of bad mind; being in such straits and difficulties they know not where to look, what course to steer, or which way to turn themselves. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But in all <i>things</i> <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> approving ourselves as the ministers of God, <span class="cverse3">{4}</span> in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</span><p>(b) Declare and indeed show.<p>(4) He first of all reckons up those things which are neither always in the ministers, nor without exception, unless they are there according to the minister's bodily condition.

To understand this as meaning <span class="ital">abstinentia a venere</span> (Grotius and others), or <span class="ital">contempt for money</span> (Theodoret), is a limitation without ground in the context, and presents too low a moral standard for a servant of Go.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν γνώσει</span>] Of the high degree of his <span class="ital">evangelical knowledge</span>, in particular of the moral will of God in the gospel, there is evidence in every one of his Epistles and in every one of his speeches in the Book of Acts. Calvin and Moras arbitrarily think that what is meant is <span class="ital">recte, et scienter agendi peritia</span>, or (comp. also Rückert and Osiander) true <span class="ital">practical prudence</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν μακροθυμίᾳ</span>] amid offence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν χρηστότητι</span>] <span class="ital">through kindness</span> (Tittmann, <span class="ital">Synon</span>. p. 140 ff.).

THE CONDITIONS AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS APOSTOLIC MINISTRY. We have in this noble description of his service a characteristic outburst of impassioned eloquence on a topic in which the Apostle felt an intense personal interest. But its fervour has not been permitted to interfere with the careful choice of words: the balanced antitheses, the rhythmical cadences and assonances, which abound throughout, betray the literary training of the writer, and recall at once such passages as <a href="/context/romans/8-31.htm" title="What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?...">Romans 8:31-39</a>, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal....">1 Corinthians 13:1-13</a>. Indeed many of the phrases which follow suggest an acquaintance with the Stoic paradoxes expressive of the <span class="greekheb">αὐτάρκεια</span> of the ideal sage. Compare also chap. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-22.htm" title="Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I....">2 Corinthians 11:22-28</a>, where he recounts in more detail the trials of his Apostolic ministry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>4. <span class="ital">approving</span>] The word is the same as is translated ‘commend’ in ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>, and there is an obvious reference here to <span class="ital"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain....">2 Corinthians 6:1-3</a></span> of that chapter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as the ministers of God</span>] There is an ambiguity in the A. V. here. The Apostle means ‘we, as ministers of God, recommend ourselves to those to whom we minister’ in the way afterwards mentioned, not that the Apostles prove themselves <span class="ital">to be</span> ministers of God by their conduct. Tyndale renders <span class="ital">let us behave ourselves as the ministers of God</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in much patience</span>] Dean Stanley divides the means by which the Apostle commended himself into four classes: (1) from patience (or rather <span class="bld">endurance</span>) to ‘fastings,’ referring to the bodily sufferings of the Apostle; (2) from ‘pureness’ to ‘love unfeigned,’ referring to the virtues, that is, the manifestations of the Divine presence in St Paul; (3) from ‘by the word of truth’ to ‘by evil report and good report,’ referring to the means whereby he was enabled to prove himself to be a true minister of God; and (4) the remainder, relating to the acceptation in which the Apostles were held, and its contrast with the reality. Bengel also would subdivide the first class into three triplets of sufferings. But this is perhaps somewhat fanciful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in afflictions</span>] The word thus rendered is translated indifferently by <span class="ital">tribulations</span> (Wiclif so renders it here) and <span class="ital">afflictions</span> in the A.
