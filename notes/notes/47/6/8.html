The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the proper time to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know not what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a day of grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in every thing suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patience in afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper and behaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm them against temptations, so as to bear the good report of men without pride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They have nothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of such differences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a variety of conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, when faithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even of the poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligently employ their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion, and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, when compared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By honor and dishonor - The apostle is still illustrating the proposition that he and his fellow-laborers endeavored to give no offence <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-3.htm">2 Corinthians 6:3</a>, and to commend themselves as the ministers of God, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">2 Corinthians 6:4</a>. He here <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-8.htm">2 Corinthians 6:8-10</a> introduces another group of particulars in which it was done. The main idea is, that they endeavored to act in a manner so as to commend the ministry and the gospel, whether they were in circumstances of honor or dishonor, whether lauded or despised by the world. The word rendered "by" (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768;  dia) does not here denote the means by which they commended the gospel, but the medium. In the midst of honor and dishonor; whatever might be the esteem in which they were held by the world, they gave no offence. The first is, "by honor." They were not everywhere honored, or treated with respect. Yet they were sometimes honored by people. The churches which they founded would honor them, and as the ministers of religion they would be by them treated with respect.<p>Perhaps occasionally also they might be treated with great attention and regard by the people of the world on account of their miraculous powers; compare <a href="/acts/28-7.htm">Acts 28:7</a>. So now, ministers of the gospel are often treated with great respect and honor. They are beloved and venerated; caressed and flattered, by the people of their charge. As ministers of God, as exercising a holy function, their office is often treated with great respect by the world. If they are eloquent or learned, or if they are eminently successful they are often highly esteemed and loved. It is difficult in such circumstances to "commend themselves as the ministers of God." Few are the people who are not injured by honor; few who are not corrupted by flattery. Few are the ministers who are proof against this influence, and who in such circumstances can honor the ministry. If done, it is by showing that they regard such things as of little moment; by showing that they are influenced by higher considerations than the love of praise; by not allowing this to interfere with their duties, or to make them less faithful and laborious; but rather by making this the occasion of increased fidelity and increased zeal in their master's cause.<p>Most ministers do more to "give offence" in times when they are greatly honored by the world than when they are despised. Yet it is possible for a minister who is greatly honored to make it the occasion of commending himself more and more as a minister of God. And he should do it; as Paul said he did. The other situation was "in dishonor." It is needless to say, that the apostles were often in situations where they had opportunity thus to commend themselves as the ministers of God. If sometimes honored, they were often dishonored. If the world sometimes flattered and caressed them, it often despised them, and cast out their names as evil; see the note, <a href="/1_corinthians/4-13.htm">1 Corinthians 4:13</a>. And perhaps it is so substantially now with those who are faithful. In such circumstances, also, Paul sought to commend himself as a minister of God. It was by receiving all expressions of contempt with meekness; by not suffering them to interfere with the faithful discharge of his duties; by rising above them, and showing the power of religion to sustain him; and by returning good for evil, prayers for maledictions, blessings for curses, and by seeking to save, not injure and destroy those who thus sought to overwhelm him with disgrace. It may be difficult to do this, but it can be done; and when done, a man always does good.<p>By evil report - The word used here (&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  dusphe&#772;mia), means, properly, ill-omened language, malediction, reproach, contumely. It refers to the fact that they were often slandered and calumniated. Their motives were called in question, and their names aspersed. They were represented as deceivers and impostors, etc. The statement here is, that in such circumstances, and when thus assailed and reproached, they endeavored to commend themselves as the ministers of God. Evidently they endeavored to do this by not slandering or reviling in return; by manifesting a Christian spirit; by living down the slanderous accusation, and by doing good if possible even to their calumniators. It is more difficult, says Chrysostom, to bear such reports than it is pain of body; and it is consequently more difficult to evince a Christian spirit then. To human nature it is trying to have the name slandered and cast out as evil when we are conscious only of a desire to do good. But it is sufficient for the disciple that he be as his master, and if they called the master of the house Beelzebub, we must expect they will also those of his household. It is a fine field for a Christian minister, or any other Christian, to do good when his name is unjustly slandered. It gives him an opportunity of showing the true excellency of the Christian spirit; and it gives him the inexpressible privilege of being like Christ - like him in his suffering and in the moral excellence of character. A man should be willing to be anything if it will make him like the Redeemer - whether it be in suffering or in glory; see <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>.<p>And good report - When people speak well of us; when we are commended, praised, or honored. To honor the gospel then, and to commend the ministry, is:<p>(1) To show that the heart is not set on this, and does not seek it;<p>(2) To keep the heart from being puffed up with pride and self-estimation;<p>(3) Not to suffer it to interfere with our fidelity to others and with our faithfully presenting to them the truth.<p>Satan often attempts to bribe people by praise, and to neutralize the influence of ministers by flattery. It seems hard to go and proclaim to people painful truths who are causing the incense of praise to ascend around us. And it is commonly much easier for a minister of the gospel to commend himself as a minister of God when he is slandered than when he is praised, when his name is cast out as evil than when the breezes of popular favor are wafted upon him. Few people can withstand the influence of flattery, but many people can meet persecution with a proper spirit; few people comparatively can always evince Christian fidelity to others when they live always amidst the influence of "good report," but there are many who can be faithful when they are poor, and despised, and reviled. Hence, it has happened, that God has so ordered it that his faithful servants have had but little of the "good report" which this world can furnish, but that they have been generally subjected to persecution and slander.<p>As deceivers - That is, we are regarded and treated as if we were deceivers, and as if we were practicing an imposition on mankind, and as if we would advance our cause by any trick or fraud that would be possible. We are regarded and treated as deceivers. Perhaps this refers to some charges which had been brought against them by the opposing faction at Corinth (Locke), or perhaps to the opinion which the Jewish priests and pagan philosophers entertained of them. The idea is, that though they were extensively regarded and treated as impostors, yet they endeavored to live as became the ministers of God. They bore the imputation with patience, and they applied themselves diligently to the work of saving souls. Paul seldom turned aside to vindicate himself from such charges, but pursued his master's work, and evidently felt that if he had a reputation that was worth anything, or deserved any reputation, God would take care of it; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1-4</a>. A man, especially a minister, who is constantly endeavoring to vindicate his own reputation, usually has a reputation which is not worth vindicating. A man who deserves a reputation will ultimately obtain just as much as is good for him, and as will advance the cause in which he is embarked.<p>And yet true - We are not deceivers and impostors. Though we are regarded as such, yet we show ourselves to be true and faithful ministers of Christ. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

This is arbitrary on the very face of it; besides, in this way of taking it there is no <span class="ital">mode</span> of the apostolic self-commendation at all expressed. Hence Billroth was right in trying to keep to the <span class="ital">instrumental</span> sense: “<span class="ital">as well honour as shame</span> (the latter, in so far as he bears it with courage and patience) <span class="ital">must contribute to the apostle’s commendation</span>” But, on the other hand, it may be urged that, according to the words, it must be the <span class="ital">shame itself</span> (as also the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> itself), and not the manner of bearing it, which commends. Hence it is rather to be taken: <span class="ital">through glory</span>, which we earn for ourselves among the friends of God, and <span class="ital">through dishonour</span>, which we draw on ourselves among opponents; through both we commend ourselves as God’s servants. On the latter idea (<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀτιμίας</span>), comp. <a href="/matthew/5-11.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.">Matthew 5:11</a>; <a href="/luke/6-22.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.">Luke 6:22</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm" title="If you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you; for the spirit of glory and of God rests on you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.">1 Peter 4:14</a>; also <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>.

The sense is that not only did he persevere through evil report and good report, but that both were overruled to the furtherance of the Gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as deceivers, and yet true</span>] The Apostle now reaches the last division of the modes in which he sets forth the genuineness of his mission. This consists in the contrast between the <span class="ital">ideas</span> of his person and work formed by the world without, and the <span class="ital">fact</span> of which he was conscious within. The world (<a href="/matthew/27-63.htm" title="Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.">Matthew 27:63</a>) held Jesus Christ to be a deceiver, and ‘the disciple is not above his master.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/6-8.htm" title="By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;">2 Corinthians 6:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δόξης</span>, <span class="ital">glory</span>) <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀτιμία</span>, <span class="ital">glory</span> and <span class="ital">disgrace</span> are derived from those, who possess authority, and fall upon those, who are present; <span class="ital">evil report and good report</span> are in the hands of the multitude, and fall upon the absent.

There is no need to change here the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>, "by means of," to "through," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "amid." The honour and dishonor are alike means which contribute to the commendation of the ministry. Of our Lord some said, "He is a deceiver," while others said, "He is a good man" (<a href="/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12</a>); and the dispraise of some is the highest praise (<a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>). Compare with the whole passage <a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9-13</a>, where we see that "abuse," "insult," and "slander," constituted no small part of the apostle's daily trial. <span class="cmt_word">By evil report and good report.</span> The beatitude of malediction (<a href="/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>). St. Paul had deliberately abandoned the desire to win the suffrages of men at the cost of undesirable concessions (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As deceivers.</span> The Jews called Christ "a deceiver" (<span class="accented">mesith, i.e.</span> a deliberate and misleading impostor), <a href="/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>; <a href="/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12</a>. This is an illustration of the "evil report," and in the Clementine homilies, a century later, St. Paul, under the disgraceful pseudonym of "Simon Magus," is still defamed as a deceiver. <span class="cmt_word">And yet true.</span> There is no "yet" in the original, and its omission gives more force to these eloquent and impassioned contrasts. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Deceivers<p>See <a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>. The opinions concerning Paul as a deceiver are mirrored in the Clementine Homilies and Recognitions, spurious writings, ascribed to Clement of Rome, but emanating from the Ebionites, a Judaizing sect, in the latter half of the second century. In these Paul is covertly attacked, though his name is passed over in silence. His glory as the apostle to the Gentiles is passed over to Peter. The readers are warned, in the person of Peter, to beware of any teacher who does not conform to the standard of James, and come with witnesses (compare <a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12-18</a>). Paul is assailed under the guise of Simon Magus, and with the same words as those in this passage, deceiver and unknown. </body></html>
