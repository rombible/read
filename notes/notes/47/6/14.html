The under-current of thought is, however, not difficult to trace. There was a false latitude as well as a true. The baser party at Corinth might think it a matter of indifference whether they married a heathen or a Christian, whether they chose their intimate friends among the worshippers of Aphrodite or of Christ. Against that “enlargement” the Apostle feels bound to protest. The Greek word for “unequally yoked together” is not found elsewhere, and was probably coined by St. Paul to give expression to his thoughts. Its meaning is, however, determined by the use of the cognate noun in <a href="/leviticus/19-19.htm" title="You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle engender with a diverse kind: you shall not sow your field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come on you.">Leviticus 19:19</a> (“Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with <span class= "ital">a diverse kind</span>”). Cattle were unequally yoked together when ox and ass were drawing the same plough (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-10.htm" title="You shall not plow with an ox and an ass together.">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>). Men and women are so when they have no common bond of faith in God. Another explanation refers the image to the yoke of a balance, or pair of scales, and so sees in the precept a warning against partiality in judgment; but this rests on very slender ground, or rather, no ground at all.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?...">2 Corinthians 6:14-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers </span>— Christians with Jews or heathen, godly persons with the ungodly, spiritual with such as are carnal. The apostle particularly speaks of marriage; but the reasons he urges equally hold against any needless intimacy or society with them. Of the five questions that follow, the three former contain the argument, the two latter the conclusion. <span class="ital">For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness </span>— The righteous can have no profitable, agreeable, or comfortable society or converse with the unrighteous. <span class="ital">What communion hath light </span>— That is, the state of light and knowledge, into which you are brought by divine mercy; <span class="ital">with darkness </span>— That deplorable state of ignorance and folly, vice and misery, in which they continue to be lost? <span class="ital">And what concord hath Christ </span>— Whom you serve; <span class="ital">with Belial </span>— To whom they belong, and who reigns in all the children of disobedience? <span class="ital">Or what part </span>— In time or in eternity; <span class="ital">hath he that believeth </span>— In Christ and his gospel, and who is a true, genuine disciple of Christ; <span class="ital">with an infidel </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Or an infidel with a believer?

If God would not endure idols in any part of the land where he dwelt, how much less under his own roof? He does not say, <span class="ital">with the temple of idols; </span>for idols do not dwell in their worshippers. This is a proper question, and a just view in which to place the matter; <span class="ital">for ye </span>— As a church, and as individuals; <span class="ital">are the temple of the living God. </span>See on <a href="/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

The word unbeliever applies to all destitute of true faith. True pastors will caution their beloved children in the gospel, not to be unequally yoked. The fatal effects of neglecting Scripture precepts as to marriages clearly appear. Instead of a help meet, the union brings a snare. Those whose cross it is to be unequally united, without their wilful fault, may expect consolation under it; but when believers enter into such unions, against the express warnings of God's word, they must expect must distress. The caution also extends to common conversation. We should not join in friendship and acquaintance with wicked men and unbelievers. Though we cannot wholly avoid seeing and hearing, and being with such, yet we should never choose them for friends. We must not defile ourselves by converse with those who defile themselves with sin. Come out from the workers of iniquity, and separate from their vain and sinful pleasures and pursuits; from all conformity to the corruptions of this present evil world. If it be an envied privilege to be the son or daughter of an earthly prince, who can express the dignity and happiness of being sons and daughters of the Almighty?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers - This is closely connected in sense with the previous verse. The apostle is there stating the nature of the remuneration or recompence which he asks for all the love which he had shown to them. He here says, that one mode of remuneration would be to yield obedience to his commands, and to separate themselves from all improper alliance with unbelievers. "Make me this return for my love. Love me as a proof of your affection, be not improperly united with unbelievers. Listen to me as a father addressing his children, and secure your own happiness and piety by not being unequally yoked with those who are not Christians." The word which is used here (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  heterozugeo&#772;) means properly, to bear a different yoke, to be yoked heterogeneously - Robinson (Lexicon). It is applied to the custom of yoking animals of different kinds together (Passow); and as used here means not to mingle together, or be united with unbelievers.<p>It is implied in the use of the word that there is a dissimilarity between believers and unbelievers so great that it is as improper for them to mingle together as it is to yoke animals of different kinds and species. The ground of the injunction is, that there is a difference between Christians and those who are not, so great as to render such unions improper and injurious. The direction here refers doubtless to all kinds of improper connections with those who were unbelievers. It has been usually supposed by commentators to refer particularly to marriage. But there is no reason for confining it to marriage. It doubtless includes that, but it may as well refer to any other intimate connection, or to intimate friendships, or to participation in their amusements and employments, as to marriage. The radical idea is, that they were to abstain from all connections with unbelievers - with infidels, and pagans, and those who were not Christians, which would identify them with them; or they were to have no connection with them in anything as unbelievers, pagans, or infidels; they were to partake with them in nothing that was special to them as such.<p>They were to have no part with them in their paganism unbelief, and idolatry, and infidelity; they were not to be united with them in any way or sense where it would necessarily be understood that they were partakers with them in those things. This is evidently the principle here laid down, and this principle is as applicable now as it was then. In the remainder of this verse and the following verses <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-15.htm">2 Corinthians 6:15-16</a>, he states reasons why they should have no such contact. There is no principle of Christianity that is more important than that which is here stated by the apostle; and none in which Christians are more in danger of erring, or in which they have more difficulty in determining the exact rule which they are to follow. The questions which arise are very important. Are we to have no contact with the people of the world? Are we cut loose from all our friends who are not Christians? Are we to become monks, and live a recluse and unsocial life? Are we never to mingle with the people of the world in business, in innocent recreation, or in the duties of citizens, and as neighbors and friends? It is important, therefore, in the highest degree, to endeavor to ascertain what are the principles on which the New Testament requires us to act in this matter. And in order to a correct understanding of this, the following principles may be suggested:<p>I. There is a large field of action, pursuit, principle, and thought, over which infidelity, sin, paganism, and the world as such, have the entire control. It is wholly without the range of Christian law, and stands opposed to Christian law. It pertains to a different kingdom; is conducted by different principles, and tends to destroy and annihilate the kingdom of Christ. It cannot be reconciled with Christian principle, and cannot be conformed to but in entire violation of the influence of religion. Here the prohibition of the New Testament is absolute and entire. Christians are not to mingle with the people of the world in these things; and are not to partake of them. This prohibition, it is supposed, extends to the following, among other things:<p>(1) To idolatry. This was plain. On no account or pretence were the early Christians to partake of that, or to countenance it. In primitive times, during the Roman persecutions, all that was asked was that they should cast a little incense on the altar of a pagan god. They refused to do it, and because they refused to do it, thousands perished as martyrs. They judged rightly; and the world has approved their cause.<p>(2) sin, vice, licentiousness. This is also plain. Christians are in no way to patronise them, or to lend their influence to them, or to promote them by their name, their presence, or their property. "Neither be partakers of other people's sins;" <a href="/1_timothy/5-22.htm">1 Timothy 5:22</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-11.htm">2 John 1:11</a>.<p>(3) arts and acts of dishonesty, deception, and fraud in traffic and trade. Here the prohibition also must be absolute. No Christian can have a right to enter into partnership with another where the business is to be conducted on dishonest and unchristian principles, or where it shall lead to the violation of any of the laws of God. If it involves deception and fraud in the principles on which it is conducted; if it spreads ruin and poverty - as the distilling and vending of ardent spirits does; if it leads to the necessary violation of the Christian Sabbath, then the case is plain. A Christian is to have no "fellowship with such unfruitful works of darkness, but is rather to reprove them;" <a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>.<p>(4) the amusements and pleasures that are entirely worldly, and sinful in their nature; that are wholly under worldly influence, and which cannot be brought under Christian principles. Nearly all amusements are of this description. The true principle here seems to be, that if a Christian in such a place is expected to lay aside his Christian principles, and if it would be deemed indecorous and improper for him to introduce the subject of religion, or if religion would be regarded is entirely inconsistent with the nature of the amusement then he is not to be found there. The world reigns there, and if the principles of his Lord and Master would be excluded, he should not be there. This applies of course to the theater, the circus, the ballroom, and to large and splendid parties of pleasure. We are not to associate with idolaters in their idolatry; nor with the licentious in their licentiousness; nor with the infidel in his infidelity; nor with the proud in their pride; nor with the frivolous in their gaiety; nor with the friends of the theater, or the ballroom, or the circus in their attachment to these places and pursuits. And whatever other connection we are to have with them as neighbors, citizens, or members of our families, we are not to participate with them in these things. Thus far all seems to be clear; and the rule is a plain one whether it applies to marriage, or to business, or to religion, or to pleasure; compare note, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-10.htm">1 Corinthians 5:10</a>.<p>II. There is a large field of action, thought, and plan which may be said to be common with the Christian and the world; that is, where the Christian is not expected to abandon his own principles, and where there will be, or need be, no compromise of the sternest views of truth, or the most upright, serious, and holy conduct. He may carry his principles with him; may always manifest them if necessary; and may even commend them to others. A few of these may be referred to.<p>(1) Commercial transactions and professional engagements that are conducted on honest and upright principles, even when those with whom we act are not Christians.<p>(2) Literary and scientific pursuits, which never, when pursued with a right spirit, interfere with the principles of Christianity, and never are contrary to it.<p>(3) the love and affection which are due to relatives and friends. Nothing in the Bible assuredly will prohibit a pious son from uniting with one who is not pious in supporting an aged and infirm parent, or a much loved and affectionate sister. The same remark is true also respecting the duty which a wife owes to a husband, a husband to a wife, or a parent to a child, though one of them should not be a Christian. And the same observation is true also of neighbors, who are not to be prohibited from uniting as neighbors in social contact, and in acts of common kindness and charity, though all not Christians.<p>(4) as citizens. We owe duties to our country, and a Christian need not refuse to act with others in the elective franchise, or in making or administering the laws. Here, however, it is clear that he is not at liberty to violate the laws and the principles of the Bible. He cannot be at liberty to unite with them in political schemes that are contrary to the Law of God, or in elevating to office people whom he cannot vote for with a good conscience as qualified for the station.<p>(5) in plans of public improvement, in schemes that go to the advancement of the public welfare, when the schemes do not violate the laws of God. But if they involve the necessity of violating the Sabbath, or any of the laws of God, assuredly he cannot consistently participate in them.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. Be not&#8212;Greek, "Become not."<p>unequally yoked&#8212;"yoked with one alien in spirit." The image is from the symbolical precept of the law (Le 19:19), "Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind"; or the precept (De 22:10), "Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together." Compare De 7:3, forbidding marriages with the heathen; also 1Co 7:39. The believer and unbeliever are utterly heterogeneous.

The precept is delivered in a term of more general significancy, than to be limited by either of these, though both of them, questionless, be comprehended in it: mh ginesye eterozugountev, do not become such as in the same yoke draw another way. It is a metaphor drawn from horses or oxen; which should draw together, being in the same yoke, neither standing still, nor yet holding back. It is a general precept, prohibitive of all unnecessary communion and intimate fellowship with such, as either in matters of faith or worship, or in their lives and conversations, declare themselves to be unbelievers; for why we should expound apistoiv of infidels merely, I cannot tell, especially considering that the apostle, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="I wrote to you in an letter not to company with fornicators:...">1 Corinthians 5:9-11</a></span>, seems to allow a further communion with a heathen, than with a notoriously scandalous Christian. So as this precept may reasonably be interpreted by those in the former Epistle, of marrying with such, eating with them at idol feasts, or at the Lord’s table, <span class="ital">{as <span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens....">2 Corinthians 5:1-21</a></span>}</span> maintaining intimate communion with them, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?</span> The reason he giveth, is, because they could have no comfortable communion with such; they were <span class="ital">righteousness, </span> those persons were <span class="ital">unrighteousness; </span> they were <span class="ital">light, </span> such persons were <span class="ital">darkness, </span> that is, full of the darkness of sin and ignorance. In the mean time, this precept ought not to be extended to a total avoiding of commerce with, or being in the company of, either heathens, or scandalous persons; for as to that, the same apostle had before determined it lawful, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a></span>. Whatever communion with such persons is either necessary from the law of God or nature, or for the support and upholding of human life and society, is lawful even with such persons; but all other is unlawful. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers,.... This seems to be an allusion to the law in <a href="/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a> and to be a mystical explanation of it; and is to be understood not as forbidding civil society and converse with unbelievers; for this is impracticable, then must believers needs go out of the world; this the many natural and civil relations subsisting among men make absolutely necessary; and in many cases is both lawful and laudable, especially when there is any opportunity or likelihood of doing them any service in a spiritual way: not is it to be understood as dehorting from entering into marriage contracts with such persons; for such marriages the apostle, in his former epistle, had allowed to be lawful, and what ought to be abode by; though believers would do well carefully to avoid such an unequal yoke, since oftentimes they are hereby exposed to many snares, temptations, distresses, and sorrows, which generally more or less follow hereon: but there is nothing in the text or context that lead to such an interpretation; rather, if any particular thing is referred to, it is to joining with unbelievers in acts of idolatry; since one of the apostle's arguments to dissuade from being unequally yoked with unbelievers is, "what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?" and from the foregoing epistle it looks as if some in this church had joined with them in such practices; see <a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>. But I rather think that these words are a dissuasive in general, from having any fellowship with unbelievers in anything sinful and criminal, whether in worship or in conversation: <p>for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? This, with what is said in the following verse, and in the beginning of the next to that, contain reasons or arguments engaging believers to attend to the exhortation given not to keep company with unbelievers. By "righteousness" is meant righteous persons, who are made the righteousness of God in Christ, to whom Christ is made righteousness, or to whom the righteousness of Christ is imputed for justification; and who also have principles of grace and holiness in their hearts, or have the kingdom of God in them, which consists of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost; and who being made free from the dominion of sin, are become servants of righteousness: and by unrighteousness is designed unrighteous persons, who are destitute of a justifying righteousness, are filled with all unrighteousness, and are, as it were, a mass and lump of iniquity; now, what fellowship can there be between persons of such distant characters? <p>And what communion hath light with darkness? regenerate men are made light in the Lord; they are enlightened into their state and condition by nature, to see the exceeding sinfulness of sin, to behold the glory, beauty, fulness, and suitableness of Christ, so as to be sensible of their need of him, and to be able to look unto him for life and salvation; they are enlightened more or less into the doctrines of the Gospel, and the duties of religion; and their path is a shining light, shining more and more unto the perfect day. Unregenerate persons are "darkness" itself; they are dark and ignorant of God in Christ, of the way of salvation by Christ, of the work of the Spirit of God upon the heart, and of the mysteries of grace; they know not themselves, nor the sad estate they are in; they are born, and brought up in darkness worse than Egyptian darkness; they go on in it, and if grace prevent not, will be cast into utter and eternal darkness. Now, what "communion" can there be between persons so different one from another? for what is more so than light and darkness? these the God of nature has divided from each other; and they are in nature irreconcilable to one another, and so they are in grace. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?</span><p>(7) Now he rebukes them boldly, because they became fellows with infidels in outward idolatry, as though it were an indifferent thing.

II. p. 557. Paul undoubtedly has in mind the figurative conception of two different animals (as ox and ass) which are yoked together in violation of the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-9.htm" title="You shall not sow your vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of your seed which you have sown, and the fruit of your vineyard, be defiled.">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>),—a conception, in which the heterogeneous fellowship of Christians with heathen is aptly portrayed: <span class="ital">drawing a yoke strange to you</span>. In this verse the dative <span class="greekheb">ἀπίστοις</span> denotes a fellowship, in which the unbelieving partner <span class="ital">forms the standard which determines</span> the mode of thought and action of the Christian partner. For this dative cannot mean “<span class="ital">with unbelievers</span>” (the usual explanation), as if <span class="greekheb">συζυγοῦντες</span> had been used; but it is not so much <span class="ital">dativus commodi</span> (Hofmann: <span class="ital">for the pleasure</span> of unbelievers), a thought which Paul would have doubtless expressed with more precision, as the <span class="ital">dativus ethicus</span> (Krüger, § 48. 6); so that the words mean: do not draw <span class="ital">for unbelievers</span> a strange yoke. The yoke meant is that drawn by unbelievers, one of a kind strange to Christians (<span class="greekheb">ἑτεροῖον</span>), and the latter are not to <span class="ital">put themselves at the disposal</span> of unbelievers by sharing the drawing it. The great <span class="ital">danger</span> of the relation against which Paul warns them, lies in this dative expression. According to Theophylact (comp.

The most obvious application of such a prohibition would be to intermarriage with the heathen, which was continually forbidden to the chosen people (see <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm" title="Neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall you take to your son.">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>, <a href="/joshua/23-12.htm" title="Else if you do in any wise go back, and join to the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you:">Joshua 23:12</a>, <a href="/ezra/9-2.htm" title="For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.">Ezra 9:2</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/13-25.htm" title="And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons, or for yourselves.">Nehemiah 13:25</a>), and this is probably the main thought here (see ref.

PARENTHETICAL.—HE WARNS THEM AGAINST TOO FAMILIAR ASSOCIATION WITH THEIR HEATHEN NEIGHBOURS. These verses are somewhat perplexing, inasmuch as they seem to interrupt the appeal of <a href="/context/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged....">2 Corinthians 6:11-13</a> by the introduction of an irrelevant warning. If they be omitted, the argument is quite consecutive, <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a> f. being in close and evident connexion with <a href="/context/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged....">2 Corinthians 6:11-13</a>. And it has been supposed that the whole section is an interpolation either (<span class="ital">a</span>) added by St. Paul after the arrival of Titus, in consequence of the news he had received as to the state of the Corinthian Church; or (<span class="ital">b</span>) belonging to another Pauline letter (possibly the Lost Epistle of <a href="/1_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="I wrote to you in an letter not to company with fornicators:">1 Corinthians 5:9</a>), and inserted here at a later date when a collection of Pauline letters began to be made; or (<span class="ital">c</span>) it has been regarded (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by Heinrici) as a fragment of an ancient homily, <span class="ital">not</span> by St. Paul, which has found a resting place here. It is urged in favour of the non-Pauline authorship of the section that (<span class="greekheb">α</span>) it contains a considerable number of words which do not occur elsewhere in St. Paul. To this it may be replied that <span class="greekheb">ἑτεροζυγεῖν</span> and <span class="greekheb">βελίαρ</span> have their origin in O.T. phraseology, while <span class="greekheb">μολυσμός</span> is a LXX word (see reff.); and that, as to the words <span class="greekheb">μετοχή</span>, <span class="greekheb">συμφώνησις</span>, <span class="greekheb">συγκατάθεσις</span>, it is not surprising that some of the synonyms which are found in this section should be comparatively rare. It is not easy to find (as has here been done, with no small skill) <span class="ital">five</span> distinct terms to convey almost the same idea. (<span class="greekheb">β</span>) Schmiedel urges that the phrase <span class="greekheb">μολυσμός σαρκός</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>) is quite un-Pauline, and that it is inconsistent with St. Paul’s psychology to speak of being “cleansed” from it, inasmuch as for him the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> is always tainted by sin. But there is no thought here of the taint of sin which remains in fallen man; <span class="greekheb">μολυσμός</span> is always used in the LXX (see reff.) of a too intimate association of the chosen people with heathen nations, and such “contamination” is exactly what it stands for in this place. As an argument on the other side, there occur in this section several quite common Pauline ideas and phrases, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the contrast of Christianity and heathendom as light and darkness (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>), the description of Christians as God’s temple (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>), the phrases “the living God” (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>) and “the fear of God” (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>), the introduction of the term <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπητοί</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>), etc. We regard, therefore, the section as undoubtedly Pauline; and, further, its connexion with what precedes reveals itself on a close inspection of the phraseology. The Apostle has bidden the Corinthians “Be ye enlarged in heart”. But he is reminded that this phrase has a bad meaning in the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-16.htm" title="Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;">Deuteronomy 11:16</a>; see Chase, <span class="ital">Classical Review</span>, 1890, p. 151), where it is applied to that excessive tolerance which should permit the worship of other gods beside Jehovah; and so he hastens to give a warning (parenthetically introduced) to the Corinthians that he does not mean by enlargement of heart any undue tolerance of or contaminating association with their heathen neighbours (see on <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a> above for <span class="greekheb">ἄπιστος</span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>14. <span class="ital">Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers</span>] Dean Stanley observes on the “remarkable dislocation of the argument here.” But the connection of thought is not difficult to trace. The only reward (see last verse) St Paul sought from the Corinthians was conduct in accordance with the Gospel of Christ. This was the best form their sympathy with him could take. Therefore he touches on some of the points on which they were in the habit of doing most violence to their Christian profession. They did not keep sufficiently aloof from unbelievers, but even went so far as to ‘sit at meat’ with them ‘in the idol-temple’ (see 1 Corinthians 8, 10, and notes) and thus become partakers with them in their idolatry, whereby they were the cause of infinite mischief to the souls of their brethren. The reference in the words ‘unequally yoked together’ is to the precept in <a href="/deuteronomy/22-10.htm" title="You shall not plow with an ox and an ass together.">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>, a precept, like many similar ones in the same chapter (<span class="ital"><a href="/2_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;">2 Corinthians 6:9</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged....">2 Corinthians 6:11-12</a></span>) and elsewhere in the Mosaic laws, manifestly figurative in its character. The Apostle’s words must not be confined to intermarriages with the heathen, though of course it includes them in the prohibition. It refers to all kinds of close and intimate relations. “They are yoked together with unbelievers, who enter into close companionship with them.” Estius.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">what fellowship</span>] The word thus rendered here is not the same as that rendered <span class="ital">communion</span> below, a word which (see notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?

The latter view has arisen from the unusual expressions of the section, and the use of the word "Belial," and the command of Greek shown by the varied expressions. There is no adequate ground for these conjectures. Every writer is conscious of moods in which words come to him more fluently than at other times, and all writers of deep feeling, like St. Paul, abound in sudden transitions which correspond to the lightning-like rapidity of their thoughts. It is doubtful whether the readers would not have seen at once the sequence of thought, which depends on circumstances which we can only conjecture. Probably the alienation from St. Paul had its root in some tampering with unbelievers. Such might at any rate have been the case among the Gentile members of the Church, some of whom were even willing to go to sacrificial feasts in heathen temples (<a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8-10</a>.). "Unequally yoked" is a metaphor derived from <a href="/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>, and is the opposite of "<span class="accented">true yoke fellow"</span> (<a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What fellowship;</span> literally, <span class="accented">participation</span> (<a href="/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unrighteousness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">lawlessness</span> (<a href="/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>).

Unequally gives an ambiguous sense. It is not inequality, but difference in kind, as is shown by the succeeding words. The suggestion was doubtless due to the prohibition in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>, against yoking together two different animals. The reference is general, covering all forms of intimacy with the heathen, and not limited to marriage or to idolfeasts.
