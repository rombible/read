The first letter, dealing with the problem of fornication in the church, has been lost (1 Cor. 5:9). The second letter (our 1 Corinthians) dealt with various problems he had become aware of. Paul wrote a third letter to the church at Corinth that was harsh and disciplinary in nature (see 2:3-4; 7:8-9). This letter has been lost as well; but according to a report Paul received from Titus, it apparently accomplished its purpose (7:6-8), leading Paul to write this fourth letter (2 Cor.), in which he comforted those who had gotten themselves right with God (1-9) and strongly defended his apostleship against some who were opposing his authority (10-13).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> 2 Corinthians is the most autobiographical of Paul’s letters, giving an intimate view of his personal life and ministry.<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> It is the least doctrinal of his letters, with the possible exception of Philemon.

Titus does this and returns to Paul.<p class="num"><span class="nm">16.</span> He writes a letter (now lost) to the Corinthian church (1 Cor. 5:9). We must keep in mind that God did not choose to inspire <i>all</i> of the many letters written by Paul and early church leaders, but <i>only</i> those which are found in the New Testament.<p class="num"><span class="nm">17.</span> After a while, Paul writes another letter. This letter is the 1 Corinthians of the New Testament. There were two basic reasons why he wrote this epistle.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> To rebuke the church—Paul had heard about some tragic church factions from the household of Chloe, living there in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:11).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> To instruct the church—Paul was visited while in Ephesus by a three-man delegation from Corinth, who handed him a list of questions the church had for him (1 Cor. 7:1; 8:1; 12:1; 16:17)<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">18.</span> He then sends Timothy to Corinth with this New Testament epistle (1 Cor. 4:17; 16:10-11).<p class="num"><span class="nm">19.</span> Timothy returns to Paul in Ephesus—This young preacher was apparently unable to straighten things out in Corinth (2 Cor. 1:1).<p class="num"><span class="nm">20.</span> Paul desires to visit the church himself at this time, but is unable to (2 Cor. 1:15-17).<p class="num"><span class="nm">21.</span> He soon hears that his work there is being undermined by some legalistic Judaizers who had just arrived from Jerusalem (2 Cor. 3:1; 10:12-18; 11:22-23).<p class="num"><span class="nm">22.</span> He now sends Titus back to Corinth with orders to straighten things out and meet him in Troas (2 Cor. 2:12-13; 7:6-7).<p class="num"><span class="nm">23.</span> Paul comes to Troas, but does not find Titus. After a restless period, he departs to Macedonia (2 Cor. 2:12-13).<p class="num"><span class="nm">24.</span> Here he meets Titus, who gives him a favorable report concerning the work at Corinth.<p class="num"><span class="nm">25.</span> With great relief, Paul writes 2 Corinthians (2 Cor. 7:5-15).<p class="num"><span class="nm">26.</span> Paul is finally able to visit Corinth at a later date for a period of three months.
