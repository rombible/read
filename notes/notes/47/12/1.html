It is not, indeed, expedient, but</span> <span class= "ital">I</span> <span class= "ital">will come</span> . . . The sequence of thought would seem to be that the Apostle felt constrained by the taunts of his opponents to indulge in what looked like self-assertion in vindication of his own character; that he was conscious, as he did so, that it was not, in the highest sense of the word, expedient for him; and that, under the influence of these mingled feelings, he passed over other topics on which he might have dwelt, and came at once to that which had been made matter of reproach against him.<p><span class= "bld">Visions and revelations of the Lord.</span>—It need scarcely be said that the history of the Acts is full of such visions (<a href="/context/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4-6</a>; <a href="/acts/16-9.htm" title="And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.">Acts 16:9</a>; <a href="/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="/acts/22-18.htm" title="And saw him saying to me, Make haste, and get you quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.">Acts 22:18</a>; <a href="/acts/23-11.htm" title="And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome.">Acts 23:11</a>; <a href="/acts/27-23.htm" title="For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,">Acts 27:23</a>). One other instance is referred to in <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>. There is scarcely any room for doubt that this also had been made matter of reproach against him, and perhaps urged as a proof of the charge of madness. In the Clementine <span class= "ital">Homilies</span>—a kind of controversial romance representing the later views of the Ebionite or Judaising party, in which most recent critics have recognised a thinly-veiled attempt to present the characteristic features of St. Paul under the pretence of an attack on Simon Magus, just as the writer of a political novel in modern times might draw the portraits of his rivals under fictitious names—we find stress laid on the alleged claims of Simon to have had communications from the Lord through visions and dreams and outward revelations; and this claim is contrasted with that of Peter, who had personally followed Christ during his ministry on earth (<span class= "ital">Hom.</span> xvii. 14-20). What was said then, in the form of this elaborate attack, may well have been said before by the more malignant advocates of the same party. The charge of insanity was one easy to make, and of all charges, perhaps, the most difficult to refute by one who gloried in the facts which were alleged as its foundation—who did see visions, and did “speak with tongues” in the ecstasy of adoring rapture (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-18.htm" title="I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:">1Corinthians 14:18</a>). It may be noted as an instance of St. Luke’s fairness that he, ignorant of, or ignoring, the charge of madness that had been brought against St. Paul, does not grudge the Apostle of the Circumcision whatever glory might accrue from a true revelation thus made through the medium of a vision (<a href="/context/acts/10-10.htm" title="And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,">Acts 10:10-11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.">2 Corinthians 12:1</a></span>. After enumerating, in the former chapter, his almost incredible labours and sufferings for the gospel, the apostle, in this, proceeds to speak of some visions and revelations that had been made to him, as a further proof of his apostleship, and of the regard which ought to be paid to his doctrines, his advices, exhortations, or reproofs. <span class="ital">It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory </span>— Or boast of any thing I have done or suffered, as a minister of Christ, unless on so pressing an occasion. Yet, or <span class="ital">nevertheless, </span>as <span class="greekheb">γαρ </span>must be here understood to signify, <span class="ital">I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord — </span>That he might not offend any one’s delicacy, he forbears to say that these visions and revelations were given to himself; although, doubtless, some of the Corinthians would inter, from his manner of speaking, that he himself had been favoured with them. Visions were things presented to a person in a supernatural manner, so as to be the objects of his sight while awake. Thus Zacharias, (<a href="/luke/1-11.htm" title="And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.">Luke 1:11</a>.) and Mary, (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm" title="And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,">Luke 1:26</a>,) and Cornelius, (<a href="/acts/10-3.htm" title="He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.">Acts 10:3</a>,) had visions of angels. Probably here the apostle means his seeing the Lord Jesus on different occasions, after his ascension; and especially those visions of Christ which he saw when he was caught up into the third heaven. <span class="ital">And revelations of the Lord — </span>These were discoveries of matters unknown, which Christ made to Paul by an internal impression on his mind; or by speech, such as the revelations mentioned <a href="/acts/13-2.htm" title="As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.">Acts 13:2</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a>. Perhaps also those which, he says, (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>,) he heard in paradise. Of the former kind were all the inspirations of the Spirit bestowed on the apostles, and on those who in the first age, preached the gospel by revelation.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 There can be no doubt the apostle speaks of himself. Whether heavenly things were brought down to him, while his body was in a trance, as in the case of ancient prophets; or whether his soul was dislodged from the body for a time, and taken up into heaven, or whether he was taken up, body and soul together, he knew not. We are not capable, nor is it fit we should yet know, the particulars of that glorious place and state. He did not attempt to publish to the world what he had heard there, but he set forth the doctrine of Christ. On that foundation the church is built, and on that we must build our faith and hope. And while this teaches us to enlarge our expectations of the glory that shall be revealed, it should render us contented with the usual methods of learning the truth and will of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is not expedient - It is not well; it does not become me. This may either mean that he felt and admitted that it did not become him to boast in this manner; that there was an impropriety in his doing it though circumstances had compelled him, and in this sense it is understood by nearly, or quite, all expositors; or it may be taken ironically. "Such a man as I am ought not to boast. So you say, and so it would seem. A man who has done no more than I have; who has suffered nothing; who has been idle and at ease as I have been, ought surely not to boast. And since there is such an evident impropriety in my boasting and speaking about myself, I will turn to another matter, and inquire whether the same thing may not be said about visions and revelations. I will speak, therefore, of a man who had some remarkable revelations, and inquire whether he has any right to boast of the favors imparted to him." This seems to me to be the probable interpretation of this passage.<p>To glory - To boast; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-8.htm">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/10-13.htm">2 Corinthians 10:13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-10.htm">2 Corinthians 11:10</a>. One of the charges which they alleged against him was, that he was given to boasting without any good reason. After the enumeration in the previous chapter of what he had done and suffered, he says that this was doubtless very true. Such a man has nothing to boast of.<p>I will come - Margin, "For I will." Our translators have omitted the word (&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1;  gar) for in the text, evidently supposing that it is a mere expletive. Doddridge renders it, "nevertheless." But it seems to me that it contains an important sense, and that it should be rendered by then. "Since it is not fit that I should glory, then I will refer to visions, etc. I will turn away then from that subject, and come to another." Thus, the word (&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1;  gar) is used in <a href="/john/7-41.htm">John 7:41</a>. "Shall then &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1;  me&#772; gar Christ come out of Galilee?" <a href="/acts/8-31.htm">Acts 8:31</a>. "How can I then &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#768;  to&#772;; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1;  gar except some man should guide me?" see also <a href="/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a>; <a href="/romans/3-3.htm">Romans 3:3</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-18.htm">Philippians 1:18</a>.<p>To visions - The word "vision" is used in the Scriptures often to denote the mode in which divine communications were usually made to people. This was done by causing some scene to appear to pass before the mind as in a landscape, so that the individual seemed to see a representation of what was to occur in some future period. It was usually applied to prophecy, and is often used in the Old Testament; see my note on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>, and also on <a href="/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10</a>. The vision which Paul here refers to was that which he was permitted to have of the heavenly world; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-4.htm">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>. He was permitted to see what perhaps no other mortal had seen, the glory of heaven.<p>And revelations of the Lord - Which the Lord had made. Or it may mean manifestations which the Lord had made of himself to him. The word rendered "revelations" means properly an "uncovering" (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  apokalupsis, from &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;  apokalupto&#772;, to uncover), and denotes a removal of the veil of ignorance and darkness, so that an object may be clearly seen; and is thus applied to truth revealed, because the obscurity is removed and the truth becomes manifest. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>2Co 12:1-21. Revelations in Which He Might Glory: But He Rather Glories in Infirmities, as Calling Forth Christ's Power: Signs of His Apostleship: His Disinterestedness: Not That He Is Excusing Himself to Them; but He Does All for Their Good, lest He Should Find Them Not Such as He Desired, and So Should Have to Be Severe at His Coming.<p>1. He proceeds to illustrate the "glorying in infirmities" (2Co 11:30). He gave one instance which might expose him to ridicule (2Co 11:33); he now gives another, but this one connected with a glorious revelation of which it was the sequel: but he dwells not on the glory done to himself, but on the infirmity which followed it, as displaying Christ's power. The oldest manuscripts read, "I MUST NEEDS boast (or glory) though it be not expedient; for I will come." The "for" gives a proof that it is "not expedient to boast": I will take the case of revelations, in which if anywhere boasting might be thought harmless. "Visions" refers to things seen: "revelations," to things heard (compare 1Sa 9:15) or revealed in any way. In "visions" their signification was not always vouchsafed; in "revelations" there was always an unveiling of truths before hidden (Da 2:19, 31). All parts of Scripture alike are matter of inspiration; but not all of revelation. There are degrees of revelation; but not of inspiration.<p>of&#8212;that is, from the Lord; Christ, 2Co 12:2.<span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.

Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar seem to have had such visions as they did not understand, till interpreted by Joseph and Daniel; but undoubtedly Paul’s visions were not such. The difference therefore seems rather to be, that in all visions which good and holy men had, there was a revelation; but every revelation did not suppose a vision. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It is not expedient doubtless for me to glory,.... Though it was lawful for him to glory, and was necessary in the present circumstances of things, in vindication of himself, and to preserve the Corinthians from being carried away with the insinuations of the false apostles; and so for the honour and interest of Christ and the Gospel; yet it was not expedient on some other accounts, or profitable and serviceable to himself; he might find that it tended to stir up pride, vanity, and elation of mind in him, and might be interpreted by others as proud boasting and vain glorying; wherefore he chose to drop it, and pass on to another subject; or rather though it was not expedient to proceed, yet, before he entirely quitted it, he thought it proper to say something of the extraordinary appearances of God unto him. Some copies, and the Vulgate Latin version, read, "if there was need of glorying, it is not indeed expedient"; the Syriac version, "there is need of glorying, but it is not expedient"; and the Arabic version, "neither have I need to glory, nor is it expedient for me: I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord"; such as the Lord had made to him, and not man; and which were not the fruit of his own fancy, or the delusions of Satan; but were from the Lord Jesus Christ, and his glory. The apostle might very well speak of "visions" or heavenly appearances, since he was favoured with many; his conversion was owing to a vision or appearance of Christ to him, whom he saw with his bodily eyes, and heard him speaking to him, and which he calls "the heavenly vision"; at another time when at Troas, a vision appeared to him in the night, and a man of Macedonia stood and prayed him to come over and help them; and when at Corinth the Lord spoke to him by a vision, and bid him not be afraid, but go on preaching the Gospel, because he had much people there to be brought in through his ministry: and as for revelations, besides what are ordinary and common to all believers, he had extraordinary ones; the Gospel and the scheme of it, the knowledge of the several particular doctrines of it, were not attained to by him in the common way, but he had them by the revelation of Jesus Christ; the several mysterious parts of it, particularly that of the calling of the Gentiles, to which might be added, the change that will be upon the living saints at Christ's second coming, were made known to him by revelation; and sometimes in this extraordinary way he was directed to go to such or such a place, as at a certain time he went up to Jerusalem by "revelation", where he was to do or suffer many things for the sake of Christ: though he had no revelation of anything that was different from, and much less contrary to the Gospel, and as it was preached by the other apostles; for there was an entire agreement between him and them in their ministry; see <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a>, and these visions and revelations were for his instruction, direction, and encouragement in the ministration of the Gospel; and being of an extraordinary nature, were suitable to those extraordinary times, and not to be expected in an ordinary way, nor is there any need of them now; besides, these were visions and revelations of the Lord, and not the effects of enthusiasm, and a warm imagination, nor diabolical delusions, or the pretensions and cheats of designing men; and were for the confirmation and establishment of the Gospel, and not to countenance a new scheme, or introduce a new dispensation; wherefore all visions and revelations men pretend to, which are for such a purpose, are to be despised and rejected. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">It <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.

The <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span> arose out of the existing circumstances of the Corinthians, by which Paul had seen himself necessitated to the <span class="greekheb">καυχᾶσθαι</span>; but the <span class="greekheb">οὐ συμφέρει</span> prevails with him to pass on to something <span class="ital">else</span> and far <span class="ital">higher</span>, as that in which there lay <span class="ital">no self-glory</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-5.htm" title="Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities.">2 Corinthians 12:5</a>). With the reading <span class="greekheb">δή</span> (see the critical remarks) the <span class="greekheb">δή</span> would only make the notion of <span class="greekheb">καυχᾶσθαι</span> more significantly[351] prominent, like the German <span class="ital">eben</span> or <span class="ital">ja</span> [<span class="ital">certainly</span>, or <span class="ital">indeed</span>] (see Krüger, § 69, 19. 2; Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar.</span> p. 392; Bäumlein, <span class="ital">Partikell.</span> p. 98), but could not, as Hofmann (with an inappropriate appeal to Hartung) assumes, denote glorying “<span class="ital">simply and absolutely</span>,” in contrast with a <span class="greekheb">καυχᾶσθαι τὰ τῆς ἀσθενείας</span>. This Paul would have known how to express by something like <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΠΛῶς ΔῊ ΚΑΥΧᾶΣΘΑΙ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἘΛΕΎΣΟΜΑΙ</span></span></span>] not: I <span class="ital">would</span> (to which Hofmann practically comes), but: I <span class="ital">will</span> (now) come to speak.

See Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar.</span> p. 235; Bäumlein, <span class="ital">Partik.</span> p. 86.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς ὀπτασίας καὶ ἀποκαλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κυρίου</span>] <span class="ital">i.e. to facts, in which Christ imparted to me visions and revelations</span>.[352] The <span class="ital">genitivus subjecti</span> <span class="greekheb">κυρίου</span> is the characteristic definition, which <span class="ital">both</span> words need (not simply the <span class="ital">second</span>, to which Hofmann limits it). Theophylact remarks that in <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλ</span>. there is added to <span class="greekheb">ὀπτασ</span>. something <span class="ital">more</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ μὲν γὰρ μόνον βλέπειν δίδωσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">αὕτη δὲ καί τι βαθύτερον τοῦ ὁρωμένου ἀπογυμνοῖ</span>. This distinction, however, keeps the two ideas apart contrary to their nature, as if the apocalyptic element were not given with the <span class="greekheb">ὀπτασία</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ὀπτασία</span> (“species visibilis objecta vigilanti aut somnianti,” Grotius) is rather a special <span class="ital">form of receiving</span> the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκάλυψις</span> (comp. Lücke, <span class="ital">Einl. in d. Offenb. Joh.</span> I. p. 27, ed. 2), which latter may take place <span class="ital">by means of</span> such a miraculous vision (<a href="/daniel/9-23.htm" title="At the beginning of your supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show you; for you are greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.">Daniel 9:23</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-1.htm" title="In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.">Daniel 10:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-16.htm" title="And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned on me, and I have retained no strength.">Daniel 10:16</a>); see also <a href="/luke/1-22.htm" title="And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned to them, and remained speechless.">Luke 1:22</a>; <a href="/acts/26-19.htm" title="Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:">Acts 26:19</a>. This is the meaning of <span class="greekheb">ὀπτασία</span> here, and <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλ</span>. is a wider idea, inasmuch as revelations occur also otherwise than in the way of visions beheld, although here ensuing in that way; comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>, where <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλ</span>. stands alone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That Paul by what follows wishes to prove, with a polemic object against the Christine party, that <span class="ital">external</span> acquaintance with Christ was superfluous (so Baur; see also Oecumenius), is not to be assumed, just because otherwise the mention of his having had a <span class="ital">vision of Christ</span> would be necessary for its bearing on the sequel. Nor can we from this passage infer it as <span class="ital">the</span> distinctive feature of the Christines, that they had claimed to stand by visions and revelations in a mystical connection with Christ (Schenkel, Dähne, de Wette, Goldhorn; comp. also Ewald, Beyschlag), since Paul is contending against specifically <span class="ital">Judaistic</span> opponents, against whom he pursues his general purpose of elucidating his apostolic dignity, which enemies obscured in Corinth,[353] from the special distinctions which <span class="ital">he</span>, and not his opponents, had to show (comp. Räbiger, p. 210; Klöpper, p. 99 ff.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[349] See on ver. 1 ff., Beyschlag in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.

I. p. 404) objects that Paul must have written “solenniter et perspicue:” <span class="greekheb">καυχᾶσθαι ἐμὲ δεῖ</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐ δὲ συμφέρει μοι</span>. But if <span class="greekheb">μοι</span> were not to be referred jointly to <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span>, seeing that <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span> with the dative and infinitive certainly is found in classical writers <span class="ital">seldom</span> (see also Ellendt, <span class="ital">Lex. Soph</span>. I. p. 399 f.), and <span class="ital">never</span> in the N. T., an <span class="greekheb">ἐμέ</span> would not be necessary; but <span class="greekheb">καυχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span> may be taken absolutely: <span class="ital">boasting is necessary</span> (under the circumstances given), <span class="ital">not advantageous is it to me</span>. The non-use of <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> is in keeping with the very common asyndetic juxtaposition of contrasted statements, <a href="/1_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.">1 Corinthians 7:6</a>; <a href="/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>, <span class="ital">et al</span>.

He explains it, therefore, as if Paul had written: <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐμοί</span> or <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐμαυτῷ συμφέρει</span>. Theodoret had already taken it erroneously, quite like Reiche.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[351] “<span class="greekheb">Δή</span> est particula determinativa, id verbum, quod sequitur, graviter efferens,” Kühner, <span class="ital">ad Xen.

Not something greater, but something quite <span class="ital">of another kind</span>. Holsten, too, finds in the <span class="greekheb">ὀπτασίας</span> something, which exalts Paul above the original apostles, since to the latter such things had not been imparted after the resurrection of Christ.

The Visions and Revelations vouchsafed to St Paul<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="ital">It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come</span>] The Greek text here is in the most utter confusion. Out of the seven Greek words which commence this chapter, the genuineness of only three is guaranteed by the agreement of the MSS. and versions. Some MSS. read, instead of as the A. V., <span class="ital">I must glory, it is not expedient for me, for</span>—(or <span class="ital">yet</span>). Others again, <span class="ital">I must glory, it is not, I grant, expedient, yet—</span>. The Vulgate begins with <span class="ital">if</span> (<span class="ital">if it bihoveth to have glorie, it spedith not, but I schal come</span>, Wiclif), no doubt from ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities.">2 Corinthians 11:30</a>. The A. V. avoids the difficulty of choosing between <span class="ital">for</span> and <span class="ital">but</span> before <span class="ital">I will come</span> by leaving out both. The usual rule in the case of a doubtful reading is to prefer the more difficult one, on the ground that a transcriber was more likely to evade what seemed to him to be a difficulty by the substitution of an easier word, than of his own accord to add to the difficulty of the passage. This rule is inapplicable here, where the alterations have clearly proceeded from an inability to comprehend the passage as it stood. The reading is therefore to be preferred which falls in best with the general scope of St Paul’s argument. As regards the first portion of the sentence it makes very little difference to the sense whether we follow the A. V. and render <span class="ital">I am quite aware</span> (<span class="greekheb">δή</span>) <span class="ital">that it is not well for me to boast</span>, or with other authorities, <span class="ital">I must boast, I know it is not good for me</span>. With regard to <span class="ital">for or but</span>, the latter seems to fall in best with the context. If we read <span class="ital">for</span>, we must regard St Paul as intending to give an additional proof of the undesirableness of boasting, as shewn by the fact that (<span class="ital"><a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2 Corinthians 12:7</a></span>) even when there be anything to boast of, it is invariably in the end a source of weakness. If we read <span class="ital">but</span>, we must suppose St Paul to feel himself compelled to boast, lest the incident to which he has just referred (ch. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not....">2 Corinthians 11:31-33</a>) should be turned into an accusation of cowardice. Therefore in spite of himself he gives a proof which few would venture to challenge, that he has a right to speak in the name of God, in order that his confessions of weakness might not be used against him.
