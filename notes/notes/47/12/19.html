In this case the sentence is better taken as an assertion, not as a question—”You are thinking, and have been thinking for a long time, that it is to you that we have been making our defence.” The Greek verb for “excuse,” is that which is always used of a formal <span class= "ital">apologia,</span> or vindication (<a href="/luke/12-11.htm" title="And when they bring you to the synagogues, and to magistrates, and powers, take you no thought how or what thing you shall answer, or what you shall say:">Luke 12:11</a>; <a href="/luke/21-14.htm" title="Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what you shall answer:">Luke 21:14</a>; <a href="/acts/19-33.htm" title="And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward.

The motive which really prompts him to speak as he has spoken is not the wish to clear himself from aspersions, but “before God in Christ,”—under a profound sense that God is his Judge, and that Christ is, as it were, the sphere in which his thoughts revolve,—he is seeking to “edify,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to build them up in the faith or love of God.

Those of whom the apostle speaks, were probably such as had not refrained from partaking in the idolatrous sacrifices of the heathen, and from the lewd practices connected with idolatry, to which, by their former customs and habits, they were still addicted. <span class="ital">Of the uncleanness, &c., which they have committed </span>— By <span class="ital">uncleanness, </span>Estius thinks the apostle meant those sins of the flesh, which are against nature; by <span class="ital">fornication </span>— The conjunction of male and female out of marriage; <span class="ital">lasciviousness </span>— He says, consists in lustful looks, touches, motions, and other things of that kind. But by <span class="ital">lasciviousness, </span>Bengelius understands <span class="ital">sodomy, bestiality, </span>and other vices contrary to nature. But, says Macknight, “although some of the faction at Corinth may have been guilty of <span class="ital">uncleanness, fornication, </span>and <span class="ital">lasciviousness, </span>in the ordinary sense of these words, fancying, through the prejudices of their education, that these things were no sins, I scarcely think that any of them, after their conversion, would continue in the commission of the unnatural crimes mentioned by Estius and Bengelius.” One thing is evident: in the absence of the apostle, the exercise of a proper Christian discipline must have been awfully neglected in this church, otherwise such scandalous sinners would have been excluded from it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:11-21 We owe it to good men, to stand up in the defence of their reputation; and we are under special obligations to those from whom we have received benefit, especially spiritual benefit, to own them as instruments in God's hand of good to us. Here is an account of the apostle's behaviour and kind intentions; in which see the character of a faithful minister of the gospel. This was his great aim and design, to do good. Here are noticed several sins commonly found among professors of religion. Falls and misdeeds are humbling to a minister; and God sometimes takes this way to humble those who might be tempted to be lifted up. These vast verses show to what excesses the false teachers had drawn aside their deluded followers. How grievous it is that such evils should be found among professors of the gospel! Yet thus it is, and has been too often, and it was so even in the days of the apostles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? - see the note on <a href="/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>. The sense is, Do not suppose that this is said from mere anxiety to obtain your favor, or to ingratiate ourselves into your esteem. This is said doubtless to keep himself from the suspicion of being actuated by improper motives. He had manifested great solicitude certainly in the previous chapter to vindicate his character; but he here says that it was not from a mere desire to show them that his conduct was right; it was from a desire to honor Christ.<p>We speak before God in Christ - We declare the simple and undisguised truth as in the presence of God. I have no mere desire to palliate my conduct; I disguise nothing; I conceal nothing; I say nothing for the mere purpose of self-vindication, but I can appeal to the Searcher of hearts for the exact truth of all that I say. The phrase "before God in Christ," means probably, "I speak as in the presence of God, and as a follower of Christ, as a Christian man." It is the solemn appeal of a Christian to his God for the truth of what he said, and a solemn asseveration that what he said was not for the mere purpose of excusing or apologizing for (the sense of the Greek) his conduct.<p>But we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying - All that I have done has been for your welfare. My vindication of my character, and my effort to disabuse you of your prejudices, has been that you might have unwavering confidence in the gospel and might be built up in holy faith.

If we consider Christ as the Foundation, conversion is edification; the building up of souls upon Christ, who is the gospel foundation; and <span class="ital">other foundation can no man lay.</span> If we consider the infusion of the first habits of grace into the soul as the foundation, edification signifies a going on from faith to faith; a growing in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, a going on to perfection. The true minister of Christ ought to make edification in both of these senses his end, and his great end; for by this means is God glorified, the souls of his people benefited, and eternally saved. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Again, think you that we excuse ourselves to you?.... The apostle would not have the Corinthians imagine, that by what he had said once and again in this epistle, he meant to excuse himself from coming to them, for he really and sincerely intended it; or that by this long defence of himself against the false apostles, he designed so much an apology for himself, or that he used any feigned words, or artful methods, to exculpate himself from any charge against him, particularly that of covetousness just mentioned; for he had no view to cover himself by studied apologies, and set orations, and evade anything exhibited against him, and make himself look innocent when guilty; it was not with any such intention he had dwelt so long on this subject: <p>we speak before God in Christ; in all sincerity and uprightness of soul, without colour, guile, or deceit, calling God and Christ to witness the truth of what was said; the apostle spoke all he did, as in the presence of the omniscient God; and as one in Christ, and a preacher of his Gospel, that would not deliver an untruth knowingly, for the whole world: <p>but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edification; it was not for himself so much, for his own credit, reputation, and glory, he did what he did; had this been the case, he would not have said the half part of what he had; but it was for their sake, out of love to them, that they might be built up and established in the faith of the Gospel, and not be carried away with the error of the wicked. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> Christ: but <i>we do</i> all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</span><p>(7) He concludes that he does not write these things to them as though he needed to defend himself, for he is guilty of nothing: but because it is appropriate for them to doubt nothing of his fidelity, who instructed them.<p>(n) As it becomes him to speak truly and sincerely, that professes himself to be in Christ, that is to say, to be a Christian.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/12-19.htm" title="Again, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.">2 Corinthians 12:19</a>. His vindication itself is now concluded. But in order that he may not appear, by thus answering for himself, to install the readers as judges over him, he further guards his apostolic dignity against this risk.

The Apostle’s intentions on his arrival<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>19. <span class="ital">Again, think you that we excuse ourselves</span>]. Rather, <span class="bld">Do ye think that we are defending ourselves again</span>? Many MSS. and versions read, <span class="ital">Do you think</span> (or <span class="ital">You think</span>) <span class="ital">that we have been defending ourselves to you this long time</span>? The word <span class="ital">excuse</span> gives a false impression, as though the Apostle were exculpating himself from blame rather than meeting accusations by sufficient answers. If we take the first reading the reference will be to the former Epistle or the commencement of this one. Cf. ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>. If the second, the meaning will be ‘you think that I have been making a long and perhaps tedious defence of myself, yet I can assure you that I shall not stand upon my defence when I come. I only desire your improvement. But if words will not suffice, I shall have, when I come, to proceed to deeds.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we speak before God in Christ</span>] This sense of saying and doing everything in the sight of God and Christ, Who will avenge all deceit by unmasking the deceiver, is a characteristic of St Paul’s whole nature, but is never more clearly displayed than in this Epistle. See ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="But as God is true, our word toward you was not yes and no.">2 Corinthians 1:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/3-4.htm" title="And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:">2 Corinthians 3:4</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.">2 Corinthians 7:12</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/8-21.htm" title="Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>, <a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia....">2 Corinthians 11:10-11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">edifying</span>] See <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.

The more approved reading is <span class="greekheb">πάλιν δοκεῖτε</span>; comp. again ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>, <span class="ital">to you</span>) as if it were necessary for our own sake in this way to retain your favour.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῆς ὑμῶν οἰκοδομῆς</span>, <span class="ital">for your edification</span>) that you may rather see, than experience with sorrow, how much I am an apostle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[88] ABG<span class="ital">f</span> Vulg. read <span class="greekheb">πάλαι</span>.
