Here is an account of the apostle's behaviour and kind intentions; in which see the character of a faithful minister of the gospel. This was his great aim and design, to do good. Here are noticed several sins commonly found among professors of religion. Falls and misdeeds are humbling to a minister; and God sometimes takes this way to humble those who might be tempted to be lifted up. These vast verses show to what excesses the false teachers had drawn aside their deluded followers. How grievous it is that such evils should be found among professors of the gospel! Yet thus it is, and has been too often, and it was so even in the days of the apostles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Did I make a gain ... - In refuting this slander, Paul appeals boldly to the facts, and to what they knew. "Same the man," says he, "who has thus defrauded you under my instructions. If the charge is well-founded, let him be specified, and let the mode in which it was done be distinctly stated." The phrase "make a gain" (from &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  pleonekteo&#772;), means properly to have an advantage; then to take advantage, to seek unlawful gain.

The apostle, to avoid or wipe off this imputation, appealeth to themselves to name any person (whom he had sent unto them) that had taken any thing of them for his use.

The circumstances of God’s providence may be such towards faithful ministers, as that they may be constrained to make use of others to do their work; but such, so near as they can judge, will never make use of any therein, but such as are of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the same spirit</span> with themselves, and walk in <span class="ital">the same steps.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Did I make a gain of you,.... He appeals to the Corinthians against such calumnies and false insinuations, whether ever he had circumvented them in such a manner, or had ever used such artful methods to pillage them; or whether ever he had discovered any covetous disposition towards anything of theirs; or had employed any persons to draw out their substance from them, and get it for himself: he owns he had sent some persons to them on different errands, and asks if he had dealt fraudulently with them, <p>by any of them whom, says he, <p>I have sent to you: he desires them to name one single person of the many who came to them from him, that had received any money from them for him; or that they had any reason to believe he had employed for such purposes; and if they could not pitch on a single instance, they ought therefore to look upon this as a downright slander and calumny. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_corinthians/12.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?">2 Corinthians 12:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">μή τινα ὧν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">of those whom</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὧν</span> by attraction for <span class="greekheb">ἐκείνων οὕς</span>) <span class="ital">I have sent, was there one by whom I took advantage of you?</span> The constr. is broken, and the resulting anacoluthon is one of the most striking in St. Paul’s writings (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>, <a href="/galatians/1-20.htm" title="Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.">Galatians 1:20</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>17. <span class="ital">make a gain of you</span>] See ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by any of them whom I sent unto you</span>] They may have been maintained at the expense of the Churches, but they certainly made no attempt to enrich St Paul by their mission. In their disinterested labours they followed implicitly the example of the great Apostle. Some have thought that there is a reference here to the collection for the poor Christians at Jerusalem, but this can hardly be, for the mission of Titus was simply for the purpose of urging the Corinthians to complete their preparations. St Paul had anticipated all objections as to his making use of that money for his own purposes by arranging (see <a href="/1_corinthians/16-3.htm" title="And when I come, whomsoever you shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality to Jerusalem.">1 Corinthians 16:3</a>) that it should be sent in the charge of brethren selected by the Corinthian Church itself. See also ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/8-19.htm" title="And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:">2 Corinthians 8:19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-21.htm" title="Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>.
