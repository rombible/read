(See Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.">2Corinthians 13:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">My God will humble me among you.</span>—We lose the force of the Greek verb by not seeing that it reproduces the word which has been so prominent in the Epistle, and which has appeared in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;">2Corinthians 7:6</a>, as “cast down;” in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:">2Corinthians 10:1</a> as “base;” in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?">2Corinthians 11:7</a> as “abasing.” There is something almost plaintive in the tone in which the Apostle speaks of the sin of his disciples as the only real “humiliation” which he has to fear. The readings vary; and one of them may be taken as a question: <span class= "ital">Will God humble me again?</span> There is, however, it is believed, no adequate ground for altering the text.<p><span class= "bld">That I shall bewail many which have sinned already.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">who have sinned beforehand;</span> leaving it uncertain what time is referred to. He may refer to sins before admission into the Church, of which men had never really repented, or to sins before the time of his writing, or before that of his arrival. On the whole, the first interpretation has most to commend it. He has in his thoughts such persons as those described in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,">1Corinthians 6:9</a>, and suspects that some of them have not really renounced the sins which he there names. Of the three forms of evil, the first is generic and the two latter more specific; the last probably indicating the darker forms of evil. It is obvious that the words cannot refer to the incestuous offender who had repented (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="So that contrariwise you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.">2Corinthians 2:7</a>), nor to the Church generally in connection with that offence (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing.">2Corinthians 7:9-11</a>). Probably he had in view the party of license, who maintained the indifference of “eating things sacrificed to idols,” and of “fornication,” just as, in the previous verse, he had chiefly in view the party of his Judaising opponents.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:11-21 We owe it to good men, to stand up in the defence of their reputation; and we are under special obligations to those from whom we have received benefit, especially spiritual benefit, to own them as instruments in God's hand of good to us. Here is an account of the apostle's behaviour and kind intentions; in which see the character of a faithful minister of the gospel. This was his great aim and design, to do good. Here are noticed several sins commonly found among professors of religion. Falls and misdeeds are humbling to a minister; and God sometimes takes this way to humble those who might be tempted to be lifted up. These vast verses show to what excesses the false teachers had drawn aside their deluded followers. How grievous it is that such evils should be found among professors of the gospel! Yet thus it is, and has been too often, and it was so even in the days of the apostles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me ... - Lest I should be compelled to inflict punishment on those whom I suppose to have been converted under my ministry. I had rejoiced in them as true converts: I had counted them as among the fruit of my ministry. Now to be compelled to inflict punishment on them as having no religion would mortify me and humble me. The infliction of punishment on members of the church is a sort of punishment to him who inflicts it as well as to him who is punished. Members of the church should walk uprightly, lest they overwhelm the ministry in shame.<p>And that I shall bewail many ... - If they repented of their sin he could still rejoice in them. If they continued in their sin until he came, it would be to him a source of deep lamentation. It is evident from the word "many" here that the disorders had prevailed very extensively in the church at Corinth. The word rendered "have sinned already" means "who have sinned before," and the idea is, that they were old offenders, and that they had not yet repented.<p>The uncleanness - see note, <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>.<p>And fornication and lasciviousness ... - see the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>. This was the sin to which they were particularly exposed in Corinth, as it was the sin for which that corrupt city was particularly distinguished. See the introduction to the First Epistle. Hence, the frequent cautions in these epistles against it; and hence, it is not to be wondered at that some of those who had become professing Christians had fallen into it. It may be added that it is still the sin to which converts from the corruptions and licentiousness of paganism are particularly exposed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. my God&#8212;his God, however trying the humiliation that was in store for him.<p>will humble me&#8212;The indicative implies that the supposition will actually be so.

Again, the apostle’s mentioning of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">many</span> that had committed <span class="bld">uncleanness, fornication, and lasciviousness, </span> and <span class="bld">not repented; </span> wheras he had only given order for the excommunication of one incestuous person, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife....">1 Corinthians 5:1-13</a></span>, and in this Epistle, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness....">2 Corinthians 2:1-17</a></span>, had given order for the restoring him upon his repentance; lets us know, that the governors of churches ought to use a great deal of prudence in the administering of church censures. We are also further taught, that nothing more afflicteth a godly person, who hath the charge of the souls of others, than to see them go on in courses of sin without repentance. Whether bewailing, in this verse, implieth proceeding to ecclesiastical censures, (as several interpreters think), I doubt; for as the word doth not necessarily imply it, so his sparing use of that rod, which he could (though absent) have as well used against other unclean persons as one incestuous person; and choosing rather that the sentence should be declared against him by the church in his absence, than by himself when present; inclineth me to think, that by bewailing, here, he only means a Christian, afflictive sense of their miscarriages; whereas his desire was, that he might have a cheerful, comfortable journey to and abode with them. But yet, in the next chapter, he seemeth to threaten something more against some particular offenders. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And lest when I come again,.... Another thing which he feared would be the case when he came again to them, that he himself should be afflicted and distressed, seeing them in a disorderly and dissolute course of life, be obliged to punish them, which would be an humiliation and matter of grief to him: <p>my God will humble me; instead of rejoicing in the fruit of his labours, that they were not in vain, he signifies that he should have great sorrow of heart; and whereas he had promised himself much pleasure and comfort in visiting them, it would be the reverse; and inasmuch as he had boasted of them to others, he should be ashamed: <p>and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, or "before"; not before conversion, but before the writing of this or the former epistle; for nothing was more grieving, and occasioned more sorrow and humiliation to the apostle, than the unbecoming walk of professors; and nothing more sensibly affects a faithful minister of the Gospel: <p>and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication, and lasciviousness, which they have committed. The city of Corinth was famous, or rather infamous, for unclean practices; as fornication, adultery, lasciviousness in words and deeds, and other unnatural lusts; "Corinthian whores" was a common proverb; nor was it proper for persons to go to Corinth, there were so many snares for lust and uncleanness; there were said to be above a thousand prostitutes in the temple of Venus there (k); hence the very great impurities and wickedness, which many of the members of this church were guilty of, may be accounted for; some of them had repented, others not, which was the great concern of the apostle: and from hence we may learn, that gracious souls may be suffered to fall into great sins; and that when they are truly brought to repentance, they ought to be restored to communion with the church; but impenitent ones are to be cut off, and remain so, till brought to a due sense of their evils. <p>(k) Alex. ab Alex.

The <span class="ital">interrogative</span> interpretation (Lachmann, Lücke) is, viewed in itself, compatible not only with the reading <span class="greekheb">ταπεινώσει</span> (Lachmann), but also with the deliberative subjunctive of the <span class="ital">Recepta</span> (Lücke). Comp.

But the <span class="ital">usual</span> non-interrogative explanation, which makes <span class="greekheb">μή</span> still dependent on <span class="greekheb">φοβοῦμαι</span>, not only makes the passage appear more emphatic (by the three parallels, <span class="greekheb">μήπως</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μήπως</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μή</span>), but is also the only interpretation suited to the context, since, in fact, after the apprehension quite definitely expressed in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>, the negative question, in the case of which a No is to be conceived as the answer (comp. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?...">2 Corinthians 12:17-18</a>), would be inappropriate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <span class="greekheb">μή</span> compared with the previous <span class="greekheb">μήπως</span> there lies a climax as regards the definiteness of the conceptio.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>] goes <span class="ital">along with</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐλθόντος μον ταπεινώσῃ με ὁ θ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πρὸς ὑμ</span>.

So also Rückert, who, however (comp. Chrysostom, Osiander, and several), explains <span class="greekheb">ταπεινώσις</span> of Paul’s seeing himself compelled “to appear before them not with the joyful pride of a father over his good children, but with the punitive earnestness of a judge.” But the punitive earnestness of the judge is in fact no <span class="greekheb">ταπεινώσις</span>, but an act of the apostolic authority, and only follows subsequently, after the <span class="greekheb">ταπεινώσις</span> has taken place by the <span class="ital">observation of the punishment-deserving state</span>, which has made him feel that his efforts have been without resul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πολλοὺς τῶν προημαρτηκότων καὶ μὴ μετανοησάντων</span>], On <span class="greekheb">προημαρτ</span>., comp. Herodian, iii. 14. 8 : <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογεῖσθαι πρὸς τὰ προημαρτημένα</span>. According to Rückert, Paul has written thus inexactly, instead of <span class="greekheb">πολλοὺς τῶν προημαρτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοὺς μὴ μετανοήσαντας</span>. How arbitrary! In that case he would have expressed himself with downright inaccuracy. Lücke, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 20, explains it more ingeniously: “Cogitavit rem ita, ut primum poneret Christianorum ex ethnicis potissimum <span class="greekheb">τῶν προημαρτηκότων καὶ μὴ μετανοησάντων</span> genus universum, cujus generis homines essent ubique ecclesiarum, deinde vero ex isto hominum genere multos eos, qui Corinthi essent, designaret definiretque.” But the reference to the unconverted sinners, who <span class="ital">ubique ecclesiarum essent</span>, is quite foreign to the context, since Paul had simply to do with the Corinthians (comp. previously <span class="greekheb">πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span>), and hence these could not seek the genus of the <span class="greekheb">προημαρτηκότων κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="ital">here meant</span> elsewhere than just <span class="ital">in their own church</span>. The right interpretation results undoubtedly from the order of the thoughts specified at <a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>, according to which <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῇ ἀκαθαρσίᾳ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. cannot belong to <span class="greekheb">μετανοησ</span>.
