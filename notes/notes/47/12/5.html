Then he saw with open vision; now he walks by faith and not by the thing seen. He can hardly recognise his own identity, and can speak of the man who had then this capacity for the beatific vision as though he were another—almost as if he were dead and gone. The “<span class= "ital">non sum qualis eram”</span> of decay and age presents manifold varieties of form, the soldier recalling the stir and the rush of battle, the poet finding that the vision and the “faculty divine” are no longer entrusted to his keeping, the eloquent orator who had “wielded at will a fierce democracy,” complaining of slow speech and of a stammering tongue; but this has a sadness peculiar to itself. Faith, hope, love, peace, righteousness, are still there, but there has passed away a glory from the earth, and the joy of that ecstatic rapture lies in the remote past, never to return on earth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-5.htm" title="Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities....">2 Corinthians 12:5-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Of such a one will I, </span>or, I might, <span class="ital">glory </span>— As a person highly favoured of Christ; <span class="ital">yet of myself </span>— Considered as in myself; <span class="ital">I will not glory </span>— Willingly; <span class="ital">but in my infirmities </span>— See on <a href="/2_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities.">2 Corinthians 11:30</a>.

Macknight thinks he addresses the faction here by way of irony, and that the sense is, “I might with truth boast of the visions and revelations of the Lord with which I have been honoured, but I will not, for fear any of you should think me a greater person than my mean bodily appearance which he seeth, and my contemptible speech, which he heareth, warrant him to think me.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 There can be no doubt the apostle speaks of himself. Whether heavenly things were brought down to him, while his body was in a trance, as in the case of ancient prophets; or whether his soul was dislodged from the body for a time, and taken up into heaven, or whether he was taken up, body and soul together, he knew not. We are not capable, nor is it fit we should yet know, the particulars of that glorious place and state. He did not attempt to publish to the world what he had heard there, but he set forth the doctrine of Christ. On that foundation the church is built, and on that we must build our faith and hope. And while this teaches us to enlarge our expectations of the glory that shall be revealed, it should render us contented with the usual methods of learning the truth and will of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of such an one will I glory - Of such a man it would be right to boast. It would be admitted that it is right to exult in such a man, and to esteem him to be uniquely favored by God. I will boast of him as having received special honor from the Lord. Bloomfield, however, supposes that the words rendered "of such an one should be translated "of such a thing," or of such a transaction; meaning" I can indeed justly boast of my being caught up to heaven as of a thing the whole glory of which pertains to him who has thus exalted me; but of myself, or of anything in me, I will not boast." So Rosenmuller explains it. But it seems to me that the connection requires that we should understand it of a person, and that the passage is partly ironical. Paul speaks in the third person. He chooses to keep himself directly out of view. And though he refers really to himself, yet he wound not say this directly, but says that of such a man they would admit it would be proper to boast.<p>Yet of myself - Directly. It is not expedient for me to boast of myself. "You would allow me to boast of such a man as I have referred to; I admit that it is not proper for me to boast directly of myself."<p>But in mine infirmities - My weaknesses, trials, pains, sufferings; such as many regard as infirmities; see the note on <a href="/2_corinthians/11-30.htm">2 Corinthians 11:30</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. of myself&#8212;concerning myself. Self is put in the background, except in respect to his infirmities.

The apostle in great modesty seems to speak of some other person, and not himself, as caught up into the third heaven, when he yet means himself; and does as it were distinguish himself from himself; himself in paradise from himself on earth; his sense is, that though he might lawfully glory of such a person so highly exalted and favoured, yet since this was his own case, he chose to forbear, and say no more of it: <p>yet of myself I will not glory; though he could, and might, and did glory in the Lord, who had done such great things for him; as that he was in Christ, and knew himself to be so, had been rapt up into heaven, and heard things unutterable; yet he would not glory of these things as from himself, as owing to any merit or worthiness of his, but as instances of mere favour, grace, and goodness; if he gloried of anything of himself in his present state and condition, it should be of his weaknesses: <p>but in mine infirmities; not his sinful ones, for these he mourned over, and was humbled before God and man under a sense of; but his many pressing difficulties of life, heavy reproaches, very great afflictions, and violent persecutions he endured for Christ's sake; see <a href="/2_corinthians/12-10.htm">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</span><p>(2) To remove all suspicion of seeking glory, he witnesses that he brags not of those things as though they were of himself, but as outside of himself.

The reader understood him! to the effect, namely, that apart from that difference of persons underlying the mere representation, the essential meaning of <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τοῦ τοιούτου καυχήσομαι</span> was the same as if Paul had written: <span class="greekheb">τὸ τοιοῦτο</span> (or <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ τοιούτῳ</span>) <span class="greekheb">καυχήσομαι</span>. But this may not mislead us, with Luther, Mosheim, Zachariae, Heumann, Schulz, Rosenmüller, Rückert, to take <span class="greekheb">τούτου</span> as <span class="ital">neuter</span>; for in favour of the view that it is <span class="ital">masculine</span> (so after Chrysostom, most expositors, including Flatt, Fritzsche, Billroth, Olshausen, de Wette, Ewald, Osiander, Hofmann) we may decisively urge not merely <span class="greekheb">τὸν τοιοῦτον</span>, <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven....">2 Corinthians 12:2-3</a>, as well as the personal contrast in <span class="greekheb">ἐμαυτοῦ</span>, and the otherwise marred symmetry of the whole mode of representation (see Fritzsche, <span class="ital">Diss.</span> II. 124), but also <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span>, which with <span class="greekheb">καυχᾶσθαι</span> denotes the <span class="ital">person</span> for whose <span class="ital">advantage</span> (see on <a href="/2_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>), not simply <span class="ital">in regard to</span> whom (Hofmann), the boast is made; the <span class="ital">thing</span> is afterwards by <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> expressly distinguished from the person. The objection of Rückert, that Paul might not push the conception so far! is quite invalid, since, in fact, the readers, if they once knew that from <a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a> onward he meant <span class="ital">himself, could</span> not at all misunderstand hi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰ μή</span> is not for <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν μή</span> (Rückert), but it introduces an actually existing exception to that principle[366] <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἐμαυτοῦ οὐ καυχήσομαι</span>.

Self-glorying otherwise is only then to take place on his part, when his own Ego (his work, toil, merit, etc.) does not come at all into consideration, but he is merely the dependent, receptive instrument of the Lord, and appears as a <span class="ital">third person</span>, on behalf of whom the <span class="greekheb">καυχᾶσθαι</span> takes place.

He has been compelled by the folly and perversity of certain among the Corinthians to touch on these proofs of Divine favour, but he just glances at the topic and passes it by; nay, he even seems to make a distinction between himself as he is and the man once so highly glorified by God, and returns to a kind of boasting more in accordance with his own sense of propriety.
