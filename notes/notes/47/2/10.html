Even sorrow for sin should not unfit for other duties, and drive to despair. Not only was there danger last Satan should get advantage, by tempting the penitent to hard thoughts of God and religion, and so drive him to despair; but against the churches and the ministers of Christ, by bringing an evil report upon Christians as unforgiving; thus making divisions, and hindering the success of the ministry. In this, as in other things, wisdom is to be used, that the ministry may not be blamed for indulging sin on the one hand, or for too great severity towards sinners on the other hand. Satan has many plans to deceive, and knows how to make a bad use of our mistakes.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To whom ye forgive anything - The sense here is, "I have confidence in you as a Christian society and such confidence, that if you forgive an offence in one of your members, I shall approve the act, and shall also be ready to forgive." He refers, doubtless, to this particular case; but he makes his remark general. It is implied here, I think, that the Corinthians were disposed to forgive the offending brother; and Paul here assures them that they had his hearty assent to this, and that if they did forgive him, he was ready to join them in the act, and to forgive him also.<p>For if I forgave anything - If I forgive anything; if I remit any of the punishments which have been inflicted by my authority.<p>For your sakes - It is not on account of the offender alone; it is in order to promote the happiness and purity of the church.<p>In the person of Christ - Locke paraphrases this, "By the authority, and in the name of Christ." Doddridge," As in the person of Christ, and by the high authority with which he has been pleased to invest me." Tyndale, "In the room of Christ." The word rendered "person" (Margin, "sight," &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  proso&#772;pon, from &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  pros and &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c8;  o&#772;ps), means properly the part toward, at, and around the eye - Robinson. Then it means the face, visage, countenance; then the presence, person, etc. Here it probably means, in the presence of Christ; with his eye upon me, and conscious that I am acting before him, and must give account to him. It implies, undoubtedly, that Paul acted by his authority, and felt that he was doing that which Christ would approve. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

If I have showed any favour to any person amongst you that hath fallen under my reproof and chastisement, it hath been for your sake, for the good and advantage of your church, or upon their motion and intercession; and I have done it sincerely in the sight of Christ (the Greek is, in the face of Christ). <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also,.... This may extend to the forgiveness of any person, in any case; either in time past, or at the present time, or in time to come; though it has a particular respect to the forgiveness of the incestuous man, which the apostle had determined in his own mind, and was very ready to come into, and very desirous to join with the church in, as they had joined with him in the excommunication of him; and in order to engage them in such a temper and disposition, he tells them it was on their account he did it: <p>for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it; which is as if he should say, whenever I have forgiven any offender, as I now do forgive this man, I always do it for your sake; either at your request, or in confidence of this, that you yourselves have forgiven; or for your good, peace, and welfare: and besides, what I do of this kind, I do it <p>in the person of Christ; in his sight and presence, who knows that what I do this way, I do it sincerely, and with my whole heart and soul; or rather I do it in his name, and by his authority; and since I forgive this man for your sakes, and in the name of Christ, you ought to do so likewise. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To whom ye forgive any thing, I <i>forgive</i> also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave <i>it</i>, for your sakes <i>forgave I it</i> in the <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> person of Christ;</span><p>(h) Truly, and from the heart.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/2-10.htm" title="To whom you forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;">2 Corinthians 2:10</a>.

Further, the <span class="ital">meaning</span> contained in Rückert’s explanation would express an indifference and accommodation so strangely at variance with the apostolic authority, that the apostle would only have been thereby lowered in the eyes of his reader.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ᾧ δέ τι χαρίζεσθε</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐγώ</span>] <span class="ital">general</span> assurance (and this general expression remains also in the reason assigned that follows), to which the present special case is subordinated. The reader <span class="ital">knew</span> to <span class="ital">whom</span> the <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span> and to <span class="ital">what</span> the <span class="greekheb">τί</span> were to be applie.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Reason assigned for what was just said. “<span class="ital">For</span> this circumstance, that I also pardon him to whom you pardon anything, rests on reciprocity: <span class="ital">what also I</span> on my part <span class="ital">have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything, I have pardoned with a regard to you</span>”—i.e. <span class="ital">in order that my forgiveness may be followed by yours</span>. This definite meaning of <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὑμᾶς</span> (not the general: <span class="ital">for your benefit</span>, as Flatt, de Wette, Osiander, and many others have it) is, according to the context, demanded by <span class="greekheb">ᾧ τι χαρ</span>., <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐγώ</span>, in virtue of the logical relation of the clause containing the reason to this assurance. Paul, however, has not again written the <span class="ital">present</span> <span class="greekheb">χαρίζομαι</span>, but <span class="greekheb">κεχάρισμαι</span>, because he wishes to hold before his readers his own <span class="ital">example</span>, consequently his own precedent already set in the pardon in question. Between this <span class="greekheb">κεχάρισμαι</span>, however, and the <span class="greekheb">χαρίζομαι</span> to be supplied after <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐγώ</span>, there is no logical contradiction. For in <span class="greekheb">ᾧ δέ τι χαρίζεσθε</span> the act of the sinner is considered as <span class="ital">an offence to the church</span>; as such, the church <span class="ital">is to</span> forgive it, and then the apostle <span class="ital">will</span> also forgive it: but in <span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ ὁ κεχάρισμαι</span> it is conceived as a <span class="ital">vexation to the apostle</span>; as such, Paul <span class="ital">has</span> forgiven it, and that <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὑμᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">for the sake of the church</span>, in order that it too may now give free course to the pardon which the offence produced in it needed.[144] To this thoughtful combination of the various references of the act, and to the placable spirit by which the representation is pervaded, the intervening clause <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἼ ΤΙ ΚΕΧΆΡΙΣΜΑΙ</span></span></span> corresponds, which is by no means intended to make the act of pardon <span class="ital">problematical</span> (de Wette), or to designate it only as <span class="ital">eventual</span>, turning on the supposition of the church granting forgiveness (Billroth), but contains a delicate reference back to <a href="/2_corinthians/2-5.htm" title="But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.">2 Corinthians 2:5</a>, in this sense, namely: <span class="ital">if</span>—seeing that the sinner, according to <a href="/2_corinthians/2-5.htm" title="But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.">2 Corinthians 2:5</a>, has not properly grieved me, but you—<span class="ital">that which I designate as</span> <span class="greekheb">κεχάρισμαι</span> <span class="ital">is really this</span>; for the having pardoned presupposes the pardoner to be the <span class="ital">injured</span> party, which Paul, however, <a href="/2_corinthians/2-5.htm" title="But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.">2 Corinthians 2:5</a>, denied himself to be.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Against all versions, Fathers and expositors, Rückert has taken <span class="greekheb">κεχάρισμαι</span> <span class="ital">passively</span>[145] of the pardoning grace which Paul experienced through his <span class="ital">conversion</span>. The sense would thus be: “<span class="ital">for whatever I have got pardoned, if I have got anything pardoned, I have got it pardoned for your sakes</span> (in order as apostle of the Gentiles to lead you to salvation).” See my <span class="ital">third</span> edition. This exposition is incorrect, partly because there is nothing in the text to suggest an allusion to the apostle’s conversion; partly because this pardoning grace was to him so firm and certain, and, in fact, the whole psychological basis of his working, that he could not, even in the most humble reminiscence of his pre-Christian conduct (comp. <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-9.htm" title="For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God....">1 Corinthians 15:9-10</a>), have presented it as problematical by <span class="greekheb">εἴ τι κεχάρισμαι</span>; partly because with this problematical inserted clause the very <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΠΡΟΣΏΠῼ ΧΡΙΣΤΟῦ</span></span></span> (explained by Rückert: “on the countenance of Christ beaming with God’s grace”) would be at varianc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΠΡΟΣΏΠῼ ΧΡΙΣΤΟῦ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">i.e. in conspectu Christi</span>, comp. <a href="/proverbs/8-30.htm" title="Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;">Proverbs 8:30</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/32-4.htm" title="Pour not out words where there is a musician, and shew not forth wisdom out of time.">Sir 32:4</a>, denotes the having pardoned, in so far as it has taken place <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὑμᾶς</span>, in its fullest <span class="ital">purity and truth</span>. It has taken place <span class="ital">in presence of Christ</span>, so that He was <span class="ital">witness</span> of it. Interpretations at variance with the words are: <span class="ital">in Christ’s stead</span> (Vulgate, Ambrosiaster, Luther, Calovius, Wetstein, and others): <span class="ital">by Christ</span>, as an oath (Emmerling), and others. Hofmann, who without reason maintains that according to our view it must have run <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐν προσώπῳ Χ</span>., attaches the words to what follows, so that they would precede the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> by way of emphasis, like <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΓΆΠΗΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.">2 Corinthians 2:4</a> (see on <a href="/romans/11-31.htm" title="Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.">Romans 11:31</a>), and the meaning would be: <span class="ital">Christ should not be obliged to be a spectator</span> of how Satan deprives His church of one of its members. This interpretation could only be justified if we were in any way by the context prepared for the <span class="greekheb">ἐν προσώπῳ Χ</span>., thus taken as a <span class="ital">specially tragic feature</span> of the devil’s guile. Besides, the thought that the devil injures the church <span class="ital">under the eyes of Christ</span>, would be nowhere else expressed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe, further, how, according to this passage, the penitence of the sinner, just as much as the removal of the offence to the church, is the aim of church-discipline, and hence its initiation and cessation are to be measured accordingly; but the Roman Catholic doctrine of indulgence[146] is at variance with this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[144] Not: to get rid of the painful relation in which they stood to that sinner, as Hofmann infers, from his incorrect interpretation of <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ ἐπιβαρῶ πάντας ὑμᾶς</span>, ver. 5.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[145] This passive use would in itself be correct as to language.

This is not a general principle, but a statement of the Apostle’s feelings at the present juncture; if they are willing to forgive the offender, so is he. Whether he advocates punishment or forgiveness it is always <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὑμᾶς</span>, “for your sakes,” and it is <span class="greekheb">ἐν προσώπῳ Χριστοῦ</span>, “in the sight of Christ”. <span class="greekheb">πρόσωπον</span> (see on <a href="/2_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>) is a “face,” and so <span class="greekheb">ἐν προσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>. is a stronger way of saying <span class="greekheb">ἐνώπιον Χριστοῦ</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> chap. <a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/8-21.htm" title="Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>, <a href="/galatians/1-20.htm" title="Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.">Galatians 1:20</a>); the Apostle claims that his acts of condemnation and forgiveness are done as “in the presence of Christ”. Both A.V. and R.V. render “in the person of Christ,” which would mean that St. Paul had acted as Christ’s delegate. But the usage of <span class="greekheb">πρόσωπον</span> in 2 <span class="ital">Cor.</span> is against this interpretation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>10. <span class="ital">To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also</span>] St Paul is here exercising the power of the keys (see <a href="/matthew/16-19.htm" title="And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.">Matthew 16:19</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-18.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.">Matthew 18:18</a>; <a href="/john/20-23.htm" title="Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.">John 20:23</a>). He is not speaking of any private forgiveness of a personal injury, but of the public absolution of an offender lying under the censure of the church. See <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,...">1 Corinthians 5:4-5</a>. We may observe (1) that St Paul acts upon the report of the Corinthian Church properly authenticated by Titus, his representative there (ch. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;...">2 Corinthians 7:6-14</a>), and (2) that he gives his official sanction to their act.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to whom I forgave it</span>] Most modern Editors read <span class="ital">what</span> for <span class="ital">to whom</span>, and the verb stands in the perfect, implying that the affair is at an end. ‘<span class="ital">What I have forgiven, I have forgiven on your account</span>.’ St Paul does not claim the right to ratify their act for the satisfaction of his own sense of importance, but because his Apostolic office is necessary for their edification and guidance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the person of Christ</span>] Cranmer and the Geneva version render ‘in the <span class="ital">sight</span>’ (literally, in the <span class="bld">face</span>) of Christ. So also Calvin. The Vulgate which is followed by Wiclif, and of course the Rhemish, renders as in the text. Tyndale renders <span class="ital">roume</span>. As the Greek word signifies both <span class="ital">person</span> and <span class="ital">face</span>, the point must be left undecided. If the A. V. be correct, then St Paul acts in this matter as Christ’s representative. If the other is the correct rendering, then he performs a solemn public act in the sight of Christ and the powers unseen. It should however, be added that in this Epistle we have the word here used in the sense of <span class="ital">person</span> in ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>, and in the sense of <span class="ital">face</span> in ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm" title="But if the ministration of death, written and engraved in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:">2 Corinthians 3:13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>, and that the expression occurs again in ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>, where see note.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/2-10.htm" title="To whom you forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;">2 Corinthians 2:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὶ</span>, <span class="ital">any thing</span>) He speaks very gently of the atrocious, but acknowledged sin.—<span class="greekheb">χαρίζεσθε</span>, <span class="ital">ye forgive</span>) He has no doubt, but that they will do what he wrote at <a href="/2_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="So that contrariwise you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐγὼ</span>, <span class="ital">I also</span>) He modestly subscribes assent to the act of the Corinthians, and regards himself, as it were in the same category with them.—<span class="greekheb">εἲ τι κεχάρισμαι</span>, <span class="ital">if I forgave any thing</span>) The matter is limited by <span class="ital">if any thing</span>, in order that Paul may show his willingness to follow up the forgiveness granted to the sinner by the Corinthians.

It would, perhaps, be pressing it too much to imply that their "forgiveness" showed that they had not accurately stood the test of perfect obedience; yet it is difficult to read the whole passage without suspecting that St. Paul, while by temperament he leaned to the side of mercy, is here showing a spirit of generous self-suppression m accepting the course which the Corinthians had followed, although it had, in some way or other, diverged from his exact directions. <span class="accented">To whom</span>, Obviously, again, a purposely indefinite reference to the incestuous person. <span class="cmt_word">I forgive also.</span> The power of "binding" and "loosing," of "forgiving" and "retaining," had only been given to the apostles representatively and collectively, and therefore to the Christian Church (<a href="/john/20-23.htm">John 20:23</a>) in its corporate capacity. The Corinthian Church had in this case decided to forgive, and St. Paul ratifies their decision. <span class="cmt_word">For if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it.</span> The reading here varies between <span class="greek">&#x1f45;</span>, <span class="accented">what</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;</span>, to whom, which in dictation might be easily confused. The order of the words also varies. The best reading seems to be expressed by the version, "For what I also have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything (I have pardoned it) for your sakes." This represents the reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, F, G, etc., and is followed by the Revised Version. There seems to be here an intentional vagueness, and reference to circumstances of which we are not informed, which might, perhaps, have given room for wounded feelings in any one less magnanimous than St. Paul. The line he took in this matter was taken for their sakes - that is all he says, he adopted it as the best <span class="accented">relatively</span>, whether it was <span class="accented">absolutely</span> the best or not. <span class="cmt_word">In the person of Christ;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the face of Christ</span>; which seems to mean "in the presence of Christ," as though he were looking on at what I did (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-11.htm">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7, 13, 18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>).
