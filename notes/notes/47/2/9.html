On the whole, the former interpretation seems preferable. It scarcely seems like St. Paul to make the punishment a trial of obedience. There is a characteristic subtle delicacy of thought in his suggesting that, having shown obedience in punishing they should show it also in forgiving.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 The apostle desires them to receive the person who had done wrong, again into their communion; for he was aware of his fault, and much afflicted under his punishment. Even sorrow for sin should not unfit for other duties, and drive to despair. Not only was there danger last Satan should get advantage, by tempting the penitent to hard thoughts of God and religion, and so drive him to despair; but against the churches and the ministers of Christ, by bringing an evil report upon Christians as unforgiving; thus making divisions, and hindering the success of the ministry. In this, as in other things, wisdom is to be used, that the ministry may not be blamed for indulging sin on the one hand, or for too great severity towards sinners on the other hand. Satan has many plans to deceive, and knows how to make a bad use of our mistakes.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For to this end also did I write - The apostle did not say that this was the only purpose of his writing, to induce them to excommunicate the offender. He does not say that he wished in an arbitrary manner to test their willingness to obey him, or to induce them to do a thing in itself wrong, in order to try their obedience. But the meaning is this: This was the main reason why he wrote to them, rather than to come personally among them. The thing ought to have been done; the offender ought to be punished; and Paul says that he adopted the method of writing to them rather than of coming among them in person, in order to give them an opportunity to show whether they were disposed to be obedient. And the sense is, "You may now forgive him. He has not only been sufficiently punished, and he has not only evinced suitable penitence, but also another object which I had in view has been accomplished. I desired to see whether you were, as a church, disposed to be obedient. That object, also, has been accomplished. And now, since everything aimed at in the case of discipline has been secured, you may forgive him, and should, without hesitation, again receive him to the bosom of the church." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. For&#8212;Additional reason why they should restore the offender, namely, as a "proof" of their obedience "in all things"; now in love, as previously in punishing (2Co 2:6), at the apostle's desire. Besides his other reasons for deferring his visit, he had the further view, though, perhaps, unperceived by them, of making an experiment of their fidelity. This accounts for his deferring to give, in his Epistle, the reason for his change of plan (resolved on before writing it). This full discovery of his motive comes naturally from him now, in the second Epistle, after he had seen the success of his measures, but would not have been a seasonable communication before. All this accords with reality, and is as remote as possible from imposture [Paley, Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;]. The interchange of feeling is marked (2Co 2:4), "I wrote &#8230; that ye might know the love," &c.: here, "I did write, that I might know the proof of you."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As for other ends, so for this also I wrote my former Epistle to you, and I now write this Second Epistle to you also, that I might have an experiment of you, what regard you would show to that apostolical authority wherewith God hath invested me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For to this end also did I write,.... Or "I have written", both in this and in his former epistle to them, and in both with this view, <p>that I might know the proof of you; that he might try, prove, and know them: <p>whether ye be obedient in all things; he wrote unto them in his former epistle, to put away that wicked man from them; which he did not do, merely to reproach the man, and fix a brand of infamy on him; nor merely to grieve and afflict their minds; nor only to show his own power and authority, which he as an apostle had received from Christ, but to make trial of their obedience; and he had had a proof of it in their rejection of him; and now he writes unto them, that since this man was truly humbled for his sin, and had repentance unto life not to be repented of, that they would as cheerfully receive him, and restore him to his place; that as the apostle had a proof of their obedience in the one, he might also have in the other, and so in all things: hence it appears, that though it belongs to the whole church, and that only, to reject or receive members, yet as ministers of the Gospel are set over the churches, to govern, guide, direct, and go before in matters of discipline; so whatever they propose, according to the rule of God's word, ought to be carefully attended to and obeyed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.">2 Corinthians 2:9</a>. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things....">2 Corinthians 2:9-10</a> are not to be placed in a parenthesis, nor <a href="/2_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.">2 Corinthians 2:9</a> alone (Flatt); but the discourse proceeds without interruption. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.">2 Corinthians 2:9</a>, namely, begins to <span class="ital">furnish grounds</span> for the <span class="greekheb">κυρῶσαι εἰς αὐτὸν ἀγάπην</span>, and, first of all, <span class="ital">from the aim of the former Epistle</span>, which aim (in reference to the relation to the incestuous person in the case of most of them at least) was attained, so that now nothing on this point stood in the way of the <span class="greekheb">κυρῶσαι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. “Correcta enim eorum segnitie nihil jam obstabat, quominus hominem prostratum et jacentem sua mansuetudine erigerent,” Calvi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς τοῦτο</span>] points to the following <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>.

It is hard to decide between the readings <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span>, “whether,” or <span class="greekheb">ᾗ</span>, “whereby” (see crit. note); but the general sense is the same in both cases. A comparison of this verse with <a href="/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.">2 Corinthians 7:12</a> has led some critics to doubt whether chaps. 2 and 7 really refer at all to the offender of <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>; for the expressed object of St. Paul’s communication was to prove the loyalty of the Corinthians to himself.

But <a href="/context/2_corinthians/2-5.htm" title="But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all....">2 Corinthians 2:5-9</a> seem quite consecutive, and we find it more natural to interpret <a href="/2_corinthians/2-5.htm" title="But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.">2 Corinthians 2:5</a> in reference to <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1 Corinthians 5:1</a> ff; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1 Corinthians 7:12</a> seems clearly to distinguish <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀδικηθείς</span> from St. Paul himself (see <span class="ital">Introd.</span>, p. 15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>9. <span class="ital">For to this end also did I write</span>] St Paul here gives a third reason for writing the first Epistle. Not only was he anxious for the restoration of the offender, for a visit to Corinth which should have nothing of a painful character about it, but he wished to test the readiness of the Corinthians to submit to his authority (cf. ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.">2 Corinthians 7:15</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/10-6.htm" title="And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.">2 Corinthians 10:6</a>), a point on which (1 Corinthians 9, 2 Corinthians 10-12) at that moment there was considerable doubt. See also note on <span class="ital"><a href="/2_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.">2 Corinthians 2:6</a></span>. Some commentators, however, contend that the word <span class="greekheb">ἔγραψα</span>, though an aorist, is, as what is called the Epistolary aorist, to be translated “I write” (as in <a href="/1_john/2-14.htm" title="I have written to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God stays in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.">1 John 2:14</a>), and that it refers to the <span class="ital">present</span> letter, and that the test of obedience St Paul desired was the display of forgiveness. But this seems hardly consistent with <a href="/1_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>. See also <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm" title="Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.">Php 2:12</a>, and <span class="ital"><a href="/2_corinthians/2-3.htm" title="And I wrote this same to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.">2 Corinthians 2:3</a></span> of this chapter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the proof</span>] That which has been tested and has borne the test.
