Even then the ways of error were manifold, and the way of truth was one. Among Judaisers, and the seekers after Greek wisdom, asserters of license for liberty, questioners of the resurrection: how few were those who preached the true word of God in its purity! The word for “corrupt,” formed from a word which signifies “huckster” or “tavern-keeper,” implies an adulteration like that which such people commonly practised. We, says St. Paul, play no such tricks of trade with what we preach; we do not meet the tastes of our hearers by prophesying deceits. The very fact that we know the tremendous issues of our work would hinder that. Comp. St. Peter’s use of the same figure in “the sincere (the <span class= "ital">unadulterated</span>) milk of the <span class= "ital">reason”</span> (<a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm" title="As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:">1Peter 2:2</a>). It is doubtful whether the imagery of the triumph is still present to his thoughts. If it were, we may think of the word “corrupt” as connected with the thought of the sweet savour: “Our incense, at any rate, is pure. If it brings death it is through no fault of ours. It is not a poisoned perfume.”<p><span class= "bld">As of sincerity, but as of God.</span>—The two clauses are half connected, half contrasted. To have said “of sincerity” alone would have been giving too much prominence to what was purely subjective. He could not feel sure that he was sincere unless he knew that his sincerity was given to him by God. (For the word “sincerity,” see Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2Corinthians 1:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>. </span><span class="ital">For we are not as many who corrupt — </span>Greek, <span class="greekheb">καπηλευοντες</span>, <span class="ital">adulterate, the word of God </span>— Like those vintners who mix their wines with baser liquors.

To him be the praise and glory of all, while the success of the gospel is a good reason for a Christian's joy and rejoicing. In ancient triumphs, abundance of perfumes and sweet odours were used; so the name and salvation of Jesus, as ointment poured out, was a sweet savour diffused in every place. Unto some, the gospel is a savour of death unto death. They reject it to their ruin. Unto others, the gospel is a savour of life unto life: as it quickened them at first when they were dead in trespasses and sins, so it makes them more lively, and will end in eternal life. Observe the awful impressions this matter made upon the apostle, and should also make upon us. The work is great, and of ourselves we have no strength at all; all our sufficiency is of God. But what we do in religion, unless it is done in sincerity, as in the sight of God, is not of God, does not come from him, and will not reach to him. May we carefully watch ourselves in this matter; and seek the testimony of our consciences, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, that as of sincerity, so speak we in Christ and of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we are not as many - This refers doubtless to the false teachers at Corinth; and to all who mingled human philosophy or tradition with the pure word of truth. Paul's design in the statement in this verse seems to be to affirm that he had such a deep sense of the responsibility of the ministerial office, and of its necessary influence on the eternal destiny of man, that it led him to preach the simple gospel, the pure word of God. He did not dare to dilute it with any human mixture. He did not dare to preach philosophy, or human wisdom. He did not dare to mingle with it the crude conceptions of man. He sought to exhibit the simple truth as it was in Jesus; and so deep was his sense of the responsibility of the office, and so great was his desire on the subject, that he had been enabled to do it. and to triumph always in Christ. So that, although he was conscious that he was in himself unfit for these things, yet by the grace of God he had been able always to exhibit the simple truth, and his labors had been crowned with constant and signal success.<p>Which corrupt the word of God - Margin, "deal deceitfully with." The word used here (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  kape&#772;leuontes) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, and does not occur in the Septuagint. The word is derived from &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  kape&#772;los, which signifies properly a huckster, or a retailer of wine, a petty chapman; a man who buys up articles for the purpose of selling them again. It also means sometimes a vintner, or an innkeeper. The proper idea is that of a small dealer and especially in wine. Such persons were notorious, as they are now, for diluting their wines with water (compare the Septuagint in <a href="/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>); and for compounding wines of other substances than the juice of the grape for purposes of gain. Wine, of all substances in trade, perhaps, affords the greatest facilities for such dishonest tricks; and, accordingly, the dealers in that article have generally been most distinguished for fraudulent practices and corrupt and diluted mixtures. Hence, the word comes to denote to adulterate; to corrupt, etc. It is here applied to those who adulterated or corrupted the pure word of God in any way, and for any purpose. It probably has particular reference to those who did it either by Judaizing opinions, or by the mixtures of a false and deceitful philosophy. The latter mode would be likely to prevail among the subtle and philosophizing Greeks. It is in such ways that the gospel has been usually corrupted:<p>(1) It is done by attempting to attach a philosophical explanation to the facts of revelation, and making the theory as important as the fact.<p>(2) by attempting to explain away the offensive points of revelation by the aid of philosophy.<p>(3) by attempting to make the facts of Scripture accord with the prevalent notions of philosophy, and by applying a mode of interpretation to the Bible which would fritter away its meaning, and make it mean anything or nothing at pleasure. In these, and in various other ways, people have corrupted the Word of God; and of all the evils which Christianity has ever sustained in this world, the worst have been those which it has received from philosophy, and from those teachers who have corrupted the Word of God. The fires of persecution it could meet, and still be pure; the utmost efforts of princes, and monarchs, and of Satan to destroy it, it has outlived, and has shone purely and brightly amidst all these efforts; but, when corrupted by philosophy, and by "science falsely so called," it has been dimmed in its luster, paralyzed in its aims, and shorn of its power, and has ceased to be mighty in pulling down the strong holds of Satan's kingdom. Accordingly, the enemy of God has ceased to excite persecution, and now aims in various ways to corrupt the gospel by the admixture of philosophy, and of human opinions. Tyndale renders this passage, "For we are not as many are which choppe and change with the word of God" - an idea which is important and beautiful - but this is one of the few instances in which he mistook the sense of the original text. In general, the accuracy of his translation and his acquaintance with the true sense of the Greek text are very remarkable.<p>But as of sincerity - Sincerely; actuated by unmingled honesty and simplicity of aim; see the note on <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>.<p>As of God - As influenced by him; as under his control and direction; as having been sent by him; as acting by his command; see the note, <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>.<p>In the sight of God - As if we felt that his eye was always on us. Nothing is better suited to make a person sincere and honest, than this.<p>Speak we in Christ - In the name, and in the service of Christ. We deliver our message with a deep consciousness that the eye of the all-seeing God is on us; that we can conceal nothing from Him; and that we must soon give up our account to Him.<p>Remarks<p>1. In this chapter, and in the management of the whole case to which Paul here refers, we have an instance of his tenderness in administering discipline. This tenderness was manifested in many ways:<p>(1) He did nothing to wound the feelings of the offending party.<p>(2) he did nothing in the way of punishment which a stern sense of duty did not demand,<p>(3) he did it all with many tears. He wept at the necessity of administering discipline at all. He wept over the remissness of the church. He wept over the fall of the offending brother.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. not as many&#8212;(2Co 11:18; Php 2:21).

We are not (saith the apostle) of the number of those who in preaching merely serve their own bellies, and turn the church into a tavern or victualling house, making a gain of the gospel, and discoursing a little while in a pulpit for gain; and so making no conscience, either what they speak, or how they speak. But we speak by authority from Christ, and in Christ’s name; clothed with his authority, and as his ambassadors; and so dare not say any thing unto people, and deliver to his people what he never gave us any commission to speak, nor yet to speak whatever cometh at our tongue’s end; but we must remember that we are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in the sight of God, </span> and speak as from God of God; and that not fraudulently, but sincerely; sincerely aiming at the glory of God in what we do, and the salvation of the souls of them to whom we speak. This is a great work, first to consult the mind and will of God, and find it out by study and meditation; then faithfully to communicate it unto people, without any vain or corrupt mixtures (which do but adulterate the word preached); then to apply it to the consciences of those that hear us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Who is sufficient for these things?</span> That is, to discharge the office of the ministry in the preaching of the gospel, as men ought to preach it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For we are not as many,.... The apostle here removes from himself, and other ministers of the Gospel, a character which belonged not to them, but to the false apostles; who are described by their number many; there were great swarms of false teachers in the early times of Christianity; see <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>; some copies read, "as the rest": and so the Syriac and Arabic versions; and also by their quality, <p>which corrupt the word of God; by "the word of God", may be meant the Scriptures in general, which are from God, contain his will, and which he uses for the good of men, and his own glory, and may be corrupted by false glosses, and human mixtures, and by adding to them, or taking from them; or the Gospel in particular, which is the word of truth, of faith, righteousness, reconciliation, and salvation, and which was corrupted by these false teachers, by making merchandise of it; they huckstered the word of God, made gain of it, sought merely their own worldly interest and advantage in it, and so mixed it with their own vain philosophy, to please the carnal ears and hearts of men; they blended law and Gospel, grace and works, in the business of salvation; they did, as peddling merchants do, mix good and bad commodities together, and then vend them for sound ware; or as vintners, who mix their wine with water, and sell it for neat wine. The Septuagint interpreters on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>, translate the last clause of that verse thus,     , "thy vintners mix wine with water"; which may be understood in a moral or spiritual sense; so did these men mix, and hereby corrupt the Gospel, the word of God; and so the Syriac version reads the words  "who mix the word of God": now the apostle says, they did not do so; they delivered out the word pure and unmixed, without any corruption or adulteration: <p>but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, says he,  <p>speak we in Christ; they spoke "in Christ", in the name of Christ, of or concerning him, and him only, and freely, fully, and plainly, as God's free gift, and the only way of salvation without the works of men: and they spoke, "as of sincerity"; what they delivered was the sincere milk of the word; the manner in which they did it was sincere, with all integrity and faithfulness; and so were their views, which were not their own profit and applause, but the glory of God and the good of souls; they spoke in Christ, and with all sincerity, "as of God"; by whom they were called and sent forth to speak in his name, and from whom they received the Gospel, and gifts, and abilities to preach it; and all this they did, in the sight of God, as the searcher of hearts, and to whom they knew they must give an account of their ministry another day. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For we are not as many, which <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</span><p>(l) We do not handle it craftily and covetously, or less sincerely than we ought.

The word of God may be corrupted (1) by the admixture of foreign doctrines, e. g. those of the Judaizers, who grafted on Christianity the alien doctrine of the universal obligation of the Jewish law, (2) by degrading the doctrine of Christ into a system of argument and disputation (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect....">1 Corinthians 1:17-31</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.">1 Corinthians 2:1</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:...">1 Corinthians 2:4-5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>), and (3) by the introduction of personal objects, such as influence, authority, the praise of men (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-12.htm" title="For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.">2 Corinthians 11:18</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-17.htm" title="They zealously affect you, but not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you might affect them.">Galatians 4:17</a>). The word here translated <span class="ital">corrupt</span> occurs nowhere else in the New Testament.

The word is not in the Hebrew), and hence from the dishonest practices of these small dealers it has come, by a process somewhat similar to that of our reproachful terms ‘higgling’ or ‘huckstering,’ to mean <span class="ital">adulterate</span>, i.e. to mix what should be pure with worthless or even deleterious substances.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but as of sincerity, but as of God</span>] See note on <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>. The word is here opposed to the idea of corrupting by admixture. The Apostle does not lose sight even here of the truth to which he returns in ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/3-5.htm" title="Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>, that his purity of heart is a supernatural gift.

His sole object is to minister Him. He desires nothing for himself. If he rebukes, it is for the offender’s sake. If he tests the obedience of the Church, it is because he is set over it for its benefit, not for his. If he preaches the word of God, it is by virtue of an inspiration from Him, whereby he preaches simply and faithfully the words put in his mouth by Christ.

This clause is introduced to show how much courage and effort the work requires. "The many" might, by Greek idiom, mean "the majority." The apparent harshness of the assertion that the majority of teachers in the apostolic age  dealt untruly with the Word of God, led to the substitution of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, the rest, in some manuscripts (D, E, F, G, L). But "the many" here means "the many antagonists of mine," who preach a different gospel (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>). It must be remembered that conceit, Pharisaism, moral laxity, and factions were all at work in the Corinthian Church. <span class="cmt_word">Which corrupt.</span> The Word means who are merely" trafficking with," "adulterating<span class="accented"></span>," "huckstering<span class="accented"></span>," the Word of life. The word occurs in the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>; Ecclus. 26:29; and Plato applies the same metaphor to the sophists, who peddle their wisdom about ('Protag.,' p. 313 d). The substantive <span class="accented">kapelos</span> means "a retail dealer," and especially a vintner, and the verb <span class="accented">kapeleuo is</span> always used in a bad sense, like the English "to huckster." Such deceitful dealers with the gospel are described in <a href="/2_peter/2-3.htm">2 Peter 2:3</a>, and in one of the Ignatian letters they are called <span class="accented">Christemporoi</span>, Christ-traffickers. Such were those who altered the perspective of the gospel, lowered its standard, and adulterated it with strange admixtures. Their methods and their teaching are constantly alluded to in these Epistles (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17, 31</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-4</a>; and <a href="/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12, 15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13-15</a>, etc.), <span class="cmt_word">But as of sincerity, but as of God.</span> lake one who speaks from the sincerity of his heart (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>) and by the inspiration of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-25.htm">1 Corinthians 14:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Before God speak we in Christ.</span> The <span class="accented">sphere</span> of our teaching as of our life is Christ; and our work is done <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"As ever in our great Taskmaster's eye."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Which corrupt (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here in the New Testament. From &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; a huckster or pedler; also a tavernkeeper. The &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; formed a distinct class among the Greek dealers, distinguished from the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; merchants or wholesale dealers. So Plato: "Is not retailer (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;) the term which is applied to those who sit in the market-place buying and selling, while those who wander from one city to another are called merchants?" ("Republic," 371; compare "Statesman," 260) The term included dealers in victuals and all sorts of wares, but was especially applied to retailers of wine, with whom adulteration and short measure were matters of course. Galen speaks of wine-dealers &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; playing tricks with their wines; mixing the new, harsh wines, so as to make them pass for old. These not only sold their wares in the market, but had &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1; wine-shops all over the town, where it was not thought respectable to take refreshments. The whole trade was greatly despised. In Thebes no one who had sold in the market within the last ten years was allowed to take part in the government. So Plato, speaking of the evils of luxury and poverty: "What remedy can a city of sense find against this disease? In the first place, they must have as few retail traders as possible" ("Laws," 919. The whole passage is well worth reading). The moral application of the term was familiar in classical Greek. Lucian says: "The philosophers deal out their instructions like hucksters." Plato: "Those who carry about the wares of knowledge, and make the round of the cities, and sell or retail them to any customer who is in want of them, praise them all alike; though I should not wonder if many of them were really ignorant of their effect upon the soul; and their customers equally ignorant, unless he who buys of them happens to be a physician of the soul" ("Protagoras," 313). Paul here uses the term of those who trade in the word of God, adulterating it for the purpose of gain or popularity. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-5.htm">1 Timothy 6:5</a>, Rev. In the "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" occurs the word &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; a Christ-monger (ch. xii., 5). </body></html>
