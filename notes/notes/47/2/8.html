Even sorrow for sin should not unfit for other duties, and drive to despair. Not only was there danger last Satan should get advantage, by tempting the penitent to hard thoughts of God and religion, and so drive him to despair; but against the churches and the ministers of Christ, by bringing an evil report upon Christians as unforgiving; thus making divisions, and hindering the success of the ministry. In this, as in other things, wisdom is to be used, that the ministry may not be blamed for indulging sin on the one hand, or for too great severity towards sinners on the other hand. Satan has many plans to deceive, and knows how to make a bad use of our mistakes.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him - The word rendered here as "confirm" (&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  kuro&#772;sai) occurs in the New Testament only here and in <a href="/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15</a>. It means to give authority, to establish as valid, to confirm; and here means that they should give strong expressions and assurances of their love to him; that they should pursue such a course as would leave no room for doubt in regard to it. Tyndale has well rendered it: "Wherefore I exhort you that love may halve strength over him." Paul referred, doubtless, here to some public act of the church by which the sentence of excommunication might be removed, and by which the offender might have a public assurance of their favor. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. confirm your love toward him&#8212;by giving effect in act, and showing in deeds your love; namely, by restoring him to your fellowship and praying for his recovering from the sickness penally inflicted on him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That you would restore him to a communion with you in your church assemblies, and take him into the bosom of your church again, and be (as before) friendly towards him. The word which we translate <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">confirm; </span> is kurwsai, which signifieth authoritatively to establish or confirm. Some observe, that the apostle speaks to them as judges, to gain their good opinion, and make them more pliable, whereas he might authoritatively have absolved him. It is hard: to say what authority the apostles had, or had not, to excommunicate; but we want a precedent in holy writ of the apostles, or any of them, exercising such a power, as being absent, and so in no capacity to hear the proof of any fact against scandalous persons. Paul <span class="ital">{<span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife....">1 Corinthians 5:1-13</a></span>}</span> writes to the church of Corinth to do it, and doth only himself command them to do their duty; and here again he writeth to them to forgive him, and restore him. There being no mention, either in the former Epistle, or here, of any command that the incestuous person should put away his wife taken unlawfully, or that he did any such thing in testification of his repentance, makes it very probable, that his crime was not using his father’s wife as his wife, but as his harlot; had it been otherwise, we should, very probably, have read of something in the one or the other place, signifying such a command of the apostle, or the thing done by him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore I beseech you,....
