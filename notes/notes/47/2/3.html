The pronoun, which does not refer to anything that has been actually said, shows with what definiteness certain passages in his first letter were stamped upon his memory. The question might be asked, “Why had he written so sharply?” And he makes answer to himself that the result had been what he had intended: that his motive in so writing as to give pain had been to avoid giving and receiving pain when he came in person. He wanted his visit to be one of unmixed joy for himself, and if so, it could not fail, looking to their mutual sympathy, to give his disciples joy also.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 The apostle desired to have a cheerful meeting with them; and he had written in confidence of their doing what was to their benefit and his comfort; and that therefore they would be glad to remove every cause of disquiet from him.

Probably the expression also includes the commands in his former Epistle to reform their conduct in general, and to put away the abuses and evil practices which prevailed in the church there.<p>Lest when I came ... - Lest I should be obliged if I came personally to exercise the severity of discipline, and thus to diffuse sorrow throughout the entire church.<p>I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice - Lest I should have grief in the church. Lest the conduct of the church, and the abuses which prevail in it should give me sorrow. I should be grieved with the existence of these evils; and I should be obliged to resort to measures which would be painful to me, and to the whole church. Paul sought to avoid this by persuading them before he came to exercise the discipline themselves, and to put away the evil practices which prevailed among them.<p>Having confidence in you all - Having confidence that this is your general character, that whatever adds to my joy, or promotes my happiness, would give joy to you all. Paul had enemies in Corinth; he knew that there were some there whose minds were alienated from him, and who were endeavoring to do him injury. Yet he did not doubt that it was the general character of the church that they wished him well, and would desire to make him happy; that what would tend to promote his happiness would also promote theirs; and therefore, that they would be willing to do anything that would make his visit agreeable to him when he came among them. He was, therefore, persuaded that if he wrote them an affectionate letter, they would listen to his injunctions, that thus all that was painful might be avoided when he came among them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

In <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2 Peter 1:5</a>, however, (3) the words here translated ‘this same’ are translated ‘beside this.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice</span>] St Paul hoped by his letter to produce such an effect that those who were blamed in it would abandon their sin. He <span class="ital">ought</span> to rejoice in such persons, for his rejoicing is to see them ‘walk worthy of the vocation wherewith they were called’ (<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a>; cf. <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 3:8</a>); and this, by virtue of their union with Christ, they might do if they would. Had he come, instead of writing, they must have caused him sorrow and not joy by the inconsistency of their Christian walk. Cf. ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all</span>] Cf. ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-16.htm" title="I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.">2 Corinthians 7:16</a>. The Apostle still keeps in view that on which he had lately insisted, the identity of his feelings, hopes, aspirations with those of the Corinthians in virtue of their common life in Christ (see note on <a href="/1_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>). His joy and theirs is to see the members of the Corinthian community entirely led by the Spirit of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-14.htm" title="For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.">Romans 8:14</a>) and producing the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>) in all their actions. See <a href="/john/15-11.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.">John 15:11</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/2-3.htm" title="And I wrote this same to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.">2 Corinthians 2:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ ἔγραψα</span>, <span class="ital">and I wrote</span>) He shows that he had this intention at the time, when he sent his first epistle, in which he had promised a visit, an intention which he explains at <a href="/2_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ὧν</span>, <span class="ital">from whom</span>) as from sons.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>) The joy of Paul itself is desirable not for his own sake, but for the sake of the Corinthians.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I wrote this same unto you.</span> <span class="accented">And I wrote</span>. He meets the tacit objection. If you shrink from causing us pain, why then did you write to us in terms so severe? The "I wrote" may be what is called the epistolary aorist, and will then be equivalent to our "I write:" "What I <span class="accented">write</span> to you now has the very object of sparing you a painful visit." If the aorist has its more ordinary sense, it refers to the First, and not to the present Epistle; and this seems the better view, for the "I wrote" in ver. 9 certainly refers to the First Epistle. <span class="accented">This same thing</span>; namely, exactly what I have written (whether in this or in the former Epistle). The words, "this very thing," may also, in the original, menu "for this very reason," as in <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5</a>, and like the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> in ver. 9. <span class="accented">Unto you</span>. These words should be omitted, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C. <span class="cmt_word">When I came.</span> The emphasis lies in these words. He preferred that his letter, rather than his personal visit, should cause pain. In you all. It is true that in the Corinthian Church St. Paul had bitter and unscrupulous opponents, but he will not believe even that they desired his personal unhappiness. At any rate, if there were any such, he will net believe that they exist, since "love believeth all things, hopeth all things" (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-7.htm">1 Corinthians 13:7</a>). </body></html>
