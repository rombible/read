Titus was to return to him at Troas. Not meeting him there, St. Paul, in his eager anxiety to hear something more than Timotheus had been able to tell him, left Troas, in spite of the opening which it presented for his work as a preacher of the gospel, and hastened on into Macedonia. Taking the route that he had taken before, he would probably go to Philippi, where he would find St. Luke; and we may conjecture, without much risk of error, that it was there that he and Titus met.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:12-17 A believer's triumphs are all in Christ. To him be the praise and glory of all, while the success of the gospel is a good reason for a Christian's joy and rejoicing. In ancient triumphs, abundance of perfumes and sweet odours were used; so the name and salvation of Jesus, as ointment poured out, was a sweet savour diffused in every place. Unto some, the gospel is a savour of death unto death. They reject it to their ruin. Unto others, the gospel is a savour of life unto life: as it quickened them at first when they were dead in trespasses and sins, so it makes them more lively, and will end in eternal life. Observe the awful impressions this matter made upon the apostle, and should also make upon us. The work is great, and of ourselves we have no strength at all; all our sufficiency is of God. But what we do in religion, unless it is done in sincerity, as in the sight of God, is not of God, does not come from him, and will not reach to him. May we carefully watch ourselves in this matter; and seek the testimony of our consciences, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, that as of sincerity, so speak we in Christ and of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I had no rest in my spirit - I was disappointed, sad, deeply anxious.

I went over where I expected to find Titus, and to learn the state of your affairs. This is one of the few instances in which Paul left an inviting field of labor, and where there was a prospect of signal success, to go to another place. It is adduced here to show the deep interest which he had in the church at Corinth, and his anxiety to learn what was their condition. It shows that there may be cases where it is proper for ministers to leave a field of great and inviting usefulness, to go to another field and to engage in another part of the great vineyard. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. no rest in my spirit&#8212;rather, "no rest for my spirit" (Ge 8:9).

He was most probably the bearer of the former Epistle, and was anxiously expected by the Apostle (ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;">2 Corinthians 7:6</a>) to bring information regarding the effect it had had upon the Corinthian Church. Though Titus is not mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, he possessed in a high degree the confidence of the Apostle (ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/8-16.htm" title="But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.">2 Corinthians 8:16</a>), as is shewn by his taking the chief place—he seems even to have held a position of greater prominence than ‘the brother whose praise is in the Gospel throughout all the Churches’ (ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2 Corinthians 8:18</a>)—in this important mission. Before this, he, as a Gentile, had been the subject of some discussion between St Paul and the Judaizing party at Jerusalem. The latter maintained that Titus ought to be circumcised, the former that he ought not; but St Paul carried his point. His character seems to have been one of deep earnestness and zeal (ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.">2 Corinthians 7:13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.">2 Corinthians 7:15</a>, <a href="/context/2_corinthians/8-16.htm" title="But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you....">2 Corinthians 8:16-17</a>) calculated to win the confidence of the great Apostle. He was afterwards placed in charge of the church in Crete, and in this capacity received from St Paul a letter of instruction known as the Epistle to Titus. The last mention of him in point of date is in <a href="/2_timothy/4-10.htm" title="For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.">2 Timothy 4:10</a>, when he is said to have ‘departed to Dalmatia,’ doubtless on a mission. For the Apostle’s feelings on this occasion (ch. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fights, within were fears....">2 Corinthians 7:5-13</a>) compare a similar anxiety displayed at an earlier period of his Apostolic career in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain....">1 Thessalonians 3:5-9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I went from thence into Macedonia</span>] Cf. <a href="/acts/20-1.htm" title="And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.">Acts 20:1</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/2-13.htm" title="I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς Μακεδονίαν</span>, <span class="ital">to Macedonia</span>) where I would be nearer and might be sooner informed [<span class="ital">what was the fruit of my former epistle to you</span>.—V. g.]—These topics are continued at <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fights, within were fears.">2 Corinthians 7:5</a> : and a most noble digression is here introduced in respect to events, which had in the meantime occurred and sufferings which had been endured by him elsewhere: the benefit of which he makes to flow even towards the Corinthians, whilst he hereby prepares the way for a defence against the false apostles.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I had;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I have had</span>. The perfect vividly realizes the scene through which he had passed. I had no rest. St. Paul had evidently told Titus to come from his mission to Corinth and meet him at Troas. But either St. Paul reached the town earlier than he intended, or Titus had been delayed. Now, the apostle was so intensely eager to know how his rebukes had been received - the name of "Corinth" was so deeply engraven on his heart - he could so ill endure the thought of being on angry terms with converts which he so deeply loved, that the non-appearance of Titus filled him with devouring anxiety and rendered him incapable of any other work. <span class="cmt_word">In my spirit</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to my spirit</span>. It was the loftiest part of St. Paul's nature  - his spirit - which was utterly incapacitated from effort by the restlessness of his miserable uncertainty about the Corinthian Church. The disclosure of such feelings ought to have had a powerful influence on the Corinthians. We see from <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5, 9</a> that St. Paul yearned for tidings of his converts with an intensity which can hardly be realized by less fervent and self-devoted natures. <span class="cmt_word">I found not Titus my brother.</span> Not only "<span class="accented">the</span> brother," but "<span class="accented">my</span> brother;" the man whom in matters of this kind I most trusted as an affectionate and able fellow worker (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-6.htm">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>). Titus, though not mentioned in the Acts, is the most prominent person in this Epistle, and it is evident that St. Paul felt for him a warm affection and respect (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-13.htm">2 Corinthians 7:13, 15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16, 17</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Taking my leave of them;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the Christians in Troas.
