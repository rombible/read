Did any come to him with his tale of body-sickness or soul-sickness, he, in his infinite sympathy, felt as if he shared in it. He claimed no exemption from their infirmities, was reminded by every such tale of his own liability to them. The words that follow have a still stronger significance. The word “offended” (better, <span class= "ital">made to stumble</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> led to fall by a temptation which the man has not resisted) suggests the thought of some grievous sin, as distinct from weakness; and the dominant sense of the word, as in <a href="/context/matthew/5-29.htm" title="And if your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.">Matthew 5:29-30</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/18-8.htm" title="Why if your hand or your foot offend you, cut them off, and cast them from you: it is better for you to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.">Matthew 18:8-9</a>; <a href="/context/mark/9-42.htm" title="And whoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.">Mark 9:42-43</a>; <a href="/mark/9-45.htm" title="And if your foot offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:">Mark 9:45</a>; <a href="/mark/9-47.htm" title="And if your eye offend you, pluck it out: it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:">Mark 9:47</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm" title="Why, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.">1Corinthians 8:13</a>, is that of the sins to which men are led by the temptations of the senses. The other word—to “burn”—is even more startling in its suggestiveness. It had been used in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.">1Corinthians 7:9</a> of the “burning” of sensual passion, and it is scarcely open to a doubt that the associations thus connected with it mingle with its meaning here. Men came to the Apostle with their tales of shame, and told how they had been tempted and had fallen; and here, too, he, in that illimitable sympathy of his, seemed to have travelled with them on the downward road. He felt himself suffused, as it were, with the burning glow of their shame. He blushed with them and for them, as though the sin had been his own. Simply as a word, it should be added, it is equally applicable to any emotion of intense pain or fiery indignation, and it has been so taken by many interpreters. The view which has been given above seems, however, most in harmony with the Apostle’s character.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:22-33 The apostle gives an account of his labours and sufferings; not out of pride or vain-glory, but to the honour of God, who enabled him to do and suffer so much for the cause of Christ; and shows wherein he excelled the false apostles, who tried to lessen his character and usefulness. It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers, hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance, diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all these trials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Our utmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when compared with his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. It may well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers of Christ. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God. Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should ever strictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all to his glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is weak ... - I sympathize with all. I feel where others feel, and their sorrows excite deep sympathetic emotions in my bosom. Like a tender and compassionate friend I am affected when I see others in circumstances of distress. The word "weak" here may refer to any lack of strength, any infirmity or feebleness arising either from body or mind. It may include all who were feeble by persecution or by disease; or it may refer to the weak in faith and doubtful about their duty (see <a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>), and to those who were burdened with mental sorrows. The idea is, that Paul had a deep sympathy in all who needed such sympathy from any cause. And the statement here shows the depth of feeling of this great apostle; and shows what should be the feeling of every pastor; see the note on <a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>.<p>And I am not weak? - I share his feelings and sympathize with him. If he suffers, I suffer. Bloomfield supposes that Paul means that in the case of those who were weak in the faith he accommodated himself to their weakness and thus became all things to all people; see my note on <a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>. But it seems to me probable that he uses the phrase here in a more general sense, as denoting that he sympathized with those who were weak and feeble in all their circumstances.<p>Who is offended - (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  skandalizetai). Who is "scandalized." The word means properly to cause to stumble and fall; hence, to be a stumbling-block to any one; to give or cause offence to anyone. The idea here seems to be, "who is liable to be led astray; who has temptations and trials that are likely to lead him to sin or to cause him to fall, and I do not burn with impatience to restore him, or with indignation against the tempter?" In all such cases Paul deeply sympathized with them, and was prompt to aid them.<p>And I burn not? - That is, with anger or with great agitation of mind at learning that anyone had fallen into sin. This may either mean that he would burn with indignation against those who had led them into sin, or be deeply excited in view of the disgrace which would be thus brought on the Christian cause. In either case it means that his mind would be in a glow of emotion; he would feel deeply; he could not look upon such things with indifference or without being deeply agitated. With all he sympathized; and the condition of all, whether in a state of feeble faith, or feeble body, or falling into sin, excited the deepest emotions in his mind. The truth here taught is, that Paul felt a deep sympathy for all others who bore the Christian name, and this sympathy for others greatly increased the cares and toils of the apostolic office which he sustained. But having given this exposition, candor compels me to acknowledge that the whole verse may mean, "Who is feeble in the faith in regard to certain observances and rites and customs <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>, and I do not also evince the same? I do not rouse their prejudices, or wound their feelings, or alarm them. On the other hand, who is scandalized, or led into sin by the example of others in regard to such custom; who is led by the example of others into transgression, and I do not burn with indignation?" In either case, however, the general sense is, that he sympathized with all others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. I &#8230; weak&#8212;in condescending sympathy with the weak (1Co 9:22).

By which the apostle doth not only show us what was his own holy temper, but what should be the temper of every faithful minister, as to his province, or that part of the church over which he is concerned to watch; viz. to have a true compassion to every member of it, to watch over his flock, inquiring diligently into the state of it; to have a quick sense of any evils under which they, or any of them, labour. This is indeed the duty of ever private member, but more especially of him whose office is to feed any part of the flock of Christ, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/12-15.htm" title="Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.">Romans 12:15</a></span>. In this the members of the spiritual, mystical body of Christ should answer to the members of the body natural, to which our apostle before resembled it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who is weak, and I am not weak.... What church is so? or what particular believer is so? for he had not only the care of all the churches, but of all believers upon him; whoever was weak in the faith he was concerned for them, to instruct, establish, and strengthen them; and suited his discourses, reasonings, and language, to their capacity, that they might understand him, and take in right notions of things: or whoever was of a weak and scrupulous conscience about things indifferent, and fearful of using them lest they should sin in so doing, he was cautious of offending them, or doing anything by which their consciences should be defiled, and their peace be broken: or whoever was afflicted, either in body or mind, he sympathized and bore a part with them: <p>who is offended, and I burn not? whoever was stumbled and made to fall by anything he said or did, or by the words and actions of others, it gave him sensible pain, it made him very uneasy; he was as one in a flame, all on fire, full of grief and trouble till the cause of the offence was removed, and the person offended made easy and restored; the word here used answers to the Hebrew word  used in <a href="/job/30-25.htm">Job 30:25</a> where it is said, "was not my soul grieved for the poor?" which Mr. Broughton renders, "did not my soul burn for the poor?" Now by all this which the apostle did and suffered, by all actions and sufferings, care and sympathy, he fully appeared to be a true and faithful minister of Christ, and abundantly more than the false apostles, who could produce none of these things as testimonies in their favour. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/11-29.htm" title="Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?">2 Corinthians 11:29</a>. Two characteristic traits for illustrating the <span class="greekheb">μέριμνα πασῶν τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν</span>. Chrysostom aptly says: <span class="greekheb">ἐπήγαγε καὶ τὴν ἐπίτασιν τῆς φροντίδος</span>, and that for the <span class="ital">individual members</span> (<a href="/acts/20-31.htm" title="Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.">Acts 20:31</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As <span class="greekheb">ἀσθενεῖ</span> with <span class="greekheb">σκανδαλίζεται</span>, so also <span class="greekheb">ἀσθενῶ</span> with <span class="greekheb">πυροῦμαι</span> forms a climax—and in a way highly appropriate to the subject! For in point of fact he could not in the second clause say: <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐ σκανδαλίζομαι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">meaning</span> of the verse is <span class="ital">to express the most cordial and most lively sympathy</span> (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm" title="And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>) <span class="ital">of his care</span> amidst the dangers, to which the Christian character and life of the brethren are exposed: “<span class="ital">Who is weak</span> as regards his faith, conscience, or his Christian morality, <span class="ital">and I am not weak</span>, do not feel myself, by means of the sympathy of my care, transplanted into the same position? <span class="ital">Who is offended</span>, led astray to unbelief and sin, <span class="ital">and I do not burn</span>, do not feel myself seized by burning pain of soul?” Semler and Billroth, also de Wette (comp. Luther’s gloss), mix up what is foreign to the passage, when they make <span class="greekheb">ἀσθενῶ</span> apply to the <span class="ital">condescension</span> of the apostle, who would give no offence to the weak, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm" title="To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>. And Emmerling (followed by Olshausen) quite erroneously takes it: “<span class="ital">quem afflictum dicas, si me non dicas? quem calamitatem oppetere, si me non iis premi, quin uri memores?</span>” In that case it must have run <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἐγὼ ἀσθενῶ</span>; besides, <span class="greekheb">σκανδαλίζεσθαι</span> never means <span class="ital">calamitatibus affici</span>, but constantly denotes religious or moral offence; and lastly, <span class="greekheb">σκανδαλίζεται</span> and <span class="greekheb">πυροῦμαι</span> would yield a quite inappropriate climax (Paul must have repeated <span class="greekheb">σκανδαλίζομαι</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀσθενεῖ</span>] comp. <a href="/romans/4-19.htm" title="And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:">Romans 4:19</a>; <a href="/context/romans/14-1.htm" title="Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful disputations....">Romans 14:1-2</a>; <a href="/romans/14-21.htm" title="It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak.">Romans 14:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak.">1 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-11.htm" title="And through your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?">1 Corinthians 8:11</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm" title="Now we exhort you, brothers, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>; <a href="/acts/20-35.htm" title="I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.">Acts 20:35</a>. The correspondence of <span class="greekheb">σκανδαλίζεται</span> in the climax forbids us to understand it of <span class="ital">suffering</span> (Chrysostom, Beza, Flatt).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πυροῦμαι</span>] <span class="ital">What</span> emotion is denoted by verbs of burning, is decided on each occasion by the context (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>; see in general on <a href="/luke/24-32.htm" title="And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?">Luke 24:32</a>), which here presents a climax to <span class="greekheb">ἀσθενῶ</span>, therefore suggests far more naturally the idea of violent <span class="ital">pain</span> (comp.
