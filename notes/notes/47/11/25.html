And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.">Acts 27:44</a>), he had kept himself floating for nearly a whole day, beginning with the night. They have, however, been referred by some writers to a dungeon pit, like that into which Jeremiah was cast (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm" title="Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.">Jeremiah 38:6</a>), in which the Apostle was either thrown or hid himself after the stoning at Lystra. Bede (<span class= "ital">Qucest.</span> iii. 8) relates, on the authority of Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury—whose evidence, as a native of Tarsus, has here a special interest—that there was such a dungeon known by the name of <span class= "ital">Bythos</span> (the word used here for “deep”) in his time at Cyzicus, and, if so, it is probable enough that the same use of the word may have prevailed in other cities. So at Athens there was a dungeon known as the <span class= "ital">barathron</span>—a word used also for a “gulf.” On the whole, however, though the conjecture is interesting enough to deserve mention, there seems no adequate reason for adopting it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:22-33 The apostle gives an account of his labours and sufferings; not out of pride or vain-glory, but to the honour of God, who enabled him to do and suffer so much for the cause of Christ; and shows wherein he excelled the false apostles, who tried to lessen his character and usefulness. It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers, hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance, diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all these trials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Our utmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when compared with his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. It may well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers of Christ. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God. Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should ever strictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all to his glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thrice was I beaten with rods - In the Acts of the Apostles there is mention made of his being beaten in this manner but once before the time when this Epistle was written. That occurred at Philippi; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22-23</a>. But there is no reason to doubt that it was more frequently done. This was a frequent mode of punishment among the ancient nations, and as Paul was often persecuted, he would be naturally subjected to this shameful punishment.<p>Once I was stoned - This was the usual mode of punishment among the Jews for blasphemy. The instance referred to here occurred at Lystra; <a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>. Paley (Horae Paulinae) has remarked that this, when confronted with the history, furnished the nearest approach to a contradiction without a contradiction being actually incurred, that he ever had met with. The history <a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a> contains but one account of his being actually stoned. But prior to this <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/14-5.htm">Acts 14:5</a>, it mentions that "an assault was made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully and to stone them, but they were aware of it, and fled to Lystra and Derbe." "Now," Paley remarks, "had the assault been completed; had the history related that a stone was thrown, as it relates that preparations were made both by Jews and Gentiles to stone Paul and his companions; or even had the account of this transaction stopped without going on to inform us that Paul and his companions were aware of their danger and fled, a contradiction between the history and the Epistle would have ensued. Truth is necessarily consistent; but it is scarcely possible that independent accounts, not having truth to guide them, should thus advance to the very brink of contradiction without falling into it."<p>Thrice I suffered shipwreck - On what occasions, or where, is now unknown, as these instances are not referred to in the Acts of the Apostles. The instance of shipwreck recorded there <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, which occurred when on his way to Rome, happened after this Epistle was written, and should not be supposed to be one of the instances referred to here. Paul made many voyages in going from Jerusalem to Tarsus, and to Antioch, and to various parts of Asia Minor, and to Cyprus; and shipwrecks in those seas were by no means such unusual occurrences as to render this account improbable.<p>A night and a day ... - The word used here (&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  nuchthe&#772;meron) denotes a complete natural day, or 24 hours.<p>In the deep - To what this refers we do not now certainly know. It is probable, however, that Paul refers to some period when, having been shipwrecked, he was saved by supporting himself on a plank or fragment of the vessel until he obtained relief. Such a situation is one of great peril, and he mentions it, therefore, among the trials which he had endured. The supposition of some commentators that he spent his time on some rock in the deep; or of others that this means some deep dungeon; or of others that he was swallowed by a whale (that is, a big fish), like Jonah, shows the extent to which the fancy is often indulged in interpreting the Bible. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. The beating by Roman magistrates at Philippi (Ac 16:23) is the only one recorded in Acts, which does not profess to give a complete journal of his life, but only a sketch of it in connection with the design of the book, namely, to give an outline of the history of the Gospel Church from its foundation at Jerusalem, to the period of its reaching Rome, the capital of the Gentile world.<p>once was I stoned&#8212;(Ac 14:19).<p>thrice &#8230; shipwreck&#8212;before the shipwreck at Melita (Ac 27:44). Probably in some of his voyages from Tarsus, where he stayed for some time after his conversion, and from which, as being a seafaring place, he was likely to make missionary voyages to adjoining places (Ac 9:30; 11:25; Ga 1:21).<p>a night and a day &#8230; in the deep&#8212;probably in part swimming or in an open boat.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thrice was I beaten with rods; </span> this was by the pagans, for the Jews whipped malefactor with a whip which had three cords.

It refers to some eminent danger Paul was in, of which the Scripture in no other place maketh mention particularly. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thrice was I beaten with rods,.... Or "wands", by the Romans; for this was a Roman punishment, distinct from scourging with cords used by the Jews. There is mention made but of one time only that he was so beaten, elsewhere, and that is in <a href="/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22</a> which was at Philippi; but that he was so many times beaten in this way, there is no room to doubt: <p>once was I stoned. This was at Lystra, at the instigation of the Jews that came from Antioch and Iconium, <a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a> by whom he was left for dead: <p>thrice I suffered shipwreck; neither of which are mentioned by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles; for the shipwreck he suffered as when he went to Rome was some time after the writing of this epistle, and therefore cannot be one of these here referred to <p>a night and a day I have been in the deep; some understand this of a well, called "Bythos", or "the deep", which was near Lystra, where the apostle was hid for such a space of time after his deliverance there; but this, were it so, he would scarcely reckon among his very great hardships and sufferings: others of a prison at Cyzicum in Asia, which, because of its very great height, was called "the depth of the sea", in which the apostle was imprisoned for such a time; but, we nowhere read that he ever was at that place, or preached there, and much less was imprisoned there; and had he, it is not likely that he should particularly point out such a short imprisonment, but would have let it pass in the general account of being in prisons before mentioned: but rather this is to be understood of the sea, often called the "deep" in Scripture, where by some accident he was cast, and was in it, as the Syriac version has it, , "where was no ship", or without one, being shipwrecked; or being cast, or having fallen into the sea, he was swimming in it, or was preserved by a broken piece of the ship, or by some other means, or by the wonderful providence of God for so long a time; though as sailing in those times was chiefly by coasting, this phrase may only signify that the ship in which he was was drove from the coast into the sea, and lost sight of the land for the space of a day and night, and lay floating about in the deep, which was reckoned very dangerous. The word  "a night day", signifies a whole natural day, consisting of a night and a day; and is an Hebraism, and answers to , "the evening and the morning", which make a full day; see <a href="/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a> <a href="/daniel/8-14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{q}</span> Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</span><p>(q) By the Roman magistrates.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_corinthians/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">τρὶς ἐραβδίσθην κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">thrice was I beaten with rods, i.e.</span>, “virgis caesus sum,” a <span class="ital">Roman</span>, as distinct from the <span class="ital">Fewish</span>, method of scourging—distinct too from flagellation with <span class="ital">thongs</span> (<a href="/matthew/27-26.htm" title="Then released he Barabbas to them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.">Matthew 27:26</a>).

We have no other account of those referred to here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a night and a day</span>] The Apostle here speaks of some terrible peril, compared to which even the shipwreck related in Acts 27 was a trifling one. Probably for twenty-four hours he was exposed to the dangers of the ocean, with but a plank between him and death. The Acts of the Apostles, we are once more constrained to remark, gives us but a scanty account of the labours and perils undergone by this undaunted soul. The word translated ‘a night and a day’ is but a single word in the original, and signifies a period of twenty-four hours, commencing with sunset. Some have thought that the expression here, ‘in the deep,’ is the same as the LXX. of <a href="/exodus/15-5.htm" title="The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.">Exodus 15:5</a>, and that St Paul <span class="ital">went down</span> with the ship, and was delivered by a Divine interposition. So Wiclif, Tyndale and the Geneva and Rheims versions, following the Vulgate, seem to have interpreted this passage (<span class="ital">in the depnesse of the see</span>, Wiclif; <span class="ital">in the depe of the see</span>, Tyndale). But the expressions here and in <a href="/exodus/15-5.htm" title="The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.">Exodus 15:5</a> (LXX.) are <span class="ital">not</span> identical. Cranmer renders, <span class="ital">in the deepe see</span>. So Chrysostom, who explains it, ‘<span class="ital">swimming on the sea</span>,’ and the Syriac version, which translates, ‘without a ship in the sea.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τρὶς ἐναυάγησα</span>, <span class="ital">thrice I was shipwrecked</span>) before the shipwreck at Melita (Malta).—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ βυθῷ</span>) <span class="greekheb">ὁ βυθὸς</span> denotes anything <span class="ital">deep:</span> but when it is used absolutely, <span class="ital">the sea</span>, especially here, as being connected with the mention of shipwrecks.

Many persons, who have been shipwrecked, thus contend with the waters for many hours, so that they may at last escape.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thrice was I beaten with rods.</span> This alludes to scourgings inflicted by Gentile magistrates with the <span class="accented">vitis</span>, or vine stick, of soldiers, or with the fasces of lictors. Only one of these horrible scourgings, which likewise often ended in death, is narrated in the Acts (<a href="/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22</a>). We do not know when the others were inflicted. In any case they were egregious violations of St. Paul's right of Roman citizenship; but this claim (as we see in Cicero's various orations) was often set at nought in the provinces. <span class="cmt_word">Once was I stoned</span>. At Lystra (<a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thrice I suffered shipwreck.</span> Not one of these shipwrecks is narrated in the Acts. The shipwreck of <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, took place some years later. <span class="cmt_word">A night and a day I have been in the deep.</span> An allusion, doubtless, to his escape from one of the shipwrecks by floating for twenty-four hours on a plank in the stormy sea. We have no right to assume that the deliverance was <span class="accented">miraculous</span>. The perfect tense shows St. Paul's vivid reminiscence of this special horror. "In the deep" means "floating on the deep waves." Theophylact explains the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1ff7;</span> to mean "in Bythos," and says that it was a place near Lystra, apparently like the Athenian <span class="accented">Barathrum</span> and the Spartan Caeadas - a place where the bodies of criminals were thrown. The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Beaten with rods<p>Roman scourgings.<p>Stoned<p>At Lystra, <a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>.<p>Thrice I suffered shipwreck<p>The shipwreck at Malta, being later, is, of course, not referred to; so that no one of these three is on record.<p>A night and a day (&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>A compound term occurring only here in the New Testament, and rarely in later Greek.<p>Have I been in the deep (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;)<p>Lit., I have made (spent) a night and a day in the deep.
