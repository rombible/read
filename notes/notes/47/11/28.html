Here that meaning is excluded by the fact that perils of that nature had been already specified, and that he now manifestly speaks of something differing in kind as well as in degree. But there is, as our modern phraseology shows, such a thing as a “rush” of business almost as trying as the “ugly rush” of a crowd, and that is manifestly what he means here. The daily visits of inquirers, the confessions of sin-burdened souls, the craving of perplexed consciences for guidance, the reference of quarrels of the household or the church to his arbitration as umpire, the arrival of messengers from distant churches, each with their tidings of good or evil—this is what we have to think of as present to St. Paul’s thoughts as the daily routine of his life; and the absence of any conjunction between the two clauses clearly points to the fact that, in his mind, “the care (or <span class= "ital">anxiety</span>) of all the churches” was all but identical with the “rush” of which he had just spoken.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-28.htm" title="Beside those things that are without, that which comes on me daily, the care of all the churches....">2 Corinthians 11:28-31</a></span>. <span class="ital">Besides those things that are without </span>— These external troubles which I have mentioned; <span class="ital">that which cometh upon me daily </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">η επισυστασις μου η καθ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">ημεραν</span>, <span class="ital">that which rusheth upon me daily, </span>or that which is my daily pressure. The expression denotes a crowd of people surrounding and pressing upon a person, in order to bear him down, and trample upon him; an idea which is elegantly applied to his cares respecting <span class="ital">the churches; </span>crowding in upon his mind, and ready to overwhelm it. And this is very properly mentioned here among his sufferings, being certainly not one of the least of them, as may be easily inferred from the account which he has given in this and in his former epistle, of the exceeding grief which the errors and irregularities of the single church of Corinth caused him. In saying, <span class="ital">the care of all the churches, </span>he signified he was deeply concerned for the prosperity, even of those which he had not seen in the flesh. St. Peter himself could not have said this in so strong a sense. <span class="ital">Who is weak </span>— Namely, in grace, and therefore oppressed with a variety of doubts and fears, and cast down; <span class="ital">and I am not weak </span>— By sympathy, as well as by condescension, manifested in complying with their weakness. <span class="ital">Who is offended </span>— Hindered in or turned out of the good way; <span class="ital">and I burn not </span>— With zeal and desire to restore him: or am not pained, as though I had fire in my bosom?

And in what I have said, I have only spoken the exact truth, without reigning or aggravating any one circumstance; for <span class="ital">God knoweth that I lie not </span>— Even that eternal Majesty of heaven and earth; <span class="ital">who is blessed for evermore. </span>This clause is added to increase the solemnity of his appeal to God for the truth of what he had said, and was going further to say; and that not only concerning his deliverance at Damascus, but concerning the visions and revelations of the Lord, to be mentioned in the next chapter.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:22-33 The apostle gives an account of his labours and sufferings; not out of pride or vain-glory, but to the honour of God, who enabled him to do and suffer so much for the cause of Christ; and shows wherein he excelled the false apostles, who tried to lessen his character and usefulness. It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers, hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance, diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all these trials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Our utmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when compared with his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. It may well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers of Christ. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God. Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should ever strictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all to his glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Besides those things that are without - In addition to these external trials, these trials pertaining to the body, I have mental trials and anxieties resulting from the necessary care of all the churches, But on the meaning of these words commentators are not agreed. Rosenmuller supposes that the phrase means "besides those things that come from other sources," "that I may omit other things." Beza, Erasmus, Bloomfield, and some others suppose that the passage means those things out of the regular routine of his office. Doddridge, "besides foreign affairs." Probably the sense is, "Apart from the things beside" (&#x3a7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  Cho&#772;ris to&#772;n parektos); "not to mention other matters; or if other matters should be laid aside, there is this continually rushing anxiety arising from the care of all the churches." That is, this would be enough in itself. Laying aside all that arises from hunger, thirst, cold, etc., this continual care occupies my mind and weighs upon my heart.<p>That which cometh upon me daily - There is great force in the original here. The phrase rendered "that which cometh upon me" means properly, "that which rushes upon me." The word (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  episustasis) means properly a concourse, a crowd, hence, a tumult; and the idea here is, that these cares rushed upon him, or pressed upon him like a crowd of people or a mob that bore all before it. This is one of Paul's most energetic expressions, and denotes the incessant anxiety of mind to which he was subject.<p>The care of all the churches - The care of the numerous churches which he had established, and which needed his constant supervision. They were young; many of them were feeble; many were made up of heterogeneous materials; many composed of Jews and Gentiles mingled together, with conflicting prejudices, habits, preferences; many of them were composed of those who had been gathered from the lowest ranks of life; and questions would be constantly occurring relating to their order and discipline in which Paul would feel a deep interest, and which would naturally be referred to him for decision. Besides this, they had many trials. They were persecuted, and would suffer much. In their sufferings Paul would feel deep sympathy, and would desire, as far as possible, to afford them relief. In addition to the churches which he had planted, he would feel an interest in all others, and doubtless many cases would be refered to him as an eminent apostle for counsel and advice. No wonder that all this came rushing on him like a tumultuous assembly ready to overpower him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. without&#8212;"Beside" trials falling on me externally, just recounted, there is "that which cometh upon me (literally, the impetuous concourse to me of business; properly, a crowd rising up against one again and again, and ready to bear him down), the care of all the churches" (including those not yet seen in the flesh, Col 2:1): an internal and more weighty anxiety. But the oldest manuscripts for "that which cometh," read, "the pressure": "the pressing care-taking" or "inspection that is upon me daily." Alford translates, "Omitting what is BESIDES"; namely, those other trials besides those recounted. But the Vulgate, Estius, and Bengel, support English Version.<p>the care&#8212;The Greek implies, "my anxious solicitude for all the churches."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By the <span class="ital">things that are without, </span> the apostle meaneth either those evils which happened to him from persons that had nto relation to the Christian church, but were persons <span class="ital">without, </span>( as the phrase is used, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/5-13.htm" title="But them that are without God judges.

For an apostle differed from an ordinary pastor, not only in his immediate call from Christ, but also in his work; there lay an obligation upon such to go up and down preaching the gospel, and they further had, both a power, and also an obligation, to superintend all other churches, and to direct the affairs of them relating to order and government: and thereupon they were mightily concerned about their doing well or ill. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Besides those things that are without,....

He has to care for <span class="ital">all</span>. Chrysostom, Theophylact, and others attach <span class="greekheb">χωρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">παρ</span> to what precedes, and separate it from what follows by a full stop; but this only makes the latter unnecessarily abrupt. Luther, Castalio, Bengel, and many others, including Flatt, Billroth (but uncertainly), and Olshausen, consider <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ἘΠΊΣΤΑΣΙς Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> (or, according to their reading: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ἘΠΙΣΎΣΤΑΣΙς Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>) as an abnormal apposition to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῶΝ ΠΑΡΕΚΤΌς</span></span></span>: not to mention what still occurs besides, namely, etc. This is unnecessarily harsh, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΩΡῚς ΤῶΝ ΠΑΡΕΚΤΌς</span></span></span> would withal only be an empty formul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΠΑΡΕΚΤΌς</span></span></span> is: quae <span class="ital">praeterea</span> eveniunt,[341] not, as Beza and Bengel, following the Vulgate, hold: “quae <span class="ital">extrinsecus</span> eum adoriebantur” (Beza), so that <span class="ital">either</span> what follows is held to be in apposition (Bengel: previously he has described the <span class="ital">proprios labores</span>, now he names the <span class="ital">alienos secum communicatos</span>), <span class="ital">or</span> <span class="greekheb">τῶν παρεκτός</span> is referred to what precedes, and what follows now expresses the <span class="ital">inward</span> cares and toils (Beza, comp. Erasmus). Linguistic usage is against this, for <span class="greekheb">παρεκτός</span> never means <span class="ital">extrinsecus</span>, but always <span class="ital">beside</span>, in the sense of <span class="ital">exception</span>. See <a href="/matthew/5-32.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.">Matthew 5:32</a>; <a href="/acts/26-29.htm" title="And Paul said, I would to God, that not only you, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.">Acts 26:29</a>; Aq. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-36.htm" title="Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he has trodden on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed the LORD.">Deuteronomy 1:36</a>; <span class="ital">Test.

This also in opposition to Ewald: “without the <span class="ital">unusual</span> things,” with which what is <span class="ital">daily</span> is then put in contrast (comp. Calvin). Hofmann, following the reading <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπισύστασίς μου</span>, would, instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῶΝ ΠΑΡΕΚΤΌς</span></span></span>, write <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῶΝ ΠΑΡʼ ἘΚΤΌς</span></span></span>, which is, in his view, <span class="ital">masculine</span>, and denotes those <span class="ital">coming on to the apostle from without</span> (the Christian body), whose <span class="ital">attacks</span> on his doctrine he must continually withstand. With this burden he associates the care of all the many <span class="ital">churches</span>, which lie continually on his soul. These two points are introduced by <span class="greekheb">χωρίς</span>, which is the adverbial <span class="ital">besides</span>.

T., and even in the classical passages in question (see from Thucydides, Krüger on i. 61. 3) it does not mean <span class="ital">praeterea</span> generally, but more strictly <span class="ital">scorsim, separatim, specially and taken by itself</span>.[342] See Ellendt, <span class="ital">Lex. Soph.</span> II. p. 974. But the two very <span class="ital">general</span> categories, which it is to introduce, would not suit this sens.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπίστασις</span>] may mean <span class="ital">either:</span> the daily <span class="ital">halting</span> (comp.

This is that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the LORD:">Numbers 26:9</a>) used in the <span class="ital">hostile</span> sense: <span class="ital">hostilis concursio, tumultus</span>, as it has also been taken here by Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Beza,[345] Bengel, and others. See <a href="/acts/24-12.htm" title="And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:">Acts 24:12</a>, and the passages in Wetstein and Loesner, p. 230.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">μοί</span>, which, in the interpretation of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΣΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> as <span class="ital">concourse</span>, would have to be taken as appropriating dative (Bernhardy, p. 89), is, according to our view of <span class="greekheb">ἐπίστ</span>., to be conceived as dependent on the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΣΤΙ</span></span></span> to be supplied.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[340] Accordingly the comma after <span class="greekheb">ἡμέραν</span> is to be deleted. If <span class="greekheb">μέριμνα κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λ</span>. be (as is the usual view) taken as a clause by itself, the <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> to be supplied is not a copula, but: <span class="ital">exists</span>. But according to the right reading and interpretation, <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπιστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μοι</span>, as an independent point, would thus be too general.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[341] The Armenian version gives instead of <span class="greekheb">παρεκτός</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἄλλων θλίψεων</span>. A correct interpretation. Chrysostom exaggerates: <span class="greekheb">πλείονα τὰ παραλειφθέντα τῶν ἀπαριθμηθέντων</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[342] So, too, in the passage, Thuc. ii. 31. 2, adduced in Passow’s <span class="ital">Lexicon</span> by Rost and by Hofmann, where <span class="greekheb">χωρίς</span> further introduces a <span class="ital">separate</span> army contingent, which is <span class="ital">counted by itself</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[343] Gregory of Nazianzus has <span class="greekheb">ἐπιστασία</span>, which is to be regarded as a good gloss.

In <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-3.htm" title="The coming in of this mischief was sore and grievous to the people:">2Ma 6:3</a> (in opposition to Grimm <span class="ital">in loc.</span>), <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπίστασις τῆς κακίας</span> is the <span class="ital">setting in</span>, the <span class="ital">coming on, i.e.</span> the <span class="ital">beginning</span> of misfortune (Polyb. i. 12. 6, ii. 40. 5, <span class="ital">al.</span>). In Dion. Halicarn. vi. 31, the reading is to be changed into <span class="greekheb">ἐπίθεσιν</span>. In Polyb. i. 26. 12, it means the <span class="ital">position</span>.

This is that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the LORD:">Numbers 26:9</a>, in which latter place we have the same textual variants as here (<span class="ital">cf.</span> also: <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/5-73.htm" title="And by their secret plots, and popular persuasions and commotions, they hindered the finishing of the building all the time that king Cyrus lived: so they were hindered from building for the space of two years, until the reign of Darius.">1Es 5:73</a>). This <span class="ital">may</span> be the true reading, both here and at <a href="/acts/24-12.htm" title="And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:">Acts 24:12</a>, for the syllable <span class="greekheb">συ</span> might readily drop out in transcription. If it be adopted here it would refer to the cabals of the Apostle’s adversaries = “the daily combination against me,” and would thus indicate a trial distinct from “the care of all the churches,” which is next mentioned. But, although this gives a good sense, we prefer to read <span class="greekheb">ἐπίστασις</span> as better supported both here and at <a href="/acts/24-12.htm" title="And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:">Acts 24:12</a> (the only places of its occurrence in N.T.). Polybius uses the word as = “attention,” “close observation,” but this will not suit <a href="/acts/24-12.htm" title="And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:">Acts 24:12</a>. It is found in <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-3.htm" title="The coming in of this mischief was sore and grievous to the people:">2Ma 6:3</a> as = “visitation” or “pressure,” and the latter rendering seems best to satisfy the context here. We have therefore followed the Revisers in adopting the Vulgate rendering <span class="ital">instantia</span> = “that which presseth,” and in taking <span class="greekheb">ἡ μέριμνα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. as in apposition with <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπίστασις</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>28. <span class="ital">Besides those things that are without</span>] The six principal English versions interpret this expression (1) of <span class="ital">external</span> trials, of which the Apostle has hitherto been speaking—“the thynges which out wardly happen unto me” (Tyndale). As the Apostle now begins to speak of <span class="ital">inward</span> troubles this rendering would seem quite natural. But Chrysostom (2) interprets it of <span class="ital">things left out of the enumeration</span>. And this interpretation is supported by the only two other passages in which the word occurs in the N. T., namely, <a href="/matthew/5-32.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.">Matthew 5:32</a>; <a href="/acts/26-29.htm" title="And Paul said, I would to God, that not only you, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.">Acts 26:29</a>. Cf. <a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm" title="And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:">Hebrews 11:32</a>. If this interpretation be followed, we must connect the words, not only with what follows, but with what precedes. ‘And besides a host of other things, which I cannot now mention, there is the daily pressure of anxiety arising from the Churches under my care.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that which cometh upon me daily</span>] There is a various reading here. If we follow the received text, which is that of the Peshito Syriac in the second century and is followed by Chrysostom, we must understand it of the daily <span class="ital">concourse</span> of troubles arising from this source. If we follow that which is proposed to be substituted for it, which is that of the Vulgate and of the most ancient MSS. (though it may not improbably have arisen from the copyist’s eye having passed from <span class="greekheb">ΣΥ</span> to <span class="greekheb">ΣΤ</span>), it must be rendered “that which <span class="ital">presseth</span> on me” (<span class="ital">instantia</span>, Vulgate; <span class="ital">my daily instance</span>, Rhemish). Tyndale, Cranmer and the Geneva render, <span class="ital">I am combred dayly</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the care</span>] Rather perhaps, <span class="bld">the anxiety</span>, as we speak of <span class="ital">care</span> in the abstract, the Greek word being derived from a verb signifying <span class="ital">to part asunder</span>, and implying that the mind is <span class="ital">torn asunder</span> as it were by conflicting emotions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of all the churches</span>] This must not perhaps be pressed (as Döllinger in his <span class="ital">Last Age of the Church</span>) so far as to assert that each Apostle considered himself individually responsible for the care of the whole Church of Christ. That there was some division of responsibility appears from <a href="/galatians/2-7.htm" title="But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me, as the gospel of the circumcision was to Peter;">Galatians 2:7</a>.

Here therefore we remark the disorderly conduct of those, who troubled Paul by the perverseness of their doctrine or life; for example, <a href="/galatians/6-17.htm" title="From now on let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.">Galatians 6:17</a>.—<span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἡμέραν</span>, <span class="ital">daily</span>) A large extent of time; and of place, in the words, <span class="ital">of all</span>.—<span class="greekheb">πασῶν</span>, <span class="ital">of all</span>) This is more modest than if he had said <span class="greekheb">πάσης τῆς ἐκκλησίας</span>, <span class="ital">of the whole church.
