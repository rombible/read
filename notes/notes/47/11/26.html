Some of them may be referred to journeys (as above) before his arrival at Antioch; some, probably, to that from Antioch to Ephesus through the interior of Asia Minor (<a href="/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a>; <a href="/acts/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,">Acts 19:1</a>); some to excursions from Ephesus. The “perils of waters” (better, <span class= "ital">rivers</span>) point to the swollen torrents that rush down in spring from the mountain heights of the Taurus and other ranges, and render the streams unfordable. “Robbers” infested, then as now, well-nigh every high-road in Syria and Asia Minor, as in the parable of the Good Samaritan (see Note on <a href="/luke/10-30.htm" title="And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.">Luke 10:30</a>), and the story of St. John and the young robber, as reported from Clement of Alexandria by Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Hist.</span> iii. 23). Of the “perils from his own countrymen,” we have instances enough up to this time at Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-23.htm" title="And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:">Acts 9:23</a>), at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/9-29.htm" title="And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.">Acts 9:29</a>), at Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, and Lystra (<a href="/acts/13-50.htm" title="But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="/context/acts/14-5.htm" title="And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them spitefully, and to stone them,">Acts 14:5-19</a>), at Thessalonica, and at Corinth (<a href="/context/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5-13</a>; <a href="/acts/18-12.htm" title="And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,">Acts 18:12</a>).

City and wilderness (possibly the Arabian desert of <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm" title="Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.">Galatians 1:17</a>; possibly the high table-lands of Armenia and Asia Minor) and sea were alike fruitful in dangers. As if with something like a climax he reserves the word “false brethren,” such as those of <a href="/galatians/2-4.htm" title="And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:">Galatians 2:4</a>, as the last and worst of his trials.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-26.htm" title="In journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brothers;...">2 Corinthians 11:26-27</a></span>. <span class="ital">In journeyings </span>— For the sake of preaching the gospel; <span class="ital">often </span>— In which I have been exposed to a variety of dangers, from <span class="ital">waters, robbers, my own countrymen, </span>and <span class="ital">the heathen. In perils in the city</span> — From tumults. Of these dangers, frequent mention is made in the Acts: as in Damascus; after that, in Jerusalem; then in Antioch, in Pisidia, Iconium, Thessalonica, Berea, Corinth, and Ephesus; all before the writing of this epistle. In dangers <span class="ital">in the wilderness </span>— Of perishing by want, or by wild beasts; <span class="ital">in the sea </span>— From storms and pirates; <span class="ital">among false brethren</span> — Who, amidst specious pretensions of love and affection, secretly watched, if not to destroy me, at least to injure my character, and ruin my usefulness. <span class="ital">In weariness — </span>Through my incessant labours; <span class="ital">and painfulness</span> — Or fatiguing toil.

It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers, hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance, diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all these trials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty of this world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Our utmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when compared with his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. It may well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers of Christ. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God. Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should ever strictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all to his glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In journeyings often - Of course subject to the fatigue, toil, and danger which such a mode of life involves.<p>In perils of waters - In danger of losing my life at sea, or by floods, or by crossing streams.<p>Of robbers - Many of the countries, especially Arabia, through which he traveled, were then infested, as they are now, with robbers. It is not impossible or improbable that he was often attacked and his life endangered. It is still unsafe to travel in many of the places through which he traveled.<p>By mine own countrymen - The Jews. They often scourged him; laid wait for him and were ready to put him to death. They had deep enmity against him as an apostate, and he was in constant danger of being put to death by them.<p>By the pagan - By those who had not the true religion. Several instances of his danger from this quarter are mentioned in the Acts .<p>In the city - In cities, as in Derbe. Lystra, Philippi, Jerusalem, Ephesus, etc.<p>In the wilderness - In the desert, where he would be exposed to ambushes, or to wild beasts, or to hunger and want. Instances of this are not recorded in the Acts , but no one can doubt that they occurred, The idea here is, that he had met with constant danger wherever he was, whether in the busy haunts of people or in the solitude and loneliness of the desert.<p>In the sea - see <a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>.<p>Among false brethren - This was the crowning danger and trial to Paul, as it is to all others. A man can better bear danger by land and water, among robbers and in deserts, than he can bear to have his confidence abused, and to be subjected to the action and the arts of spies upon his conduct. Who these were he has not informed us. He mentions it as the chief trial to which he had been exposed, that he had met those who pretended to be his friends, and who yet had sought every possible opportunity to expose and destroy him. Perhaps he has here a delicate reference to the danger which he apprehended from the false brethren in the church at Corinth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.
