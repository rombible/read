The word for “bounty” (<span class= "ital">eulogia</span>) has, like that for “confidence” in the preceding verse, the interest of an ecclesiastical history attaching to it. Literally, it means a “blessing;” then, as in the LXX. of <a href="/genesis/23-11.htm" title="No, my lord, hear me: the field give I you, and the cave that is therein, I give it you; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it you: bury your dead.">Genesis 23:11</a>, <a href="/judges/1-15.htm" title="And she said to him, Give me a blessing: for you have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.">Judges 1:15</a>, it was used for the “gift,” which is the outward token or accompaniment of a blessing. In liturgical language, as connected with the “cup of <span class= "ital">blessing,”</span> it was applied—(1) to the consecrated bread and wine of the Lord’s Supper generally; (2) specially to those portions which were reserved to be sent to the sick and other absentees; (3) when that practice fell into disuse, to the unconsecrated remains; and (4) to gifts of bread or cake to friends or the poor, as a residuum of the old distributions at the Agapæ, or Feasts of Charity.<p><span class= "bld">As a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.</span>—The bearing of the last word is not quite obvious. Probably what is meant is this:—“Let your gift be worthy of what you call it, a ‘blessing’ expressed in act, not the grudging gift of one who, as he gives, is intent on gaining some advantage through his seeming generosity.” So understood, it expresses the same thought as Shakespeare’s well-known lines:—<p>“The quality of mercy is not strained,<p>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.”<p>It is possible, however, that the word “covetousness” had been applied tauntingly to St. Paul himself, as always “asking for more,” always “having his hand” (as is sometimes said of active organising secretaries in our own time) “in people’s pockets,” and that this is his answer to that taunt. The use of the corresponding verb in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?">2Corinthians 12:17-18</a>, is strongly in favour of this view. “Don’t look on this business,” he seems to say, “as a self-interested work of mine. Think of it as, in every sense of the word, a blessing both to givers and receivers.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 When we would have others do good, we must act toward them prudently and tenderly, and give them time. Christians should consider what is for the credit of their profession, and endeavour to adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. The duty of ministering to the saints is so plain, that there would seem no need to exhort Christians to it; yet self-love contends so powerfully against the love of Christ, that it is often necessary to stir up their minds by way of remembrance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore I thought it necessary ... - In order to secure the collection, and to avoid all unpleasant feeling on all hands.<p>That they would go before unto you - Before I should come.<p>And make up beforehand your bounty - Prepare it before I come. The word "bounty" is in the margin, rendered "blessing." The Greek (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  eulogia) means properly commendation, eulogy. Then it means blessing, praise applied to God. Then that which blesses - a gift, donation, favor, bounty - whether of God to human beings, or of one man to another. Here it refers to their contribution as that which would be adapted to confer a blessing on others, or suited to produce happiness.<p>That the same might be ready as a matter of bounty - That it may truly appear as a liberal and voluntary offering; as an act of generosity and not as wrung or extorted from you. That it may be truly a blessing - a thank-offering to God and adapted to do good to people.<p>And not as of covetousness - "And not like a sort of extortion, wrung from you by mere dint of importunity" - Doddridge. The word used here (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  pleonexia) means usually covetousness, greediness of gain, which leads a person to defraud others. The idea here is, that Paul would have them give this as an act of bounty, or liberality on their part, and not as an act of covetousness on his part, not as extorted by him from them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. that they would go before&#8212;Translate, "that they should," &c.<p>whereof ye had notice before&#8212;rather, "promised before"; "long announced by me to the Macedonians" (2Co 9:2) [Bengel].

The word which we translate <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">bounty, </span> in the Greek signifieth blessing, which agreeth with the Hebrew dialect. Abigail’s present to David in his distress is called hkrb, a <span class="ital">blessing, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/25-27.htm" title="And now this blessing which your handmaid has brought to my lord, let it even be given to the young men that follow my lord.">1 Samuel 25:27</a></span>: so Jacob called his present to his brother Esau, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/33-11.htm" title="Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.">Genesis 33:11</a></span>. Such kind of reliefs are called a blessing in both the Hebrew and the Greek tongue: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because they are a part of God’s blessing upon him that gives, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/24-5.htm" title="He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.">Psalm 24:5</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because the giving of them is a recognition or acknowledgntent how far God hath blessed persons, they giving as the Lord hath prospered them, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/16-2.htm" title="On the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.">1 Corinthians 16:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Because they are an indication of the blessing, or well wishing, of him that giveth to him that receiveth the gift. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Because they are a real doing good to the person that receiveth them, an actual blessing of him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. Possibly they are (in him that gives) an effectual, real blessing of God; for we then bless God with what we have, when we use and improve it for the ends for which he hath given it to us. It is very observable, that a liberal, free giving to the relief of the servants of God in distress, is called cariv and eulogia, <span class="ital">grace</span> and <span class="ital">blessing; </span> a heart to it being created in us from the free grace of God, and the work itself being a real, actual blessing of God with our substance, and the fruit of our increase: which two things well digested, will be potent arguments to charity with every soul that knoweth any thing of God, or hath any love for God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That the same might be ready; </span> that the same may be ready gathered, not to gather when I come. As a blessing, we translate it, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">as a matter of bounty:</span> the sense is the same. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Not as of covetousness:</span> the meaning is, I have also sent the brethren, that they may persuade you to a free and liberal contribution, a giving that may look like a blessing, not as proceeding from a narrow heart, in which the love of money prevaileth above the love of God. Giving to the distressed saints of God sparingly, and disproportionately to what estate we have, no ways looks like a blessing; he that so gives, doth not, according to the apostle’s phrase, give wv eulogian’ for he neither gives as the Lord hath blessed and prospered him, nor yet according to what God requires of him; for he withholds a part of what he ought to part with: neither doth he bless his brother; he doth him some little good, but blessing another signifies a more liberal doing good to him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren,.... Titus, and the other two, on whom he did not lay his commands, or apostolical injunctions, according to the authority and dignity of his office; only exhorted or besought them, and which was judged by him very needful and proper at this time: <p>that they would go before hand unto you; before him, and the Macedonian brethren that might probably come with him: <p>and make up before hand your bounty; or blessing; for any present sent, or delivered, by one person to another, as a token of their friendship, favour, and good will, whether in a necessitous case or not, was by the Jews called  "a blessing"; see <a href="/genesis/33-11.htm">Genesis 33:11</a> and especially what is contributed for the relief of the poor may be so called, because it is not only a part of the bounty of Providence, and blessings of life, with which men are favoured; but is also one way of blessing God for the mercies he has blessed them with, and likewise of blessing, or doing good to fellow creatures and Christians. Moreover, because for this the poor bless their benefactors; and it is a blessing itself to do good to others. Now the apostle judged it expedient to send the brethren before hand to complete and finish this good work begun. <p>Whereof, says he, <p>ye had notice before: in his former epistle, <a href="/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a> or which was promised before by them; or had been spoken of so much before by him to other churches: <p>that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, or blessing, <p>not as of covetousness; that is, that the collection being ready made, largely and liberally, it might appear to be a free generous action, and show what a noble bountiful disposition they were of; and not performed as covetous men usually do what they do, sparingly, tenaciously, keeping their money as long as they can, being loath to part with it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as <i>a matter of</i> bounty, and not as <i>of</i> <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> covetousness.</span><p>(b) As from covetous men.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they would go before to you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof you had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.">2 Corinthians 9:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὖν</span>] in pursuance of what was said in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>] comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">προέλθ</span>.] namely, before my arrival and that of the Macedonians possibly accompanying me.

The A.V. rendering of <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξίαν</span> = “covetousness,” seems to mean “niggardliness, such as a covetous man would exhibit,” and this would fall in well with the verses which follow; but it is not agreeable to the general meaning of the word or to St. Paul’s usage elsewhere (see reff.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>5. <span class="ital">the brethren</span>] i.e. those mentioned in the last chapter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">go before</span>] i.e. before the Apostle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">your bounty, whereof ye had notice before</span>] Rather, according to the best MSS., ‘your <span class="bld">previously announced</span> bounty,’ i.e. either (1) announced by me to the Macedonian Churches; or (2) generally, promised beforehand. The word translated <span class="ital">bounty</span> is more usually translated <span class="ital">blessing</span> (Vulg. <span class="ital">benedictio</span>).

The gifts of the Corinthians are called a <span class="ital">blessing</span>, because they are so to others, and because they call down a blessing on those who impart them.

But Dr Plumptre regards it as possibly referring to St Paul, ‘as a work of <span class="ital">your</span> bounty, not of <span class="ital">my</span> claims upon your purses.’ Ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>, <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?...">2 Corinthians 12:17-18</a>, which he cites, are decidedly in favour of this interpretation.

The Corinthians had promised largely; it was evident that there had been, or that there was ground for fearing that there might be, some slackness of performance. St. Paul was so unwilling to have seemed inaccurate in what, he had said about them in Macedonia that he wished to give them ample notice before the Macedonian delegates arrived. <span class="cmt_word">Your bounty, whereof ye had notice before;</span> <span class="accented">your previously promised blessing, bounty</span>; literally, <span class="accented">blessing</span>. The mere word should have acted as an inducement to generosity. See the use of the word to express a generous gift in <a href="/genesis/33-11.htm">Genesis 33:11</a>; <a href="/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>, etc. (LXX.); <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>.

It is less likely that the word <span class="accented">pleonexia</span> refers to the "parsimony" of the Corinthians, as though the <span class="accented">smallness</span> of their gift would show their greed for large gains. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Go before<p>Notice the thrice repeated before, emphasizing the injunction to have everything ready before Paul's arrival.<p>Make up beforehand (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>Adjust.
