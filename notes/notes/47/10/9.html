"I say that I might boast more of my power in order that I may not appear disposed to terrify you with my letters merely. I do not threaten more than I can perform. I have it in my power to execute all that I have threatened, and to strike an awe not only by my letters, but by the infliction of extraordinary miraculous punishments. And if I should boast that I had done this, and could do it again, I should have no reason to be ashamed.

I say this lest I should seem to be terrifying you, as children, with empty threats [Bengel]. Estius explains, "I might boast more of my authority, but I forbear to do so, that I may not seem as if," &c.

I tell you, saith the apostle, that I have an authority, and a further authority than those who vilify me can pretend unto: but I also tell you, I have no authority to do any harm to any of you; all the authority I have is for your edification, as much as lieth in me to promote the business of your salvation; so that I need not be reported as one that went about to terrify you by my letters; yet I know there are some who so represent me unto you. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.

But by Erasmus, Luther, Castalio, Beza, Grotius, Bengel, and others, also Billroth and Schrader, it is attached to <a href="/2_corinthians/10-8.htm" title="For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>, in which case, however, some (Beza, Bengel, comp.

Erasmus): “<span class="ital">non addam plura ea de re</span>.” The latter is pure invention; and from the supplement of Beza there would not at all logically result what is said in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-9.htm" title="That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.">2 Corinthians 10:9</a>. No; let <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ δόξω κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. be joined <span class="ital">immediately</span>, without assuming any intervening thought, to <span class="greekheb">οὐκ αἰσχυνθήσομαι</span>: <span class="ital">I shall not be put to shame</span> (now comes the <span class="ital">definition</span>, in a negative form, <span class="ital">of the divine aim</span> with reference to the charge in question), <span class="ital">in order that I may not appear</span>, etc., that the matter may not remain on the footing of the mere word, but it may be apparent in point of fact that I am something quite other than the man who wishes to frighten you by his letters. If in this way the passage proceeds simply and correctly without logical difficulty, the less simple connection of Chrysostom <span class="ital">et al</span>. (see above) is superfluous, and is, moreover, not to be accepted, <span class="ital">because</span> the new part of the passage would begin, in a very palpably abrupt way, with <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> without any connecting particle,[304] and because what Paul says in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.">2 Corinthians 10:11</a> could not destroy the appearance indicated in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-9.htm" title="That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.">2 Corinthians 10:9</a>, to which belonged <span class="ital">matter of fact</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς ἂν ἐκφοβεῖν ὑμᾶς</span>] The Vulgate rightly has: “tanquam terrere vos,” and Beza: “ceu perterrefacere vos.” The <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἄν</span> modestly takes away from the harsh and strong <span class="greekheb">ἐκφοβεῖν</span> the offensiveness, which in the feeling of the apostle it would have had, if taken by itself and in its full sense. It is not <span class="ital">modal</span> (“in any way,” Hofmann), but <span class="ital">comparative</span>, corresponding quite to our modifying <span class="ital">as</span> [German <span class="ital">wie</span>]: that I may not appear <span class="ital">to put you as in dread</span>. In later Greek <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἄν</span> certainly has the meaning <span class="ital">tanquam, quasi</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span> having lost its specific reference. See Hermann, <span class="ital">de part.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span>, 4. 3, p. 184; Bornemann, <span class="ital">in d. Sächs. Stud.</span> 1846, p. 61; Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut.

The classical <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἄν</span> with optative and subjunctive (Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar.</span> p. 767), as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>, is not to be brought into comparison her.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τῶν ἐπιστ</span>.] namely, which I write to you (<span class="ital">article</span>); he had already written two.

The connection of thought is not clear at first sight, but a little consideration will serve to bring it out. St Paul is about to boast of his authority. This boast is no <span class="ital">brutum fulmen</span>. He means to act upon it in all seriousness when he comes to Corinth. He wishes them to understand that it will not be confined to words, but will be shewn in deeds when he arrives.
