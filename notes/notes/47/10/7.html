By speaking thus, the apostle did not intend to acknowledge the false teacher referred to to be a true and faithful minister of Christ. That teacher had taken on himself the work of the ministry, and was by profession a servant of Christ. This Paul acknowledged, without entering into the consideration of his integrity or faithfulness. “At the same time, as he pretended to great powers of reasoning, the apostle desired him to reason this from himself: That if he was a minister of Christ merely by professing to be one, the apostle, who, besides laying claim to that character, had exercised miraculous powers among the Corinthians, was thereby shown to be more truly a minister of Christ than he was, who did not possess that proof.” — Macknight.

There can be no doubt that they valued themselves on their external advantages, and laid claim to special honor in the work of the ministry, because they were superior in personal appearance, in rank, manners, or eloquence to Paul. Paul reproves them for thus judging, and assures them that this was not a proper criterion by which to determine on qualifications for the apostolic office. Such things were highly valued among the Greeks, and a considerable part of the effort of Paul in these letters is to show that these things constitute no evidence that those who possessed them were sent from God.<p>If any man trust to himself ... - This refers to the false teachers who laid claims to be the followers of Christ by way of eminence. Whoever these teachers were, it is evident that they claimed to be on the side of Christ, and to be appointed by him. They were probably Jews, and they boasted of their talents and eloquence, and possibly that they had seen the Saviour. The phrase "trust to himself," seems to imply that they relied on some special merit of their own, or some special advantage which they had - Bloomfield. It may have been that they were of the same tribe that he was, or that they had seen him, or that they. confided in their own talents or endowments as a proof that they had been sent by him. It is not an uncommon thing for people to have such confidence in their own gifts, and particularly in a power of fluent speaking, as to suppose that this is a sufficient evidence that they are sent to preach the gospel.<p>Let him of himself think this again - Since he relies so much on himself; since he has such confidence in his own powers, let him look at the evidence that I also am of Christ.<p>That as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's - That I have given as much evidence that I am commissioned by Christ as they can produce. It may be of a different kind. It is not in eloquence. and rank, and the gift of a rapid and ready elocution, but it may be superior to what they are able to produce. Probably Paul refers here to the fact that he had seen the Lord Jesus, and that he had been directly commissioned by him. The sense is, that no one could produce more proofs of being called to the ministry than he could. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Or "look upon things", ironically said; or "ye do look on things", a reproof for making judgment of persons and things, by the outward appearance of them; so many judged of Paul by the meanness of his person, the weakness of his body, the lowness of his voice, his outward circumstances of life, his poverty, afflictions, and persecutions; and despised him; whilst they looked upon the riches, eloquence, haughty airs, noisiness, and personable mien, of the false apostles, and admired them: <p>if a man trusts to himself that he is Christ's: is fully assured that he has an interest in his love and favour, is redeemed by his blood, is a partaker of his grace, and a believer in him; or rather, that he is a minister of the Gospel, and an apostle of Christ, one that is qualified and sent forth by him to preach the word: <p>let him, of himself, think this again, that as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's; that is, he may, and ought of himself, without another's observing it to him, of his own accord, willingly reason and conclude, by the selfsame marks and evidences he would be thought to be a minister of Christ, that we are also. The sense is, that let a man be ever so confident of his being a true minister of the Gospel, he will not be able to point out one criterion or proof of his being so, but what he might discern in the Apostle Paul, and the rest of his fellow ministers, and therefore ought to conclude the same of them as of himself. In which may be observed the great modesty of the apostle, who does not go about to disprove others being Christ's, who so confidently boasted of it; nor bid them look to it to see if they were or not, since all that say so are not; only as if granting that they were, he would have them look upon him, and his fellow apostles as such also, who had at least equal pretensions to this character. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> Do ye look on things after the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> outward appearance?

He at once breaks into the midst of this course of thought on the part of his opponents with the disapproving question: <span class="ital">Do you look on that which lies before the eyes?</span> I do you judge according to the appearance? by which he means this, that they profess to have seen him weak and cowardly, when he was in Corinth personally (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>).

The <span class="ital">answer</span> to the question is: <span class="ital">If any one is confident that he belongs to Christ, let him judge this again of himself, that just as he belongs to Christ, so do we</span>.

It is taken as <span class="ital">not interrogative</span> (Lachmann and Tischendorf), but also with <span class="greekheb">βλέπετε</span> as indicative, and the sentence, consequently, as a <span class="ital">judgment</span> of censure, by Chrysostom, Gennadius, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Calvin, Schulz, Flatt. Calvin says: “Magni facitis alios, qui magnis ampullis turgent; me, quia ostentatione et jactantia careo, despicitis;” while Flatt, following Storr, in spite of <a href="/2_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm" title="For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>, refers <span class="greekheb">κατὰ πρόσωπον</span> to the kinship of James with Christ, on which the Christine party had relied. In any case, however, it is more lively and forcible, and therefore more suitable, to take it as <span class="ital">interrogative</span>. Others, again, take <span class="greekheb">βλέπετε</span> as an <span class="ital">imperative</span> (Vulgate, Ambrosiaster, Anselm, Cornelius a Lapide, Billroth, Rückert, Olshausen, de Wette, Bisping, Hofmann): <span class="ital">observe withal what lies so clearly before the eyes!</span> In this view we should not have to explain it with Ewald: “<span class="ital">regard personal matters</span>;” so that Paul begins to point to the personal element which is now to be taken into consideration; but with Hofmann: the readers only needed to have their eyes open to what lay before them, in order to judge rightly. But against this it may be urged that <span class="greekheb">κατὰ πρόσωπον</span> could not but most naturally explain itself from <a href="/2_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>, and that the meaning itself would have something tame and more calmly argumentative, than would be suited to the lively emotion of the passage. Besides, it is Paul’s custom elsewhere to put <span class="greekheb">βλέπετε</span> first, when he summons to an <span class="ital">intuemini</span>. See <a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm" title="For you see your calling, brothers, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:">1 Corinthians 1:26</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-18.htm" title="Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Php 3:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἴτις πέποιθεν ἑαυτῷ Χριστοῦ εἶναι</span>] In this way is designated the confidence which his opponents (not a single peculiar false teacher, as Michaelis thinks) arrogantly cherished for themselves, but denied to Paul, that they were genuine Christ-people, genuine servants of Christ.

The translation apud se in the Vulg. and It. also rests on this reading, which might easily enough be supplanted by the better known <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἑαυτοῦ</span>, and hence deserves to be preferred. There lies in this <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ἑαυτοῦ</span> (secum solo reputet) a reproof putting more delicately to shame than in <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἑαυτοῦ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_corinthians/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/2_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Do you look on things after the outward appearance?

They may be rendered in three ways, (1) as in the text, (2) <span class="ital">ye look on things after the outward appearance</span>, or (3) as some interpreters prefer to render, <span class="ital">look at what lies plainly before your eyes</span>, i.e. the genuineness of St Paul’s Apostolic mission. The Vulgate and Rhemish versions render thus. So also Wiclif, <span class="ital">See ye the thingis that ben aftir the face</span>. Either (1) or (2) is preferable to (3), which not only does not suit the context (cf. also <a href="/1_corinthians/2-5.htm" title="That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.">1 Corinthians 2:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-21.htm" title="Therefore let no man glory in men.

The meaning of the last of the three renderings is that if the Corinthians regard their teachers from an exclusively fleshly point of view, St Paul has no need to shrink from the comparison. Cf. ch. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also....">2 Corinthians 11:18-33</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as he is Christ’s, even so are we Christ’s</span>] St Paul proceeds to give four proofs of this.
