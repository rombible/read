The apostle fixes a good rule for his conduct; namely, not to boast of things without his measure, which was the measure God had distributed to him. There is not a more fruitful source of error, than to judge of persons and opinions by our own prejudices. How common is it for persons to judge of their own religious character, by the opinions and maxims of the world around them! But how different is the rule of God's word! And of all flattery, self-flattery is the worst. Therefore, instead of praising ourselves, we should strive to approve ourselves to God. In a word, let us glory in the Lord our salvation, and in all other things only as evidences of his love, or means of promoting his glory. Instead of praising ourselves, or seeking the praise of men, let us desire that honour which cometh from God only.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you - What regions are referred to here can be only a matter of conjecture. It may be that he wished to preach in other parts of Greece, and that he designed to go to Arcadia or Lacedaemon. Rosenmuller supposes that as the Corinthians were engaged in commerce, the apostle hoped that by them some tidings of the gospel would reach the countries with which they were engaged in traffic. But I think it most probable that he alludes to Italy and Spain. It is certain that he had formed the design of visiting Spain <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/15-24.htm">Romans 15:24</a>, <a href="/romans/15-28.htm">Romans 15:28</a>; and he doubtless wished the Corinthians to aid him in that purpose, and was anxious to do this as soon as the condition of the eastern churches would allow it.<p>And not to boast in another man's line of things ... - Margin, "Rule," the same word (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;  kano&#772;n) which occurs in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-13.htm">2 Corinthians 10:13</a>. The meaning is, that Paul did not mean to boast of what properly belonged to others. He did not claim what they had done as his own. He did not intend to labor within what was properly their bounds, and then to claim the field and the result of the labor as his. He probably means here to intimate that this had been done by the false teachers of Corinth; but so far was he from designing to do this, that he meant soon to leave Corinth, which was properly within his limits, and the church which he had founded there, to go and preach the gospel to other regions. Whether Paul ever went to Spain has been a question (see the note on <a href="/romans/15-24.htm">Romans 15:24</a>); but it is certain that he went to Rome, and that he preached the gospel in many other places after this besides Corinth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.
