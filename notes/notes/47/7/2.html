There is an almost infinite pathos in that entreaty, uttered, we may well believe, as from the very depths of the soul—“Make room for us.” The under-current of thought flows on. He had complained of their being straitened in their affections, had entreated that they would enlarge their hearts towards him, as his heart was enlarged towards them. He has travelled on—his thoughts turning now to the party of license, with whom he had pleaded so earnestly in 1 Corinthians 8-10—to the terribly unutterable contaminations to which they were exposing themselves by their companionship with idolaters. He now, almost, as it were, with sobs, entreats once more: “You can find a place for such as these in your heart. Have you no place for me?” In the words “we wronged no man” we find reference to charges of greed of gain and self-interested motives that had been whispered against him, and to which he refers again in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-20.htm" title="Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:">2Corinthians 8:20</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-18.htm" title="I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?">2Corinthians 12:18</a>. Perhaps, also, he contrasts himself with others, who “did wrong and defrauded” (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-8.htm" title="No, you do wrong, and defraud, and that your brothers.">1Corinthians 6:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">We have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.</span>—The word for “corrupt” is the same as that translated “defile” in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.">1Corinthians 3:17</a>, and is used with manifest reference to sensual impurity in <a href="/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="/jude/1-10.htm" title="But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.">Jude 1:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-2.htm" title="For true and righteous are his judgments: for he has judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.">Revelation 19:2</a>. The word for “defrauded” is not the same as that in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-8.htm" title="No, you do wrong, and defraud, and that your brothers.">1Corinthians 6:8</a>, and though meaning literally “to make a gain,” or “seek a gain,” had, with its cognate nouns, acquired a darker shade of meaning. The verb is used in obvious connection with impurity in <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1Thessalonians 4:3-6</a>, where see Note. The nouns often appear in closest companionship with those which indicate that form of evil (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortionists, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world.">1Corinthians 5:10-11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-14.htm" title="Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:">2Peter 2:14</a>; <a href="/romans/1-29.htm" title="Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,">Romans 1:29</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>). Mere greed of gain is commonly described by another word, which we translate “the love of money” (<a href="/luke/16-14.htm" title="And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.">Luke 16:14</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm" title="For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.">1Timothy 6:10</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-2.htm" title="For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,">2Timothy 3:2</a>). There seems, then, sufficient reason for connecting this verb also with the same class of sins. It would seem as if the word had colloquially acquired a secondary meaning, and was used of those who sought gain by ministering to the vice of others—who became, as it were, purveyors of impurity. The words, so understood, give us a momentary glimpse into a depth of evil from which we would willingly turn our eyes. But they leave no room for doubt that, in the infinite pruriency of such a city as Corinth, even such things as these had been said of the Apostle in the cynical jests of the paganising party of license. They tolerated such things themselves. They welcomed those who practised them to their friendship (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1Corinthians 5:11</a>). They whispered, we may well believe, of private interviews in lonely lodgings, of public gatherings at night of men and women, and of the kiss of peace. They insinuated that, after all, he was even such a one as themselves. So, in like manner, was the fair fame of a disciple of St. Paul’s attacked by Martial, not apparently with malignity, but only in the wantonness of jest. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus on the Later. Years of St.</span> <span class= "ital">Paul’s Life,</span> at the end of the Acts of the Apostles.) So like charges were levelled at the reputation of Athanasius (Sozomen. <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> ii. 25), and of Hooker (Walton’s <span class= "ital">Life</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> So, generally, it was the ever-recurring calumny of the heathen against the Christians that their <span class= "ital">Agapae,</span> or Feasts of Love, were scenes of foulest license. It is obvious that there is much in the popular outcry against confession that partakes more or less of the same character. Against charges of this nature St. Paul utters his indignant denial: “No,” he virtually says; “you find a place in your affections for those who do such things: can you not find a place also for us who are free from them<span class= "ital">?”</span> The sense which some have given to the word “corrupt,” as referring only to doctrinal corruptions, is manifestly out of the question.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man....">2 Corinthians 7:2-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Receive us </span>— With that affection which is due to the faithful servants of Christ, and to those who have been instruments in your conversion and edification; for, whatever may have been insinuated by ill- designing persons to the contrary; <span class="ital">we have wronged </span>— Or <span class="ital">injured; no man</span> — In his person. <span class="ital">We have corrupted no man </span>— In his principles. <span class="ital">We have defrauded no man </span>— Of his property.

If we hope in God as our Father, we must seek to be holy as he is holy, and perfect as our Father in heaven. His grace, by the influences of his Spirit, alone can purify, but holiness should be the object of our constant prayers. If the ministers of the gospel are thought contemptible, there is danger lest the gospel itself be despised also; and though ministers must flatter none, yet they must be gentle towards all. Ministers may look for esteem and favour, when they can safely appeal to the people, that they have corrupted no man by false doctrines or flattering speeches; that they have defrauded no man; nor sought to promote their own interests so as to hurt any. It was affection to them made the apostle speak so freely to them, and caused him to glory of them, in all places, and upon all occasions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Receive us - Tyndale renders this: "understand us." The word used here (&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  cho&#772;re&#772;sate) means properly, give space, place, or room; and it means here evidently, make place or room for us in your affections; that is, admit or receive us as your friends. It is an earnest entreaty that they would do what he had exhorted them to do in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-13.htm">2 Corinthians 6:13</a>; see the note on that verse. From that he had digressed in the close of the last chapter. He here returns to the subject and asks an interest in their affections and their love.<p>We have wronged no man - We have done injustice to no man. This is given as a reason why they should admit him to their full confidence and affection. It is not improbable that he had been charged with injuring the incestuous person by the severe discipline which he had found it necessary to inflict on him; note, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>. This charge would not improbably be brought against him by the false teachers in Corinth. But Paul here says, that whatever was the severity of the discipline, he was conscious of having done injury to no member of that church. It is possible, however, that he does not here refer to any such charge, but that he says in general that he had done no injury, and that there was no reason why they should not receive him to their entire confidence. It argues great consciousness of integrity when a man who has spent a considerable time, as Paul had, with others, is able to say that he had wronged no man in any way. Paul could not have made this solemn declaration unless he was certain he had lived a very blameless life; compare <a href="/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33</a>.<p>We have corrupted no man - This means that he had corrupted no man in his morals, either by his precept or his example. The word (&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;  phtheiro&#772;) means in general to bring into a worse state or condition, and is very often applied to morals. The idea is, here, that Paul had not by his precept or example made any man the worse. He had not corrupted his principles or his habits, or led him into sin.<p>We have defrauded no man - We have taken no man's property by cunning, by trick, or by deception. The word &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  pleonekteo&#772; means literally to have more than another, and then to take advantage, to seek unlawful gain, to circumvent, defraud, deceive. The idea is, that Paul had taken advantage of no circumstances to extort money from them, to overreach them, or to cheat them. It is the conviction of a man who was conscious that he had lived honestly, and who could appeal to them all as full proof that his life among them had been blameless. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

This is the ground on which he asks their reception of (making room for) him in their hearts. We wronged none by an undue exercise of apostolic authority; 2Co 7:13 gives an instance in point. We have corrupted none, namely, by beguilements and flatteries, while preaching "another Gospel," as the false teachers did (2Co 11:3, 4). We have defrauded none by "making a gain" of you (2Co 12:17).

By which vindication of or apology for himself and his fellow labourers, it is not improbably judged, that the apostle reflecteth upon those false apostles and teachers that were crept into this church, who had wronged him, corrupted them, and been too busy in other ways to pick their pockets. Nothing becometh more a minister of the gospel, than innocency and righteousness; nothing more commends him unto his people: for though they are easily persuaded that an innocent and just man must be a pious man, yet they are difficultly persuaded, (and there is no reason for it), that an unjust or mischievous man can be so. Men are so mad of their lusts, that ofttimes teachers who will favour them in them, though never so unjust and unrighteous in their actings, shall find more favour with them, than the most righteous person that will not spare them as to their Herodias: But he who will entertain the least hopes to bring men off from their lusts and sinful practices, is concerned above all men to be innocent and righteous. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Receive us,....

Unobjectionable from a linguistic point of view (see Wetstein, <span class="ital">ad</span> <span class="ital"><a href="/matthew/19-11.htm" title="But he said to them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.">Matthew 19:11</a></span>); but in the exhortation of <a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a> there was nothing to be misunderstood, just as little as for the readers in the disclosure that follows (to which de Wette refers it); and if Paul, as Rückert thinks, had had it in his mind that the measures of his first Epistle had been judged unfavourably, he could not have expected any reader to gather this from the simple <span class="greekheb">χωρήσατε ἡμᾶς</span>, especially as in what follows the idea of the effects of the first Epistle is quite kept at a distance by <span class="greekheb">οὐδένα ἐπλεονεκτήσαμεν</span>.[255]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐδένα ἠδικήσαμεν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] This is no doubt aimed at hostile calumniations of the apostle and his companions. Some one must have said: <span class="ital">They act wrongly towards the people! they ruin them, they enrich themselves from them!</span> It is impossible to prove that <span class="greekheb">ἐφθείραμεν</span> applies exactly to <span class="ital">the</span> corruptela <span class="ital">quae fit per falsam doctrinam</span> (Calvin and most, following the Fathers; just as Hofmann also refers it to the <span class="ital">inward</span> injuring of the <span class="ital">persons</span> themselves, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>); the way in which the word is associated with <span class="greekheb">ἠδικήσ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ἐπλεονεκτ</span>. is rather in favour of a reference to the <span class="ital">outward position</span>. In how many ways not known to us more precisely may the apostle and his fellow-labourers have been accused of such a ruining of others! How easily might such slanders be based on the strictness of his moral requirements, his sternness in punishing, his zeal for collections, his lodging with members of the church, the readiness to make sacrifices which he demanded, and the like! Probably his prosecution and administration of the collections would be especially blackened by this reproach of <span class="greekheb">πλεονεκτεῖν</span>. Comp. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?...">2 Corinthians 12:17-18</a>.

But if his readers were to <span class="ital">know</span> of this reference <span class="ital">to his former Epistle</span>, he must have <span class="ital">expressed</span> it (the reader could not guess it).

St Paul here refers to the charges brought against him. He had been accused of <span class="ital">wronging</span> the Corinthians by claiming an authority to which he had no right, and which he turned to his own account (see <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?...">1 Corinthians 9:1-6</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward....">2 Corinthians 1:12-17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/6-3.htm" title="Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:...">2 Corinthians 6:3-4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own bowels.">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Do you look on things after the outward appearance?

Dr Plumptre regards the words ‘corrupted’ and ‘defrauded’ as referring to sensual sin, and illustrates by the revolting charges of immorality brought against the Christians by those who misinterpreted their brotherly and sisterly affection. It is true that the word here translated ‘defrauded’ seems to have a reference to something more than mere greed of gain. See note on <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortionists, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world....">1 Corinthians 5:10-11</a>. Still, the word translated ‘corrupted’ and its derivatives do not appear to have had any such restricted sense in St Paul. See, for instance, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>, ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:3</a> of this Epistle; and, in a less degree, <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22</a>. And, however common such charges were in the days of Minucius Felix and Tertullian, they are not hinted at elsewhere in Scripture, but rather the contrary. See <a href="/1_peter/4-4.htm" title="Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:">1 Peter 4:4</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2 Peter 2:2</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Χωρήσατε ἡμᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">receive us</span>) The sum of what is stated in this and in the tenth and following chapter.—<span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span>) <span class="ital">us</span>, who love you and rejoice for your sake, receive also with favour our feelings, words, and actions.—<span class="greekheb">οὐδένα ἠδικήσαμεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐδένα ἐφθείραμεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐδένα ἐπλεονεκτήσαμεν</span>) He lays down three things by gradation, the first of which he treats from <a href="/2_corinthians/7-4.htm" title="Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.">2 Corinthians 7:4</a>, by repeating the very word <span class="greekheb">ἀδικεῖν</span>, at <a href="/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.">2 Corinthians 7:12</a>; the second from ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>, by repeating the very word <span class="greekheb">φθείρειν</span>, at ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>; the third from ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For what is it wherein you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.">2 Corinthians 12:13</a>, by repeating the very word <span class="greekheb">πλεονεκτεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">ib</span>. <a href="/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?">2 Corinthians 12:17</a>.

The discussion of the clause itself, <span class="greekheb">οὐδένα ἐπλεονεκτήσαμεν</span> begins at <a href="/2_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.">2 Corinthians 7:13</a>. This then is what he means to say: There is no reason, why you should not receive us [favourably: <span class="ital">capiatis</span>]: for we have injured no man, by our severity producing an absorbing grief [referring to ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="So that contrariwise you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>, “lest such a one should be <span class="ital">swallowed up</span> with overmuch sorrow”]; nay, we have not even made a man worse by a too haughty mode of acting: nay, we have not even defrauded any man for gain; in everything we have consulted you and your interests: comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing.">2 Corinthians 7:9</a>; and that too, without any reward.

It is an appeal to them to get rid of the <span class="accented">narrowness</span> of heart, the constricted affections, of which he has complained in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-12.htm">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">We have wronged...  corrupted...  defrauded no man.</span> The "no man" in the original is placed first, and this emphatic position, together with its triple repetition, marks St. Paul's insistence on the fact that, whatever his enemies might insinuate, there was no <span class="accented">single member</span> of their Church who could complain of injury, moral harm, or unfair treatment from him. Clearly he is again thinking of definite slanders against himself. His sternness to the offender may have been denounced as a wrong; his generous sanction of broad views about clean and unclean meats, idol-offerings, etc., may have been represented as corrupting others by false teaching (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>) or bad example (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>); his urgency about the collection for the saints (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-16.htm">2 Corinthians 12:16</a>; <a href="/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33</a>), or his assertion of legitimate authority, may have been specified as greed for power. The verb <span class="accented">pleonektein</span> is often used in connection with other verbs, implying sensuality. It is difficult for us even to imagine that St. Paul had ever been charged with gross immorality; but it may have been so, for in a corrupt atmosphere everything is corrupt. Men like Nero and Heliogabalus, being themselves the vilest of men, openly declared their belief that no man was pure, and many in the heathen world may have been inclined to similar suspicions. Of Whitefield, the poet says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"His sins were such as Sodom never knew,<br />And calumny stood up to swear all true."</span> We know too that the Christians were universally charged with Thyestean banquets and promiscuous licentiousness. It is, however, more natural to take <span class="accented">pleonektein</span> in its <span class="accented">general</span> sense, in which it means "to overreach," "to claim or seize more than one's just rights" (see <a href="/2_corinthians/2-11.htm">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>) In <a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1-6</a> he is defending himself against similar charges, as also in this Epistle (2 Corinthians 5:12; 6:3; 10:7-11; 11; 12.<span class="accented">, passim</span>).
