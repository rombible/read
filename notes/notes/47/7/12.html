All other inter pretations—such as those which make St. Paul or the community the injured party—are fantastic. But in what sense was the father injured? The union was a marriage, not a mere concubinage or adultery (see Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1Corinthians 5:1</a>), and it could not have been so unless the first marriage had been dissolved by a divorce. But if the husband had divorced the wife, then, though the son’s marriage may have shocked men as immoral, the father could hardly be said to have suffered a wrong to which he had exposed himself by his own act. The probable explanation is found in supposing that the wife, seduced by her step-son or seducing him, had divorced herself. Wives had this power under Roman law; and it was used with such license under the Empire, that Juvenal speaks of one woman of rank who had—<p>“Eight husbands in five autumns. Do you laugh?<p>The thing reads well upon an epitaph.”<span class= "ital">—Sat. vi.</span> 230.<p>On this assumption the father had, of course, sustained a very grievous wrong. There is an obvious tone of impatience, almost of annoyance, in the way in which St. Paul speaks of the whole business. It was one of those scandals in which, though it had been necessary to assert the law of purity and enforce the discipline of the Church, he could not bring himself at the time to feel any special interest in either of the parties. Afterwards, when the sinner was repentant, there came, it is true, a new feeling of pity for him, as in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.">2Corinthians 2:6-8</a>. But when he wrote, it was with a larger aim, to show them how much he cared for his disciples at Corinth, how jealous he was to clear away any stains that affected their reputation as a Church. It is noticeable that no mention is made of the woman’s repentance, nor, indeed, of her coming, in any way, under the discipline of the Church. The facts of the case suggest the conclusion that both husband and wife were heathens, and that the son was the only convert of the family. In this case we may fairly assume that she had played the part of temptress, and that his conscience, though weak, had been the more sensitive of the two. On this view the exhortations against being “unequally yoked together” with unbelievers gains a fresh significance. Possibly some idolatrous festival had furnished the first opportunity of sin, and so the fact gave special protest against any attempt to combine the worship of Christ with that of Belial.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you....">2 Corinthians 7:12-16</a>. </span><span class="ital">Wherefore, though I wrote </span>so severely <span class="ital">to you </span>— It was not only or chiefly for the sake of the incestuous person, or his father; but to show my care over you; <span class="ital">in the sight of God </span>— Who hath committed you to me to be instructed and directed. <span class="ital">Therefore we were comforted in your comfort </span>— In hearing you were made happy by my care of you; <span class="ital">and exceedingly the more for the joy </span>ye gave to <span class="ital">Titus, because his spirit was refreshed — </span>When ye received him with affection, and read my letter with due submission. <span class="ital">If I have boasted any thing </span>— Concerning you; <span class="ital">to him </span>— That I was confident the converts at Corinth would approve themselves worthy of the esteem in which I held them; <span class="ital">I am not ashamed </span>— Of that boasting; <span class="ital">but as we spake all things to you in truth </span>— When addressing ourselves to you; <span class="ital">so our boasting </span>— Of you to Titus, concerning your good disposition and proper behaviour, has been verified to our great satisfaction. <span class="ital">And </span>— Or so that; <span class="ital">his inward affection </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">τα σπλαγχνα αυτου</span>, <span class="ital">his bowels, </span>or <span class="ital">tender affection; is more abundant toward you </span>— Than it had been before; <span class="ital">while he remembers the obedience</span> — Of the generality of you to those apostolical injunctions which I sent you by him; <span class="ital">how ye received him </span>— As my messenger; <span class="ital">with fear and trembling </span>— With great solicitude, that there might be nothing in or among you which it might grieve him to observe, or me to hear reported. <span class="ital">I rejoice therefore that </span>your behaviour has been such as to give me reason to rely on your ready obedience <span class="ital">in all things. </span>Œcumenius has observed, that the apostle, in this part of his epistle, expressed his good opinion of the Corinthians, and mentioned his having praised them to Titus, to prepare them for his exhortations in the two following chapters concerning the collection for the saints in Judea. His address, therefore, in this part of his letter is admirable, especially as, in commending the Corinthians, he expressed himself quite agreeably to the good opinion which he now entertained of them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:12-16 The apostle was not disappointed concerning them, which he signified to Titus; and he could with joy declare the confidence he had in them for the time to come.

But the words, "unto you," thus, would be rather obscure; still the obscurity of the genuine reading may have been the very reason for the change being made by correctors into the reading of English Version. Alford explains the reading: "He wrote in order to bring out their zeal on his behalf (that is, to obey his command), and make it manifest to themselves in God's sight, that is, to bring out among them their zeal to regard and obey him." But some of the oldest manuscripts and versions (including the Vulgate and old Italian) support English Version. And the words, "to you," suit it better than the other reading. 2Co 2:4, "I wrote &#8230; that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you," plainly accords with it, and disproves Alford's assertion that English Version is inconsistent with the fact as to the purpose of his letter. His writing, he says, was not so much for the sake of the individual offender, or the individual offended, but from his "earnest care" or concern for the welfare of the Church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong; </span> for the cause of him that had abused his father’s wife, not out of any particular hatred or ill-will I had to him; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">nor for his cause that suffered wrong; </span> nor for the sake of him whose wife was so abused; nor for my own sake, who had been so abused, and suffered wrong by you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you; </span> but only out of a love to your souls, and a care I had for you, that in all things you might approve yourselves unto God.

Paul denies <span class="ital">absolutely</span> that he has written that part of the Epistle on account of the two persons mentioned. In the nature of the case, no doubt, he had to write against the <span class="greekheb">ἀδικήσας</span>, and so indirectly in favour of the <span class="greekheb">ἀδικηθείς</span>; but the <span class="ital">destined purpose</span> of this letter, as Paul from the true light of his apostolic standpoint is aware, lay not in this aim affecting the two persons primarily concerned, but in its higher significance as bearing on the church’s relation to the apostle: <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ εἵνεκεν τοῦ φανερωθῆναι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Regarding the form <span class="greekheb">εἵνεκεν</span>, see on <a href="/luke/4-18.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,">Luke 4:18</a>, and Kühner, I. p. 229, ed. 2. The <span class="greekheb">ἀδικήσας</span> is the <span class="ital">incestuous person</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">ἀδικηθείς</span> <span class="ital">his father</span>, as the party grievously injured by the son’s incestuous marriage with the step-mother.

This explanation of the <span class="greekheb">ἀδικηθείς</span> seems from the relation of the two participles active and passive to be the only natural, and, in fact, necessary one. It is no objection that, in the first Epistle, nothing was said at length regarding the father and the wrong done to him (see only <a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>), since the censure and ordaining of chastisement to the transgressor <span class="ital">of themselves</span> practically contained the satisfaction to the injured father.

Others (Wolf, Storr, Emmerling, Osiander, Neander, Maier) think that Paul means <span class="ital">himself</span>, in so far as he had been deeply injured in his office by that transgression. But this mode of designating himself, set down thus without any more precise indication, would be strangely enigmatical, as well as marked by want of delicate tact (as if the readers were not <span class="greekheb">ἀδικηθέντες</span>, like Paul!), and no longer suiting what was already said in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-5.htm" title="But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.">2 Corinthians 2:5</a>. The reference of <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀδικηθέντος</span> to the apostle himself would only be right on the assumption that allusion is here made to the state of things discussed by Paul in an <span class="ital">intermediate letter now lost</span>.[263] <span class="ital">Others</span> (Bengel, comp.

Hofmann, who rejects both the <span class="ital">Recepta</span> and the reading of Lachmann, and prefers that of <span class="greekheb">א</span>: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΣΠΟΥΔῊΝ ὙΜῶΝ ΤῊΝ ὙΠῈΡ ὙΜῶΝ ΠΡῸς ὙΜᾶς</span></span></span>, takes this <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῸς ὙΜᾶς</span></span></span> even in a <span class="ital">hostile</span> sense: “You are to show yourselves diligent <span class="ital">for</span> yourselves and <span class="ital">against</span> yourselves;” the strict procedure of the church against its adherents is on the one hand an acting <span class="ital">for</span> themselves (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠῈΡ ὙΜῶΝ</span></span></span>), and on the other hand an acting <span class="ital">against</span> themselves (<span class="greekheb">πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span>). This artificial interpretation is wrong, because, if <span class="greekheb">πρὸς</span> could mean <span class="ital">contra</span> here, Paul must have written at least <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῊΝ ὙΠῈΡ ὙΜῶΝ ΤΕ ΚΑῚ ΠΡῸς ὙΜᾶς</span></span></span>, and because <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΌς</span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΠΟΥΔΉ</span></span></span> (<a href="/hebrews/6-11.htm" title="And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:">Hebrews 6:11</a>; Herod. iv. 11. 1; Diod. xvii. 114) and with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΠΟΥΔΆΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span> (Dem. 515. 23, 617. 10) has not that arbitrarily assumed sense, but the sense of an interest <span class="ital">for</span> some one, though this is more commonly expressed by <span class="greekheb">περί</span>. If the reading of <span class="greekheb">א</span> were right, it would have to be explained simply: <span class="ital">in order that your zeal, in which you aim at your own good, should become manifest among you before God</span>. Had Paul wished to express the singular meaning which Hofmann imports, he would have known how to write: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῊΝ ΣΠΟΥΔῊΝ ὙΜῶΝ ΤῊΝ ὙΠῈΡ ὙΜῶΝ ΤΕ ΚΑῚ ΚΑΘʼ ὙΜῶΝ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[263] <span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>On this assumption Bleek is of opinion that Paul, in that lost Epistle, had rebuked the wanton defiance of the incestuous person towards him (comp. also Neander). According to Ewald, Paul is the <span class="greekheb">ἀδικηθείς</span> over against the man of reputation in the church, who had been endeavouring to deprive him of his repute in it by public accusations. Comp. Hilgenfeld in his <span class="ital">Zeitschr</span>. 1864, p. 169, 1865, p. 252, according to whom Paul is the <span class="greekheb">ἀδικηθείς</span>, because things had in the meanwhile come to a pronounced rejection of his apostolic repute. According to Beyschlag in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1865, p. 254, Timothy is meant, who was personally insulted by a spokesman in the ranks of the opponents.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_corinthians/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.">2 Corinthians 7:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἄρα εἰ καὶ ἔγραψα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">consequently, although I wrote to you, i.e.</span>, wrote a severe letter, <span class="ital">it was not for his cause that did the wrong, sc.</span>, the incestuous son of <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>, <span class="ital">nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, sc.</span>, his father, <span class="ital">but that your diligence on our behalf might be made manifest to yourselves</span> (“chez vous,” so <span class="greekheb">πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm" title="For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and you know.">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>) <span class="ital">in the sight of God</span>.

Whichever be the true reading, the alteration has either sprung from a desire to alter the passage into conformity with the supposed meaning of the Apostle, or from similarity of sound, in the case of a copyist writing from oral dictation. Either reading would make good sense, but that in the text is more probable for two reasons: (1) the Apostle has been all along insisting on the purity of his motives and on his unfeigned affection for his Corinthian converts (ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>); and (2) it seems rather unlikely that he should have wished the Corinthians to manifest their earnestness in his behalf <span class="ital">unto themselves</span>. See, however, on the other hand, ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.">2 Corinthians 2:9</a>, and cf. Calvin, who says “St Paul congratulates the Corinthians on having learned at length by this test, how they were disposed towards him.” The word here translated <span class="ital">care</span> is the same as that rendered <span class="ital">carefulness</span> in the last verse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.">2 Corinthians 7:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐχ ἓνεκεν τοῦ ἀδικήσαντος</span>) Whatever I have written, I have written it, <span class="ital">not for the sake of him, who did the wrong</span>.

He now varies the term because the expression, <span class="ital">to make sorry</span>, he said concerning himself, <a href="/context/2_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same letter has made you sorry, though it were but for a season....">2 Corinthians 7:8-9</a>; and he now dismisses this very <span class="ital">sorrow</span>. Inasmuch as you Corinthians have done what was just respecting him, who had committed the sin, by your <span class="ital">zeal</span> and <span class="ital">revenge</span>, I acquiesce.—<span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ ἕνεκεν τοῦ ἀδικηθέντος</span>, <span class="ital">nor for the sake of him, who suffered wrong</span>) The singular for the plural by euphemism.

Others explain it as referring to the offended parent, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τὴν σπουδὴν ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">our care</span>) Comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐνώπιον</span>, <span class="ital">in the sight of</span>) Construed with <span class="greekheb">φανερωθῆναι</span>, that <span class="ital">it might be manifested</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, though I wrote unto you.</span> "So then, even if I <span class="accented">did</span> write you," namely, about that matter. <span class="cmt_word">For his cause that had done the wrong,</span> etc. My object in writing was not to mix myself up with the personal quarrel. I had in view neither the wronger nor the wronged, directly and primarily, but wrote for the sake of the whole Church (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1, 2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nor for his cause that suffered wrong.</span> Apparently the father of the offender (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Our care for you,</span> etc. Among the diversity of readings in this clause, which seem to be still further confused by mere mistakes of copyists, the best supported reading is "your care for us" (B, C, E, K, L, and various versions, etc.). The Sinaitic manuscript has "your care for yourselves." The variations have partly risen from the apparent strangeness of the remark that his letter had been written in order that their care for him might be manifested <span class="accented">to themselves</span>; in other words, that  they might learn from their own conduct the reality of their earnest feelings for him. He has already spoken of this "earnest care" of theirs (ver. 11), but not in quite the same sense. Certainly, however, the reading followed by our Authorized Version, even if it be a correction, furnishes a more natural meaning (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>), and the other may have arisen from a clerical error. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_corinthians/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Our care for you (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>The correct text reverses the pronouns and reads your care for us. This difficult passage means that while Paul did desire the punishment and reformation of the offender, and the vindication of the wronged party, his main object was that the fidelity and zeal of the Church toward God should be manifested, as it was (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>). This would appear in the manifestation of their zealous interest for him as God's minister. He states this as if it were his only object. Manifest unto you is rather among you (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), as in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a>. </body></html>
