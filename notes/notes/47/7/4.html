If we hope in God as our Father, we must seek to be holy as he is holy, and perfect as our Father in heaven. His grace, by the influences of his Spirit, alone can purify, but holiness should be the object of our constant prayers. If the ministers of the gospel are thought contemptible, there is danger lest the gospel itself be despised also; and though ministers must flatter none, yet they must be gentle towards all. Ministers may look for esteem and favour, when they can safely appeal to the people, that they have corrupted no man by false doctrines or flattering speeches; that they have defrauded no man; nor sought to promote their own interests so as to hurt any. It was affection to them made the apostle speak so freely to them, and caused him to glory of them, in all places, and upon all occasions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Great is my boldness of speech toward you - This verse seems designed to soften the apparent harshness of what he had said <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-12.htm">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>, when he intimated that there was a lack of love in them toward him (Bloomfield), as well as to refer to the plainness which he had used all along in his letters to them. He says, therefore, that he speaks freely; he speaks as a friend; he speaks with the utmost openness and frankness; he conceals nothing from them. He speaks freely of their faults, and he speaks freely of his love to them; and he as frankly commends them and praises them. It is the open, undisguised language of a friend, when he throws open his whole soul and conceals nothing.<p>Great is my glorying of you - I have great occasion to commend and praise you, and I do it freely. He refers here to the fact that he had boasted of their liberality in regard to the proposed collection for the poor saints of Judea <a href="/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>; that he had formerly boasted much of them to Titus, and of their readiness to obey his commands <a href="/2_corinthians/7-14.htm">2 Corinthians 7:14</a>; and that now he had had abundant evidence, by what he had heard from Titus (verses 5ff), that they were disposed to yield to his commands, and obey his injunctions. He had probably often had occasion to boast of their favorable regard for him.<p>I am filled with comfort - That is, by the evidence which I have received of your readiness to obey me.<p>I am exceeding joyful - I am overjoyed. The word used here occurs nowhere else in the New Testament except in <a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>. It is not found in the classic writers; and is a word which Paul evidently compounded (from &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1;  huper and &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;  perisseuo&#772;), and means to superabound over, to superabound greatly, or exceedingly. It is a word which would be used only when the heart was full, and when it would be difficult to find words to express its conceptions. Paul's heart was full of joy; and he pours forth his feelings in the most fervid and glowing language. I have joy which cannot be expressed.<p>In all our tribulation - see the note, <a href="/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. boldness of speech&#8212;(compare 2Co 6:11).<p>glorying of you&#8212;Not only do I speak with unreserved openness to you, but I glory (boast) greatly to others in your behalf, in speaking of you.<p>filled with comfort&#8212;at the report of Titus (2Co 7:6, 7, 9, 13; 2Co 1:4).<p>exceeding joyful&#8212;Greek, I overabound with joy (2Co 7:7, 9, 16).<p>our tribulation&#8212;described in 2Co 7:5; also in 2Co 4:7, 8; 6:4, 5.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Great is my boldness of speech toward you; </span> because I so dearly love you, therefore I speak so boldly and freely to you (as men use to speak most freely to those whom they most love). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Great is my glorying of you; </span> I boast of your obedience to others, and therefore would be far from exposing you.
