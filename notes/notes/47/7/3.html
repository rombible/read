We trace here a sudden revulsion of feeling. What he had just said seemed to imply that he condemned them for even listening to the calumnies which had been circulated against him, for joining in any measure even of outward friendship with men of evil lives; and then there rushes on his memory the recollection of all the good news which Titus had brought.

If we hope in God as our Father, we must seek to be holy as he is holy, and perfect as our Father in heaven. His grace, by the influences of his Spirit, alone can purify, but holiness should be the object of our constant prayers. If the ministers of the gospel are thought contemptible, there is danger lest the gospel itself be despised also; and though ministers must flatter none, yet they must be gentle towards all. Ministers may look for esteem and favour, when they can safely appeal to the people, that they have corrupted no man by false doctrines or flattering speeches; that they have defrauded no man; nor sought to promote their own interests so as to hurt any. It was affection to them made the apostle speak so freely to them, and caused him to glory of them, in all places, and upon all occasions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I speak not this to condemn you - I do not speak this with any desire to reproach you. I do not complain of you for the purpose of condemning, or because I have a desire to find fault, though I am compelled to speak in some respect of your lack of affection and liberality toward me. It is not because I have no love for you, and wish to have occasion to use words implying complaint and condemnation.<p>For I have said before - <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11-12</a>.<p>That ye are in our hearts - That is, we are so much attached to you; or you have such a place in our affections.<p>To die and live with you - If it were the will of God, we would be glad to spend our lives among you, and to die with you; an expression denoting most tender attachment. A similar well-known expression occurs in Horace:<p>Tecum vivere amem. tecum obeam libens.<p>Odes, B. III. IX. 24.<p>With the world I live, with the world Idie.<p>This was an expression of the tenderest attachment. It was true that the Corinthians had not shown themselves remarkably worthy of the affections of Paul, but from the beginning he had felt toward them the tenderest attachment. And if it had been the will of God that he should cease to travel, and to expose himself to perils by sea and land to spread the knowledge of the Saviour, he would gladly have confined his labors to them, and there have ended his days. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

I do not wish thereby to express any condemnatory judgment, as if, although we have done wrong to no one, etc., you failed in that love to which <span class="greekheb">χωρήσατε ἡμᾶς</span> lays claim. <span class="greekheb">Κατάκρισιν</span> was taken of the reproach of <span class="ital">covetousness</span> (so Theodoret, and comp. Emmerling and Neander), but this is an arbitrary importation into the word. According to Rückert, <span class="greekheb">πρὸς κατάκρισιν</span> is not to be supplemented by <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>, but Paul wishes here to remove the unpleasant impression of <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>, in which he confirms the severity of his former Epistle, so that there is to be regarded as object of <span class="greekheb">κατάκρισις</span> primarily the incestuous person, and secondarily the whole church, in so far as it has acted towards this man with unchristian leniency. This explanation falls to the ground with Rückert’s view of <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>; the <span class="greekheb">ἐστέ</span> that follows puts it beyond doubt that <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> is really to be supplied with <span class="greekheb">πρὸς κατακρ</span>. for its explanation. According to de Wette, <span class="greekheb">οὐ π</span>. <span class="greekheb">κατάκρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λ</span>. applies in form, no doubt, to <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>, but in substance more to the censure, of which the expostulatory tone of <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a> had created an expectation; in other words, it applies to something <span class="ital">not really said</span>, which is arbitrary, since what was said was fitted sufficiently to appear as <span class="greekheb">κατάκρισις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">προείρηκα γάρ</span>] <span class="ital">for I have said before</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.">2 Corinthians 6:11</a> f.), <span class="ital">antea dixi</span>, as 3Ma 6:35, <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/14-8.htm" title="First, verily for the unfeigned care I have of things pertaining to the king; and secondly, even for that I intend the good of mine own countrymen: for all our nation is in no small misery through the unadvised dealing of them aforesaid.">2Ma 14:8</a>, and often in classical writers.

By his adding the definition of degree, <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ συναποθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., Paul becomes his own interprete.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ συναποθανεῖν καὶ συζῇν</span>] is usually taken (see still Rückert, de Wette, Ewald, also Osiander, who, however, mixes up much that is heterogeneous) as: <span class="ital">so that I would die and live with you</span>, and this as “vehementissimum amoris indicium, nolle nec in vita nee in morte ab eo quem ames separari,” Estius, on which Grotius finely remarks: “egregius <span class="greekheb">χαρακτὴρ</span> boni pastoris, <a href="/john/10-12.htm" title="But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.">John 10:12</a>.” Comparison is made with the Horatian <span class="ital">tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam lubens</span> (Od. iii. 9. 24), and similar passages in Wetstein. But against this may be urged not only the position of the two words, of which the <span class="greekheb">συναποθανεῖν</span> must logically have been put last, but also the perfectly plain construction, according to which the subject of <span class="greekheb">ἐστε</span> must also be the subject of <span class="greekheb">συναπ</span> and <span class="greekheb">συζῇν</span>.: <span class="ital">you are in our hearts in order to die and to live with</span> (<span class="ital">us</span>),[256] <span class="ital">i.e.</span> in order not to depart from our hearts (from our love) in death, if it is appointed to us to die, and in life, if it is appointed to us to remain in life. For he, whom we love, dies and lives with us, when regarded, namely, from the idea of our heartfelt love to him, and from our sympathetic point of view feeling this consciousness of love which has him always present to our heart—a consciousness according to which we, dying and living, know him in our hearts as sharing death and life with us. And how natural that Paul, beset with continual deadly perils (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;">2 Corinthians 6:9</a>), should have put the <span class="greekheb">συναποθανεῖν</span> <span class="ital">first!</span> in which case <span class="greekheb">συζῇν</span> is to be referred to <span class="ital">eternal</span> life just as little as <span class="greekheb">ζῶμεν</span> in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;">2 Corinthians 6:9</a> (Ambrosiaster, comp. Osiander). Hence the thought can as little surprise us, and as little appear “tolerably meaningless” (de Wette), as the conception of <span class="ital">alter ego</span>. Hofmann, too, with his objection (“since they, nevertheless, in fact do not die with him,” etc.) mistakes the psychological delicacy and thoughtfulness of the expression; and wishes to interpret it—which no reader could have hit on (expressly as <span class="greekheb">προείρ</span>. does not point back further than to <a href="/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.">2 Corinthians 6:11</a>)—from <a href="/2_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;">2 Corinthians 6:9</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/4-11.htm" title="For we which live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.">2 Corinthians 4:11</a> to the effect that the life of the apostle is a continual dying, in which he yet remains always in life, and that consequently it is his life so constituted which the readers share, when they are in his heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[256] There is no justification for departing in any passage from the <span class="ital">telic</span> reference of <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> with the infinitive.

Carlyle calls him an ‘unkempt Apostle Paul,’ and some say of him, ‘he was a man rude, brave, true, unpolished.’ We all know his integrity, his truth, his daring, his incorruptible honesty. But besides these, there was a refined and delicate courtesy, which was for ever taking off the edge of his sharpest rebukes, and sensitively anticipating every pain his words might give.” Robertson.

The commentators have pointed out a similar expression to that in the text in Horace, <span class="ital">Odes</span>, III. 9. 24, “Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens.” Wordsworth refers to the Theban sacred band, and to a similar passage in Athenaeus. But a deeper meaning is suggested by a comparison of ch. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body....">2 Corinthians 4:10-12</a> and notes. Also cf. ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:">2 Corinthians 3:2</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/7-3.htm" title="I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die and live with you.">2 Corinthians 7:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ πρὸς κατάκρισιν</span>, <span class="ital">not</span> [<span class="ital">for condemnation</span>] <span class="ital">to condemn you</span>) He shows that he does not say, what he has said at <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>, because he supposes that the Corinthians dislike Paul and his colleagues, but that he speaks with a paternal spirit, ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/6-13.htm" title="Now for a recompense in the same, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged.">2 Corinthians 6:13</a> : and in order to prove how far he is from entertaining that supposition, he calls it <span class="ital">a condemnation</span>, thus humbling himself anew.—<span class="greekheb">προείρηκα</span>, <span class="ital">I have said before</span>) ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm" title="(For he said, I have heard you in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succored you: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>.—<span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) The reason why he himself does not condemn them, and why they ought to receive the apostle and his associates [<a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a> “Receive <span class="ital">us</span>.”]—<span class="greekheb">ἐν καρδίαις</span>, <span class="ital">in our hearts</span>) So <a href="/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Php 1:7</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ συναποθανεῖν καὶ συζῇν</span>, <span class="ital">to die and live with you</span>) ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-6.htm" title="And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.">2 Corinthians 1:6</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-12.htm" title="So then death works in us, but life in you.">2 Corinthians 4:12</a>. The height of friendship.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I speak not this to condemn you.</span> "Not by way of condemnation am I speaking." My object is to maintain the old love between us; what I say, therefore, is merely  to defend myself, not to complain of you (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have said before.</span> He has not said it in so many words, but has implied it in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2, 3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-11.htm">2 Corinthians 6:11-14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Ye are in our hearts.</span> So he says to his beloved Philippians, "I have you in my heart" (<a href="/philippians/1-7.htm">Philippians 1:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To die and live with you.</span> Similarly he tells the Thessalonians that he was ready to give them even his own life (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>). This is no mere conventional expression of deep affection, like Horace's, "Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens;" nor is it the description of some compact for life and death like that of the Theban Band. It has the deeper meaning which was involved by the words "life" and "death" on the lips of a Christian (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-11.htm">2 Corinthians 4:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-9.htm">2 Corinthians 6:9</a>). And one whose life was, for Christ's sake, a daily death, naturally mentions death first. </body></html>
