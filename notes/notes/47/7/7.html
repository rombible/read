On the part of the majority, at least, of those who had been present when the Epistle was read, there had been all the feelings which he most desired to rouse—longing to see him as he longed to see them (see <a href="/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:">1Thessalonians 3:6</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a>, for the meaning of the word), their “mourning” (<span class= "ital">uttered lamentation</span>) for having grieved him; their <span class= "ital">zeal</span> (not “towards” him, but) <span class= "ital">on his behalf and for him,</span> as against those who slandered him.

But God comforts those who are cast down. We should look above and beyond all means and instruments, to God, as the author of all the consolation and good we enjoy. Sorrow according to the will of God, tending to the glory of God, and wrought by the Spirit of God, renders the heart humble, contrite, submissive, disposed to mortify every sin, and to walk in newness of life. And this repentance is connected with saving faith in Christ, and an interest in his atonement. There is a great difference between this sorrow of a godly sort, and the sorrow of the world. The happy fruits of true repentance are mentioned. Where the heart is changed, the life and actions will be changed. It wrought indignation at sin, at themselves, at the tempter and his instruments. It wrought a fear of watchfulness, and a cautious fear of sin. It wrought desire to be reconciled with God. It wrought zeal for duty, and against sin. It wrought revenge against sin and their own folly, by endeavours to make satisfaction for injuries done thereby. Deep humility before God, hatred of all sin, with faith in Christ, a new heart and a new life, make repentance unto salvation. May the Lord bestow it on every one of us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And not by his coming only - Not merely by the fact that be was restored to me, and that my anxieties in regard to him were now dissipated. It is evident that Paul, not having met with Titus as he had expected, at Troas, had felt much anxiety on his account, perhaps apprehending that he was sick, or that he had died.<p>But by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you - Titus was satisfied and delighted with his interview with you. He had been kindly treated, and he had seen all the effect produced by the letter which he had desired. He had, therefore, been much comforted by his visit to Corinth, and this was a source of additional joy to Paul. He rejoiced at what he had witnessed among you, and he imparted the same joy to me also. The joy of one friend will diffuse itself through the heart of another. Joy is diffusive, and one Christian cannot well be happy without making others happy also.<p>When he told us of your earnest desire - Either to rectify what was amiss (Doddridge, Clarke); or to see me - Macknight, Rosenmuller, Bloomfied. It seems to me that the connection requires us to understand it of their desire, their anxiety to comply with his commands. and to reform the abuses which existed in the church, and which had given him so much pain.<p>Your mourning - Produced by the Epistle.

The church at Corinth received Titus with all respect and reverence; treated him in the most kind and tender manner; satisfied him in the affair of the incestuous person; greatly refreshed his spirits with an account of their faith in Christ, experience of the grace of God, and their regard and close attachment to the honour of religion, and the interest of the Redeemer; many comfortable opportunities had he with them, in preaching among them, and conversing with them; and the account of this added to the apostle's consolation; for the joys and comforts of one believer yield a considerable pleasure, and are matter of joy and comfort, to another: <p>when he told us your earnest desire; that is, of seeing the apostle, of satisfying him in the thing he had complained of, and of reformation in their conduct, and the discipline of Christ's house for the future: <p>your mourning; for the evil that had been committed among them; the dishonour it had brought upon the doctrine and ways of Christ; their remissness, carelessness, and neglect in discharging their duty; and the grief and sorrow occasioned hereby to the apostle: <p>your fervent mind toward me; in vindicating him, his character, doctrine, and conduct, against the false apostles, and others: <p>so that I rejoiced the more: his joy on this narrative of things abundantly exceeded his troubles and afflictions, which surrounded him on every side, and overcame and extinguished that sorrow, which had possessed him on their account; and greatly added to the joy he felt by the coming of Titus, and the consolation that he had met with at Corinth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_corinthians/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/7-7.htm" title="And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὐ μόνον δὲ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">and not by his coming only, but also</span> (see reff. for constr.) <span class="ital">by the comfort wherewith he was comforted in respect of you</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-7.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:">1 Thessalonians 3:7</a> for constr.), <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, “I was comforted, not only by his coming, but by the good news which he brought”; <span class="ital">while he told us your longing, sc.</span>, to see me, <span class="ital">your mourning, sc.</span>, at the rebuke which I sent you, <span class="ital">your zeal on my behalf</span>. <span class="greekheb">ζῆλος</span> may either mean “zeal,” in a good sense, as here (see reff.), or “jealousy,” in a bad sense (see reff. <a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>).—<span class="greekheb">ὥστε με μᾶλλον χαρῆναι</span>: <span class="ital">so that I rejoiced yet more, sc.</span>, than at the mere coming of Titus with his news (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.">2 Corinthians 7:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_corinthians/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>7. <span class="ital">and not by his coming only, but by the consolation</span>] See ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="Now thanks be to God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the aroma of his knowledge by us in every place.">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>, which is explained by this passage.

There is an instance of an intermediate sense in ch. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>.

St. Paul, partly because of his infirmities, was peculiarly dependent on the support of human sympathy (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1-8</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>; <a href="/acts/17-15.htm">Acts 17:15</a>; <a href="/acts/28-15.htm">Acts 28:15</a>). It was not, however, the mere arrival of Titus which cheered him, but still more the good news which he brought, and which partially lightened his anxieties. In all probability this letter was written almost immediately after the arrival of Titus, and while the joy caused by his presence was still glowing in the apostle's heart. It is characteristic of the seclusion of an austere life that St. Jerome supposes the cause of the apostle's distress to have been that Titus was his interpreter, and that in his absence he could not preach! <span class="cmt_word">Your earnest desire.</span> Your yearning to see me once more.
