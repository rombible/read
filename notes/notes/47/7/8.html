Dr. Whitby here remarks, “That true repentance for sin clears us from the guilt of it, not only in the sight of God, but man; so that it is both uncharitable and unchristian to stigmatize or reproach any person for the sin we know or believe he hath truly repented of.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:5-11 There were fightings without, or continual contentions with, and opposition from Jews and Gentiles; and there were fears within, and great concern for such as had embraced the Christian faith. But God comforts those who are cast down. We should look above and beyond all means and instruments, to God, as the author of all the consolation and good we enjoy. Sorrow according to the will of God, tending to the glory of God, and wrought by the Spirit of God, renders the heart humble, contrite, submissive, disposed to mortify every sin, and to walk in newness of life. And this repentance is connected with saving faith in Christ, and an interest in his atonement. There is a great difference between this sorrow of a godly sort, and the sorrow of the world. The happy fruits of true repentance are mentioned. Where the heart is changed, the life and actions will be changed. It wrought indignation at sin, at themselves, at the tempter and his instruments. It wrought a fear of watchfulness, and a cautious fear of sin. It wrought desire to be reconciled with God. It wrought zeal for duty, and against sin. It wrought revenge against sin and their own folly, by endeavours to make satisfaction for injuries done thereby. Deep humility before God, hatred of all sin, with faith in Christ, a new heart and a new life, make repentance unto salvation. May the Lord bestow it on every one of us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For though I made you sorry ... - That is, in the First Epistle which he had sent to them. In that Epistle he had felt it necessary to reprove them for their dissensions and other disorders which had occurred and which were tolerated in the church. That Epistle was suited to produce pain in them - as severe and just reproof always does; and Paul felt very anxious about its effect on them. It was painful to him to write it, and he was well aware that it must cause deep distress among them to be thus reproved.<p>I do not repent - I have seen such happy effects produced by it; it has so completely answered the end which I had in view; it was so kindly received, that I do not regret now that I wrote it. It gives me no pain in the recollection, but I have occasion to rejoice that it was done.<p>Though I did repent - Doddridge renders this: "however anxious I may have been." The word used here does not denote repentance in the sense in which that word is commonly understood, as if any wrong had been done. It is not the language of remorse. It can denote here nothing more than "that uneasiness which a good man feels, not from the consciousness of having done wrong, but from a tenderness for others, and a fear lest that which, prompted by duty, he had said, should have too strong an effect upon them." - Campbell, diss. vi. part iii. section 9. See the meaning of the word further illustrated in the same dissertation. The word (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  metamelomai) denotes properly to change one's purpose or mind after having done anything (Robinson); or an uneasy feeling of regret for what has been done without regard either to duration or effects - Campbell. Here it is not to be understood that Paul meant to say he had done anything wrong.<p>He was an inspired man, and what he had said was proper and right. But he was a man of deep feeling, and of tender affections. He was pained at the necessity of giving reproof. And there is no improbability in supposing that after the letter had been sent off, and he reflected on its nature and on the pain which it would cause to those whom he tenderly loved, there might be some misgiving of heart about it, and the deepest anxiety, and regret at the necessity of doing it. What parent is there who has not had the same feeling as this? He has felt it necessary to correct a beloved child, and has formed the purpose, and has executed it. But is there no misgiving of heart? No question asked whether it might not have been dispensed with? No internal struggle; no sorrow; no emotion which may be called regret at the resolution which has been taken? Yet there is no repentance as if the parent had done wrong. He feels that he has done what was right and necessary. He approves his own course, and has occasion of rejoicing at the good effects which follow. Such appears to have been the situation of the apostle Paul in this case; and it shows that he, had a tender heart, that he did not delight in giving pain, and that he had no desire to overwhelm them with grief. When the effect was seen, he was not unwilling that they should be apprized of the pain which it had cost him. When a parent has corrected a child, no injury is done if the child becomes acquainted with the strugglings which it has cost him, and the deep pain and anxiety caused by the necessity of resorting to chastisement.<p>For I perceive ... - I perceive the good effect of the Epistle. I perceive that it produced the kind of sorrow in you which I desired. I see that it has produced permanent good results. The sorrow which it caused in you is only for a season; the good effects will be abiding. I have, therefore, great occasion to rejoice that I sent the Epistle. It produced permanent repentance and reformation <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-9.htm">2 Corinthians 7:9</a>, and thus accomplished all that I wished or desired. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. with a letter&#8212;Greek, "in the letter" namely, the first Epistle to the Corinthians.<p>I do not repent, though I did repent&#8212;Translate, "I do not regret it, though I did regret it." The Greek words for regret and repent are distinct. Paul was almost regretting, through parental tenderness, his having used rebukes calculated to grieve the Corinthians; but now that he has learned from Titus the salutary effect produced on them, he no longer regrets it.<p>for I perceive, &c.&#8212;This is explanatory of "I did repent" or "regret it," and is parenthetical ("for I perceive that that Epistle did make you sorry, though it was but for a season").<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For though I made you sorry with a letter; </span> the apostle doubtless meaneth the former Epistle to this church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I do not repent, though I did repent:</span> as to which, he saith, that although he was sometimes troubled, because (probably) he understood that some truly pious persons in this church were troubled at it, as thinking themselves intended in the reprehensions of it; for which effect, or mistake, (he saith), he was once sorry, being troubled that he should do any thing to grieve them, whom he so affectionately loved; yet now he tells them he was not sorry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season; </span> and their sorrow was but a temporary sorrow, until they could reform those abuses, which they were made sensible of by that Epistle, and give the apostle that wrote it just satisfaction. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For though I made you sorry with a letter,....

The apostle answers that he did not use his roughness without grief. And he adds moreover, that he is also glad now that he drove them to that sorrow even though it was against his will, since it was so profitable to them. For there is a sorrow not only praiseworthy, but also necessary, that is, by which repentance grows by certain degrees: and for this repentance he praises them highly.

Information regarding this <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον χαρῆναι</span>, explaining the ground of it.

Luther; Rinck, <span class="ital">Lucubr. crit.</span> p. 162, and the punctuation of Lachmann and Teschendorf; also Kling. Only in this way of dividing and interpreting this passage does the explanatory statement advance in a simple logical way (1, I do not regret; 2, if I did previously regret, now I am glad), and the imperfect <span class="greekheb">μετεμελ</span>. stand in right correlation with the present <span class="greekheb">νῦν χαίρω</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">μετεμελόμην</span> applies to the time before the <span class="ital">present joyful mood was reached</span>. The <span class="ital">common</span> punctuation, adopted also by Osiander and Hofmann, which connects <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ μετεμελ</span>. with the previous words, and begins a new sentence with <span class="greekheb">νῦν χαίρω</span>, breaks asunder the logical connection and the correlation of the parts, and leaves <span class="greekheb">βλέπω γὰρ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. (which must be the reason assigned for <span class="greekheb">οὐ μεταμέλομαι</span>, as Hofmann also correctly holds, and not for <span class="greekheb">ἐλύπησα ὑμᾶς</span>, as Olshausen, de Wette, and others would make it) without any proper reference. Bengel, indeed, wishes to take <span class="greekheb">εἰ καί</span> before <span class="greekheb">πρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὥρ</span> <span class="ital">elliptically:</span> “Contristavit vos, inquit, epistola tantummodo ad tempus <span class="ital">vel potius ne ad tempus quidem</span>.” But it is not the bare <span class="greekheb">εἰ καί</span> which is thus used elliptically, but <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ ἄρα</span>, or more often <span class="greekheb">εἴπερ ἄρα</span>, even <span class="greekheb">εἰ ἄρα</span> (see Vigerus, ed. Herm. p. 514; comp. Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell.</span> I. p. 440; Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar.</span> p. 521); further, <span class="greekheb">πρὸς ὥραν</span> must have logically stood before <span class="greekheb">εἰ καί</span>; lastly, the thought itself would be in the highest degree unsuitable, since Paul could not cast doubt on the genuine sadness of the readers (comp. <span class="greekheb">ὀδυρμόν</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/7-7.htm" title="And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>, and see <a href="/2_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing.">2 Corinthians 7:9</a> ff.). The meaning would not be, as Bengel thinks, <span class="greekheb">ἤθους</span> <span class="ital">apostolici plenissimum</span>, but in contradiction with the context. Billroth would (and Chrysostom in a similar way) bring out a logical grounding of <span class="greekheb">οὐ μεταμέλομαι</span> by taking <span class="greekheb">βλέπω</span> as meaning: <span class="ital">I take into consideration</span>;[259] “I take into consideration that it <span class="ital">has saddened</span> you, though only for a short time, as I had intended; by allowing yourselves to be saddened, you have shown that you are susceptible to amendment” (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-2.htm" title="For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?">2 Corinthians 2:2</a>). But in this way everything, in which the probative force is supposed to lie, is <span class="ital">imported</span>. This is the case also with Hofmann, who makes (comp. Bengel above) <span class="greekheb">εἰ καί</span> form by itself alone a parenthetic elliptic sentence, but in a concessive sense, so that the import of the whole is held to be: “Although the Epistle has saddened them, it is a temporary, not a permanent, sadness with which it has filled them. This the apostle sees, and he therefore does not regret that he has saddened them by it.” Paul does not write in this enigmatical fashion; he would have said intelligibly: <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπιστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκείνη</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ ἐλύπησεν ὑμᾶς</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρὸς ὥραν ἐλύπησεν</span>, or, at any rate, have added to <span class="greekheb">εἰ καί</span> the appropriate verb (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.">2 Corinthians 7:12</a>). Such an elliptic <span class="greekheb">εἰ καί</span> is as unexampled as that which is assumed by Bengel, and both serve only to misconstrue and distort the meaning of the words. Rückert comes nearest to our view; he proposes to read <span class="greekheb">βλέπων</span> (as also Lachmann, <span class="ital">Praef</span>. p. xii., would), and to make the meaning: “<span class="ital">That I have thus saddened you I do not regret, but although I regretted it</span> (<span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ καὶ μετεμελόμην</span>) <span class="ital">when I saw that that Epistle had caused you … sadness, still I am glad now</span>,” etc. But apart from the very weak attestation for the reading <span class="greekheb">βλέπων</span>, and apart also from the fact that <span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ καί</span> would be <span class="ital">although, however</span>, not <span class="ital">but although</span>, <span class="greekheb">βλέπων</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐλύπησεν ὑμᾶς</span> would only contain a very superfluous and cumbrous repetition of the thought already expressed in the acknowledgment <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ ἐλύπησα ὑμᾶς</span>, since <span class="greekheb">βλέπων</span> would <span class="ital">not</span> apply to the insight gained from the news brought by Titus. Ewald has the peculiar view, which is simply an uncalled for and arbitrary invention, that Paul intended to write: for I see that that Epistle, though it saddened you for a short time, has <span class="ital">yet brought you to a right repentance</span>; but feeling this to be unsuitable, he suddenly changed the train of thought and went on: <span class="ital">I am now glad</span>, etc. Neander has a view quite similar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <span class="greekheb">πρὸς ὥραν</span>, comp. <a href="/philemon/1-15.htm" title="For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him for ever;">Philemon 1:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-5.htm" title="To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.">Galatians 2:5</a>. The clause “<span class="ital">although for a short time</span>” is here a delicately thoughtful addition of sympathetic love, which has in view the fact that the sadness caused by it will only last <span class="ital">up to the receipt of the present Epistle</span>, which is intended to assure the readers of the apostle’s pardon and joy (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.">2 Corinthians 2:4</a> ff.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[259] Camerarius already took it as <span class="ital">hoc intueor et considero</span>.

II. 3, p. 203.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some make an alteration in the meaning of <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ μετεμελόμην</span>: <span class="ital">etiamsi poenituisset</span> (Erasmus, Castalio, Vatablus, and others, including Flatt); or hold that <span class="ital">poenitere</span> is here equivalent to <span class="ital">dolorem capere</span> (Calvin, comp. Grotius); or suggest explanations such as: “Non autem dolere potuit de eo <span class="ital">quod</span> scripserit cum severitate propter schismata …; hoc enim omne factum instinctu divino per <span class="greekheb">θεοπευστίαν</span>; sed quod contristati fuerint epistola sua et illi, quos illa increpatio adeo non tetigit,” Calovius (comp. Grotius); or the more ingenious device of Beza: “ut significet apostolus, se ex epistola illa acerbius scripta nonnullum dolorem cepisse, non quasi quod fecerat optaret esse infectum, sed quod clementis patris exemplo se ad hanc severitatem coactum esse secum gemens, eventum rei expectaret.” But these are forced shifts of the conception of mechanical inspiration. The Theopneustia does not put an end to the spontaneity of the individual with his varying play of human emotions; hence Wetstein is so far right in remarking: “<span class="ital">Interpretes, qui putant, et consilium scribendi epistolam</span> (rather of writing in so hard a vein of chastisement), <span class="ital">et ejus consilii poenitentiam, et poenitentiae poenitentiam ab afflatu Spir. sancti fuisse profectam, parum consentanea dicere videntur</span>.” Not as if such alternation of moods testified against the existence of inspiration; but it attests its dependence on the natural conditions of the individual in the mode of its working, which was not only different in different subjects, but was not alike even in individuals where these were differently determined by outer and inner influences; so that the divine side of the Scripture does not annul the human, or make it a mere phantom, nor can it be separated from it mechanically.

To some persons this would be perplexing. They cannot understand how an inspired Apostle could regret what he had done: if it were done by inspiration, what room could there be for misgivings? And if he regretted an act done under God’s guidance, just as any common man might regret a foolish act, how could the Apostle be inspired? But this, which might perplex some, exhibits the very beauty and naturalness of the whole narrative. God’s inspiration does not take a man and make a passive machine of him. When God inspires, His spirit mixes with the spirit of man in the form of thought, not without struggles and misgivings of the human element Otherwise it would not be inspiration <span class="ital">of</span> the man, but simply a Divine echo <span class="ital">through</span> the man.” Robertson.

But in truth there need be no such difficulty. The right course was that taken in the First Epistle, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. But after the Epistle was sent, the tender human heart of St Paul doubted whether he had done right, whether he had not given unnecessary pain, and the like, and his mind was not fully set at rest on the point until the arrival of Titus shewed him clearly the hand of God in the matter. Such self-questionings are constantly going on in the mind of every conscientious man, even when he has been acting most thoroughly under the guidance of God’s Spirit. The word here translated <span class="ital">made sorry</span>, which is owing to Wiclif, is the same word which in ch. 2 is rendered ‘caused grief’ and ‘grieved.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_corinthians/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same letter has made you sorry, though it were but for a season.">2 Corinthians 7:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν τῇ ἐπιστολῇ</span>) <span class="ital">in the letter</span>, he does not add, <span class="ital">my:</span> presently after, he removes himself further from it, when he adds, <span class="greekheb">ἐκείνη</span>, <span class="ital">that</span> [same epistle.]—<span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ</span>) <span class="ital">although:</span> Paul had wished to remove, if possible, sorrow from the repentance of the Corinthians.

The apostle explains the reason, why he does not repent of having caused sorrow to the Corinthians. The letter, he says, has made you sad only for a time, or rather not even for a time. Whence also Chrysostom in his exposition repeats the words, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι πρὸς ὥραν ἐλύπησεν ὑμᾶς</span>, in such a way as to omit <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ</span>. The particle <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ</span>, put absolutely, expresses much feeling [Valde <span class="ital">morata</span> est. end.] <span class="ital">Sextus</span> <span class="greekheb">πρὸς ἀστρολόγον</span>, says, <span class="greekheb">Μεθʼ ἡμέραν οὐδὲν τῶν προειρημένων δυνατόν ἐστι παρασημειοῦσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">μόνα δὲ</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ ἄρα</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὰς τοῦ ἡλίου κινήσεις</span>. <span class="ital">By day none of the things previously mentioned can possibly be observed, but only the motions of the sun, if indeed even those;</span> wherein <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ ἄρα</span>, as Devarius properly remarks, <span class="ital">takes away the concession, that had been made</span>, namely, that the motions of the sun only can be observed; <span class="ital">if only</span>, says he, viz., even the motions of the sun can be observed. See Devar. on the Gr. particles, in the instance, <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ</span>, also in the case of <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ εἴπερ</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ εἰ ἄρα</span>, and Budaei Comm.

Probably the First Epistle, though some suppose that the allusion is to a lost  intermediate letter. <span class="cmt_word">I do not repent, though I did repent;</span> better, <span class="accented">I do not regret it</span>. Every one has experienced the anxiety which has followed the despatch of some painful letter. If it does good, well; but perhaps it <span class="accented">may</span> do harm. The severity was called for; it seemed a duty to write severely. But how will the rebuke be received? Might we not have done better if we had used language less uncompromisingly stern? As St. Paul thought with intense anxiety that perhaps in his zeal for truth he may have irrevocably alienated the feelings of the Corinthians, whom, with all their grave faults, he loved, a moment came when he actually regretted what he had written. He himself assures us that he had this feeling. Those who try all kinds of fantastic hypotheses and tortuous exegesis to explain away this phrase as though it were inconsistent with St. Paul's inspiration, go to Scripture to find there their own <span class="accented">a priori</span> dogmas, not to seek what Scripture really says. The doctrine of inspiration is not the fetish into which it has been degraded by formal systems of scholastic theology. Inspiration was not a mechanical dictation of words, but the influence of the Holy Ghost in the hearts of men who retained all their own natural emotions. <span class="cmt_word">For I perceive,</span> etc. There are various ways of taking this clause.
