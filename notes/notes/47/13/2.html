The chief objects of this rigour were to be those whom he had described previously as “having sinned beforehand” (see Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.">2Corinthians 12:21</a>); but he adds that his work as judge will extend to <span class= "ital">all the rest</span> of the offenders. What he has in view is obviously passing a sentence of the nature of an excommunication on the offenders, “delivering them to Satan” (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1Timothy 1:20</a>), with the assured confidence that that sentence would be followed by some sharp bodily suffering. In that case men would have, as he says in the next verse, a crucial <span class= "ital">test</span> whether Christ was speaking in him, and learn that he whom they despised as <span class= "ital">infirm</span> had a reserve-force of spiritual power, showing itself in supernatural effects even in the regions of man’s natural life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_corinthians/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:...">2 Corinthians 13:2-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">I told you before </span>— As you will remember; <span class="ital">and foretel you </span>now, <span class="ital">as if I were present — </span>That is, I declare what you ought to regard as much as if I spake it personally to you; <span class="ital">and being absent </span>— In body, not in spirit; <span class="ital">now I write to them </span>who <span class="ital">heretofore have sinned </span>— In any scandalous and aggravated manner, namely, before ye received my letter; <span class="ital">and to all others </span>— Who have sinned since, and have not repented; <span class="ital">that if I come again I will not spare </span>— As I have hitherto done, but am determined, by the divine permission, to animadvert with severity upon notorious offenders, by the exertion of that miraculous power with which God hath endowed me. <span class="ital">Since ye seek, </span>&c. — This verse appears to be connected with the preceding, and in that case the sense is, <span class="ital">I will not spare, since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in, </span>or <span class="ital">by me. </span>As if he had said, This course I am obliged to take, because you will not believe that Christ gives me authority for what I say and do, without some manifest proof of it; <span class="ital">which to you-ward is not weak, </span>&c. — But has manifested his mighty power in and among you by my ministry, in your conversion, gifts, &c., and will do it further by enabling me to punish you. <span class="ital">For though he was crucified through weakness </span>— As a weak, frail man, left to the impotence of human nature; <span class="ital">yet he liveth </span>— He rose from the dead, and is alive for evermore; <span class="ital">by the power of God </span>— Which hath exalted him to uncontrolled and universal authority; and this power you ought to stand in awe of in me his minister. <span class="ital">For </span>though <span class="ital">we also are weak in him — </span>And to them who regard only external appearances may seem contemptible, nevertheless we shall live with him; <span class="ital">by the power of God toward you </span>— Shall appear to be alive and powerful in and through Christ, being endowed with power from him to punish obstinate offenders.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_corinthians/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-6 Though it is God's gracious method to bear long with sinners, yet he will not bear always; at length he will come, and will not spare those who remain obstinate and impenitent. Christ at his crucifixion, appeared as only a weak and helpless man, but his resurrection and life showed his Divine power. So the apostles, how mean and contemptible soever they appeared to the world, yet, as instruments, they manifested the power of God. Let them prove their tempers, conduct, and experience, as gold is assayed or proved by the touchstone. If they could prove themselves not to be reprobates, not to be rejected of Christ, he trusted they would know that he was not a reprobate, not disowned by Christ. They ought to know if Christ Jesus was in them, by the influences, graces, and indwelling of his Spirit, by his kingdom set up in their hearts. Let us question our own souls; either we are true Christians, or we are deceivers. Unless Christ be in us by his Spirit, and power of his love, our faith is dead, and we are yet disapproved by our Judge.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_corinthians/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I told you before - That I would not spare offenders; that I would certainly punish them.

Rather, "I have already said (at my second visit), and tell you (now) beforehand, AS (I did) WHEN I WAS PRESENT THE SECOND TIME, SO also NOW in my absence (the oldest manuscripts omit the 'I write,' which here wrongly follows in English Version Greek text) to them which heretofore have sinned (namely, before my second visit, 2Co 12:21), and to all others (who have sinned since my second visit, or are in danger of sinning)." The English Version, "as if I were present the second time," namely, this next time, is quite inconsistent with 2Co 13:1, "this is the third time I am coming to you," as Paul could not have called the same journey at once "the second" and "the third time" of his coming. The antithesis between "the second time" and "now" is palpable.<p>if I come again, &c.&#8212;that is, whensoever I come again (Ac 20:2).

He means, that he had in his former epistle faithfully told them of their evils, and admonished them for them; and now he sends to them a second time before his coming, and again admonishes them, as if he was upon the spot with them; so that they had, as before, three witnesses, also a first and second admonition; which, should they be without success, he must proceed further: <p>and being absent now, I write to them which heretofore have sinned; before he wrote his first epistle, of which he had information, and had faithfully reproved and admonished them; see <a href="/2_corinthians/12-21.htm">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>. <p>And to all other; that might since be drawn into a compliance with sinful practices, through their example; or as the Arabic version renders it, "to the rest of the congregation"; who would be witnesses for him, and against them, that he had admonished them a first, and a second time: and by his present writing declares, <p>that if I come again; for, not knowing what might fall out to prevent him, though he was bent upon coming, and ready for it, nor what was the will of God about it, he does not choose to be positive in the matter; and therefore writes conditionally, and with a guard, and no doubt with a submission to the divine will: <p>I will not spare; this was the reason why as yet he had not been at Corinth, because he was willing to spare them; see <a href="/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a> being loath to come to severities, if gentler methods would take effect; but now having used all proper means, he is at a point, aud determined not to spare, but to use his apostolical rod, or that power which the Lord had given him in an extraordinary way, as an extraordinary officer, to punish incorrigible offenders, in such manner as the incestuous person, and Hymenaeus and Philetus had been used by him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_corinthians/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_corinthians/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:">2 Corinthians 13:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὡς παρὼν</span> … <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> is not to be put in a parenthesis, since it is a definition to <span class="greekheb">προλέγω</span>, which interrupts neither the construction nor the sense. <span class="ital">I have said before, and say beforehand, as at my second visit</span> (“sicut feci, cum secundo vobiscum essem,” Er. Schmid), <span class="ital">so also in my present absence, to those who have formerly sinned, and to all the rest, that, when I shall have come again, I will not spare</span>. Accordingly <span class="greekheb">ὡς παρὼν τὸ δεύτερον</span> leaves no doubt as to the temporal reference of <span class="greekheb">προείρηκα</span>. Moreover, from <a href="/2_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:">2 Corinthians 13:2</a> <span class="ital">alone</span> the presence of the apostle, which had already <span class="ital">twice</span> taken place, could not be proved. For, if we knew that he had been only <span class="ital">once</span>, <span class="greekheb">προείρηκα</span> would certainly refer to the first epistle, and <span class="greekheb">ὡς παρὼν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. would have to be explained: <span class="ital">as if I were present for the second time, although I am now absent</span> (comp. Grotius, Estius, Bengel, Rosenmüller, Flatt, Baur, and others).[393] But, as it is clear from other passages that Paul had already been twice in Corinth, and as here in particular <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΊΤΟΝ ΤΟῦΤΟ ἜΡΧΟΜΑΙ</span></span></span> immediately goes before, that view, in which also the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝῦΝ</span></span></span> would simply be superfluous and cumbrous, is impossible. Beza, who is followed by Zachariae and Märcker, connects awkwardly (seeing that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΔΕΎΤΕΡΟΝ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝῦΝ</span></span></span> must correspond to each other) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΔΕΎΤΕΡΟΝ</span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΛΈΓΩ</span></span></span>. Hofmann also misses the correct view, when he makes <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς</span></span></span> serve merely to annex the <span class="ital">quality</span> (“as one having been there a second time, and now absent”), in which the apostle has said and says beforehand. In this way <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> would be the <span class="ital">quippe qui</span> from the conception of the speaker, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-25.htm" title="Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.">1 Corinthians 7:25</a>, and <span class="greekheb">παρών</span> would be imperfect. The two clauses of the sentence, however, contain in fact not qualities subjectively conceived, but two <span class="ital">objective relations of time</span>; and hence <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>, if it is to have the sense given above, would simply be irrelevant (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1 Corinthians 5:3</a><span class="ital"> a</span>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.">2 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm" title="Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;">Php 1:27</a>) and confusing. Paul would have simply written: <span class="greekheb">προείρηκα παρὼν τὸ δεύτερον καὶ προλέγω ἀπὼν νῦν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῖς προηματηκόσι</span>] See on <a href="/2_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>. It is self-evident, we may add, that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟ</span></span></span> in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΗΜΑΡΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> has from the standpoint of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΛΈΓΩ</span></span></span> a greater period of the past behind it than from the standpoint of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΕΊΡΗΚΑ</span></span></span>, and that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΗΜΑΡΤΗΚΌΤΕς</span></span></span>, whom the present <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΛΈΓΩ</span></span></span> threatens, were more, and in part other, than those to whom at the second visit the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΕΊΡΗΚΑ</span></span></span> had applied. The <span class="ital">category</span>, however, is the same; and hence it is not to be said, with Lücke, that from our passage it is clear: “quibus nunc, tanquam <span class="greekheb">προημαρτηκόσι</span>, severiorem castigationem minatur apostolus, <span class="ital">eosdem jam tunc, quum olim</span> (<span class="greekheb">προείρηκα</span>) <span class="ital">minitatus esset</span>, <span class="greekheb">προημαρτηκότας</span> <span class="ital">fuisse</span>.” Paul had at his second presence threatened the <span class="greekheb">προημαρτηκότες</span>, and he threatens them also now. On the two occasions the threat referred to the same <span class="ital">genus hominum</span>, to those who had sinned before the time at which Paul discoursed to the Corinthians, and were still sinners; but the <span class="ital">individuals</span> were not on the two occasions quite the same. Certainly at least there were <span class="ital">now</span> (<span class="greekheb">προλέγω</span>) not a few among them, who had not been included on the <span class="ital">previous</span> occasion (see <a href="/1_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="For it has been declared to me of you, my brothers, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.">1 Corinthians 1:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>, comp. with <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:...">2 Corinthians 12:20-21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῖς λοιποῖς πᾶσιν</span>] Thus <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῖς ΜῊ ΠΡΟΗΜΑΡΤΗΚΌΣΙ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> <span class="ital">To these</span> he then said it before, and he says it so now, <span class="ital">by way of warning</span>, of deterring.

I. p 203: “This is the second time that I am present among you and yet absent at the same time.” Paul, namely, had, in Lange’s view, the <span class="ital">spirit-like gift</span> of transplanting himself with the full spiritual power of his authority during his absence into the midst of the distant church, which had doubtless felt the <span class="ital">thunderclap</span> of his spiritual appearing. In Corinth this had taken place the first time at the exclusion of the incestuous person, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1 Corinthians 5:3</a>, and the second time now.

The only correct view of this <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> and its relation to <span class="greekheb">τὸ δεύτερον</span> is already given by Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">παρεγενόμην δεύτερον καὶ εἶπον</span>, <span class="greekheb">λέγω δὲ καὶ νῦν διὰ τῆς ἐπιστολῆς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀνάγκη με μοιπὸν ἀληθεῦσαι</span>.
