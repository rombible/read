He could not land from the boat which had been His pulpit, for that would have plunged Him into the thick of the crowd, and so the only way to get away from the throng was to cross the lake. But even there He was followed; ‘other boats were with Him.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The first point to note is the wearied sleeper. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The disciples ‘take Him, . . . even as He was,’ without preparation or delay, the object being simply to get away as quickly as might be, so great was His fatigue and longing for quiet. We almost see the hurried starting and the intrusive followers scrambling into the little skiffs on the beach and making after Him. The ‘multitude’ delights to push itself into the private hours of its heroes, and is devoured with rude curiosity. There was a leather, or perhaps wooden, movable seat in the stern for the steersman, on which a wearied-out man might lay his head, while his body was stretched in the bottom of the boat. A hard ‘pillow’ indeed, which only exhaustion could make comfortable! But it was soft enough for the worn-out Christ, who had apparently flung Himself down in sheer tiredness as soon as they set sail. How real such a small detail makes the transcendent mystery of the Incarnation! Jesus is our pattern in small common things as in great ones, and among the sublimities of character set forth in Him as our example, let us not forget that the homely virtue of hard work is also included. Jonah slept in a storm the sleep of a skulking sluggard, Jesus slept the sleep of a wearied labourer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The next point is the terrified disciples. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The evening was coming on, and, as often on a lake set among hills, the wind rose as the sun sank behind the high land on the western shore astern. The fishermen disciples were used to such squalls, and, at first, would probably let their sail down, and pull so as to keep the boat’s head to the wind. But things grew worse, and when the crazy, undecked craft began to fill and get water-logged, they grew alarmed. The squall was fiercer than usual, and must have been pretty bad to have frightened such seasoned hands. They awoke Jesus, and there is a touch of petulant rebuke in their appeal, and of a sailor’s impatience at a landsman lying sound asleep while the sweat is running down their faces with their hard pulling. It is to Mark that we owe our knowledge of that accent of complaint in their words, for he alone gives their ‘Carest Thou not?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But it is not for us to fling stones at them, seeing that we also often may catch ourselves thinking that Jesus has gone to sleep when storms come on the Church or on ourselves, and that He is ignorant of, or indifferent to, our plight. But though the disciples were wrong in their fright, and not altogether right in the tone of their appeal to Jesus, they were supremely right in that they did appeal to Him. Fear which drives us to Jesus is not all wrong. The cry to Him, even though it is the cry of unnecessary terror, brings Him to His feet for our help.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The next point is the word of power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Again we have to thank Mark for the very words, so strangely, calmly authoritative. May we take ‘Peace!’ as spoken to the howling wind, bidding it to silence; and ‘Be still!’ as addressed to the tossing waves, smoothing them to a calm plain? At all events, the two things to lay to heart are that Jesus here exercises the divine prerogative of controlling matter by the bare expression of His will, and that this divine attribute was exercised by the wearied man, who, a moment before, had been sleeping the sleep of human exhaustion. The marvellous combination of apparent opposites, weakness, and divine omnipotence, which yet do not clash, nor produce an incredible monster of a being, but coalesce in perfect harmony, is a feat beyond the reach of the loftiest creative imagination. If the Evangelists are not simple biographers, telling what eyes have seen and hands have handled, they have beaten the greatest poets and dramatists at their own weapons, and have accomplished ‘things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A word of loving rebuke and encouragement follows. Matthew puts it before the stilling of the storm, but Mark’s order seems the more exact. How often we too are taught the folly of our fears by experiencing some swift, easy deliverance! Blessed be God! He does not rebuke us first and help us afterwards, but rebukes by helping. What <span class="ital">could</span> the disciples say, as they sat there in the great calm, in answer to Christ’s question, ‘Why are ye fearful?’ Fear can give no reasonable account of itself, if Christ is in the boat. If our faith unites us to Jesus, there is nothing that need shake our courage. If He is ‘our fear and our dread,’ we shall not need to ‘fear their fear,’ who have not the all-conquering Christ to fight for them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘Well roars the storm to them who hear<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A deeper voice across the storm.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Jesus wondered at the slowness of the disciples to learn their lesson, and the wonder was reflected in the sad question, ‘Have ye not <span class="ital">yet</span> faith?’-not yet, after so many miracles, and living beside Me for so long? How much more keen the edge of that question is when addressed to us, who know Him so much better, and have centuries of His working for His servants to look back on. When, in the tempests that sweep over our own lives, we sometimes pass into a great calm as suddenly as if we had entered the centre of a typhoon, we wonder unbelievingly instead of saying, out of a faith nourished by experience, ‘It is just like Him.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/mark/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/mark/4-35.htm" title="And the same day, when the even was come, he said to them, Let us pass over to the other side....">Mark 4:35-41</a></span>. <span class="ital">The same day, when the even was come </span>— See note on <a href="/matthew/8-18.htm" title="Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart to the other side.">Matthew 8:18</a>. <span class="ital">They took him even as he was in the ship </span>— They carried him immediately, in the same vessel from which he had been preaching to the people. <span class="ital">And there arose a great storm </span>— See note on <a href="/context/matthew/8-23.htm" title="And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him....">Matthew 8:23-27</a>. <span class="ital">He was asleep in the hinder part of the ship </span>— So we translate the words <span class="greekheb">επι τη πρυμνη</span>, for want of a proper English expression for that particular part of the vessel near the rudder, on which he lay. <span class="ital">Peace — </span>Cease thy tossing; <span class="ital">be still </span>— Cease thy roaring.

Their faith appeared weak, and their prayers strong. When our wicked hearts are like the troubled sea which cannot rest, when our passions are unruly, let us think we hear the law of Christ, saying, Be silent, be dumb. When without are fightings, and within are fears, and the spirits are in a tumult, if he say, Peace, be still, there is a great calm at once. Why are ye so fearful? Though there may be cause for some fear, yet not for such fear as this. Those may suspect their faith, who can have such a thought as that Jesus careth not though his people perish. How imperfect are the best of saints! Faith and fear take their turns while we are in this world; but ere long, fear will be overcome, and faith will be lost in sight.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-18.htm">Matthew 8:18-27</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 4:35-5:20.

Ritschl in the <span class="ital">theol. Jahrb.</span> 1851, p. 517 ff., has rightly availed himself of this point on behalf of Mark’s originality; since a later softening—yet without set purpose and naturally unbiassed, and hence not even consistent—is at any rate more probable than a subsequent aggravation of this censure. The remarks of Baur in opposition (<span class="ital">theol. Jahrb.</span> 1853, p. 88 f.) are unimportant, and would amount to this, that Mark, who is assumed withal to be neutral, would in this point have even outstripped Luke. Comp.

Probably those who were in these boats had availed themselves of them to get nearer to the great Prophet, the boatmen themselves having seen the vast crowd that was gathered on the shore, and so having been attracted thither. Thus he had a large audience on the sea as well as on the land. And not it was so ordered that he was surrounded by a fleet and by a multitude of witnesses when he stilled the tempest. </body></html>
