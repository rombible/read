Their faith appeared weak, and their prayers strong. When our wicked hearts are like the troubled sea which cannot rest, when our passions are unruly, let us think we hear the law of Christ, saying, Be silent, be dumb. When without are fightings, and within are fears, and the spirits are in a tumult, if he say, Peace, be still, there is a great calm at once. Why are ye so fearful? Though there may be cause for some fear, yet not for such fear as this. Those may suspect their faith, who can have such a thought as that Jesus careth not though his people perish. How imperfect are the best of saints! Faith and fear take their turns while we are in this world; but ere long, fear will be overcome, and faith will be lost in sight.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Peace, be still - There is something exceedingly authoritative and majestic in this command of our Lord. Standing amid the howling tempest, on the heaving sea, and in the darkness of night, by his own power he stills the waves and bids the storm subside. None but the God of the storms and the billows could awe by a word the troubled elements, and send a universal peace and stillness among the winds and waves. He must, therefore, be divine. The following remarks by Dr. Thomson, long a resident in Syria, and familiar with the scenes which occur there, will farther illustrate this passage, and the parallel account in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-18.htm">Matthew 8:18-27</a>, and also the passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/14-23.htm">Matthew 14:23-32</a>. The extract which follows is taken from "The land and the Book," vol. ii. p. 32, 33: "To understand the causes of these sudden and violent tempests, we must remember that the lake lies low - 600 feet lower than the ocean; that the vast and naked plateaus of the Jaulan rise to a great height, spreading backward to the wilds of the Hauran and upward to snowy Hermon; that the water-courses have cut out profound ravines and wild gorges, converging to the head of this lake, and that these act like gigantic "funnels" to draw down the cold winds from the mountains.<p>On the occasion referred to we subsequently pitched our tents at the shore, and remained for three days and nights exposed to this tremendous wind. We had to double-pin all the tent-ropes, and frequently were obliged to hang with our whole weight upon them to keep the quivering tabernacle from being carried up bodily into the air. No wonder the disciples toiled and rowed hard all that night; and how natural their amazement and terror at the sight of Jesus walking on the waves! The faith of Peter in desiring and "daring" to set foot on such a sea is most striking and impressive; more so, indeed, than its failure after he made the attempt. The whole lake, as we had it, was lashed into fury; the waves repeatedly rolled up to our tent door, tumbling over the ropes with such violence as to carry away the tent-pins. And moreover, those winds are not only violent, but they come done suddenly, and often when the sky is perfectly clear. I once went in to swim near the hot baths, and, before I was aware, a wind came rushing over the cliffs with such force that it was with great difficulty I could regain the shore. Some such sudden wind it was, I suppose, that filled the ship with waves so that it was now full, while Jesus was asleep on a pillow in the hinder part of the ship; nor is it strange that the disciples aroused him with the cry of Master! Master! carest thou not that we perish." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41. And they feared exceedingly&#8212;were struck with deep awe.<p>and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?&#8212;"What is this? Israel has all along been singing of Jehovah, 'Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, Thou stillest them!' 'The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea!' (Ps 89:9; 93:4). But, lo, in this very boat of ours is One of our own flesh and blood, who with His word of command hath done the same! Exhausted with the fatigues of the day, He was but a moment ago in a deep sleep, undisturbed by the howling tempest, and we had to waken Him with the cry of our terror; but rising at our call, His majesty was felt by the raging elements, for they were instantly hushed&#8212;'What Manner of Man is this?'"   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/mark/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/mark/4-35.htm" title="And the same day, when the even was come, he said to them, Let us pass over to the other side.">Mark 4:35</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they feared exceedingly,.... That is, the men in the ship, the mariners to whom the ship belonged, and who had the management of it: <p>and said to one another, as persons in the greatest amazement, <p>what manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? Surely this person must not be a mere man; he must be more than a man; he must be truly God, that has such power over the wind and sea. This best suits with the mariners, since the disciples must have known before, who and what he was; though they might be more established and confirmed in the truth of Christ's deity, by this wonderful instance of his power. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/mark/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/mark/4-41.htm" title="And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?">Mark 4:41</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐφοβήθησαν φ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μ</span>.: nearly the same phrase as in <a href="/jonah/1-16.htm" title="Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the LORD, and made vows.">Jonah 1:16</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τίς ἄρα οὗτός</span>, who then is this?
