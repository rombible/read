By his thus instructing them, they were made able to instruct others; as candles are lighted, not to be covered, but to be placed on a candlestick, that they may give light to a room. This parable of the good seed, shows the manner in which the kingdom of God makes progress in the world. Let but the word of Christ have the place it ought to have in a soul, and it will show itself in a good conversation. It grows gradually: first the blade; then the ear; after that the full corn in the ear. When it is sprung up, it will go forward. The work of grace in the soul is, at first, but the day of small things; yet it has mighty products even now, while it is in its growth; but what will there be when it is perfected in heaven!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Without a parable spake he not unto them - That is, the things pertaining to his kingdom. On other subjects he spake without parables. On these, such was their prejudice, so many notions had they contrary to the nature of his kingdom, and so liable would plain instructions have been to give offence, that he employed this method to "insinuate" truth gradually into their minds, and to prepare them fully to understand the nature of his kingdom.<p>They were alone - His disciples.<p>He expounded - Explained.

The multitude being dismissed, he unfolded and explained all these parables to his disciples, and led them into a large knowledge of himself, and the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; whereby they were furnished for the work he had called them to, and designed them for. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> expounded all things to his disciples.</span><p>(l) Literally, loosed, as you would say, explained to them the hard riddles.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/mark/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/mark/4-34.htm" title="But without a parable spoke he not to them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.">Mark 4:34</a>. <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς παραβολῆς</span>, etc., without a parable He was not wont to speak to the people, not merely that day, but at any time.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπέλυε</span>, etc., He was in the habit of interpreting all things (<span class="ital">viz.</span>, the parables in private to His own disciples, the Twelve, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλύσεως</span>, <a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm" title="Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.">2 Peter 1:20</a>).

Yet on the whole it must be admitted that in his account of Christ’s parabolic teaching Mark seems to vacillate between two opposite views of the function of parables, one that they were used to make spiritual truths plain to popular intelligence, the other that they were riddles, themselves very much needing explanation, and fitted, even intended, to hide truth. This second view might be suggested and fostered by the fact that some of the parables express recondite spiritual truths.</body></html>
