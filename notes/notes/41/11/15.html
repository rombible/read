See the note on <a href="/context/matthew/21-12.htm" title="And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,...">Matthew 21:12-14</a>. Such strong notions had our Lord of even relative holiness, and of the regard due to those places, as well as times, that are peculiarly dedicated to God. The Jews, it must be observed, reckoning the lower and outward court of the temple a place of little or no sanctity, because it was designed for accommodating the Gentile proselytes in their worship, not only kept a daily market there of such things as were necessary in offering sacrifices, but suffered the common porters, in going from one part of the city to another with their burdens, to pass through it, for the sake of shortening their way. But as these abuses occasioned great disturbance to the proselytes, Jesus reformed them again as he had done three years before, (see <a href="/john/2-14.htm" title="And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:">John 2:14</a>,) telling the people around him, that the Gentiles worshipped there by divine appointment, as well as the Jews, the temple being ordained of God to be the <span class="ital">house of prayer for all nations; </span>and to prove this, he cited <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm" title="Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.">Isaiah 56:7</a>, from which the inference was plain, that they were guilty of a gross profanation of the temple who carried on any traffic, even in the court of the Gentiles, much more they who, to make gain, committed frauds and extortions in the prosecution of their traffic, because thus they turned God’s <span class="ital">house of prayer </span>into <span class="ital">a den of thieves. </span>The offenders, it appears, did not make the least resistance. Probably they were struck with a panic by the secret energy of Christ’s omnipotence, as was the case formerly, when he made the like reformation at the first passover after his ministry commenced. To this purpose, Jerome, on the place, says, “Igneum enim quiddam, atque sidereum, radiebat ex oculis ejus, et divinitatis majestas lucebat in facie.” <span class="ital">For, a certain fiery and sparkling radiance issued from his eyes, and a divine majesty shone in his face.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Dr. Campbell justly notices here an inaccuracy in our translation of the original clause, which is rendered, <span class="ital">shall be called of all nations the house of prayer, </span>as if the last words had been, <span class="greekheb">υπο παντων των εθνων</span>, <span class="ital">of all nations, </span>whereas they are, <span class="greekheb">πασι τοις εθνεσιν</span>, <span class="ital">for all nations. </span>“The court of the Gentiles was particularly destined for the devout of all nations, who acknowledged the true God, though they had not subjected themselves to the Mosaic law, and were accounted aliens. The proselytes, who had received circumcision, and were, by consequence, subject to the law, were on the same footing with native Jews, and had access to the court of the people. Justly, therefore, was the temple styled, <span class="ital">A house of prayer for all nations. </span>The error in the common version is here the more extraordinary, as, in their translation of Isaiah, they render the passage quoted, <span class="ital">for all people.”</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:12-18 Christ looked to find some fruit, for the time of gathering figs, though it was near, was not yet come; but he found none. He made this fig-tree an example, not to the trees, but to the men of that generation. It was a figure of the doom upon the Jewish church, to which he came seeking fruit, but found none. Christ went to the temple, and began to reform the abuses in its courts, to show that when the Redeemer came to Zion, it was to turn away ungodliness from Jacob. The scribes and the chief priests sought, not how they might make their peace with him, but how they might destroy him.

The booths of this market are mentioned in the rabbinical writings as the booths of the son of Hanan, or Annas. But this market is never mentioned in the Old Testament. It seems to have sprung up after the Captivity. Our Lord adopted these strong measures <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the temple courts were not the proper places for merchandise, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because these transactions were often dishonest, on account of the avarice and covetousness of the priests. The priests, either themselves or by their families, sold oxen and sheep and doves to those who had need to offer them in the temple. These animals were, of course, needed for sacrifices; and there was good reason why they should be ready at hand for those who came up to worship. But the sin of the priests lay in permitting this buying and selling to go on within the sacred precincts, and in trading dishonestly. There were other things needed for the sacrifices, such as wine, and salt, and oil. Then there were also the <span class="cmt_word">money-changers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a small coin) - those who exchanged large coins for smaller, or foreign money for the half-shekel. Every Israelite, whether rich or poor, was required to give the half-shekel, neither less nor more. So when money had to be exchanged, an allowance or premium was required by the money-changer. Doves or pigeons were required on various occasions for offerings, chiefly by the poor, who could not afford more costly offerings. From these also the priests had their gain. <span class="cmt_word">The seats of them that sold</span> <span class="cmt_word">the doves.</span> These birds were often sold by women, who were provided with seats. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Money-changers (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Another unclassical word, but used also by Matthew.
