The word “eventide” is somewhat indefinite, but it included the two or three hours before sunset, as well as after.

It seems he stayed in the temple but a little while. Having made his public appearance in the metropolis, and received the title of Messiah openly from the multitude, and surveyed the temple, he left the city without doing any thing, to the great discouragement of the throng that had come in with him, expecting that he was immediately to have laid hold on the reins of government.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-11 Christ's coming into Jerusalem thus remarkably, shows that he was not afraid of the power and malice of his enemies. This would encourage his disciples who were full of fear. Also, that he was not disquieted at the thoughts of his approaching sufferings. But all marked his humiliation; and these matters teach us not to mind high things, but to condescend to those of low estate. How ill it becomes Christians to take state, when Christ was so far from claiming it! They welcomed his person; Blessed is he that cometh, the He that should come, so often promised, so long expected; he comes in the name of the Lord. Let him have our best affections; he is a blessed Saviour, and brings blessings to us, and blessed be He that sent him.

He saw the abominations and abuses which he afterward corrected. It may be a matter of wonder that he did not "at once" correct them, instead of waiting to another day; but it may be observed that God is slow to anger; that he does not "at once" smite the guilty, but waits patiently before he rebukes and chastises.<p>The eventide - The evening; the time after three o'clock p. m. It is very probable that this was before sunset. The religious services of the temple closed at the offering of the evening sacrifice, at three o'clock, and Jesus probably soon left the city.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 11:11-26.

It was not now safe for the Lord to sleep in the city, nor, from the day of His Triumphal Entry, did He pass one night in it, save the last fatal one.<p>The Barren Fig Tree Cursed (Mr 11:12-14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/mark/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 11-19. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/21-12.htm" title="And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,">Matthew 21:12</a>"</span>, and following verses to <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/21-17.htm" title="And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.">Matthew 21:17</a></span>, where having so largely spoken to this part of the history, considering also what Mark and Luke hath to complete the history, few words will be needful about it here. Though Mark seems to relate it so, as if the first day Christ came into the temple, looked about it, and did no more till he came back from Bethany (whither he went that night) the next day, yet the other evangelists’ relation of it would make one think otherwise, besides that interpreters think it not probable that our Saviour the first night should only look about, and patiently see and suffer those abuses; most do therefore think that our Saviour the first day did cast out those that sold and bought in the temple. In the notes upon Matthew we have given an account of the market in the court of the Gentiles, which was the outward court of the temple, where, through the covetousness of the priests, some say there were constant shops. In the temple there were, the most holy place, into which the priests only entered, and the holy place, into which entered all the circumcised, whether native Jews or proselytes: these two places they accounted holy. But there was also a court which they called the court of the Gentiles, of which they had no such esteem, but allowed the keeping of shops and markets in it, especially before the passover. Concerning our Saviour’s driving out these buyers and sellers, <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/21-12.htm" title="And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,">Matthew 21:12</a>"</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/21-13.htm" title="And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.">Matthew 21:13</a>"</span>. In those notes also I have fully opened the history concerning our Saviour’s cursing the barren fig tree, and given what account interpreters do give of the difficulty arising from <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/11-13.htm" title="And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.">Mark 11:13</a></span>, as to which I have nothing to add here, save this only, offering it to learned persons to consider, whether the sense of these words, ou gar hn cairov sucwn, be any more than, <span class="ital">for there were no figs. He found nothing but leaves, for there were no figs, </span> as if it had been ou gar hsan suca. So as cairov there should neither signify the common time when figs use to be ripe, nor yet signify the seasonableness of the year for figs, but particularly relate to that tree, which at that time had no figs.
