We should rest in no religion that does not make us fruitful in good works. Christ taught them from hence to pray in faith. It may be applied to that mighty faith with which all true Christians are endued, and which does wonders in spiritual things. It justifies us, and so removes mountains of guilt, never to rise up in judgment against us. It purifies the heart, and so removes mountains of corruption, and makes them plain before the grace of God. One great errand to the throne of grace is to pray for the pardon of our sins; and care about this ought to be our daily concern.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou cursedst - To curse means to devote to destruction.
