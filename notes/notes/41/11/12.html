<span class="ital">he was hungry, </span>&c. — See note on <a href="/context/matthew/21-18.htm" title="Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungry....">Matthew 21:18-22</a>. <span class="ital">And seeing a fig-tree, having leaves </span>— The fig-tree, it must be observed, puts forth its fruit first, and its leaves afterward, so that it was natural to suppose, as it had leaves, it would also have fruit upon it. <span class="ital">And when he came, he found nothing but leaves </span>— There was not so much as any fruit in the bud: which unfruitfulness at this season showed it to be absolutely barren. For <span class="ital">the time of figs, </span>that is, the season of gathering figs, <span class="ital">was not yet. </span>Thus, in <a href="/matthew/21-34.htm" title="And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, that they might receive the fruits of it.">Matthew 21:34</a>, <span class="greekheb">καιρος των καρπων</span>, signifies <span class="ital">the season of gathering the fruits. </span>In construing this passage, the latter clause must be joined with the words, <span class="ital">He came, if haply, </span>&c., the middle clause being a parenthesis; thus, <span class="ital">He came, if haply he might find any thing thereon, for the season of gathering figs was not yet. </span>That this is the true construction of the passage is plain, because the evangelist is not giving the reason why there were no figs on the tree, but the reason why Jesus expected to find some on it. He tells us the season of gathering figs was not come, to show that none had been taken off the tree; and consequently, that, having its whole produce upon it, there was nothing improper in Christ’s expecting fruit on it then. Whereas, if we should think the reason why he did not find any figs was, that the time of them was not come, we must acknowledge the tree was cursed very improperly for having none. It is true, this interpretation makes a trajection necessary; yet it is not more extraordinary than that which is found in <a href="/context/mark/16-3.htm" title="And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher?...">Mark 16:3-4</a>; where the clause, <span class="ital">for it was very great, </span>namely, the stone at the door of the sepulchre, does not relate to what immediately precedes it, namely, <span class="ital">and when they looked they saw the stone rolled away, </span>but to the remote member, <span class="ital">they said, Who shall roll us away the stone? </span>— This interpretation is approved by Dr. Campbell, who renders the original expression, <span class="ital">the fig-harvest, </span>justly asking, “What can the time of any fruit be, but the time of its full maturity? And what is the season of gathering, but the time of maturity? But figs may be eaten for allaying hunger before they be fully ripe: and the declaration that the season of figs was not yet come, cannot be the reason why there was nothing but leaves on the tree; for the fig is of that tribe of vegetables wherein the fruit appears before the leaf. The leaves therefore showed that the figs should not only be formed, but well advanced; and, the season of reaping being not yet come, removed all suspicion that they had been gathered. When both circumstances are considered, nothing could account for its want of fruit but the barrenness of the tree.” <span class="ital">Jesus said, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever </span>— This, like some other of our Lord’s actions, was emblematical and prophetic. “This fig-tree,” says Origen, “was, <span class="greekheb">δενδρον του λαου</span>, a tree representing the people, <span class="greekheb">εμψυχος συκη</span>, <span class="ital">a living fig-tree, </span>on which was pronounced <span class="ital">a curse suitable to its condition; </span>for, <span class="greekheb">δια τουτο ακαρπος εστιν η Ιουδαιων συναγωγη</span>, <span class="greekheb">και τουτο γινεται αυτη εως της συντελειας του αιωνος</span>, <span class="ital">therefore the synagogue of the Jews is unfruitful, and will continue so till the fulness of the Gentiles shall come in.

He made this fig-tree an example, not to the trees, but to the men of that generation. It was a figure of the doom upon the Jewish church, to which he came seeking fruit, but found none. Christ went to the temple, and began to reform the abuses in its courts, to show that when the Redeemer came to Zion, it was to turn away ungodliness from Jacob. The scribes and the chief priests sought, not how they might make their peace with him, but how they might destroy him. A desperate attempt, which they could not but fear was fighting against God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-18.htm">Matthew 21:18-22</a>.<p><a href="/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a><p>Into the temple - Not into the edifice properly called "the temple," but into the "courts" which surrounded the principal edifice. Our Saviour, not being of the tribe of Levi, was not permitted to enter into the holy or most holy place; and when, therefore, it is said that he went into the "temple," it is always to be understood of the "courts" surrounding the temple. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>.<p>And when he had looked round about upon all things - Having seen or examined everything. He saw the abominations and abuses which he afterward corrected. It may be a matter of wonder that he did not "at once" correct them, instead of waiting to another day; but it may be observed that God is slow to anger; that he does not "at once" smite the guilty, but waits patiently before he rebukes and chastises.<p>The eventide - The evening; the time after three o'clock p. m. It is very probable that this was before sunset. The religious services of the temple closed at the offering of the evening sacrifice, at three o'clock, and Jesus probably soon left the city.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

Had he stolen forth from that dear roof at Bethany to the "mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God?" (Lu 6:12); or, "in the morning," as on a former occasion, "risen up a great while before day, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed" (Mr 1:35); not breaking His fast thereafter, but bending His steps straight for the city, that He might "work the works of Him that sent Him while it was day?" (Joh 9:4). We know not, though one lingers upon and loves to trace out the every movement of that life of wonders. One thing, however we are sure of&#8212;it was real bodily hunger which He now sought to allay by the fruit of this fig tree, "if haply He might find any thing thereon"; not a mere scene for the purpose of teaching a lesson, as some early heretics maintained, and some still seem virtually to hold.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/mark/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/mark/11-11.htm" title="And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about on all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.">Mark 11:11</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And on the morrow,....

Comp. on <a href="/context/matthew/21-18.htm" title="Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungry....">Matthew 21:18-20</a>, whose more compressed narrative represents a later form taken by the tradition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰ ἄρα</span>] <span class="ital">whether under these circumstances</span> (see Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar.</span> p. 178 f.)—namely, since the tree had leaves, which in fact in the case of fig-trees come <span class="ital">after</span> the fruits. Comp. on <a href="/matthew/21-19.htm" title="And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.">Matthew 21:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ ἦν καιρὸς σύκων</span>] not inappropriate (Köstlin), but rightly giving information whence it happened that Jesus found nothing but leaves only.[142] If it had been the time for figs (<span class="ital">June</span>, when the <span class="ital">Boccôre</span> ripens, comp. <a href="/matthew/24-32.htm" title="Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:">Matthew 24:32</a>) He would have found fruits also as well as the leaves, and would not have been deceived by the abnormal foliage of the tree. The objections against this logical connection—on the one hand, that figs of the previous year that had hung through the winter might still have been on the tree; on the other, that from <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ ἦν καιρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σύκ</span>. the fruitlessness of the tree would appear quite natural, and therefore not be justified as an occasion for cursing it (comp. de Wette, Strauss, Schenkel; according to Bruno Bauer, Mark made the remark on account of <a href="/hosea/9-10.htm" title="I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves to that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.">Hosea 9:10</a>)—are quite irrelevant; for (1) Figs <span class="ital">that have hung through the winter</span> were not at all associated with a tree’s <span class="ital">being in leaf</span>, but might also be found on trees without leaves; the <span class="ital">leafy</span> tree promised <span class="ital">summer figs</span>, but had none,[143] because in the month Nisan it was not the time for figs, so that thus the presence of foliage which, in spite of the earliness of the time of year, justified the conclusion from the nature of the fig-tree that there would be fruit upon it, was only a deceptive anomaly. (2) The tree presents itself as deserving a curse, because, having <span class="ital">leaves</span> it ought also to have had <span class="ital">fruit</span>; the <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ ἦν κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σ</span>. would only make it appear as blameless if it had had no <span class="ital">leaves</span>; hence even with our simply literal apprehension of the words there in no wise results an over-hasty judicial sentence. It is almost incredible how the simple and logically appropriate meaning of the words has been distorted, in order to avoid representing Jesus as seeking figs out of the fig-season. Such explanations, however, deserve no refutation; <span class="ital">e.g.</span> that of Hammond, Clericus, Homberg, Paulus, Olshausen, Lange, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> II. 1, p. 321: for it was <span class="ital">not a good fig-year</span> (see, on the other hand, Strauss, II. p. 220 f.); that of Abresch, <span class="ital">Lect. Arist.</span> p. 16, and Triller, <span class="ital">ad Thom. M.</span> p. 490: for it was not a <span class="ital">place suitable for figs</span>; the <span class="ital">interrogative</span> view of Majus, <span class="ital">Obss.</span> I. p. 7 : “<span class="ital">nonne</span> enim tempus erat ficuum?;” that of Heinsius and Knatchbull: “<span class="ital">ubi enim fuit, tempus erat ficuum</span>” (so that <span class="greekheb">οὗ</span> would have to be read); the notion of Mill, that Jesus only <span class="ital">feigned</span> as if He were seeking figs, in order merely to do a miracle (Victor Antiochenus and Euthymius Zigabenus had already taken even His hunger as simulated; compare recently again Hofmann, p. 374); the view of Kuinoel (comp. Dahme in Henke’s <span class="ital">Magaz.</span> I. 2, p. 252): for it was <span class="ital">not yet</span> (<span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> = <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὔΠΩ</span></span></span>) <span class="ital">fig-harvest</span>; compare also Baumgarten-Crusius. Fritzsche has the correct view, although he reproaches Mark with having subjoined the notice “<span class="ital">non elegantissime</span>,” whereas it very correctly states why Jesus, <span class="ital">notwithstanding the leaves of</span> the tree, found no <span class="ital">fruits</span>. Toup (<span class="ital">Emendatt. in Suid.</span> II. p. 218 f.), Tittmann (<span class="ital">Opusc.</span> p. 509), and Wassenbergh (in Valckenaer, <span class="ital">Schol.</span> I. p. 18) have even declared themselves against the genuineness of the words in spite of all the critical evidence! Bornemann (in opposition to Wassenbergh) in the <span class="ital">Schol. in Luc.</span> p. xlix. f., and in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1843, p. 131 ff., comes back again essentially to the interpretation of Hammond, and explains: “for it was <span class="ital">not favourable weather</span> for figs.” But <span class="greekheb">καιρός</span> could only acquire the meaning of “favourable weather” by more precise definition <span class="ital">in the context</span>, as in the passage quoted by Bornemann, Eur. <span class="ital">Hec.</span> 587, by <span class="greekheb">θεόθεν</span>, and hence this interpretation is not even favoured by the reading <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΓᾺΡ ΚΑΙΡῸς ΟὐΚ ἮΝ ΣΎΚΩΝ</span></span></span> (B C* L <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Δ</span></span> א</span>, Copt.
