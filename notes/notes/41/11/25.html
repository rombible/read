The reproduction of the words which are recorded as having been spoken in the Sermon on the Mount, is very significant. The prayer even of intensest faith is not perfect, unless the temper of the worshipper is also that of the Charity which forgives offences. Such words exclude from the prayers of Christ’s disciples wishes more or less vindictive, which, as in Psalms 69, 109, had seemed natural and right under a less perfect manifestation of the will and mind of the Father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/mark/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/mark/11-25.htm" title="And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses....">Mark 11:25-26</a></span>. <span class="ital">When ye stand praying </span>— Standing was their usual posture when they prayed. <span class="ital">Forgive, if ye have aught against any </span>— If you expect your prayers should prevail with God, you must take care to offer them in <span class="ital">love </span>as well as in <span class="ital">faith; </span>and, as you have offended the Majesty of heaven by many provocations, if you expect forgiveness from him, you must forgive your fellow-creatures if you have any matter of complaint against any of them.

We should rest in no religion that does not make us fruitful in good works. Christ taught them from hence to pray in faith. It may be applied to that mighty faith with which all true Christians are endued, and which does wonders in spiritual things. It justifies us, and so removes mountains of guilt, never to rise up in judgment against us. It purifies the heart, and so removes mountains of corruption, and makes them plain before the grace of God. One great errand to the throne of grace is to pray for the pardon of our sins; and care about this ought to be our daily concern.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when ye stand praying - When ye pray. It seems that the posture in prayer was sometimes standing and sometimes kneeling. God looks upon "the heart" rather than upon our position in worship; and if the heart be right, any posture may be proper. It cannot be doubted, however, that in private, in the family, and wherever it can be conveniently done, the kneeling posture is more proper, as expressing more humility and reverence, and more in accordance with Scripture examples. Compare <a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/6-13.htm">2 Chronicles 6:13</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>; <a href="/luke/22-41.htm">Luke 22:41</a>; <a href="/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>; <a href="/acts/9-40.htm">Acts 9:40</a>.

The sense is, that if, while a man is praying, it comes into his mind that such an one has committed a trespass against him, has done him an injury, of which he has just reason to complain; but instead of complaining of it before God, and calling upon him to avenge his cause, he should immediately in his heart, and from his heart, forgive him, even though he is not present to acknowledge his sin, and ask his pardon; and such an one may expect forgiveness of God, and a manifestation of it to his soul; which is one the things he is constantly praying for, as his daily case makes it necessary: not that it is to be understood as though his for, giving the person that has offended him, is the cause, or condition, of his receiving remission of sin at the hand of God; for then it would not be through the blood of Christ, and according to the riches of his grace; but this points at a temper and disposition of mind well pleasing to God, and describes persons who may expect this favour from him; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</span><p>(g) When you will appear before the altar.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/mark/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/mark/11-25.htm" title="And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses....">Mark 11:25-26</a>.

And how appropriate is this to guard against a false conclusion from the occurrence with the fig-tree! Nevertheless (in opposition to Holtzmann) it is hardly here original, but introduced[145] into this connection by Mark from the collection of Logia in the way of thoughtful redaction, not of unadjusted insertion (Hilgenfeld).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">στήκετε</span>] Comp. on <span class="greekheb">ἑστῶτες</span>, <a href="/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.

The ordinary attitude of Eastern nations in prayer is here indicated, namely, "standing," with the head, doubtless, bowed in reverence. The promise of this text is that requests offered in prayer by a faithful heart will be granted - granted as God knows best. The connection of these verses with the former is close. One great hindrance to the faith without which there can be no spiritual power, is the presence of angry and uncharitable feelings. These must all be put away if we would hope for a favorable answer from God. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Trespasses<p>See on <a href="/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14</a>. </body></html>
