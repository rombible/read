Dr. Campbell translates this clause, The <span class="ital">Lord is our God: the Lord is one; </span>in Deuteronomy, <span class="ital">Jehovah is our God: Jehovah is one; </span>and not as one sentence, <span class="ital">Jehovah our God is one Jehovah. </span>Among other reasons for rendering the words thus, he gives the following: 1st, That “it appears to have been the purpose of their great legislator, to establish among them these two important articles, as the foundation of that religious constitution he was authorized to give them. The first was, that the God whom they were to adore, was not any of the acknowledged objects of worship in the nations around them, and was therefore to be distinguished among them, the better to secure them against seduction, by the peculiar name <span class="ital">Jehovah, </span>by which alone he chose to be invoked by them. The second was, the unity of the divine nature, and consequently, that no pretended divinity (for all other gods were merely pretended) ought to be associated with the only true God, or share with him in their adoration. 2d, That in the reply of the scribe, <a href="/mark/12-32.htm" title="And the scribe said to him, Well, Master, you have said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:">Mark 12:32</a>, which was approved by our Lord, and in which he, as it were, echoes every part of the answer that had been given to his question, there are two distinct affirmations with which he begins; these are, <span class="ital">There is one God, </span>and <span class="ital">there is only one, </span>corresponding to <span class="ital">The Lord is our God, </span>and <span class="ital">the Lord is one. </span>The first clause, in both declarations, points to the object of worship; the second, to the necessity of excluding all others. Accordingly, the radical precept relating to this subject, quoted by our Lord, <a href="/matthew/4-10.htm" title="Then said Jesus to him, Get you hence, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.">Matthew 4:10</a>, from the LXX., is exactly suited to both parts of this declaration. <span class="ital">Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God. </span>This may be called the positive part of the statute, and corresponds to the article, <span class="ital">The Lord is our God. Thou shalt serve him only. </span>This is the negative part, and corresponds to the article, <span class="ital">The Lord is one.”</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:28-34 Those who sincerely desire to be taught their duty, Christ will guide in judgment, and teach his way. He tells the scribe that the great commandment, which indeed includes all, is, that of loving God with all our hearts. Wherever this is the ruling principle in the soul, there is a disposition to every other duty. Loving God with all our heart, will engage us to every thing by which he will be pleased. The sacrifices only represented the atonements for men's transgressions of the moral law; they were of no power except as they expressed repentance and faith in the promised Saviour, and as they led to moral obedience. And because we have not thus loved God and man, but the very reverse, therefore we are condemned sinners; we need repentance, and we need mercy. Christ approved what the scribe said, and encouraged him. He stood fair for further advance; for this knowledge of the law leads to conviction of sin, to repentance, to discovery of our need of mercy, and understanding the way of justification by Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-34.htm">Matthew 22:34-40</a>.<p><a href="/mark/12-28.htm">Mark 12:28</a><p>Perceiving that he answered them well - That is, with wisdom, and with a proper understanding of the law. In this case the opinion of the Saviour corresponded with that of the Pharisees; and the question which this scribe put to him now seems to have been one of the very few candid inquiries of him by the Jews for the purpose of obtaining information.

This was a question which, with some others, divided the Jewish teachers into rival schools.

The permanent value of this section lies in the answer of Jesus to the question put to Him, which is substantially the same in both Mt. and Mk. The accounts vary in regard to the motive of the questioner. In Mt. he comes to tempt, in Mk. in hope of getting confirmation in a new way of thinking on the subject, similar to that of the man in quest of eternal life—that which put the ethical above the ritual. No anxious attempt should be made to remove the discrepancy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/mark/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28–34</span>.

The Rabbinical schools taught that there were important distinctions between the Commandments, some being great and others small, some hard and weighty, others easy and of less importance. Great commands were the observance of the Sabbath, circumcision, minute rites of sacrifice and offering, the rules respecting fringes and phylacteries. Indeed, all the separate commandments of the ceremonial and moral Law had been carefully weighed and classified, and it had been concluded that there were “248 affirmative precepts, being as many as the members in the human body, and 365 negative precepts, being as many as the arteries and veins, or the days of the year; the total being 613, which was also the number of the letters in the Decalogue.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/mark/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/mark/12-28.htm" title="And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?">Mark 12:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καλῶς</span>, <span class="ital">well</span>) Admirably.

It does not necessarily appear that he had an evil intention in putting this question. He may, in his own mind (seeing the wisdom and skill of our Lord), have desired to hear what Christ had to say to a very difficult question on a matter deeply interesting to all true Hebrews. The question was one much mooted amongst the Jews in the time of our Lord. "For many," says Beds, "thought that the first commandment in the Law related to offerings and sacrifices, with regard to which so much is said in Leviticus, and that the right worship of God consisted in the due offering of these." On this account the Pharisees encouraged children to say "Corban" to their parents; and hence this candid and truth-loving scribe, when he heard our Lord's answer about the love of God and of our neighbor, said that such obedience was worth "more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices." With regard to the love of God, St. Bernard says, "The measure of our love to God is to love him without measure; for the immense goodness of God deserves all the love that we can possibly give to him." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Well (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., beautifully, finely, admirably.<p>What (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;)<p>Rather, of what nature. </body></html>
