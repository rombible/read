It is sad to think what base usage God's faithful ministers have met with in all ages, from those who have enjoyed the privileges of the church, but have not brought forth fruit answerable. God at length sent his Son, his Well-beloved; and it might be expected that he whom their Master loved, they also should respect and love; but instead of honouring him because he was the Son and Heir, they therefore hated him. But the exaltation of Christ was the Lord's doing; and it is his doing to exalt him in our hearts, and to set up his throne there; and if this be done, it cannot but be marvellous in our eyes. The Scriptures, and faithful preachers, and the coming of Christ in the flesh, call on us to render due praise to God in our lives. Let sinners beware of a proud, carnal spirit; if they revile or despise the preachers of Christ, they would have done so their Master, had they lived when he was upon earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this parable explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-46</a>.<p>See this parable explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-46</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>Mr 12:1-12.

The meaning is plainly this, that the chief priests and scribes, as the builders of the Jewish Church, rejected Christ from the building as a useless stone; yea, more - they condemned and crucified him. They rejected him (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The verb in the Greek implies that the stone was first examined and then deliberately refused. But this stone, thus disallowed and set at nought by the builders, was made <span class="cmt_word">the head of the corner</span>. The image here is different from that used in the Epistles, where Christ is spoken of as the chief Corner-stone in the foundation. Here he is represented as the Corner-stone in the cornice. In real truth he is both. He is the tried Foundation-stone. But he is also the Head of the corner. In the great spiritual building he is "all and in all," uniting and binding together all in one. <span class="cmt_word">This was the Lord's doing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">this was from the Lord.</span> The feminine (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>) refers apparently to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>.
