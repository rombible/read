Nothing is more likely to insnare the followers of Christ, than bringing them to meddle with disputes about worldly politics. Jesus avoided the snare, by referring to the submission they had already made as a nation; and all that heard him, marvelled at the great wisdom of his answer.

The flattering speech is differently and more logically (Schanz) given in Mt. <span class="ital">Vide</span> notes there on the virtues specified.—<span class="greekheb">ἔξεστιν</span>, etc.: the question now put, and in two forms in Mk.

The tribute-money alluded to was a capitation tax levied by the Roman government, and keenly resented by Judas the Gaulonite (<a href="/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>) and his followers.
