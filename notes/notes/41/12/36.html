This is a proof, that David did call Christ his Lord; and that he called him so in spirit; since these words were delivered by him under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit: that the psalm was wrote by David, the title shows; and that he spake it as he was influenced by the Holy Ghost, our Lord declares: the passage relates to what God the Father said to Christ, when being risen from the dead, he ascended on high, and entered into the most holy place; he bid him sit down at his right hand, as having done the work of man's salvation, he was sent about, to full satisfaction; and as a mark of affection to him, and honour conferred upon him in the human nature; where he should continue, till all his enemies, Jews, Pagans, Papists, and Mahometans, as well as Satan, and all his principalities and powers, were so subdued under him, as to be as a footstool to his throne: and when David prophetically speaks of this, he calls the Messiah his Lord; saying, the "Lord said to my Lord"; on which account the prophecy is cited; who was so, as he is God, and his Creator and Redeemer. That this prophecy is a prophecy of the Messiah, and is applicable to no other but he; and is therefore pertinently cited, and applied to him here; see Gill on <a href="/matthew/22-44.htm">Matthew 22:44</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For David himself said by <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span><p>(f) Literally, in the Holy Spirit; and there is a great power in this kind of speech, by which is meant that it was not so much David who was speaking, but instead the Holy Spirit, who in a way possessed David.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/mark/12.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/mark/12-36.htm" title="For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool.">Mark 12:36</a>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς Δ</span>.

The Psalm is more frequently cited by the New Testament writers than any other single portion of the ancient Scriptures (<a href="/context/acts/2-34.htm" title="For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he said himself, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand,...">Acts 2:34-35</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-13.htm" title="But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?">Hebrews 1:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-6.htm" title="As he said also in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-17.htm" title="For he testifies, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 7:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-21.htm" title="(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said to him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)">Hebrews 7:21</a>), “In later Jewish writings nearly every verse of it is quoted as referring to the Messiah.” Perowne <span class="ital">on the Psalms</span>, ii. 291.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/mark/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/mark/12-36.htm" title="For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool.">Mark 12:36</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀυτὸς</span>,) <span class="ital">Himself</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said unto my Lord</span>. From this verse (<a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.) our Lord shows that the Messiah, such as he was, was not a mere man, as the Pharisees thought, but that he was God, and therefore David's Lord. The meaning, therefore, is this, "The Lord God said to my Lord," that is, Christ, "Sit thou at my right hand," that is, when, after his cross, his death, and his resurrection, he will exalt him far above all principality and power, and place him next to him in heaven, that he may reign with supreme happiness and power and glory over all creatures. These words show that this is a Divine decree, fixed and irrevocable. Till I make thine enemies thy footstool (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the footstool of thy feet</span>; that is, reign with me in glory until the day of judgment, when I will make the wicked, all opposing powers, subject to thee. The word "till" does not imply that Christ will then cease to reign. "Of his kingdom there shall be no end." But he will then formally deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father, only that he may receive it again as the second Person of the Godhead. </body></html>
