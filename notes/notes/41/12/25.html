Christ put aside the objection of the Sadducees, who were the scoffing infidels of that day, by setting the doctrine of the future state in a true light. The relation between husband and wife, though appointed in the earthly paradise, will not be known in the heavenly one. It is no wonder if we confuse ourselves with foolish errors, when we form our ideas of the world of spirits by the affairs of this world of sense. It is absurd to think that the living God should be the portion and happiness of a man if he is for ever dead; and therefore it is certain that Abraham's soul exists and acts, though now for a time separate from the body. Those that deny the resurrection greatly err, and ought to be told so. Let us seek to pass through this dying world, with a joyful hope of eternal happiness, and of a glorious resurrection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Are as the angels - That is, as the angels in respect to connections and relations.

Compare the argument of St Paul in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-39.htm" title="All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds....">1 Corinthians 15:39-44</a>, based on the endless variety of the creative power of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as the angels</span>] The Sadducees denied not only the Resurrection, but the existence also of angels and spirits (<a href="/acts/23-8.htm" title="For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.">Acts 23:8</a>). In His reply, therefore, our Lord embraces the whole area of their unbelief. He refers to the angels in heaven as persons, whose personal existence was a fact. Moreover in these words we have one of the few revelations which He was pleased to make as to the state after death. They imply that, as St Paul teaches, at the Resurrection “<span class="ital">we shall be changed</span>” (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.

The blessed, after the resurrection, will be like angels as to purity, as to a spiritual life, as to immortality, as to happiness and glory. There will be no necessity for marriages in heaven. Here, on earth, the father dies, but he lives on in his children after death. In heaven there is no death, but every one will live and be blessed for ever; and therefore it is that St. Luke adds here, "Neither can they die any more." St. Augustine says, "Marriages are on account of children; children on account of succession; succession on account of death. But in heaven, as there is no death, neither is there any marriage." </body></html>
