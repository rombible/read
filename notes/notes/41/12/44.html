He knows how much, and from what motives, men give to his cause. He looks at the heart, and what our views are, in giving alms; and whether we do it as unto the Lord, or only to be seen of men. It is so rare to find any who would not blame this widow, that we cannot expect to find many who will do like to her; and yet our Saviour commends her, therefore we are sure that she did well and wisely. The feeble efforts of the poor to honour their Saviour, will be commended in that day, when the splendid actions of unbelievers will be exposed to contempt.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of their abundance - Of their superfluous store. They have given what they did not "need." They could afford it as well as not, and in doing it they have shown no self-denial.<p>She of her want - Of her poverty.<p>All her living - All that she had to live on. She trusted in God to supply her wants, and devoted her little property entirely to him. From this passage we may learn:<p>1. That God is pleased with offerings made to him and his cause.<p>2. That it is our duty to devote our property to God. We received it from him, and we shall not employ it in a proper manner unless we feel that we are stewards, and ask of him what we shall do with it. Jesus approved the conduct of all who had given money to the treasury.<p>3. That the highest evidence of love to the cause of religion is not the "amount" given, but the amount compared with our means.<p>4. That it "may be" proper to give "all" our property to God, and to depend on his providence for the supply of our wants.<p>5. That God does not despise the humblest offering, if made in sincerity. He loves a cheerful giver.<p>6. That there are none who may not in this way show their love to the cause of religion. There are few, very few students in Sunday Schools who may not give as much to the cause of religion as this poor widow; and Jesus would be as ready to approve their offerings as he was hers: and the time to "begin" to be benevolent and to do good is in early life, in childhood.<p>7. That it is every man's duty to inquire, not how much he gives, but how much compared with what he has; how much self-denial he practices, and what is the "motive" with which it is done.<p>8. We may remark that few practice self-denial for the purpose of charity. Most give of their abundance - that is, what they can spare without feeling it, and many feel that this is the same as throwing it away. Among all the thousands who give to these objects, how few deny themselves of one comfort, even the least, that they may advance the kingdom of Christ! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 12:41-44.

Observe all the graphic touches in the account of the widow’s mite. (i) Our Lord was <span class="ital">sitting</span> over against the Treasury; (ii) He was <span class="ital">watching</span> the people casting in their contributions; (iii) He <span class="ital">called</span> to Him His disciples; and (iv) He points out to them the full meaning of her act of self-denial. After this incident in the “court of the women,” and apparently while the Saviour was still there, it came to pass, that two of the Apostles, Andrew and Philip, brought to Him the “inquiring Greeks,” who had desired to see Him (<a href="/context/john/12-20.htm" title="And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:...">John 12:20-22</a>). No sooner did He behold these “inquirers from the West,” than He broke forth into words of mysterious joy (<a href="/context/john/12-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit....">John 12:24-26</a>), and presentiments of His coming Passion (<a href="/context/john/12-27.htm" title="Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?

Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.">John 12:28</a>). And so with the clear prevision that He was about to be “<span class="ital">lifted up</span>” upon His Cross, and, if “<span class="ital">lifted up</span>,” would “<span class="ital">draw all men unto Him</span>” (<a href="/john/12-32.htm" title="And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.">John 12:32</a>), He prepared to leave the Temple, which He was never to enter again. His public work was over. His last counsels, His final warnings, had been delivered.</body></html>
