Here we have a prediction of that ruin which came upon them within less than forty years after this. Such destruction and desolation, that the like cannot be found in any history. Promises of power to persevere, and cautions against falling away, well agree with each other. But the more we consider these things, the more we shall see abundant cause to flee without delay for refuge to Christ, and to renounce every earthly object, for the salvation of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the house-top - See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1-8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

This was the outer garment or pallium. They who worked in the field were accustomed to leave their cloak and their tunic at home; so that, half-stripped, they might be more free to labor. Therefore our Lord warns them that in this impending destruction, so suddenly would it come, they must be ready to fly just as they were. It was the direction given to Lot, "Escape for thy life; look not behind thee." </body></html>
