In the great events of the creation recorded in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> the sun and the moon and the stars did not show their light until that period which is called the fourth day. So in the end of the world, the sun and the moon and the stars are represented as withdrawing their light, perhaps figuratively, but perhaps also literally, in the course of some of the unknown physical changes which shall accompany the winding up of the present dispensation. To this agree the next words, "the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken." The powers may here mean those great unseen forces of nature by which the universe is now held in equipoise. When the Creator wills it, these powers shall be shaken. (See <a href="/job/26-11.htm">Job 26:11</a>, "The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof;" see also <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>, "And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll.")
