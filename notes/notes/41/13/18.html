Here we have a prediction of that ruin which came upon them within less than forty years after this. Such destruction and desolation, that the like cannot be found in any history. Promises of power to persevere, and cautions against falling away, well agree with each other. But the more we consider these things, the more we shall see abundant cause to flee without delay for refuge to Christ, and to renounce every earthly object, for the salvation of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the house-top - See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1-8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

See Lewin’s <span class="ital">Fasti Sacri</span>, p. 344 and p. 358. The Jewish custom, which forbade travelling on the Sabbath beyond a distance of 2000 ells, would make the Christian Jews’ travelling on that day infinitely more difficult, even though they might themselves be possibly free from any scruple. “They would in addition to other embarrassments, expose themselves to the severest persecutions of fanaticism.” Lange.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And pray ye that it be not in the winter</span>.

St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/24-20.htm">Matthew 24:20</a>) adds, "neither on a sabbath." But this would be comparatively of little interest to those to whom St. Mark was writing. Our Lord thus specifies the winter, because at that season, on account of the cold and snow, flight would be attended with special difficulty and hardship, and would be almost impossible for the aged and infirm. </body></html>
