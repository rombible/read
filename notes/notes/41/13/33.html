It would almost seem, from the very different conclusions of the discourse in the three Gospels, as if they had been based up to this point on a common document which then stopped and left them to a greater divergency of memory or tradition. The omission of St. Matthew’s reference to the history of Noah is, perhaps, characteristic of St. Mark’s as a Gentile Gospel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/mark/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/mark/13-33.htm" title="Take you heed, watch and pray: for you know not when the time is....">Mark 13:33-37</a></span>. <span class="ital">Take ye heed </span>— Of every thing that would unfit you for your Master’s coming, that might lull you into a fatal security, and render you negligent and slothful: <span class="ital">watch and pray </span>— Let your minds be always awake to a sense of your danger, and be on your guard against it: watch for the coming of your Lord, that it may not surprise you, and pray for that grace which is necessary to qualify you for it, by enabling you to fulfil his will in all things. <span class="ital">For ye know not when the time is </span>— And ought to be ready every day for that which may come any day. This he illustrates in the close by a parable. <span class="ital">The Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, </span>&c. — Being about to leave this world and go to the Father; <span class="ital">who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, </span>&c. — Gave authority to some that were to be overseers, and work to others that were to be labourers; <span class="ital">and commanded the porter to watch </span>— To be ready to open to him at his return; and in the mean time to take care to whom he should open his gates, not to idle vagrants, thieves, and robbers, but only to his master’s friends and servants. Thus our Lord Jesus, when he ascended on high, left something to all his servants to do, expecting they should all serve his cause in his absence, and be ready to receive him at his return. All are appointed to work, and some are authorized to rule. See notes on <a href="/context/matthew/24-42.htm" title="Watch therefore: for you know not what hour your Lord does come....">Matthew 24:42-51</a>. <span class="ital">Watch ye therefore </span>— The advice is repeated and pressed upon them, because of its unspeakable importance, as it is also upon us. <span class="ital">For ye know not when the master of the house cometh </span>— The builder, head, and ruler of his house, the church; <span class="ital">the Son, presiding over his own house, </span>or family, <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a> : Ye know not when he will come to take account of his servants, and of their work, and of the improvement they have made; <span class="ital">at even or at midnight, </span>&c. — <span class="greekheb">Οψε</span>, <span class="ital">evening, </span>answers to the first watch of the night, which began at sun-setting and ended at nine: <span class="greekheb">μεσονυκτιον</span>, or <span class="ital">midnight, </span>answers to the second watch, which ended at twelve: <span class="greekheb">αλεκτοροφωνια</span>, or the <span class="ital">cock-crowing, </span>answers to the third watch, which ended at three in the morning: <span class="greekheb">πρωι</span>, or the <span class="ital">morning, </span>answers to the fourth watch, which ended at six. As if he had said, Early and late, hold yourselves in a prepared state; <span class="ital">lest, coming suddenly, he find you sleeping </span>— In a state of lukewarmness and sloth. Observe, reader! 1st, This is applicable to his coming to each of us in particular at death, as well as to his coming to us all in general at the final judgment. Our present life is a night, a dark night, compared with the other life; we know not in which watch of the night our Master will come; whether in the days of youth, or middle age, or old age; but as soon as we are born, we begin to die; and therefore, as soon as we are capable of expecting any thing, we must expect death. 2d, Our great care must be that, whenever our Lord comes, he do not find us sleeping secure in ourselves, off our guard, indulging ourselves in ease and sloth, mindless of our work and duty, and thoughtless of our Lord’s coming; ready to say, He will not come, and so being unprepared to meet him. 3d, His coming will indeed be a sudden coming; it will be a great surprise and terror to those that are careless and asleep: it will come upon them <span class="ital">as a thief in the night. </span>It is therefore, 4th, the indispensable duty of all Christ’s disciples to watch, to be awake, and keep awake. <span class="ital">What I say unto you </span>twelve, <span class="ital">I say unto all</span> — My disciples and followers; what I say to you of this generation, I say to all that shall believe in me through your word: <span class="ital">Watch </span>— Expect my second coming, and prepare for it, that you <span class="ital">may be found in peace, without spot and blameless.</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:28-37 We have the application of this prophetic sermon. As to the destruction of Jerusalem, expect it to come very shortly. As to the end of the world, do not inquire when it will come, for of that day and that hour knoweth no man. Christ, as God, could not be ignorant of anything; but the Divine wisdom which dwelt in our Saviour, communicated itself to his human soul according to the Divine pleasure. As to both, our duty is to watch and pray. Our Lord Jesus, when he ascended on high, left something for all his servants to do. We ought to be always upon our watch, in expectation of his return. This applies to Christ's coming to us at our death, as well as to the general judgment. We know not whether our Master will come in the days of youth, or middle age, or old age; but, as soon as we are born, we begin to die, and therefore we must expect death. Our great care must be, that, whenever our Lord comes, he may not find us secure, indulging in ease and sloth, mindless of our work and duty. He says to all, Watch, that you may be found in peace, without spot, and blameless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither the Son - This text has always presented serious difficulties. It has been asked, If Jesus had a divine nature, how could he say that he knew not the day and hour of a future event? In reply, it has been said that the passage was missing, according to Ambrose, in some Greek manuscripts; but it is now found in all, and there can be little doubt that the passage is genuine. Others have said that the verb rendered "knoweth" means sometimes to "make" known or to reveal, and that the passage means, "that day and hour none makes known, neither the angels, nor the Son, but the Father." It is true that the word has sometimes that meaning, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>, but then it is natural to ask where has "the Father" made it known? In what place did he reveal it? After all, the passage has no more difficulty than that in <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>, where it is said that Jesus increased in wisdom and stature. He had a human nature. He grew as a man in knowledge. As a man his knowledge must be finite, for the faculties of the human soul are not infinite. As a man he often spoke, reasoned, inquired, felt, feared, read, learned, ate, drank, and walked. Why are not all these, which imply that he was a "man" - that, "as a man," he was not infinite - why are not these as difficult as the want of knowledge respecting the particular "time" of a future event, especially when that time must be made known by God, and when he chose that the man Christ Jesus should grow, and think, and speak "as a man?" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33.
