As to the destruction of Jerusalem, expect it to come very shortly. As to the end of the world, do not inquire when it will come, for of that day and that hour knoweth no man. Christ, as God, could not be ignorant of anything; but the Divine wisdom which dwelt in our Saviour, communicated itself to his human soul according to the Divine pleasure. As to both, our duty is to watch and pray. Our Lord Jesus, when he ascended on high, left something for all his servants to do. We ought to be always upon our watch, in expectation of his return. This applies to Christ's coming to us at our death, as well as to the general judgment. We know not whether our Master will come in the days of youth, or middle age, or old age; but, as soon as we are born, we begin to die, and therefore we must expect death. Our great care must be, that, whenever our Lord comes, he may not find us secure, indulging in ease and sloth, mindless of our work and duty. He says to all, Watch, that you may be found in peace, without spot, and blameless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the house-top - See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1-8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28.

Manich.</span> 22, <span class="ital">de Trinit.</span> i. 12, and others were of opinion that He did not know it <span class="ital">for His disciples</span>, in so far as He had not been commissioned by God to reveal it unto them. See in later times, especially Wetstein. Similarly Victor Antiochenus also and Theophylact suggest that He desired, as a wise Teacher, to keep it concealed from the disciples, although He was aware of it. Lange, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> II. 3, p. 1280, invents the view that He <span class="ital">willed</span> not to know it (in contrast with the sinful wish to know on the part of the disciples), for there was no call in the horizon of His life for His <span class="ital">reflecting</span> on that day. So, in his view, it was likewise with the angels in heaven. The Lutheran orthodoxy asserts that <span class="greekheb">κατὰ κτῆσιν</span> He was omniscient, but that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤᾺ ΧΡῆΣΙΝ</span></span></span> He had not everything <span class="ital">in promptu</span>.[159] See Calovius. Ambrosius, <span class="ital">de fide</span>, v. 8, cut the knot, and declared that <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ ὁ υἱός</span> was an interpolation of the Arians. Nevertheless it is contained <span class="ital">implicite</span> also in the <span class="greekheb">εἰ μὴ ὁ πατὴρ μόνος</span> of Matthew, even although it may not have stood originally in the collection of Logia, but rather is to be attributed to the love of details in Mark, whose dependence not on our Matthew (Baur, <span class="ital">Markusev.</span> p. 102, comp. his <span class="ital">neut. Theol.</span> p. 102), but on the apostle’s collection of Logia, may be recognised in this more precise explanation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[157] The signification “people” is rightly not given either by Spitzner on Homer, <span class="ital">Il.</span> Exc. ix. 2, or in Stephani <span class="ital">Thes.</span>, ed. Hase, II. p. 559 f.; in the latter there are specified—(1) <span class="ital">genus</span>, progenies; (2) <span class="ital">generatio</span>, genitura; (3) <span class="ital">aetas</span>, seculum.

But this is to carry back the scruples of later prepossession into the apostolic age. Zeller (in Hilgenfeld’s <span class="ital">Zeitschr.</span> 1865, p. 308 ff.) finds in the words, because they attribute to Christ a nature exalted above the angels, an indication that our Mark was not written until the first half of the second century; but his view is founded on erroneous assumptions with respect to the origin of the Epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians, and Philippians, and of the fourth Gospel. Moreover, Paul places Christ above the angels in other passages (<a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm" title="And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>), and even as early as in the history of the temptation they <span class="ital">minister</span> to Him. Zeller believes that he gathers the like conclusion in respect of the date of the composition of our Gospel (and of that of Luke also), but under analogous incorrect combinations, <span class="ital">from the fact</span> that Mark (and Luke) attaches so studious importance to the narratives of the expulsion of demons.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[159] See, on the other hand, Thomasius, <span class="ital">Chr.

It is probable that a fig tree may have been near to them. <span class="cmt_word">When her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh</span>. The branch (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) would be the young shoot, now become tender under the quickening influences of the spring; and this was an evident sign that the summer was at hand. The Asiatic fig tree requires a considerable amount of warmth to enable it to put forth leaves and fruit. Its rich flavour requires a summer heat to mature it. Aristotle says that the fig is the choice food of bees, from which they make their richest honey. Then the fig tree does not flower after the ordinary manner; but produces flower and fruit at once from the tree, and rapidly matures the fruit. The lesson, therefore, from the fig tree is this - the speed with which she ripens her fruit when she feels the warmth of summer. In like manner, as soon as the disciples perceived the signs of Christ's coming, they were to learn that he was close at hand, as certainly as the ripening fruit of the fig tree showed that summer was at hand. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Parable<p>See on <a href="/matthew/24-32.htm">Matthew 24:32</a>.<p>Branch<p>See on <a href="/mark/11-8.htm">Mark 11:8</a>. </body></html>
