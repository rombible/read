Here we have a prediction of that ruin which came upon them within less than forty years after this. Such destruction and desolation, that the like cannot be found in any history. Promises of power to persevere, and cautions against falling away, well agree with each other. But the more we consider these things, the more we shall see abundant cause to flee without delay for refuge to Christ, and to renounce every earthly object, for the salvation of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the house-top - See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1-8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

In Matthew (Mt 24:26-28) we have some additional particulars: "Wherefore, if they shall say unto you, Behold, He is in the desert; go not forth: behold, He is in the secret chambers; believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be." See on [1494]Lu 17:23, 24.

The Persic version adds, "of them"; of the false Christs, and false prophets: for though the purposes of God, concerning the salvation of his elect, are infrustrable; his promises are yea and amen; his grace is efficacious and irresistible, and his power uncontrollable; and the salvation of his chosen ones certain; yet it becomes them to be on their guard against every deception, and temptation, and to make use of all means for their perseverance: <p>behold, I have foretold you all things; relating to the destruction of the temple, city, and nation of the Jews; the signs that would go before it, as the disciples had desired; the miseries and calamities that would attend it, and the danger they would be exposed to through false Christs, and false prophets; and therefore would be inexcusable, if they did not observe the caution he now gave them: and moreover, when all these should be accomplished, they would remember that he had told them of them beforehand; which would be a proof of his omniscience, and so an establishment of them in the truth of him, as the Messiah; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/24-25.htm">Matthew 24:25</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/mark/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/mark/13-23.htm" title="But take you heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.">Mark 13:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς δὲ</span>, etc., now you look out!
