It was the death of the vilest malefactors. Thus the cross and the shame are put together. God having been dishonoured by the sin of man, Christ made satisfaction by submitting to the greatest disgrace human nature could be loaded with. It was a cursed death; thus it was branded by the Jewish law, De 21:23. The Roman soldiers mocked our Lord Jesus as a King; thus in the high priest's hall the servants had mocked him as a Prophet and Saviour. Shall a purple or scarlet robe be matter of pride to a Christian, which was matter of reproach and shame to Christ? He wore the crown of thorns which we deserved, that we might wear the crown of glory which he merited. We were by sin liable to everlasting shame and contempt; to deliver us, our Lord Jesus submitted to shame and contempt. He was led forth with the workers of iniquity, though he did no sin. The sufferings of the meek and holy Redeemer, are ever a source of instruction to the believer, of which, in his best hours, he cannot be weary. Did Jesus thus suffer, and shall I, a vile sinner, fret or repine? Shall I indulge anger, or utter reproaches and threats because of troubles and injuries?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the principal events in this chapter explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/27.htm">Matthew 27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 15<p>Mr 15:1-20.

Irresolution indeed had gone too far, and he could not retrace his steps. He thought he must content the people, and therefore released Barabbas unto them. But he imagined there was room for a compromise. Clamorous as was the crowd, perhaps they would be satisfied with a punishment only less terrible than the Cross, and so he gave the order that He, Whom he had pronounced perfectly innocent, should be scourged.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">willing to content the people</span>] “willinge for <span class="ital">to do ynow</span> to þe peple,” Wyclif. Here we have one of St Mark’s Latinisms. The Greek expression answers exactly to the Latin <span class="ital">satisfacere=to satisfy appease, content</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when he had scourged him</span>] Generally the scourging before crucifixion was inflicted by lictors (Livy, xxxiii. 36; Jos. <span class="ital">Bell. Jud</span>. ii. 14. 9; v. 11. 1). But Pilate, as sub-governor, had no lictors at his disposal, and therefore the punishment was inflicted by soldiers. Lange, iv. 356 n. The Roman scourging was horribly severe. Drops of lead and small sharp-pointed bones were often plaited into the scourges, and the sufferers not unfrequently died under the infliction. Compare the <span class="ital">horribile flagellum</span> of Hor. Sat. i. iii. 119; and “flagrum <span class="ital">pecuinis ossibus</span> catenatum,” Apul. <span class="ital">Met</span>. viii. That the soldiers could not have performed their duty with forbearance on this occasion, is plain from the wanton malice, with which they added mockery to the scourging.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to be crucified</span>] But the compromise did not content the excited multitude. The spectacle of so much suffering so meekly borne did not suffice. “If thou let this man go,” they cried, “thou art not Cæsar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Cæsar” (<a href="/john/19-12.htm" title="And from thereafter Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.">John 19:12</a>). This crafty well-chosen cry roused all Pilate’s fears. He could only too well divine the consequences if they accused him of sparing a prisoner who had been accused of treason before the gloomy suspicious Tiberius (“atrocissimè exercebat leges <span class="ital">majestatis</span>,” Suet. <span class="ital">Vit. Tib</span>. c. 58; Tac. <span class="ital">Ann</span>. iii. 38). His fears for his own personal safety turned the scale. After one more effort therefore (<a href="/context/john/19-13.htm" title="When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha....">John 19:13-15</a>), he gave the word, the irrevocable word, “<span class="ital">Let Him be crucified</span>” (<a href="/john/19-16.htm" title="Then delivered he him therefore to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.">John 19:16</a>), and the long struggle was over. St John, it is to be observed, mentions the scourging as one of Pilate’s final attempts to release Jesus. St Mark, like St Matthew, looks upon it as the first act in the awful tragedy of the Crucifixion. Both views are equally true. The scourging should have moved the people; it only led them to greater obduracy; it proved, as St Mark brings out, the opening scene in the Crucifixion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/mark/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/mark/15-15.htm" title="And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.">Mark 15:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ ἱκανὸν ποιῆσαι</span>) <span class="ital">to content</span>, or <span class="ital">satisfy</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pilate, wishing</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="cmt_word">to content the multitude, released unto them</span> <span class="cmt_word">Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified</span>. St. Luke and St. John are more full in details here. From their narratives it appears that when Pilate found that his attempt to rescue our Lord, by putting Barabbas in contrast with him, had failed, he next hoped to move the multitude to pity by the terrible punishment of scourging, after which he trusted that they would relent. Scourging was a vile punishment, inflicted on slaves. But it was also inflicted upon those who were condemned to death, even though freemen This scourging, which was a part of the punishment of crucifixion, was of frightful severity. Horace ('Sat.' 1:3, 119) speaks of it as "horrible flagellum." But it appears from St. John (<a href="/john/21-1.htm">John 21:1</a>) that the scourging of Jesus took place before his formal condemnation to be crucified; we may therefore suppose that it was not a part of the ordinary punishment of crucifixion. At all events, there is nothing, upon a careful comparison of the narratives, to lead us to the conclusion that our blessed Lord was scourged twice. In fact, Pilate anticipated the time of the scourging, in the vain hope that he might by this means save our Lord from the capital punishment. A comparison of the narratives of St. Matthew and St. Mark with that of St. John will make this clear; for they all three refer to one and the same scourging. Recent investigations at Jerusalem have disclosed what may probably have been the place of the punishment. In a subterranean chamber, discovered by Captain Warren, on what Mr. Fergusson holds to be the site of Antonia, Pilate's praetorium, stands a truncated column, no part of the structure itself, but just such a dwarf pillar as criminals would be tied to to be scourged. The chamber cannot be later than the time of Herod (see Professor Westcott on St. <a href="/john/19.htm">John 19</a>.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>To content (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit., to do the sufficient thing.
