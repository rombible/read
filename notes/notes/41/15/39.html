The Jews were doing their utmost to extinguish the Sun of Righteousness. The darkness signified the cloud which the human soul of Christ was under, when he was making it an offering for sin. He did not complain that his disciples forsook him, but that his Father forsook him. In this especially he was made sin for us. When Paul was to be offered as a sacrifice for the service saints, he could joy and rejoice, Php 2:17; but it is another thing to be offered as a sacrifice for the sin of sinners. At the same instant that Jesus died, the veil of the temple was rent from the top to the bottom. This spake terror to the unbelieving Jews, and was a sign of the destruction of their church and nation. It speaks comfort to all believing Christians, for it signified the laying open a new and living way into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. The confidence with which Christ had openly addressed God as his Father, and committed his soul into his hands, seems greatly to have affected the centurion. Right views of Christ crucified will reconcile the believer to the thought of death; he longs to behold, love, and praise, as he ought, that Saviour who was wounded and pierced to save him from the wrath to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the scripture was fulfilled ... - This passage of Scripture is found in <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>. This does not mean that he "was" a transgressor, but simply that in dying he "had a place" with transgressors. Nor does it mean that God regarded him as a sinner; but that at his death, in popular estimation. or by the sentence of the judge, he was "regarded as" a transgressor, and was treated in the same manner as the others who were put to death for their transgressions. Jesus died, the "just" for the "unjust," and in his death, as well as in his life, he was "holy, harmless, undefiled." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 15:38-47.

The thing that chiefly impressed him, according to Mk., was the manner of His death.—<span class="greekheb">οὕτως ἐξέπνευσεν</span> = with a loud voice, as if life were still strong, and so much sooner than usual, as of one who, needing no Elijah to aid Him, could at will set Himself free from misery. This was a natural impression on the centurion’s part, and patristic interpreters endorse it as true and important. Victor Ant. says that the loud voice showed that Jesus died <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐξουσίαν</span>, and Theophylact applies to the <span class="greekheb">ἐξέπνευσεν</span> the epithet <span class="greekheb">δεσποτικῶς</span>.

And is there not something docetic in self-rescue from the pangs of the cross, instead of leaving the tragic experience to run its natural course? Mt.’s explanation of the wonder of the centurion, by the external events—earthquake, etc.—is, by comparison, secondary. Schanz characterises Mk.’s account as “schöner psychologisch” (psychologically finer).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/mark/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">39–41</span>.

Death he must have often witnessed, on the battle-field, in the amphitheatre at Cæsarea, in tumultuous insurrections in Palestine, but never before had he been confronted with the majesty of a Voluntary Death undergone for the salvation of the world. The expression of a wondrous power of life and spirit in the last sign of life, the triumphant shout in death, was to him a new revelation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Son of God</span>] In an ecstacy of awe and wonder “<span class="ital">he glorified God</span>,” he exclaimed, “<span class="ital">In truth this man was righteous</span>” (<a href="/luke/23-47.htm" title="Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.">Luke 23:47</a>); nay, he went further, and declared, “<span class="ital">This Man was a</span> (or <span class="ital">the</span>) <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of God</span>.” It is possible that on bringing the Lord back after the scourging, which he superintended, the centurion may have heard the mysterious declaration of the Jews, that by their Law the Holy One ought to die, because He <span class="ital">made Himself the Son of God</span> (<a href="/john/19-7.htm" title="The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.">John 19:7</a>). The words made a great impression on Pilate <span class="ital">then</span> (<a href="/john/19-8.htm" title="When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;">John 19:8</a>). But now the centurion had seen <span class="ital">the end</span>. And what an end! All that he had dimly believed of heroes and demigods is transfigured. This man was more. He was <span class="ital">the Son of God</span>. Together with the centurion at Capernaum (Matthew 8) and Cornelius at Cæsarea (Acts 10) he forms in the Gospel and Apostolic histories a triumvirate of believing Gentile soldiers. The words, <span class="ital">I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me</span>, had been already fulfilled in the instance of the penitent malefactor. They are now true of this Roman officer. The “Lion of the tribe of Judah” was “reigning from the Tree.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/mark/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div>[39. <span class="greekheb">Οὕτω κράξας</span>, <span class="ital">having thus cried out</span>) Christ was not exhausted to death by faintness, but most voluntarily laid down His life.—V. g.]<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the centurion, which</span> <span class="cmt_word">stood by over against him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">saw that he so gave up the ghost.</span> The words, "so cried out," are not in the most important authorities. It was the business of the centurion to watch all that took place, and to see that the sentence was executed. He must have been standing close under the cress; and there was that in  the whole demeanour of the dying Sufferer, so different from anything that he had ever witnessed before, that it drew from him the involuntary exclamation, <span class="cmt_word">Truly this man was the Son of God</span>. He had observed him through those weary hours; he had noticed the meekness and the dignity of the Sufferer; he had heard those words, so deeply impressed upon the faith and reverence of Christians, which fell from him from time to time as he hung there; and then at last he heard the piercing cry, so startling, so unexpected, which escaped him just before he yielded up his spirit; and he could come to no other conclusion than this, that he was in very deed God's Son. It has been supposed by some that this centurion was Longiuus, who was led by the miracles which accompanied the death of Christ, to acknowledge him to be the Son of God, and to be a herald of his resurrection, and was ultimately himself put to death for the sake of Christ in Cappadocia. St. Chrysostom repeats the common report, that on account of his faith he was at last crowned with martyrdom. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Son of God<p>Not the Son of God, which Rev. has retained, but a son of God.
