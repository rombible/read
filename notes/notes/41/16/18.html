Our blessed Lord renewed his choice of the eleven as his apostles, and commissioned them to go into all the world, to preach his gospel to every creature. Only he that is a true Christian shall be saved through Christ. Simon Magus professed to believe, and was baptized, yet he was declared to be in the bonds of iniquity: see his history in Ac 8:13-25. Doubtless this is a solemn declaration of that true faith which receives Christ in all his characters and offices, and for all the purposes of salvation, and which produces its right effect on the heart and life; not a mere assent, which is a dead faith, and cannot profit. The commission of Christ's ministers extends to every creature throughout the world, and the declarations of the gospel contain not only truths, encouragements, and precepts, but also most awful warnings. Observe what power the apostles should be endued with, for confirming the doctrine they were to preach. These were miracles to confirm the truth of the gospel, and means of spreading the gospel among nations that had not heard it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They shall take up serpents - When it is necessary for the sake of establishing religion, they shall handle poisonous reptiles without injury, thus showing that God was with them to keep them from harm.

The Arabic version adds, "in their own hands"; and in an ancient manuscript of Beza's it is read, "in the hands"; so the Apostle Paul had a viper, which fastened and hung on his hand, which he shook off, without receiving any harm from it, <a href="/acts/28-3.htm">Acts 28:3</a>. <p>And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; not that they were hereby warranted to drink poison, to show what power they had; but should they accidentally drink it, or rather should they be forced to it by their enemies in order to destroy them, they should find no hurt by it: and Papias (x) reports of Barsabas, surnamed Justus, who was put up with Matthias for the apostleship, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a>, that he drank a poisonous draught, and by the grace of the Lord, received no hurt: and the Jews themselves report (y), that <p>"a son of R.

Such a thing is not known from the history of the apostolic times (what took place with the adder on the hand of Paul in <a href="/acts/28-2.htm" title="And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.">Acts 28:2</a> ff. is different); it would, moreover, be too much like juggling for a <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> of believers, and betrays quite the character of apocryphal legend, for which, perhaps, a traditional distortion of the fact recorded in <a href="/acts/28-2.htm" title="And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.">Acts 28:2</a> f. furnished a basis, whilst the serpent-charming so widely diffused in the East (Elsner, <span class="ital">Obss.</span> p. 168; Wetstein <span class="ital">in loc.</span>; Winer, <span class="ital">Realw.</span>) by analogy supplied material enough. The promise in <a href="/luke/10-19.htm" title="Behold, I give to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.">Luke 10:19</a> is specifically distinct. Others have adopted for <span class="greekheb">αἴρειν</span> the meaning of <span class="ital">taking out of the way</span> (<a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-39.htm" title="And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.">Matthew 24:39</a>; <a href="/acts/21-36.htm" title="For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.">Acts 21:36</a>), and have understood it either of the <span class="ital">driving away, banishing</span> (Luther, Heumann, Paulus), or of the <span class="ital">destroying</span> of the serpents (Euthymius Zigabenus, Theophylact, both of whom, however, give also the option of the correct explanation); but the expression would be inappropriate and singular, and the thing itself in the connection would not be sufficiently marvellous. The meaning: “<span class="ital">to plant</span> serpents <span class="ital">as signs of victory with healing effect</span>,” in which actual serpents would have to be thought of, but according to their symbolical significance, has a place only in the fancy of Lange excited by <a href="/john/3-14.htm" title="And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:">John 3:14</a>, not in the text. The singular thought must at least have been indicated by the addition of the essentially necessary word <span class="greekheb">σημεῖα</span> (<a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm" title="And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:">Isaiah 5:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm" title="And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.">Isaiah 11:12</a>), as the classical writers express <span class="ital">raising a signal</span> by <span class="greekheb">αἴρειν σημεῖον</span> (comp.

The practice of condemning to the cup of poison gave material for it. But it is not to be supposed that the legend of the harmless poison-draught of <span class="ital">John</span> (comp. also the story of <span class="ital">Justus Barsabas</span> related by Papias in Euseb. <span class="ital">H. E.</span> iii. 39) suggested our passage (in opposition to de Wette and older expositors), because the legend in question does not occur till so late (except in Abdias, <span class="ital">hist. apost.</span> v. 20, and the <span class="ital">Acta Joh.</span> in Tischendorf, p. 266 ff., not mentioned till Augustine); it rather appears to have formed itself on occasion of <a href="/matthew/20-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not my to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.">Matthew 20:23</a> from our passage, or to have developed itself[186] out of the same conception whence our expression arose, as did other similar traditions (see Fabricius <span class="ital">in Abd.</span> p. 576).

In his view, there is symbolically expressed “the subjective restoration of life to invulnerability.” Christ is held to declare that the poison-cup would not harm His people, primarily in the symbolical sense, just as it did not harm Socrates in his soul; but also in the typical sense: that the life of believers would be ever more and more strengthened to the overcoming of all hurtful influences, and would in many cases, even in the literal sense, miraculously overcome them. This is to put into, and take out of the passage, exactly what pleases subjectivity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[187] Not the believers who heal (Lange: “they on their part shall enjoy perfect health”).
