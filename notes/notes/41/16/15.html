There is much, however, that is so distinct in St. Mark’s report as to suggest the thought that it may have referred to a different occasion.<p><span class= "bld">Preach the gospel to every creature.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">to the whole creation.</span> The universality of the word is, of course, limited by the nature of the case.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/mark/16.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Mark<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE WORLD-WIDE COMMISSION<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/mark/16-15.htm" title="And he said to them, Go you into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.">Mark 16:15</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The missionary enterprise has been put on many bases. People do not like commandments, but yet it is a great relief and strength to come back to one, and answer all questions with ‘He bids me!’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now, these words of our Lord open up the whole subject of the Universality of Christianity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The divine audacity of Christianity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Take the scene. A mere handful of men, whether ‘the twelve’ or ‘the five hundred brethren’ is immaterial.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How they must have recoiled when they heard the sweeping command, ‘Go ye into all the world’! It is like the apparent absurdity of Christ’s quiet word: ‘They need not depart; give ye them to eat,’ when the only visible stock of food was ‘five loaves and two small fishes.’ As on that occasion, so in this final commandment they had to take Christ’s presence into account. ‘I am with you.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So note the obviously world-wide extent of Christ’s claim of dominion. He had come into the world, to begin with, that ‘the world through Him might be saved.’ ‘If any man thirst, let him come.’ The parables of the kingdom of heaven are planned on the same grand scale. ‘I will draw all men unto Me.’ It cannot be disputed that Jesus ‘lived and moved and had His being’ in this vision of universal dominion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Here emerges the great contrast of Christianity with Judaism. Judaism was intolerant, as all merely monotheistic faiths must be, and sure of future universality, but it was not proselytising-not a missionary faith. Nor is it so to-day. It is exclusive and unprogressive still.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Mohammedanism in its fiery youth, because monotheistic was aggressive, but it enforced outward profession only, and left the inner life untouched. So it did not scruple to persecute as well as to proselytise. Christianity is alone in calmly setting forth a universal dominion, and in seeking it by the Word alone. ‘Put up thy sword into its sheath.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The foundations of this bold claim.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Christ’s sole and singular relation to the whole race. There are profound truths embodied in this relation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {a} There is implied the adequacy of Christ for all. He is for all, because He is the only and all-sufficient Saviour. By His death He offered satisfaction for the sins of the whole world. ‘Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none else.’ ‘Neither is there ‘salvation in any other, for there is none other name,’ etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {b} The divine purpose of mercy for all. ‘God will have all men to be saved, and to come to a knowledge of the truth.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {c} The adaptation of the Gospel message to all. It deals with all men as on one level. It addresses universal humanity. ‘Unto you, O men, I call, and My voice is to the sons of men.’ It speaks the same language to all sorts of men, to all stages of society, and in all ages. Christianity has no esoteric doctrine, no inner circle of the ‘initiated.’ Consequently it introduces a new notion of privileged classes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note the history of Christianity in its relation to slavery, and to inferior and down-trodden races. Christianity has no belief in the existence of ‘irreclaimable outcasts,’ but proclaims and glories in the possibility of winning any and all to the love which makes godlike. There is one Saviour, and so there is only one Gospel for ‘all the world.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Its vindication in facts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The history of the diffusion of the Gospel at first is significant. Think of the varieties of civilisation it approached and absorbed. See how it overcame the bonds of climate and language, etc. How unlike the Europe of to-day is to the Europe of Paul’s time!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In this twentieth century Christianity does not present the marks of an expiring superstition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note, further, that the history of missions vindicates the world-wide claim of the Gospel. Think of the wonderful number of converts in the first fifty years of gospel preaching. The Roman empire was Christianised in three centuries! Recall the innumerable testimonies down to date; e.g. the absolute abandonment of idols in the South Sea Islands, the weakening of caste in India, the romance of missions in Central Africa, etc. etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The character, too, of modern converts is as good as was that of Paul’s. The gospel in this century produces everywhere fruits like those which it brought forth in Asia and Europe in the first century. The success has been in every field. None has been abandoned as hopeless. The Moravians in Greenland. The Hottentots. The Patagonians {Darwin’s testimony}. Christianity has constantly appealed to all classes of society. Not many ‘noble,’ but some in every age and land.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. The practical duty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘Go ye and preach.’ The matter is literally left in our hands. Jesus has returned to the throne. Ere departing He announces the distinct command. There it is, and it is age-long in its application,- ‘Preach!’ that is the one gospel weapon. Tell of the name and the work of ‘God manifest in the flesh.’ First ‘evangelise,’ then ‘disciple the nations.’ Bring to Christ, then build up in Christ. There are no other orders. Let there be boundless trust in the divine gospel, and it will vindicate itself in every mission-field. Let us think imperially of ‘Christ and the Church.’ Our anticipations of success should be world-wide in their sweep.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> As when they kindle the festival lamps round the dome of St. Peter’s, there is a first twinkling spot here and another there, and gradually they multiply till they outline the whole in an unbroken ring of light, so ‘one by one’ men will enter the kingdom, till at last ‘every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘He shall reign from shore to shore.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With illimitable sway.’</span><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/mark/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/mark/16-15.htm" title="And he said to them, Go you into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature....">Mark 16:15-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Go ye into all the world </span>— To all countries under heaven; <span class="ital">and preach the gospel to every creature </span>— That is, to all mankind, to every human being, whether Jew or Gentile, for our Lord speaks without any limitation or restriction whatever. On this Bengelius remarks, “If all men, of all places and ages, have not heard the gospel, the successors of the first preachers, or those whose duty it was to hear it, have not answered God’s design herein, but have made void his counsel.” <span class="ital">He that believeth — </span>The gospel which you preach, <span class="ital">with his heart unto righteousness; </span>he that receives your testimony with a faith productive of love to God and man, and of obedience to the divine will; and who, in token of that faith, <span class="ital">is baptized, </span>and continues till death to maintain a temper and conduct suitable to that engagement, <span class="ital">shall be saved </span>— That is, he shall, by virtue of that faith and baptism, be put into a state of salvation: he shall be saved from the guilt and power of his sins into the favour and image of God; his person shall be justified, and his nature sanctified; and he shall be entitled to, and made meet for, eternal salvation; of which also he shall be made a partaker, if he continue in the faith he has received, and do not wilfully recede from his baptismal covenant. <span class="ital">He that believeth not </span>— With such a faith as is above described, whether baptized or unbaptized; <span class="ital">shall be damned </span>— <span class="greekheb">Κατακριθησεται</span>, <span class="ital">shall be condemned, </span>namely, at the day of final judgment, and in consequence thereof shall perish eternally.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:14-18 The evidences of the truth of the gospel are so full, that those who receive it not, may justly be upbraided with their unbelief. Our blessed Lord renewed his choice of the eleven as his apostles, and commissioned them to go into all the world, to preach his gospel to every creature. Only he that is a true Christian shall be saved through Christ. Simon Magus professed to believe, and was baptized, yet he was declared to be in the bonds of iniquity: see his history in Ac 8:13-25. Doubtless this is a solemn declaration of that true faith which receives Christ in all his characters and offices, and for all the purposes of salvation, and which produces its right effect on the heart and life; not a mere assent, which is a dead faith, and cannot profit. The commission of Christ's ministers extends to every creature throughout the world, and the declarations of the gospel contain not only truths, encouragements, and precepts, but also most awful warnings. Observe what power the apostles should be endued with, for confirming the doctrine they were to preach. These were miracles to confirm the truth of the gospel, and means of spreading the gospel among nations that had not heard it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Into all the world - To the Gentiles as well as the Jews. It was contrary to the opinions of the Jews that the Gentiles should be admitted to the privileges of the Messiah's kingdom, or that the partition wall between them should be broken down. See <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21-22</a>. It was long before the disciples could be trained to the belief that the gospel was to be preached to all men; and it was only by special revelation, even after this command, that Peter preached to the Gentile centurion, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>; Jesus has graciously ordered that the preaching of the gospel shall be stopped by no barriers. Wherever there is man, there it is to be proclaimed. To every sinner he offers life, and all the world is included in the message of mercy, and every child of Adam is offered eternal salvation.<p>Preach - Proclaim; make known; offer. To do this to every creature is to offer pardon and eternal life to him on the terms of the plan of mercy - through repentance, and faith in the Lord Jesus.<p>The gospel - The good news. The tidings of salvation. The assurance that the Messiah has come, and that sin may be forgiven and the soul saved.<p>To every creature - That is, to every human being. Man has no right to limit this offer to any class of men. God commands his servants to offer the salvation to "all men." If they reject, it is at their peril. God is not to blame if they do not choose to be saved. His mercy is manifest; his grace is boundless in offering life to a creature so guilty as man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Not at the same time, and place, as before; not on the first day of the week, on which he rose from the dead, but forty days after, just upon his ascension to heaven; see <a href="/mark/16-19.htm">Mark 16:19</a>; nor at Jerusalem, but in Galilee, where be appointed to meet his disciples, and did, when he gave them the following commission; see <a href="/matthew/28-16.htm">Matthew 28:16</a>. <p>go ye into all the world: not only into Judea, and through all the cities of it, where they had been before confined; nor only into the Roman empire, which is sometimes so called, because great part of the world was under that government; but into every known and habitable part of the whole universe, to all the nations of the world under heaven: and it is to be observed, that this command is not enjoined on every apostle separately, as if each of them was to go into all the world, and travel over every part; but that one was to go one way, and another another way; every one had his line, or that part of the world marked out for him, whither he was to steer his course, and where he was to fulfil and finish his ministry: and besides, this commission not only included the Apostles, but reaches to all the ministers of the Gospel in succeeding ages, to the end of the world; and since this, one part of the world, which was not known, is now discovered; and the order includes that, as well as the then known parts of the world, and the Gospel accordingly has been sent into it. <p>And preach the Gospel to every creature; not to inanimate and irrational creatures, as stocks and stones, the beasts of the field, &amp;c. nor to all rational creatures, as angels, good or bad; the former need not the preaching of the Gospel, and the latter are denied the blessing; but men, the offspring of fallen Adam, the objects of God's good will: these are styled "the creatures", because the chief of God's creation on earth; and are often in the Jewish writings so called; take an instance or two: <p>"R. Chuninn ben Dousa (r) used to say, all in whom,  "the creatures" (i.e. men) have delight, God has delight; and in whomsoever "the creatures" (or men) have no, delight, God has no delight.'' <p>One of the seven qualifications of a member of the sanhedrim is, , "love of the creatures" (s), or love of men: so it is said (t), that <p>"the holy blessed God, sits in the height of the world, and gives a portion of food, , "to every creature",'' <p>that is, to every man: and particularly the Gentiles, as distinguished from the Jews, are often intended by this phrase: thus <p>"says (u) R. Judah, perhaps,  "the creatures", (i.e. the Gentiles,) knew the love with which the holy blessed God Ioved Israel, and roared like lions to pursue after them.'' <p>It is elsewhere (w) said, <p>"all the prayers, , "of the creatures" (the Heathens) are only concerning the earth; Lord, let the earth bring forth! Lord, let the earth be fruitful! All the prayers of the Israelites, are only for the house of the Lord; Lord, let the house of the sanctuary be built, &amp;c.'' <p>And in this sense is the phrase used, in <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a> <a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>. Now to these, Christ would have the Gospel preached, as well as to the Jews; even to all, without any distinction of people, Jews and Gentiles, Barbarians, Scythians, bond and free, male and female, rich and poor, greater or lesser sinners, even to all mankind; than which, nothing was more provoking to the Jews; who would, if they could, have revoked and made null this commission of Christ; see <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>. It was the Gospel he would have preached to them, the word of peace and reconciliation, by his atoning sacrifice; the doctrine of free and full pardon by his blood; and of justification by his righteousness; and of complete salvation by him: even every doctrine relating to his person, as God and man; to every office of his, as prophet, priest, and king; to his incarnation, sufferings, and death, his resurrection, ascension, session at the right hand of God, and intercession for his people, and second coming to judgment; with every doctrine relating to the grace of God, of the Father in election, and the covenant of peace, of the Son in redemption, and of the Spirit in regeneration and sanctification: all which he would have published and declared in the most free, plain, and open manner, with all boldness, faithfulness, and constancy.
