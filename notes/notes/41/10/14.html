It does not appear that they needed bodily cures, nor were they capable of being taught: but those who had the care of them believed that Christ's blessing would do their souls good; therefore they brought them to him. Jesus ordered that they should be brought to him, and that nothing should be said or done to hinder it. Children should be directed to the Saviour as soon as they are able to understand his words. Also, we must receive the kingdom of God as little children; we must stand affected to Christ and his grace, as little children to their parents, nurses, and teachers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Saw it - Saw the conduct of his disciples.<p>Was much displeased - Because, first, it was a pleasure to Him to receive and bless little children; and, secondly, they were doing what they were not commanded to do - interfering in a case where it was evidently improper.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 10:13-16.

Only lately the Lord had expressed His love towards little children in a very remarkable manner (<a href="/context/mark/9-36.htm" title="And he took a child, and set him in the middle of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said to them,...">Mark 9:36-37</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of such</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">to such belongs the Kingdom of God.</span> He says not <span class="ital">of these,</span> but <span class="ital">of such:</span> shewing that it is not children only, but the disposition of children which obtains the kingdom, and that to such as have the like innocence and simplicity the reward is promised.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/mark/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/mark/10-14.htm" title="But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said to them, Suffer the little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.">Mark 10:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἠγανάκτησε</span>, <span class="ital">was much displeased</span>) on account of the obstruction thrown in the way of His love by the disciples.—<span class="greekheb">τοιούτων ἐστὶν</span>, <span class="ital">of such is</span>) Of such as these, it is [to such belongs] the privilege to receive the kingdom of God, <a href="/mark/10-15.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.">Mark 10:15</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">when Jesus saw</span> it (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Greek shows that there was no interval between the acts of the parents  and the disciples, and our Lord's seeing it. The parents were bringing the children, the disciples were rebuking them, Jesus was perceiving. <span class="cmt_word">He was much displeased</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">he was moved with indignation</span>. His words imply eagerness and earnestness: <span class="cmt_word">Suffer the little children to come unto me; forbid them not</span>. The copulative <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> is not to be found in the best authorities. The omission adds force and vividness to the words. The simplicity, candour, and innocence of little children are very attractive. This narrative shows with what care children should be educated. <span class="cmt_word">For of such is the kingdom</span> <span class="cmt_word">of God;</span> that is, of such little children as these. The kingdom of heaven belongs in a peculiar manner to little children. We know for certain that little children who have been brought to Christ in Holy Baptism, if they die before they are old enough for moral accountableness, are undoubtedly saved. They pass at once into a nearer position to the throne. "They are without fault before the throne of God." </body></html>
