By law, it was the husband’s prerogative to dissolve the marriage. The wife could do nothing by herself. When he thought fit to dissolve it, her consent was not necessary.

He here shows that the reason why Moses' law allowed divorce, was such that they ought not to use the permission; it was only for the hardness of their hearts. God himself joined man and wife together; he has fitted them to be comforts and helps for each other. The bond which God has tied, is not to be lightly untied.

Mark has not the properly <span class="ital">tempting element</span> in the question, but it is found in Matt.: <span class="greekheb">κατὰ πᾶσαν αἰτίαν</span> (see on <a href="/matthew/19-3.htm" title="The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?">Matthew 19:3</a>). That this element was not also preserved in <span class="ital">the</span> tradition which Mark here follows, may very naturally be explained from the <span class="ital">reply</span> of Jesus, which ran <span class="ital">unconditionally</span> (even according to Matt. <a href="/context/mark/10-4.htm" title="And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away....">Mark 10:4-6</a>). Mark therefore has not the <span class="ital">original</span> form of the question (Bleek, Weiss, Holtzmann, Schenkel, Harless, <span class="ital">Ehescheid.</span> p. 30), nor does he make the question be put more <span class="ital">captiously</span> (Fritzsche), nor has he made use of Matthew incorrectly, or with alterations consonant to his own reflection (Saunier, Baur), because the Jewish points of dispute as to divorce were to him indifferent (Köstlin); but he follows a defective tradition, which in this particular is completed and corrected in Matthew. De Wette’s conjecture is arbitrary, that Mark presupposes that the Pharisees had already heard of the view of Jesus on divorce, and wished to induce Him to a <span class="ital">renewed</span> declaration on the subject. The perilous element of the question does not turn on the divorce of <span class="ital">Herod</span> (Ewald, Lange). See on Matthew.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/mark/10-3.htm" title="And he answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?">Mark 10:3</a>. Here also the tradition, which Mark follows, deviates from Matthew, who represents that the commandment of Moses is brought into question not by Jesus, but by the Pharisees, and that as an objection against the answer of Jesus. But it is more natural and more forcible that the reply of Jesus should start immediately from <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, and should first elicit this Mosaic <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span>—on the right estimation of which depended the point at issue—from the mouth of the questioners themselves, in order thereupon to attach to it what follows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/mark/10-4.htm" title="And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.">Mark 10:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπέτρεψε</span>] emphatically prefixed (see the critical remarks): Moses <span class="ital">permitted</span>, in saying which their <span class="greekheb">ἔξεστιν</span>, <a href="/mark/10-2.htm" title="And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.">Mark 10:2</a>, is present to their minds. See, moreover, on <a href="/matthew/5-31.htm" title="It has been said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce:">Matthew 5:31</a>. They prudently refrain from saying <span class="greekheb">ἐνετείλατο</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/mark/10-5.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.">Mark 10:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐντολὴν ταύτ</span>.] the commandment of the putting forth a writing of divorcement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/mark/10-6.htm" title="But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.">Mark 10:6</a>.

Our</span> Lord was now on his last progress towards Jerusalem. It would appear from St. Luke (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>) that in the earlier part of his journey he touched the frontier of Samaria. Putting the accounts together, we conclude that, being refused by the Samaritans, he passed eastwards along their frontier, having Galilee on his left, and Samaria on his right; and then crossed the Jordan, perhaps at Scythopolis, where was a bridge, and so entered Peraea. As Judaea and Galilee both lay west of the Jordan, this route above described would be literally coming "to the borders of Judaea and beyond Jordan." Again multitudes flocked together to him, and again he taught them. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1</a>) says that "he healed them." His miracles of healing and his teaching went hand in hand. </body></html>
