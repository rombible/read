One of the rulers of a synagogue earnestly besought Christ for a little daughter, about twelve years old, who was dying. Another cure was wrought by the way. We should do good, not only when in the house, but when we walk by the way, De 6:7. It is common with people not to apply to Christ till they have tried in vain all other helpers, and find them, as certainly they will, physicians of no value. Some run to diversions and gay company; others plunge into business, or even into intemperance; others go about to establish their own righteousness, or torment themselves by vain superstitions. Many perish in these ways; but none will ever find rest to the soul by such devices; while those whom Christ heals of the disease of sin, find in themselves an entire change for the better. As secret acts of sin, so secret acts of faith, are known to the Lord Jesus. The woman told all the truth. It is the will of Christ that his people should be comforted, and he has power to command comfort to troubled spirits. The more simply we depend on Him, and expect great things from him, the more we shall find in ourselves that he is become our salvation. Those who, by faith, are healed of their spiritual diseases, have reason to go in peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In Decapolis - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/4-25.htm">Matthew 4:25</a>.<p>How great things ... - This was the natural expression of right feeling at being cured of such a calamity.

Nor were they without order in these synagogues; they had one whom they called the ruler of the synagogue, who directed and ordered the affairs of that particular synagogue. It is more probable that <span class="ital">Jairus</span> (here mentioned) was in that sense so called, than because he was one of the court of twenty-three which the Jews are said to have had in every city. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when Jesus was passed over again,....

This may seem to some unnecessary to be added; and it may be asked, what way but by ship, or boat, could he have gone over to the other side of the sea of Galilee? To which it may be replied, there was a bridge at Chammath of Gadara (m), over an arm of this sea, over which Christ and his disciples might have passed, and have gone by land to Capernaum; so that this phrase is very necessarily and significantly used: <p>much people gathered unto him; who had before attended on his ministry in these parts, and had seen his miracles; as the casting out of an unclean spirit from a man, healing the centurion's servant, curing the man sick of the palsy, and Simon's wife's mother of a fever, and a man that had a withered hand: <p>and he was nigh unto the sea; he seems to have been at Capernaum, which was nigh unto the sea, and in the house of Matthew or Levi, whom he had called at the sea side from the receipt of custom; see <a href="/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9</a>. <p>(m) T.

St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13</a>) distinctly tells us that he had left Nazareth, and was now dwelling at Capernaum, thus fulfilling the ancient prophecy with regard to Zebulun and Nephthalim. The circumstances under which he quitted Nazareth are given by St. Luke (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-31</a>). St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>) calls Capernaum his own city. Thus as Christ ennobled Bethlehem by his birth, Nazareth by his education, and Jerusalem By his death, so he honored Capernaum by making it his ordinary residence, and the focus, so to speak, of his preaching and miracles. When Jesus returned, <span class="cmt_word">a great multitude was gathered unto him; and he was by the sea</span>. St. Luke says that the people welcomed him, for they were waiting for him. Again he placed himself by the sea, probably for the conveniences of addressing a multitude, and of relieving himself of the pressure, as before, by taking refuge in a boat. </body></html>
