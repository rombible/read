Very much is promised to our believing. If thou canst believe, it is possible that thy hard heart may be softened, thy spiritual diseases may be cured; and, weak as thou art, thou mayest be able to hold out to the end. Those that complain of unbelief, must look up to Christ for grace to help them against it, and his grace will be sufficient for them. Whom Christ cures, he cures effectually. But Satan is unwilling to be driven from those that have been long his slaves, and, when he cannot deceive or destroy the sinner, he will cause him all the terror that he can. The disciples must not think to do their work always with the same ease; some services call for more than ordinary pains.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And wheresoever - In whatever place - at home or abroad, alone or in public.<p>He teareth him - He rends, distracts, or throws him into convulsions.<p>He foameth - At the mouth, like a mad animal.
