The verbal, or all but verbal, reproduction of these verses indicates the impression which they had made on the disciples. It may be noted, however, that St. Mark omits the “Woe unto the world because of offences . . .,” which we find in St. Matthew, and that the emphatic thrice-repeated words, “Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched,” are found only in St. Mark. It should be noted, however, that in <a href="/mark/9-43.htm" title="And if your hand offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:">Mark 9:43</a>; <a href="/mark/9-45.htm" title="And if your foot offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:">Mark 9:45</a> the words “into the fire that never shall be quenched” are omitted in some of the best MSS., and that the same MSS., and others, omit both <a href="/mark/9-44.htm" title="Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.">Mark 9:44</a>; <a href="/mark/9-46.htm" title="Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.">Mark 9:46</a>, leaving <a href="/mark/9-48.htm" title="Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.">Mark 9:48</a> to stand as the only description of Gehenna.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:41-50 It is repeatedly said of the wicked, Their worm dieth not, as well as, The fire is never quenched. Doubtless, remorse of conscience and keen self-reflection are this never-dying worm. Surely it is beyond compare better to undergo all possible pain, hardship, and self-denial here, and to be happy for ever hereafter, than to enjoy all kinds of worldly pleasure for a season, and to be miserable for ever. Like the sacrifices, we must be salted with salt; our corrupt affections must be subdued and mortified by the Holy Spirit. Those that have the salt of grace, must show they have a living principle of grace in their hearts, which works out corrupt dispositions in the soul that would offend God, or our own consciences.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/18-7.htm">Matthew 18:7-9</a>.

For whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me&#8212;or, shall cause them to stumble; referring probably to the effect which such unsavory disputes as they had held would have upon the inquiring and hopeful who came in contact with them, leading to the belief that after all they were no better than others.<p>it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck&#8212;The word here is simply "millstone," without expressing of which kind. But in Mt 18:6 it is the "ass-turned" kind, far heavier than the small hand-mill turned by female slaves, as in Lu 17:35. It is of course the same which is meant here.<p>and he were cast into the sea&#8212;meaning, that if by such a death that stumbling were prevented, and so its eternal consequences averted, it would be a happy thing for them. Here follows a striking verse in Mt 18:7, "Woe unto the world because of offences!" (There will be stumblings and falls and loss of souls enough from the world's treatment of disciples, without any addition from you: dreadful will be its doom in consequence; see that ye share not in it). "For it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!" (The struggle between light and darkness will inevitably cause stumblings, but not less guilty is he who wilfully makes any to stumble).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/mark/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm" title="But whoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.">Matthew 18:6</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me,.... Whosoever shall do the, least injury to the meanest person that believes in Christ, who are mean both in their own eyes, and the eyes of others; for Christ is not speaking of little children in age, who are neither capable of believing in Christ, nor are they ready to take offence; but of such as belong to him; his disciples and followers, of whom he is speaking in the preceding verse: <p>it is better for him that a mill stone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea; and drowned there: the allusion is to the drowning of malefactors, by tying a stone, or any heavy thing about their necks, and casting them into the sea. Casaubon, and others, have shown out of Heathen writers, that this has been a practice of some nations, particularly the Grecians: Jerom says, Christ speaks according to the custom of the country; this being a punishment of the greatest crimes among the Jews; but I have no where met with it in their writings: Christ's sense is, that such who give offence to any of his ministers or people, how mean soever they may appear, shall undergo the severest punishment; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> And whosoever shall offend one of <i>these</i> little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</span><p>(10) God is such a severe avenger of offences that it is better to suffer anything else than to be an occasion of offence to any.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/mark/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/mark/9-42.htm" title="And whoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea....">Mark 9:42-48</a>.
