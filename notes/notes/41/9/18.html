Very much is promised to our believing. If thou canst believe, it is possible that thy hard heart may be softened, thy spiritual diseases may be cured; and, weak as thou art, thou mayest be able to hold out to the end. Those that complain of unbelief, must look up to Christ for grace to help them against it, and his grace will be sufficient for them. Whom Christ cures, he cures effectually. But Satan is unwilling to be driven from those that have been long his slaves, and, when he cannot deceive or destroy the sinner, he will cause him all the terror that he can. The disciples must not think to do their work always with the same ease; some services call for more than ordinary pains.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And wheresoever - In whatever place - at home or abroad, alone or in public.<p>He teareth him - He rends, distracts, or throws him into convulsions.<p>He foameth - At the mouth, like a mad animal.

Some additional particulars are given by Luke, and by our Evangelist below.

As if wounded at the exposure before such a multitude, of the weakness of His disciples' faith, which doubtless He felt as a reflection on Himself, He puts them to the blush before all, but in language fitted only to raise expectation of what He Himself would do.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/mark/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/mark/9-17.htm" title="And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought to you my son, which has a dumb spirit;">Mark 9:17</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And wheresoever he taketh him,....

Then follows a graphic description of the ensuing symptoms: spasms (<span class="greekheb">ῥήσσει</span>, a late form of <span class="greekheb">ῥήγνυμι</span>), foaming (<span class="greekheb">ἀφρίζει</span> from <span class="greekheb">ἀφρός</span>: he, the boy, foameth), grinding of the teeth (<span class="greekheb">τρίζει τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὀδ</span>.), then the final stage of motionless stupor graphically described as withering (<span class="greekheb">ξηραίνεται</span>), for which Euthy. gives as an equivalent <span class="greekheb">ἀναισθητεῖ</span>, and Weizsäcker “und wird <span class="ital">starr</span>”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/mark/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">wheresoever</span>] According to St Matthew these crises had a connection with changes of the moon (<a href="/matthew/17-15.htm" title="Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatic, and sore vexed: for often he falls into the fire, and oft into the water.">Matthew 17:15</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he teareth him</span>] Probably this manifested itself in violent convulsions, St Vitus’ dance, or the like.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">pineth away</span>] “wexip drye,” Wyclif. The word may denote either that he pined away like one, the very springs of whose life were dried up, or that in the paroxysms of his disorder his limbs became unnaturally stiff and stark. The fundamental form of his malady was epilepsy in its worst form, accompanied by dumbness, atrophy, and suicidal mania (<a href="/mark/9-22.htm" title="And often it has cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you can do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.">Mark 9:22</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/mark/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/mark/9-18.htm" title="And wherever he takes him, he tears him: and he foams, and gnashes with his teeth, and pines away: and I spoke to your disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.">Mark 9:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καταλάβῃ</span>, <span class="ital">he taketh</span> him) The term [demoniacal] possession, seems too narrow to express the idea here.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wheresoever it taketh him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">it seizeth hold of him.</span>  This is the Greek word from which comes our "catalepsy," the active form of "epilepsy." <span class="cmt_word">It teareth him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). This is doubtless the literal meaning. But there is much evidence to show that it means here "it striketh or throweth him down." This is the reudering of the Peshito Syriac, and of the Vulgate. The same interpretation is also given by Hesychius as one of the meanings of the word. St. Luke (<a href="/luke/9-39.htm">Luke 9:39</a>) describes the symptoms thus: "A spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out, and it teareth him (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) that he foameth (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely." This it will be remembered is the record of one who was himself a physician. <span class="cmt_word">He grindeth his teeth, and pineth away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), as though the springs of his life were dried up.

The form &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; is used in classical Greek of dancers beating the ground, and of beating drums. Later, in the form &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, a term of fighters: to fell, or knock down, which is the sense adopted by Rev.<p>Gnasheth with his teeth<p>Rev., grindeth.
