There is nothing to indicate its being so (how entirely different it is with <a href="/mark/7-3.htm" title="For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.">Mark 7:3</a> f.!); we should at least expect with <span class="greekheb">νηστεύοντες</span> some such general addition as <span class="greekheb">πολλά</span> (<a href="/matthew/9-14.htm" title="Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but your disciples fast not?">Matthew 9:14</a>). It is to be explained: <span class="ital">And there were the disciples of John</span>, etc., <span class="ital">engaged in fasting</span> (just at that time). This <span class="ital">suggested</span> their question. This view is followed also by Bleek and Holtzmann, the latter thinking, in the case of John’s disciples, of their fasting as mourners on account of the loss of their master,—a view for which <a href="/mark/2-19.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.">Mark 2:19</a> does not serve as proof.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔρχονται κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">Both</span>, naturally by means of representatives from among them.

In all the synoptic Gospels we find this incident following closely upon what goes before. It is not improbable that the Pharisees and the disciples of John  were fasting at the very time when Matthew gave his feast. This was not one of the fasts prescribed by the Law; had it been so, it would have been observed by our Lord. There were, however, fasts observed by the Pharisees which were not required by the Law; there were two in particular of a voluntary nature, mentioned by the Pharisee (<a href="/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a>), where he says, "I fast twice in the week." It was a custom, observed by the stricter Pharisees, but not of legal obligation. It was not correct to say, but thy disciples fast not. They fasted, no doubt, but in a different spirit; they did not fast to be seen of men - they followed the higher teaching of their Master. It is remarkable to find the disciples of John here associated with the Pharisees. John was now in prison in the fort of Machaerus. It is possible that jealousy of the increasing influence of Christ may have led John's disciples to associate themselves with the Pharisees. The point of this particular attack upon Christ was this: It is as though they said, "You claim to be a new teacher sent from God, a teacher of a more perfect religion. How is it, then, that we are fasting, while your disciples are eating and drinking?" The disciples of John more especially may have urged this out of zeal for their master. Such an unworthy zeal is too often seen in good men, who love to prefer their own leader to all others, forgetting the remonstrance of St. Paul, "While there is amongst you strife and contention, are ye not carnal, and walk after the manner of men?" <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>And of the Pharisees<p>But the of is wrong.
