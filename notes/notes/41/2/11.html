True faith and strong faith may work in various ways; but it shall be accepted and approved by Jesus Christ. Sin is the cause of all our pains and sicknesses. The way to remove the effect, is to take away the cause. Pardon of sin strikes at the root of all diseases. Christ proved his power to forgive sin, by showing his power to cure the man sick of the palsy. And his curing diseases was a figure of his pardoning sin, for sin is the disease of the soul; when it is pardoned, it is healed. When we see what Christ does in healing souls, we must own that we never saw the like. Most men think themselves whole; they feel no need of a physician, therefore despise or neglect Christ and his gospel. But the convinced, humbled sinner, who despairs of all help, excepting from the Saviour, will show his faith by applying to him without delay.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their faith - Their confidence or belief that he could heal them.<p>Son - Literally, "child." The Hebrews used the words "son" and "child" with a great latitude of signification. They were applied to children, to grandchildren, to adopted children, to any descendants, to disciples, followers, young people, and to dependents. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. In this place it denotes affection or kindness. It was a word of consolation - an endearing appellation, applied by the Saviour to the sick man to show his "compassion," to inspire confidence, and to assure him that he would heal him.<p>We never saw it on this fashion - Literally, "We never saw it so." We never saw anything like this. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.
