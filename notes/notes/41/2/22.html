By "old bottles" are meant, the Scribes and Pharisees, the whole, which needed not a physician, and the righteous, Christ came not to call; and by new wine, either the love of God, which is not shed abroad in the hearts of such persons; or the blessings of the new covenant, which are not bestowed upon them; or the Gospel, which brings an account of both, which is not received by carnal men: <p>else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: the Gospel will only fill them with rage and fury, and they will despise it, and let it go; which will be an aggravation of their sin and misery, and so will prove the savour of death unto death unto them: <p>but new wine must be put into new bottles; into the hearts of sinners, who are called to repentance, and are renewed in the Spirit of their minds; are newborn babes, that desire the sincere milk of the word, and wine of the Gospel; in these the love of God is exceeding abundant, and it comes in with full flows into their souls; all grace is made to abound towards them, and the word of Christ richly dwells in them; in whom these things remain and abide, and they themselves are saved with an everlasting salvation; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/mark/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/mark/2-22.htm" title="And no man puts new wine into old bottles: else the new wine does burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.">Mark 2:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">ῥήξει</span>.

They have not yet been baptized into the Spirit. They need tenderness and consideration. They could no more endure severe new doctrine than an old robe could the insertion of a piece of new cloth which had never passed through the hands of the fuller.” In training His disciples our Lord never took the old wine from them till they were capable of relishing the new. In Romans 14 we have the best practical commentary on His words.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - "Bottles" in this verse is better rendered literally <span class="accented">wine-skins</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And no man putteth new wine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">into</span> <span class="cmt_word">old wine-skins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine perisheth, and the skins; but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>). The sense is this: New wine, in the process of fermentation, will burst old bottles made of wine-skins not strong enough to resist the strength of the fermenting fluid; so that there is a twofold loss - both that of the bottles and that of the wine. And therefore new wine must be poured into bottles made of fresh wine-skins, which, by reason of their strength and toughness, shall be able to resist the fermenting energy of the new wine. And by these very apt illustrations our Lord teaches us that it is a vain thing to attempt to mingle together the spiritual freedom of the gospel with the old ceremonies of the Law. To attempt to engraft the living spiritual energy of the gospel upon the old legal ceremonial now about to pass away, would be as fatal a thing as to piece an old garment with new material, or to put new wine into old wineskins. There is here, therefore, a valuable lesson for the Christian Church, namely, to treat new converts with gentleness and consideration. </body></html>
