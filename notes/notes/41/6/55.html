And no difficulties can hinder Christ's appearance for his people, when the set time is come. He silenced their fears, by making himself known to them. Our fears are soon satisfied, if our mistakes are set right, especially our mistakes as to Christ. Let the disciples have their Master with them, and all is well. It is for want of rightly understanding Christ's former works, that we view his present works as if there never were the like before. If Christ's ministers now could cure people's bodily diseases, what multitudes would flock after them! It is sad to think how much more most care about their bodies than about their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They knew him - They "recollected" Jesus, because he had been there before and worked miracles.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>55. and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was&#8212;At this period of our Lord's ministry the popular enthusiasm in His favor was at its height.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/mark/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/mark/6-53.htm" title="And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.">Mark 6:53</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And ran through that whole region round about,....
