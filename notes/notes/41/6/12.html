It is not said how long they were out on this their first expedition; but it is probable they spent a considerable time in it, for Luke says, <a href="/luke/9-6.htm" title="And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.">Luke 9:6</a>, <span class="ital">they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:7-13 Though the apostles were conscious to themselves of great weakness, and expected no wordly advantage, yet, in obedience to their Master, and in dependence upon his strength, they went out.

They executed both the trusts which Christ had reposed in them, preaching the gospel, and by miraculous operations confirming the doctrine which they brought to be from heaven. John Baptist, and Christ, and the twelve all preached the same doctrine, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Repent; </span> that is, turn from your former sinful courses, which if men do not, Christ’s coming will profit them nothing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And anointed with oil many that were sick.</span> James directed this <span class="ital">anointing with oil</span> also <span class="ital">in the name of the Lord.</span> It is disputed amongst learned men whether this anointing with oil was the using of oil as a medicine, having a natural virtue, (for it is certain in that country there were oils that were of great natural force for healing), or only as sacramental and symbolical, signifying what they did was from that unction of the Spirit of Christ which they had received, not by their own power or virtue, and representing by anointing with oil, that is an excellent lenitive, the refreshing and recovery of the diseased. But it is not probable, considering that our Lord sent the disciples to confirm the doctrine of the gospel which they preached, that he should direct them in these operations to use means of a natural force and efficacy, which had at least much abated of the miracle; besides, James bids them anoint the sick with oil <span class="ital">in the name of the Lord.</span> So as they doubtless used oil as symbolical, testifying that what they did was not by their own power and virtue. Nor did the apostles always use this rite in healing. Peter and John used it not in their healing the lame man, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/3-6.htm" title="Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.">Acts 3:6</a></span>: <span class="ital">In the name of Jesus Christ</span> (say they) <span class="ital">rise up and walk.</span> He declareth the use of it, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/3-16.htm" title="And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.">Acts 3:16</a></span>, only to show, that Christ’s name through faith in his name was that which made the lame man whole. So that it being both a free rite, which they sometimes used and sometimes not, and a rite annexed to miraculous operations, to declare the effect was from Christ, not from their power, in a miraculous and extraordinary, not in a natural and ordinary, way of operation, the necessity of the use of it still is very impertinently urged by some, and as impertinently quoted by others, to prove the lawfulness of ritual impositions. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they went out,.... From that part of the country where they then were, some one way, and some another, two by two, with these instructions, and according to these directions; in order to preach the word, and work miracles, in the several parts where they were sent: <p>and preached that men should repent; both of the evil practices which they were guilty of, and of the bad principles they had imbibed, and change both their sentiments and their conduct: this, they exhorted them to, as John the Baptist, and Christ, had done before, who set out in their ministry the same way; and these, as they did also, preached the Gospel, and the things appertaining to the kingdom of God, and Gospel dispensation, and called upon men to believe them. For faith and repentance went together in Christ's ministry, <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>, and so they did in the ministry of John, the Baptist, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/19-4.htm">Acts 19:4</a>, and in the ministry of the apostles, <a href="/acts/20-21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>. When they preached that men should repent, it does not from hence follow, that they have a power to repent of themselves: for such is the condition of men by nature, that they neither see their need of repentance, and their hearts are so hard and obdurate, that they cannot work themselves up to it, or work it in them, and exercise it; this requires the powerful and efficacious grace of God to produce it, and it is a gift of his grace; and if he gives the means, and not the grace of repentance itself, it will never appear: but the apostles preaching that men should repent, shows that they were in such a state as to need it; and how necessary it was for them to have it, seeing without it they must all perish: and such a ministration is proper, to awaken the minds of men to a sense of the need of it, and to direct them to Christ the Saviour, who is exalted to give it, as well as the remission of sins. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They preached that men should repent</span>.
