And no difficulties can hinder Christ's appearance for his people, when the set time is come. He silenced their fears, by making himself known to them. Our fears are soon satisfied, if our mistakes are set right, especially our mistakes as to Christ. Let the disciples have their Master with them, and all is well. It is for want of rightly understanding Christ's former works, that we view his present works as if there never were the like before. If Christ's ministers now could cure people's bodily diseases, what multitudes would flock after them! It is sad to think how much more most care about their bodies than about their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22-36</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>51. And he went up unto them into the ship&#8212;John (Joh 6:21) says, "Then they willingly received him into the ship"&#8212;or rather, "Then were they willing to receive Him" (with reference to their previous terror); but implying also a glad welcome, their first fears now converted into wonder and delight. "And immediately," adds the beloved disciple, "they were at the land whither they went," or "were bound." This additional miracle, for as such it is manifestly related, is recorded by the fourth Evangelist alone. As the storm was suddenly calmed, so the little bark&#8212;propelled by the secret power of the Lord of nature now sailing in it&#8212;glided through the now unruffled waters, and, while they were wrapt in wonder at what had happened, not heeding their rapid motion, was found at port, to their still further surprise.<p>"Then are they glad, because at rest<p>And quiet now they be;<p>So to the haven He them brings<p>Which they desired to see."<p>Matthew (Mt 14:33) says, "Then they that were in the ship came [that is, ere they got to land] and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth Thou art the Son of God."

Not only were they “sore amazed,” but “beyond measure.” Never had the disciples been so impressed by the majesty of Christ as they were now in consequence of this miracle. St Matthew, <a href="/matthew/14-33.htm" title="Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth you are the Son of God.">Matthew 14:33</a>, tells us that the impression made extended also to those who were with them in the ship, i. e. probably the crew.

Nor was the impression confined to them alone. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/14-33.htm">Matthew 14:33</a>) tells us that they who were in the boat came and worshipped him. They felt, at least for the 'moment, that they were brought into awful nearness to One whose "way is in the sea," and whose "path is in the great waters," and whose "footsteps are not known."
