Herod did many of those things which John in his preaching taught him; but it is not enough to do many things, we must have respect to all the commandments. Herod respected John, till he touched him in his Herodias. Thus many love good preaching, if it keep far away from their beloved sin. But it is better that sinners persecute ministers now for faithfulness, than curse them eternally for unfaithfulness. The ways of God are unsearchable; but we may be sure he never can be at a loss to repay his servants for what they endure or lose for his sake. Death could not come so as to surprise this holy man; and the triumph of the wicked was short.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For Herod feared John - That is, he stood in awe of him on account of his sanctity, and his boldness and fearlessness in reproving sin.<p>Knowing that he was a just man and an Holy - A holy, pious, upright, honest man - a man who would not be afraid of him, or afraid to speak his real sentiments.<p>And observed him - Margin, "kept him, or saved him." This does not mean that he "observed" or obeyed his teachings, but that he kept him in safe custody in order to preserve him from the machinations of Herodias. He was willing to show his respect for John, and to secure him from danger, and even to do "many things" which might indicate respect for him - at least, to do so much as to guard him from his enemies.<p>And did many things - But he did not do the thing which was demanded of him - to break off from his sins. He attempted to make a compromise with his conscience. He still loved his sins, and did "other" things which he supposed might be accepted in the place of putting away, as he ought, the wife of his brother - the polluted and adulterous woman with whom he lived. Perhaps he treated John kindly, or spoke well of him, or aided him in his wants, and attempted in this way to silence his rebukes and destroy his faithfulness. This was probably before John was imprisoned. So sinners often treat ministers kindly, and do much to make them comfortable, and hear them gladly, while they are still unwilling to do the thing which is demanded of them - to repent and believe the gospel. They expect that their kind attentions will be accepted in the place of what God demands - repentance and the forsaking of their sins. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

But he had not anticipated for his guests the rare luxury of seeing a princess—his own niece, a granddaughter of Herod the Great and of Mariamne, a descendant, therefore, of Simon the High Priest, and the great line of Maccabæan princes—a princess, who afterwards became the wife of a tetrarch, and the mother of a king—honouring them by degrading herself into a scenic dancer.” Farrar’s <span class="ital">Life of Christ</span>, I. 391.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/mark/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/mark/6-22.htm" title="And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatever you will, and I will give it you.">Mark 6:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ κορασίῳ</span>, <span class="ital">the king unto the damsel</span>) An antithesis.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The words should run thus<span class="cmt_word">: And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f29;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>.
