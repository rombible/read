Christ notices the frights of some, and the toils of others of his disciples, and provides rest for those that are tired, and refuge for those that are terrified. The people sought the spiritual food of Christ's word, and then he took care that they should not want bodily food. If Christ and his disciples put up with mean things, surely we may. And this miracle shows that Christ came into the world, not only to restore, but to preserve and nourish spiritual life; in him there is enough for all that come. None are sent empty away from Christ but those who come to him full of themselves. Though Christ had bread enough at command, he teaches us not to waste any of God's bounties, remembering how many are in want.

See the notes at <a href="/matthew/14-16.htm">Matthew 14:16</a>. As the disciples had a common purse in which they carried their little property, consisting of the donations of their friends and money to be given to the poor (compare <a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-8.htm">Matthew 26:8-9</a>; <a href="/luke/8-3.htm">Luke 8:3</a>), it is not improbable that they had at this time about this sum in their possession. Philip - for it was he who asked the question <a href="/john/6-7.htm">John 6:7</a> - asked, with a mixture of wonder and agitation, whether they should take all their little property and spend it on a single meal? And even if we should, said he, it would not be sufficient to satisfy such a multitude. It was implied in this that, in his view, they could not provide for them if they wished to, and that it would be better to send them away than to attempt it.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39.

It would not be green in that district after April. Thus St. Mark's account of the state of the grass at that time (an account evidently repeated from an eye-witness) coincides with the account of St. John, who says that "the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was at hand" (<a href="/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>By companies (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;)<p>Peculiar to Mark. The Jewish dining-room was arranged like the Roman: three tables forming three sides of a square, and with divans or couches following the outside line of the tables. The open end of the square admitted the servants who waited at table. This explains the arrangement of the multitude here described by Mark. The people sat down, literally, in table-companies, arranged like guests at table; some companies of a hundred and some of fifty, in squares or oblongs open at one end, so that the disciples could pass along the inside and distribute the loaves<p>Green<p>Mark only. </body></html>
