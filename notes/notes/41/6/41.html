Christ notices the frights of some, and the toils of others of his disciples, and provides rest for those that are tired, and refuge for those that are terrified. The people sought the spiritual food of Christ's word, and then he took care that they should not want bodily food. If Christ and his disciples put up with mean things, surely we may. And this miracle shows that Christ came into the world, not only to restore, but to preserve and nourish spiritual life; in him there is enough for all that come. None are sent empty away from Christ but those who come to him full of themselves. Though Christ had bread enough at command, he teaches us not to waste any of God's bounties, remembering how many are in want. We may, some time, need the fragments that we now throw away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In ranks - Literally, in the form of square beds in a garden.

The taking of the food into the hands would seem to have been a formal act before the" blessing," or "giving of thanks," for it. Probably our Lord used the ordinary form of benediction. This is one amongst other instances showing the fitness and propriety of" grace before meat." In considering the miraculous action which followed the benediction, our reason is baffled. It eludes our grasp. It is best simply to behold in this multiplying of the food, both the bread and the fishes, an act of Divine omnipotence; not indeed now, as at the beginning, a creation out of nothing, for here there was the nucleus of the five loaves and the two fishes, but an act of creative development of the food in its best kind; for all the works of God are perfect, <span class="cmt_word">He gave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) would be better rendered, <span class="accented">he was giving.</span> It was in his hands that the miracle was wrought, and the food continually multiplied. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Brake and gave (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>The verbs are in different tenses; the former in the aorist, the latter in the imperfect.
