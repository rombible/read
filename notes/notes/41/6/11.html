Mark omits that direction, perhaps, because he was writing for the "Gentiles," and the direction might create unnecessary difficulty or offence.

This clause is omitted in some copies, and so it is in the Vulgate Latin version, and may perhaps be transcribed from Mat_. 10:15; see Gill on <a href="/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a>; though it is in most copies, and is read in the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions. It is certain that there will be a day of judgment; it is fixed, God has appointed it, though it is not known by men or angels: this will be universal; all must appear in it before God, the judge of all, Jews and Gentiles; such who have lived in the earlier ages of time, as well as those that will live nearer that day; such who have only had the dim light of nature to guide them, and also who have been favoured with the Gospel revelation: the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrha, though they have had the judgments of God upon them in this world, they will not escape the righteous judgment of God hereafter; things are not over with them, there is still a reckoning to be made, an account to pass with them; their full punishment is not yet executed, even though they have been suffering the vengeance of eternal fire; their bodies must be raised, and they must receive for the things which they have done in them, and which they have so dreadfully and unnaturally abused; and yet, as vile sinners as they have been, and as sore a punishment as they are worthy of, their punishment will be milder and more tolerable, than that of the inhabitants of such places, where the Gospel has been preached, and they have despised and rejected it.

The dust of <span class="ital">their</span> roads adhering to your feet, shake it off and leave it behind you. <a href="/context/mark/6-12.htm" title="And they went out, and preached that men should repent....">Mark 6:12-13</a> report the carrying out of the mission by the Twelve through preaching and healing.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα μετανοῶσιν</span>: the burden of their preaching was, Repent. Luke has the more evangelic term, <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγελιζόμενοι</span>. The other aspect of their ministry is summed up in the expulsion of many demons, and the cure of many suffering from minor ailments, <span class="greekheb">ἀρρώστους</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/mark/6-5.htm" title="And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands on a few sick folk, and healed them.">Mark 6:5</a>). In Mark’s account the powers of the Twelve appear much more restricted than in Matthew (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/mark/10-8.htm" title="And they two shall be one flesh: so then they are no more two, but one flesh.">Mark 10:8</a>). The use of oil in healing (<span class="greekheb">ἐλαίῳ</span>) is to be noted. Some have regarded this as a mark of late date (Baur). Others (Weiss, Schanz) view it as a primitive practice (<span class="ital">vide</span> <a href="/james/5-14.htm" title="Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:">Jam 5:14</a>). Many conjectural opinions have been expressed as to the function or significance of the oil. According to Lightfoot and Schöttgen it was much used at the time by physicians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The instructions to the Twelve present an interesting problem in criticism and comparative exegesis. It is not improbable that two versions of these existed and have been drawn upon by the synoptists, one in the <span class="ital">Logia</span> of Matthew, reproduced, Weiss thinks, substantially in Luke 10 (mission of Seventy), the other in Mark 6, used (Weiss) in <a href="/context/luke/9-1.htm" title="Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases....">Luke 9:1-6</a>. Matthew, according to the same critic, mixes the two. Similarly Holtzmann, who, however, differs from Weiss in thinking the two versions entirely independent. Weiss reconstructs the original version of the <span class="ital">Logia</span> thus:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1<a href="/matthew/9-38.htm" title="Pray you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.">Matthew 9:38</a> = <a href="/luke/10-2.htm" title="Therefore said he to them, The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few: pray you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.">Luke 10:2</a>, prayer for labourers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2<a href="/luke/10-3.htm" title="Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.">Luke 10:3</a> = go forth, I send you as lambs among wolves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3<a href="/context/matthew/10-5.htm" title="These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not:...">Matthew 10:5-6</a>, go not to Samaria, but to Israel only.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4<a href="/context/luke/10-4.htm" title="Carry neither purse, nor money, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way....">Luke 10:4-11</a>, detailed instructions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/mark/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">the dust under your feet</span>] For instances of the carrying out of this command, compare the conduct of St Paul at Antioch in Pisidia, <a href="/acts/13-51.htm" title="But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.">Acts 13:51</a>, and at Corinth, <a href="/acts/18-6.htm" title="And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said to them, Your blood be on your own heads; I am clean; from now on I will go to the Gentiles.">Acts 18:6</a>. The action must be regarded as symbolical of a complete cessation of all fellowship, and a renunciation of all further responsibility. It was customary with Pharisees when they entered Judæa from a Gentile land, to do this in token of renunciation of all communion with heathenism; those who rejected the Apostolic message were to be looked upon as those who placed themselves beyond the pale of fellowship and communion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shake off the dust</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) literally, <span class="accented">the soil -</span> that is under your feet<span class="cmt_word">.</span> St. Matthew and St. Luke use the word (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) "dust." A very significant action. The dust was shaken off as an evidence of the toil and labour of the apostles in journeying to them. It witnessed that they had entered the city and had delivered message, and that their message had been refused. The very dust, therefore, of the place was a defilement to them. "It shall be more tolerable," etc. This clause is omitted by the best authorities; it was probably copied from St. Matthew. </body></html>
