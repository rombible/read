They had not drawn from the miracle of the Loaves the conclusion which they might have drawn, that all natural forces were subject to their Master’s sovereignty. The personal connection of the Evangelist with the Apostle may, perhaps, also account for his omission of the narrative which St. Matthew gives of his rashness and failing faith.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:45-56 The church is often like a ship at sea, tossed with tempests, and not comforted: we may have Christ for us, yet wind and tide against us; but it is a comfort to Christ's disciples in a storm, that their Master is in the heavenly mount, interceding for them. And no difficulties can hinder Christ's appearance for his people, when the set time is come. He silenced their fears, by making himself known to them. Our fears are soon satisfied, if our mistakes are set right, especially our mistakes as to Christ. Let the disciples have their Master with them, and all is well. It is for want of rightly understanding Christ's former works, that we view his present works as if there never were the like before. If Christ's ministers now could cure people's bodily diseases, what multitudes would flock after them! It is sad to think how much more most care about their bodies than about their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They considered not the miracle of the loaves - They did not remember or call to mind the "power" which Jesus had shown in feeding the five thousand by a miracle, and that, having done that, he had power also to save them from the storm.<p>Their heart was hardened - Their "mind" was dull to perceive it. This does not mean that they were "opposed" to Jesus, or that they had what we denominate "hardness of heart," but simply that they were slow to perceive his power. They did not quickly learn, as they ought to have done, that he had all power, and could therefore allay the storm. The word "heart" is frequently used in this sense.

The glory of Christ, which he manifested, and showed forth in his miracles, was not so clearly and fully discerned, attended to, and acknowledged by them, at it might reasonably be thought it would; for notwithstanding these miracles, which they daily saw, they stood in need of divine illuminations, that the darkness of their minds being removed, they might behold the glory of Christ, as the glory of the only begotten of the Father. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For they <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> considered not <i>the miracle</i> of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.</span><p>(z) Either they did not perceive, or had not well considered that miracle of the five loaves, to the point that the virtue of Christ was just as strange to them as if they had not been present at that miracle which was done just a little before.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/mark/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/mark/6-52.htm" title="For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.">Mark 6:52</a> reflects on the astonishment of the Twelve as blameworthy in view of the recent feeding of the multitude.
