Christ notices the frights of some, and the toils of others of his disciples, and provides rest for those that are tired, and refuge for those that are terrified. The people sought the spiritual food of Christ's word, and then he took care that they should not want bodily food. If Christ and his disciples put up with mean things, surely we may. And this miracle shows that Christ came into the world, not only to restore, but to preserve and nourish spiritual life; in him there is enough for all that come. None are sent empty away from Christ but those who come to him full of themselves. Though Christ had bread enough at command, he teaches us not to waste any of God's bounties, remembering how many are in want.

The Twelve on Their Return, Having Reported the Success of Their Mission, Jesus Crosses the Sea of Galilee with Them, Teaches the People, and Miraculously Feeds Them to the Number of Five Thousand&#8212;He Sends His Disciples by Ship Again to the Western Side, While He Himself Returns Afterwards Walking on the Sea&#8212;Incidents on Landing.

And the apostles gathered themselves together&#8212;probably at Capernaum, on returning from their mission (Mr 6:7-13).<p>and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught&#8212;Observe the various reasons He had for crossing to the other side. First, Matthew (Mt 14:13) says, that "when Jesus heard" of the murder of His faithful forerunner&#8212;from those attached disciples of his who had taken up his body and laid it in a sepulchre (see on [1446]Mr 6:29)&#8212;"He departed by ship into a desert place apart"; either to avoid some apprehended consequences to Himself, arising from the Baptist's death (Mt 10:23), or more probably to be able to indulge in those feelings which that affecting event had doubtless awakened, and to which the bustle of the multitude around Him was very unfavorable. Next, since He must have heard the report of the Twelve with the deepest interest, and probably with something of the emotion which He experienced on the return of the Seventy (see on [1447]Lu 10:17-22), He sought privacy for undisturbed reflection on this begun preaching and progress of His kingdom. Once more, He was wearied with the multitude of "comers and goers"&#8212;depriving Him even of leisure enough to take His food&#8212;and wanted rest: "Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while," &c. Under the combined influence of all these considerations, our Lord sought this change.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/mark/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 31-33. Matthew makes the cause of this motion of our Saviour’s to have been his receiving the report of Herod’s dealing with John the Baptist, as we often find him yielding to the fury of his adversaries. Mark assigns another reason, (as there may be several reasons or motives of and to the same action or motion), viz. that both himself and his apostles might have a little rest. The place which he chose for his recess is called <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">a desert place, </span> not because it was wholly not inhabited, but very thinly inhabited.

It was a place on the other side of the water, for they went to it by ship. But this water was but a lake, though called the sea of Tiberias, for the people, fetching a little further compass about, went thither on foot, and outwent the motion of the ship. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto them,....
