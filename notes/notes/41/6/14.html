In addition an interesting illustration of what is stated as to Herod’s belief may be given from the Roman poet Persius. He is describing in one of his satires (v. 180-188) the effect of superstitious fear in marring all the pleasures of the pride of luxurious pomp, and this is the illustration which he chooses:—<p>“But when the feast of Herod’s birthday comes,<p>And, through the window, smoke-besmeared, the lamps,<p>Set in due order, wreaths of violets round,<p>Pour out their oily fumes, and in the dish<p>Of red-clay porcelain tail of tunny swims,<p>And the white flagon bellies out with wine,<p>Thou mov’st thy lips, yet speak’st not, and in fear<p>Thou keep’st the Sabbath of the circumcised,<p>And then there rise dark spectres of the dead,<p>And the cracked egg-shell bodes of coming ill . . .<p>It is clear that a description so minute in its details must have been photographed, as it were, from some actual incident, and could not have been merely a general picture of the prevalence of Jewish superstition in Roman society. Commentators on the Roman poet have, however, failed to find any clue to the incident thus graphically related. Can we, starting from what the Gospels tell us as to the character of Antipas, picture to ourselves a scene that explains his strange mysterious hints? In A.D. 39 Herod Agrippa I., the nephew of the Tetrarch, obtained the title of king from the Emperor Caligula. Prompted by the ambition of Herodias, Antipas went with her to Rome, to seek, by lavish gifts and show of state, the same distinction. The emissaries of Agrippa, however, thwarted his schemes, and he was deposed and sent into exile at Lugdunum. May we not conjecture that the same superstitious terror which made him say that John the Baptist was risen from the dead followed him there also? “Herod’s birthday” again comes round, and there is a great feast, and instead of the “lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee,” senators and courtiers and philosophers are there, and, lo! there is a pause, and the Tetrarch rises in silent horror—as Macbeth at the apparition of Banquo’s ghost—and he sees the dark form shaking its gory locks, and his lips move in speechless terror, and he “does many things” on the coming Sabbath, and the thing becomes a by-word and a proverb in the upper circles of Roman society, and is noted in the schools of the Stoics as an illustration of what superstition can effect. The view thus stated is, of course, not more than a conjecture, but it at least explains phenomena. Persius died, at the age of twenty-eight or thirty, in A.D. 62, and may well therefore have heard the matter talked of in his boyhood.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/mark/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/mark/6-14.htm" title="And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him....">Mark 6:14-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">And King Herod </span>(the tetrarch; see notes on <a href="/matthew/2-1.htm" title="Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,">Matthew 2:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/14-1.htm" title="At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,">Matthew 14:1</a>) <span class="ital">heard of him — </span>While the apostles were making their circuit about the country, proclaiming everywhere the glories of their great Master, and working miracles in his name, information concerning him and his marvellous works came to the ears of King Herod; <span class="ital">for his name was spread abroad </span>— And reached many places far more distant than the court of Herod, <a href="/context/matthew/4-24.htm" title="And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought to him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them....">Matthew 4:24-25</a>. <span class="ital">And he said, that John the Baptist was risen from the dead </span>— This his own guilty conscience suggested, and he could not forbear speaking of it to those that were about him.

Herod did many of those things which John in his preaching taught him; but it is not enough to do many things, we must have respect to all the commandments. Herod respected John, till he touched him in his Herodias. Thus many love good preaching, if it keep far away from their beloved sin. But it is better that sinners persecute ministers now for faithfulness, than curse them eternally for unfaithfulness. The ways of God are unsearchable; but we may be sure he never can be at a loss to repay his servants for what they endure or lose for his sake.

Mark calleth him <span class="ital">Herod the king, </span> whom Mark and Luke called <span class="ital">tetrarch.</span> Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, but under that title he exercised a regal power within his province. The whole history teacheth us several things. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The notion of a faithful minister. He is one that dares to fell the greatest persons of what they do contrary to the plain law of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. It also teacheth us the malice of souls debauched with lust. It was not enough for Herodias to have John in prison, where he could do her no great prejudice, she must also have his head cut off. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. The ill influence of corrupt persons in princes’ courts. Herod had in his government appeared no cruel, bloody man. Our Saviour in great quiet preached the gospel, and wrought miracles for the confirmation of it, within Herod’s jurisdiction; in Galilee we find no inquiry made by Herod after him, no calling him in question: and for John the Baptist, he did not only tolerate him, but brought him to his court, reverenced him as a just and holy man, did many things upon his instructions, <span class="ital">heard him gladly; </span> but by the influence of Herodias (his courtiers being at least silent in the case) he is prevailed with to put him to death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. The arts likewise of these persons are observable; they take the advantage of his jollity on his birthday, when in the excess of mirth it was likely he would be more easy and complying to grant their requests. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. We may also from hence learn the mischief of rash oaths and general promises, especially when they flow from souls ignorant of the law of God; for had Herod understood any thing of that, he could not have thought that his oath could have been the bond of iniquity, or obliged him to any sinful act. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6. We may also understand the mercy of God to that people who are governed by laws, whose lives and liberties do not depend upon the will of any. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>7. Lastly, we may observe how far men may go, and yet be far enough from any saving grace. They may have a reverence for godly ministers, they may hear them gladly, they may do many things. The hypocrite hath some principal lust in which he must be gratified, and cannot bear a reproof as to that. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And king Herod heard of him,....

Antipas heard that the disciples of Jesus preached and did such miracles. Then comes the explanation assigning the reason for this: <span class="ital">for His name became known, i.e.</span> for it did not remain a secret, that these itinerant teachers and miracle-workers were working as empowered <span class="ital">by Jesus</span>. Comp. also Holtzmann, p. 83. According to Grotius, Griesbach, and Paulus (also Rettig in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1838, p. 797), the object of <span class="greekheb">ἤκουσεν</span> is: <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">φαν</span>. <span class="greekheb">γ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐγέν</span>. would be parenthetic. This is at variance with the simple style of the evangelist. According to de Wette, Mark has been led by the alleged parenthesis <span class="greekheb">φανερὸν</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> to forget the object, so that merely something indefinite, perhaps <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span>, would have to be supplied. But what carelessness! and still the question remains, to what the <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> applies. Ewald (comp. Bengel) takes <span class="greekheb">φανερὸν</span> … <span class="greekheb">προφητῶν</span> as a parenthesis, which was intended to explain <span class="ital">what</span> Herod heard, and holds that in <a href="/mark/6-16.htm" title="But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.">Mark 6:16</a> the <span class="greekheb">ἤκουσεν</span> of <a href="/mark/6-14.htm" title="And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Mark 6:14</a> is again taken up (that instead of <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγεν</span> in <a href="/mark/6-14.htm" title="And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Mark 6:14</a> <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγον</span> is to be read, which Hilgenfeld also prefers; see the critical remarks).

(<a href="/mark/14-1.htm" title="After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.">Mark 14:1</a>), and St Luke (<a href="/luke/9-7.htm" title="Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;">Luke 9:7</a>), style him more exactly “the tetrarch.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his name</span>] It is peculiar to St Mark that he connects the watching observation of Herod Antipas with the work of Christ as extended by the preaching and miracles of His Apostles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">was risen from the dead</span>] Herod’s guilty conscience triumphed over his Sadducean profession of belief that there is no resurrection.

The word "tetrarch" properly means the sovereign or ruler of the fourth part of a territory. He is known as Herod Anti-pus, son of Herod the Great, who had appointed him "tetrarch" of Galilee and Peraea. Herod Antipas had married the daughter of Arctas, King of Arabia, but deserted her for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. <span class="cmt_word">John the Baptist is risen from the dead</span>; that is, "is risen in the person of Jesus Christ." St. Luke. (<a href="/luke/9-7.htm">Luke 9:7</a>) says that at first Herod was "much perplexed (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>)" "about him. At length, however, as he heard more and more of the fame of Christ's miracles, he came to the conclusion that our Lord was none other than John the Baptist risen again. Such is the opinion of St. Chrysostom, St. Augustine, and others. At that time the views of Pythagoras respecting the transmigration of souls were generally current, and probably influenced the troubled mind of Herod. He had put to death an innocent and holy man; and it is a high testimony to the worth of the Baptist that, under the reproaches of a guilty conscience, Herod should have come to the conclusion that he had risen from the dead, thus probably giving the lie to his own opinions as a Sadducee; and terrified lest the Baptist should now  avenge his own murder. "What a great thing," exclaims St. Chrysostom," is virtue! for Herod fears him, even though dead." It should not be forgotten that this is the same Herod who set Jesus at nought and mocked him, when Pilate sent him to him, in the hope of relieving himself of the terrible responsibility of condemning one whom he knew to be innocent. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Was spread abroad<p>"But for the rumor, Herod would not have known of him.

As Dr. Morison observes, "A snatch of Herod's theology and philosophy." He knew that John wrought no miracles when alive, but he thought that death had put him into connection with the unseen world, and enabled him to wield its powers. </body></html>
