Herod did many of those things which John in his preaching taught him; but it is not enough to do many things, we must have respect to all the commandments. Herod respected John, till he touched him in his Herodias. Thus many love good preaching, if it keep far away from their beloved sin. But it is better that sinners persecute ministers now for faithfulness, than curse them eternally for unfaithfulness. The ways of God are unsearchable; but we may be sure he never can be at a loss to repay his servants for what they endure or lose for his sake. Death could not come so as to surprise this holy man; and the triumph of the wicked was short.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this account of the death of John the Baptist fully explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1-12</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

For this outspoken faithfulness he was flung into prison, probably in the castle of Machærus or “the Black Fortress,” which Herod’s father had built in one of the most abrupt wâdys to the east of the Dead Sea, to overawe the wild Arab tribes of the neighbourhood. Though originally in the possession of Aretas, Herod had probably seized the fortress after the departure of his first wife to her father’s stronghold at Petra (Jos. <span class="ital">Ant</span>. xviii. 5. 2).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For John said unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">Herod.</span> The Greek tense (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>) implies more than the simple expression, "he said;" it implies a repeated warning. We learn from St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/14-5.htm">Matthew 14:5</a>) that Herod would have killed John before, but he feared the people. Here St. Mark says <span class="cmt_word">that Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not; for Herod feared John</span>. There is no contradiction between the two evangelists. The case appears to have been this: that at first Herod desired to put John to death, because John had reproved him on account of Herodias. But by degrees John gained an influence over Herod by the force of his character, and by his holy life and teaching. </body></html>
