Christ notices the frights of some, and the toils of others of his disciples, and provides rest for those that are tired, and refuge for those that are terrified. The people sought the spiritual food of Christ's word, and then he took care that they should not want bodily food. If Christ and his disciples put up with mean things, surely we may. And this miracle shows that Christ came into the world, not only to restore, but to preserve and nourish spiritual life; in him there is enough for all that come. None are sent empty away from Christ but those who come to him full of themselves. Though Christ had bread enough at command, he teaches us not to waste any of God's bounties, remembering how many are in want. We may, some time, need the fragments that we now throw away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two hundred pennyworth of bread - About twenty-eight dollars, or 6 British pounds. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/14-16.htm">Matthew 14:16</a>. As the disciples had a common purse in which they carried their little property, consisting of the donations of their friends and money to be given to the poor (compare <a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-8.htm">Matthew 26:8-9</a>; <a href="/luke/8-3.htm">Luke 8:3</a>), it is not improbable that they had at this time about this sum in their possession. Philip - for it was he who asked the question <a href="/john/6-7.htm">John 6:7</a> - asked, with a mixture of wonder and agitation, whether they should take all their little property and spend it on a single meal? And even if we should, said he, it would not be sufficient to satisfy such a multitude. It was implied in this that, in his view, they could not provide for them if they wished to, and that it would be better to send them away than to attempt it.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38.

(Joh 6:8, 9). Probably this was the whole stock of provisions then at the command of the disciples&#8212;no more than enough for one meal to them&#8212;and entrusted for the time to this lad.

The comparative  value of the two kinds of bread is given in <a href="/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a>. "A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny." The psalmist alludes to the greater excellence of wheat flour: "He would have fed them also with the finest wheat flour" (<a href="/psalms/81-16.htm">Psalm 81:16</a>). </body></html>
