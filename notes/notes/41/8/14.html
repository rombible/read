Alas! what cause we have to lament for those around us, who destroy themselves and others by their perverse and obstinate unbelief, and enmity to the gospel! When we forget the works of God, and distrust him, we should chide ourselves severely, as Christ here reproves his disciples.

We met with this whole history, with some additions, in <span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/16-5.htm" title="And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread....">Matthew 16:5-12</a></span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/16-5.htm" title="And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.">Matthew 16:5</a>"</span>, and following verses to <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/16-12.htm" title="Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.">Matthew 16:12</a></span>. It teacheth us both a lesson of human frailty, and what is our Christian duty: of our frailty, in not considering the works of the Lord for us, so as to make any use of them for the time to come. God doth his great works of providence to he had in remembrance, and that not only with respect to himself, that he might be glorified by us upon the remembrance of them, and this not only by our rejoicing in him, but also by our trusting in him, and not desponding under such like difficulties as God by any of them hath delivered us from. And also with respect to our duty, that we might in present exigences relieve ourselves from former experiences: and if we do not thus conceive of God’s dispensations, we do not perceive, nor understand, the meaning and will of God in them; though we have eyes we see not, though we have ears we hear not, and in remembering we remember not, our remembrance is of no benefit, no advantage at all unto us. Our Saviour, indeed, did not at all speak here of bodily bread; though he did bid them beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Herod, he spake to them about the doctrine of the Pharisees, and so Matthew tells us they (after this reproof) considered, though he (after his accustomed manner) spake to them under a parabolical expression. Saith he: What though you have forgotten to bring bread, do not you know, have not I, by two miraculous operations, taught you that I am able to furnish you with bread, though you have none, or such a quantity as is very insufficient? God expects of us that we should so keep in mind his former dispensations of providence to us, under straits and difficulties, as to trust in him when his providence brings us again into the like difficulties, yet not declining the use of any reasonable and just means for providing for ourselves. Thus David knew, and understood, that God had delivered him from the lion and the bear, while going against Goliath, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/17-31.htm" title="And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him....">1 Samuel 17:31-58</a></span>; he made it a ground of his confidence: so also <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/116-8.htm" title="For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.">Psalm 116:8</a></span>: and Paul, when he concluded God would deliver because he had delivered.
