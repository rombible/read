Christ refused to answer their demand. If they will not be convinced, they shall not. Alas! what cause we have to lament for those around us, who destroy themselves and others by their perverse and obstinate unbelief, and enmity to the gospel! When we forget the works of God, and distrust him, we should chide ourselves severely, as Christ here reproves his disciples. How is it that we so often mistake his meaning, disregard his warnings, and distrust his providence?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees - See <a href="/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6</a>.<p>Of Herod - Of the Herodians - of Herod and his followers. Matthew, instead of "Herod," has "the Sadducees." It is not improbably that he cautioned them against them all. The Pharisees sought his life, and were exceedingly corrupt in their doctrine and practice; the Sadducees denied some of the essential doctrines of religion, and the Herodians probably were distinguished for irreligion, sensuality, and corrupt living. They were united, therefore, with the Pharisees and Sadducees in opposing the claims of Jesus. Matthew has recorded his caution to avoid the Pharisees and Sadducees, and Mark has added, what Matthew had omitted. the caution likewise to beware of the Herodians. Thus, the evangelists speak the same thing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. How is it that ye do not understand?&#8212;"do not understand that the warning I gave you could not have been prompted by any such petty consideration as the want of loaves in your scrip." Profuse as were our Lord's miracles, we see from this that they were not wrought at random, but that He carefully noted their minutest details, and desired that this should be done by those who witnessed, as doubtless by all who read the record of them. Even the different kind of baskets used at the two miraculous feedings, so carefully noted in the two narratives, are here also referred to; the one smaller, of which there were twelve, the other much larger, of which there were seven.<p>Blind Man at Bethsaida Restored to Sight (Mr 8:22-26).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/mark/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/mark/8-14.htm" title="Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.">Mark 8:14</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto them,....
