It is obvious that general as the words are, they had a special bearing on those who, like Peter, and probably the other disciples, had shown that they were “ashamed” of the words which had just been spoken.<p><span class= "bld">This adulterous and sinful generation.</span>—The words are not found in St. Luke’s report, but they agree with language which our Lord had used before (<a href="/matthew/12-39.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-4.htm" title="A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.

Their force here lies in the contrast drawn between those from whose frown or scorn the disciples were now shrinking, and the bright hosts in whose presence the faithless should be put to shame when the Son of Man should come in His glory. They were to look on this picture and on that, and ask themselves which ordeal was the most terrible.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:34-38 Frequent notice is taken of the great flocking there was to Christ for help in various cases. All are concerned to know this, if they expect him to heal their souls. They must not indulge the ease of the body. As the happiness of heaven with Christ, is enough to make up for the loss of life itself for him, so the gain of all the world in sin, will not make up for the ruin of the soul by sin. And there is a day coming, when the cause of Christ will appear as glorious, as some now think it mean and contemptible. May we think of that season, and view every earthly object as we shall do at that great day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ashamed of me - Ashamed to own attachment to me on account of my lowly appearance and my poverty.<p>And of my words - My doctrines, my instructions.<p>This adulterous and sinful generation - This age given to wickedness, particularly to adultery.<p>In the glory of his Father - In the day of judgment. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>. The meaning of this verse is, Whosoever shall refuse, through pride or wickedness, to acknowledge and serve Christ here, shall be excluded from his kingdom hereafter. He was lowly, meek, and despised; yet there was an inimitable beauty in his character even then. But he will come again in awful grandeur; not as the babe of Bethlehem, not as the man of Nazareth, but as the Son of God, in majesty and glory. They that would not acknowledge him here must be rejected by him there; they that would not serve him on earth will not enjoy his favor in heaven; they that would cast Him out and despise him must be cast out by him, and consigned to eternal, hopeless sorrow. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 8:27-38.

The first prevailed upon Peter, in the high priest’s hall. The second we find no instance of any good man guilty of in holy writ, and it most certainly argues a rotten and a corrupt heart. When men think it beneath their honour and quality to own the despised and maligned truth and ways of God, this is not only a denial of Christ, but the most inexcusable denial of him. Nor can any such persons look for any thing less at the hands of Christ, than that he should think it much more beneath his honour and dignity in the day of judgment to own them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me,....
