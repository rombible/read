We can scarcely fail to trace in the multiplied “thunderings and voices” of the Apocalypse (<a href="/revelation/4-5.htm" title="And out of the throne proceeded lightning and thunder and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.">Revelation 4:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-1.htm" title="And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.">Revelation 6:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-5.htm" title="And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunder, and lightning, and an earthquake.">Revelation 8:5</a>), and in the tradition of John’s indignant shrinking from contact with the heretic Cerinthus. that which was in harmony with the spiritual being of the Seer, and with the name which his Lord had thus given him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/mark/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/mark/3-17.htm" title="And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:">Mark 3:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">James and John he surnamed Boanerges </span>— “This word,” says Dr. Hammond, “is the corruption of the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">בני רעשּׁ</span>, <span class="ital">benei ragnash, sons of earthquake, tempest, </span>or any other <span class="ital">commotion, </span>such as is here styled, <span class="greekheb">βροντη</span>, <span class="ital">thunder. </span>And the meaning of this title may seem to be, that those two sons of Zebedee were to be special, eminent ministers of the gospel, which is called, <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm" title="Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.">Hebrews 12:26</a>, <span class="greekheb">φονη την γην γαλευουσα</span>, <span class="ital">a voice shaking the earth, </span>taken from <a href="/haggai/2-7.htm" title="And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:7</a>, which is directly the periphrasis of <span class="greekheb">רעשּׁ</span>, which is here rendered <span class="ital">thunder, </span>in the notion wherein <span class="greekheb">φονη</span>, voice, and <span class="greekheb">βροντη</span>, thunder, are promiscuously used for the same thing.” If the learned reader will consult Dr. Lightfoot and Grotius, he will receive further information concerning the derivation of the word <span class="ital">Boanerges. </span>Whitby thinks, “Christ gave James and John this name from a foresight of the heat and zeal of their temper, of which they quickly gave an instance in their desire to call down fire from heaven to consume the Samaritans. Hence we find, in the Acts, Peter and John are the chief speakers and actors in the defence and propagation of the gospel; and the zeal of James and Peter seems to be the reason why the one was slain by Herod, and the other imprisoned in order to the like execution.” Doubtless our Lord, in giving them this name, had respect to three things: the warmth and impetuosity of their spirits, their fervent manner of preaching, and the power of their word.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:13-21 Christ calls whom he will; for his grace is his own. He had called the apostles to separate themselves from the crowd, and they came unto him. He now gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils. May the Lord send forth more and more of those who have been with him, and have learned of him to preach his gospel, to be instruments in his blessed work. Those whose hearts are enlarged in the work of God, can easily bear with what is inconvenient to themselves, and will rather lose a meal than an opportunity of doing good. Those who go on with zeal in the work of God, must expect hinderances, both from the hatred of enemies, and mistaken affections of friends, and need to guard against both.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Boanerges - This word is made up of two Hebrew words signifying "sons of thunder," meaning that they, on some accounts, "resembled" thunder. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. It is not known why this name was given to James and John. They are nowhere else called by it. Some suppose it was because they wished to call down fire from heaven and consume a certain village of the Samaritans, <a href="/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>.

These are mentioned next, as being first called after Peter and Andrew: <p>and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, the sons of thunder: either because of their loud and sonorous voice; or their warm zeal for Christ, and fervency in their ministry: or for their courage in opposing the enemies of Christ, and the power that went along with their words; which either put to confusion and silence, or issued in conviction and conversion. The Syriac version reads, "Benai Regesh", and the Persic, "Beni Reg'sch". The Jews, as our learned countryman Mr. Broughton has observed (w), sometimes pronounce "Scheva" by on, as Noabyim", for "Nebyim"; so here, "Boanerges" for Benereges", or "Benerges". There is a city which was in the tribe of Dan, mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-45.htm">Joshua 19:45</a>, which is called "Bene-berak, the sons of lightning"; and is spoken of in the Jewish (x) writings, as a place where several of the Rabbins met, and conversed together: the reason of this name may be inquired after. <p>(w) Broughton's Requ. of Consent, in his Works, p. 620.

The etymology of the surname is somewhat differently traced out by Hiller; Onom., p. 117, 699.—<span class="greekheb">ὑιοὶ βροντῆς</span>, sons of thunder) A magnificent appellation. Thunder in Scripture is something both terrible and Joyous. So also the Gospel strikes terror into the world, and brings joy and gain to the godly. John in his mildness has, notwithstanding the hidden force of thunder, especially in his testimony as to the Godhead of Jesus Christ; comp. <a href="/john/12-29.htm" title="The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.">John 12:29</a>; <a href="/john/12-28.htm" title="Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.">John 12:28</a>; and in the Revelation he has written out the account of very many thunders; and he himself heard utterances of thunders, which he was forbidden to write out; <a href="/context/revelation/10-3.htm" title="And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices....">Revelation 10:3-4</a>. Hiller, in the passage quoted from him, says, “The thunder-bolt (lightning) is the son of thunder, inasmuch as it accompanies the crashing sound which proceeds from the rent clouds.”<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Although Mark mentions that the apostles were sent: out in pairs (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>), he does not classify them here in pairs. But he alone throws Peter and James and John, the three who shared the Lord's particular intimacy, into one group. Matthew and Luke both introduce Andrew between Peter and James.<p>He surnamed them Boanerges (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x392;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., he put upon them the name. Some uncertainty attaches to both the origin and the application of the name. Most of the best texts read &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, names, instead of name. This would indicate that each of the two was surnamed a "son of thunder." Some, however, have claimed that it was a dual name given to them as a pair, as the name Dioscuri was given to Castor and Pollux. The reason of its bestowal we do not know. It seems to have been intended as a title of honor, though not perpetuated like the surname Peter, this being the only instance of its occurrence; possibly because the inconvenience of a common surname, which would not have sufficiently designated which of them was intended, may have hindered it from ever growing into an appellation. It is justified by the impetuosity and zeal which characterized both the brothers, which prompted them to suggest the calling of fire from heaven to consume the inhospitable Samaritan village (<a href="/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>); which marked James as the victim of an early martyrdom (<a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>); and which sounds in the thunders of John's Apocalypse. The Greek Church calls John &#x392;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, the thunder-voiced. The phrase, sons of, is a familiar Hebrew idiom, in which the distinguishing characteristic of the individual or thing named is regarded as his parent. Thus sparks are sons of fire (<a href="/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>); threshed corn is son of the floor (<a href="/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>). Compare son of perdition (<a href="/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>); sons of disobedience (<a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>). </body></html>
