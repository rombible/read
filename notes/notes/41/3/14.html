Henry thinks our Lord appointed them by imposition of hands, but of this there is no proof. Indeed, this appointment seems to have been made some time before they were sent out to preach, or entered properly on their office. They were now called and appointed merely <span class="ital">to be with him, </span>that is, not only to attend on his public ministry, but to enjoy the benefit of his private conversation and daily instructions, that they might thereby be better fitted for the great work in which they were to be employed. If, as is generally supposed, our Lord, in appointing <span class="ital">twelve, </span>had a reference to the twelve patriarchs, and twelve tribes of Israel, and therefore, on the death of Judas, another was chosen to make up the number, this was only a piece of respect paid to that people, previous to the grand offer of the gospel to them. For, when they had generally rejected it, two more, Paul and Barnabas, were added, without any regard to the particular number of <span class="ital">twelve.

After their election, these twelve accompanied Jesus constantly, lived with him on one common stock as his family, and never departed from him unless by his express appointment.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:13-21 Christ calls whom he will; for his grace is his own. He had called the apostles to separate themselves from the crowd, and they came unto him. He now gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils. May the Lord send forth more and more of those who have been with him, and have learned of him to preach his gospel, to be instruments in his blessed work. Those whose hearts are enlarged in the work of God, can easily bear with what is inconvenient to themselves, and will rather lose a meal than an opportunity of doing good. Those who go on with zeal in the work of God, must expect hinderances, both from the hatred of enemies, and mistaken affections of friends, and need to guard against both.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He ordained twelve - The word rendered "ordained" here does not express our notion of ordination to the ministry. It means, literally, "he made" - that is, he "appointed" twelve to be with him.<p>Twelve - The reason why "twelve" were chosen was, probably, that such a number would be deemed competent witnesses of what they saw; that they could not be easily charged with being excited by sympathy, or being deluded, as a multitude might; and that, being destined to go into all the world, a considerable number seemed indispensable. Perhaps, also, there was some reference to the fact that "twelve" was the number of the twelve tribes of Israel.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 3:13-19.

The number selected, answering to the twelve sons of Jacob, was small indeed as compared with the hundreds who enrolled themselves as disciples of a Hillel or a Gamaliel, and their position in life was humble and obscure, but “<span class="ital">the weak things of the world were to confound the things which are mighty</span>” (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm" title="But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>), and these Twelve were to be the Twelve Pillars of the Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(ii) <span class="ital">Their calling and training</span>. Observe that the calling and training of the Twelve was a most important part of our Lord’s ministerial work.

The name also which He gave to them deserves attention.

The word thus rendered means (i) as an adjective, <span class="ital">despatched</span> or <span class="ital">sent forth</span>, (ii) as a substantive, the <span class="ital">actual delegate</span> of the person who sends him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) In Classical Greek the word was almost entirely restricted to the meaning of a “naval expedition,” a “fleet despatched on foreign service,” and this meaning entirely superseded any other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) In the Septuagint the word occurs only once, namely, in <a href="/1_kings/14-6.htm" title="And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, you wife of Jeroboam; why feign you yourself to be another? for I am sent to you with heavy tidings.">1 Kings 14:6</a>, in the sense of “a messenger,” “one who has a commission from God,” where Abijah says to the wife of Jeroboam, “I am a <span class="ital">messenger</span> unto thee of heavy tidings.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) With the later Jews the word was in common use, and was the title of those, who were sent from the mother city on any foreign mission, especially the collection of the tribute for the Temple service.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">d</span>) Thus when He employed it to designate His immediate and most favoured disciples, “our Lord was not introducing a new term, but adopting one which from its current usage would suggest to His hearers the idea of a highly responsible mission.” In <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a> He Himself is styled “The <span class="ital">Apostle</span> and high priest of our profession,” with which compare <a href="/john/17-18.htm" title="As you have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.">John 17:18</a>.

Their actual consecration (of all of them at least but one, namely, Judas Iscariot) took place when he breathed on them and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost" (<a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>). But from this time they were his apostles "designate." They were henceforth to Be with him as his attendants and disciples. They were to go forth and preach under his direction, and by his power they were to cast out devils. Several manuscripts add here that they were "to heal sicknesses," but the words are emitted in some of the oldest authorities. The authority over unclean spirits is more formally conveyed later on (see <a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>), so that here St. Mark speaks by anticipation. But this shows how much importance was attached to this part of their mission; for it recognizes the spiritual world, and the special purpose of the manifestation of the Son of God, namely, that he might "destroy the works of the devil." <span class="accented">He appointed twelve.</span> The number twelve symbolizes perfection and universality. The number three indicates what is Divine; and the number four, created things. Three multiplied by four gives twelve, the number of those who were to go forth as apostles into the four quarters of the world - called to the faith of the holy Trinity. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ordained (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., made.
