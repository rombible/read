His prayer, as is very probable, was chiefly concerning the great and important work, which was upon his mind, and he was about to do; the making and constituting twelve of his disciples, as his apostles, to preach in his name, and work miracles: <p>and calleth unto him whom he would; that is, "when it was day", as the above evangelist observes; when he called his disciples, such as had been for some time followers of him, as many of them as he thought fit: for it seems by the same evangelist, that others were called to him besides the twelve; and out of them he chose them: the phrase "whom he would", is in the Arabic version rendered, "whom he loved"; and it is a common observation of expositors, that the choice and call of the apostles to office, were not according to their will, works and merits, but according to the sovereign will and grace of Christ, who chose them, and not they him: but to me there seems no foundation for such a remark here, though it is a truth; because this regards not the call of the twelve only, and much less of them to office, but a call of many of the followers of Christ to come to him on the mountain: <p>and they came unto him; as many as he called out of the multitude; and from among these he made the following choice. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/mark/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/mark/3-13.htm" title="And he goes up into a mountain, and calls to him whom he would: and they came to him....">Mark 3:13-19</a>.

A few indeed had gathered round Him as His disciples, but as yet they did not present the appearance of a regular and organized body, nor had they received a distinct commission to disseminate His doctrines. Such a body was now to be formed. Such a commission was now to be given. Accordingly He retired to the mountain-range west of the Lake, and spent the whole night in prayer to God (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.">Luke 6:12</a>). The scene of His retirement and lonely vigil was in all probability the singular elevation now known as the Karûn Hattîn, or “Horns of Hattîn,” the only conspicuous hill on the western side of the Lake, and “singularly adapted by its conformation both to form a place for short retirement, and a rendezvous for gathering multitudes.” Then at dawn of the following day (<a href="/luke/6-13.htm" title="And when it was day, he called to him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;">Luke 6:13</a>), He<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">calleth unto him whom he would</span>] of the disciples, who had gradually gathered around Him, and when they had come to Him He selected for Himself (<a href="/luke/6-13.htm" title="And when it was day, he called to him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;">Luke 6:13</a>), and<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/mark/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/mark/3-13.htm" title="And he goes up into a mountain, and calls to him whom he would: and they came to him.">Mark 3:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς τὸ ὄρος</span>, <span class="ital">into a mountain</span>) Apart.—<span class="greekheb">οὓς ἤθελεν αὐτὸς</span>, <span class="ital">whom He Himself would</span>) He had unlimited authority, and that the highest.

Similarly, St. Luke (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a>) says," He went out into the mountain to pray." The use of the definite article might either point to some well-known eminence, or to the high table-land as distinguished from the plain, and in which there would be many recesses, which would explain the use of the preposition Tradition indicates Mount Hatten as the place, about five miles to the west of the Sea of Galilee. The summit rises above a level space, where large numbers might stand within hearing. It is supposed, with good reason, that it was from thence that the sermon on the mount was delivered. It was <span class="cmt_word">at</span> daybreak, as we learn from St. Luke (<a href="/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13</a>), after this night of prayer, that <span class="cmt_word">he called unto him whom he himself would</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>): <span class="cmt_word">and they went</span> unto <span class="cmt_word">him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">they went away to him</span>, the word implying that they forsook their former pursuits. His own will was the motive power: he called "whom he himself would;" but their will consented.
