In this place it is equivalent to the Messiah, who was, among the Jews, called the Son of God. Hence, they were charged not to make him known, because he was not desirous that it should be blazoned abroad that he claimed to be the Messiah. He had not yet done what he wished in order to establish his claims to the Messiahship. He was poor and unhonored, and the claim would be treated as that of an impostor. "For the present," therefore, he did not wish that it should be proclaimed abroad that he was the Messiah. The circumstance here referred to demonstrates the existence of evil spirits. If these were merely diseased or deranged persons, then it is strange that they should be endowed with knowledge so much superior to those in health. If they were under the influence of an order of spirits superior to man - whose appropriate habitation was in another world - then it is not strange that they should know him, even in the midst of his poverty, to be the Messiah, the Son of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>Mr 3:1-12.

The force of the imperfect tense in the original here is very striking, “<span class="bld">whenever the demons saw Him, they kept falling down before Him and saying</span>” … and as often as they did so, “He <span class="ital">straitly charged</span> them that they should not make Him known,” i. e. as the Messiah “the Son of God.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/mark/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/mark/3-11.htm" title="And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, You are the Son of God.">Mark 3:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅταν</span>) <span class="greekheb">ὅτʼ ἂν</span> is here joined with a past tense of the Indicative, as <span class="greekheb">ὅπου ἂν</span>, ch. <a href="/mark/6-56.htm" title="And wherever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and sought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.">Mark 6:56</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying</span>.

It is just possible that this homage paid to our Lord may have been an act of cunning - a ruse, as it were, to lead the people to suppose that our Lord was in league with evil spirits. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Son of God</span>. Did, then, the unclean spirits really know that Jesus was the Son of God? A voice from heaven at his baptism had proclaimed him to be the Son of God, and that voice must have vibrated through the spiritual world. Then, further, they must have known him to be the Son of God by the numerous and mighty miracles which he wrought, and which they must have seen [o be real miracles, such as could only have been wrought by the supernatural power of God, and which were wrought by Christ for this very purpose, that they might prove him to be the promised Messiah, the only begotten Son of God. It may, however, be observed that they did  not know this so clearly, but that, considering, on the other hand, the greatness of the mystery, they hesitated. It is probable that they were ignorant of the end and fruit of this great mystery, namely, that mankind were to be redeemed by the Incarnation, the Cross, and the Death of Christ; and so their own kingdom was to be overthrown, and the kingdom of God established. Blinded by their hatred of Jesus, whom they perceived to be a most holy Being, drawing multitudes to himself, they stirred up the passions of evil men against him, little dreaming that in promoting his destruction they were overthrowing their own kingdom. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The unclean spirits (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;)<p>The article indicating those particular spirits which took part in that scene.
