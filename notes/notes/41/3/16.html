The evangelists tell us it signifieth <span class="ital">Sons of thunder, </span> thereby minding them of their duty, to cry aloud, and to preach the gospel as on the housetops; or perhaps declaring what he knew was in the fervour and warmth of their spirits. We must not here inquire too narrowly into the secret counsels of God, in suffering a son of perdition to come into the number of his first ministers: Christ did it not because he did not know what was in his heart, for before that he showed himself a devil, by informing against his Master, Christ told his disciples that he had chosen twelve, and one of them was a devil; nor yet because he had no others to send, he had multitudes of disciples, and he who of stones could have raised up children to Abraham, could easily have fitted out a person for this service; nor yet did he do it to let in any sots and scandalous persons into the ministry, for we read of no scandal in Judas’s life. We ought to believe that God had wise ends in the permission of this, and that Christ did out of infinite wisdom do this, though we possibly are not able to give a satisfactory account in the case. What if we should say that Christ by this: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Instructed those that after his ascension should have the care of the church, not to pretend to judge of secret things, but only to judge as man ought to judge, according to the outward appearance, leaving the judgment of the heart to God alone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. God by this arms his people against the scandal of wicked ministers, such in whom corruption may break out after their entrance into that holy function, though before no such thing appeared, that they may not think the ministerial acts performed by them to have been nullities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. God by this also lets us know, that the efficacy of the ordinance doth not depend upon the goodness of the spiritual state of the minister that administers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A bell may call others to hear the word, though itself receives no benefit by it. In the mean time here is no warrant either for people to choose, or the governors of a church to ordain, lewd and visibly scandalous persons. Judas was no such person; nor yet for people to own, or the governors of churches to continue, lewd and scandalous persons in the ministry, God ordinarily not blessing the labours of such. No sooner had Judas discovered himself, but he went out and hanged himself. Christ no longer allowed him his company, nor the disciples their fellowship. There is a great deal of difference with relation to our fellowship and communion, between secret wickedness concealed in the heart and open and scandalous sinning, though both be alike dangerous to the soul of the sinner. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Simon he surnamed Peter.

The position of some of the names varies in the lists, but in all four the leaders of <span class="ital">the three groups</span> are the same, Peter, Philip, and James, the son of Alphæus, while in all four Judas Iscariot is placed last. According to St Mark’s catalogue they may be arranged in three groups:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(i)&emsp;&emsp;1&emsp;&emsp;Peter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2&emsp;&emsp;James.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3&emsp;&emsp;John.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4&emsp;&emsp;Andrew.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(ii)&emsp;&emsp;5&emsp;&emsp;Philip.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6&emsp;&emsp;Bartholomew.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>7&emsp;&emsp;Matthew.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>8&emsp;&emsp;Thomas.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(iii)&emsp;&emsp;9&emsp;&emsp;James the Less.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>10&emsp;&emsp;Thaddæus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>11&emsp;&emsp;Simon the Cananite.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>12&emsp;&emsp;Judas Iscariot.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">Group</span> i<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>i. <span class="ital">Simon</span>.

He said to him, Feed my sheep.">John 21:16</a>), whom our Lord surnamed Peter or Cephas, <span class="ital">the Rock-man</span>, stands first in all the four lists. He was brought up in his father’s occupation, as a fisherman on the Galilean lake, and lived originally at Bethsaida, and afterwards in a house at Capernaum (<a href="/mark/1-21.htm" title="And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.">Mark 1:21</a>; <a href="/mark/1-29.htm" title="And immediately, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.">Mark 1:29</a>).

His second call took place on the lake near Capernaum, where he and the other three in this group were fishing. He is specially prominent on various occasions before the rest of the Apostles. Sometimes he <span class="ital">speaks in their name</span> (<a href="/matthew/19-27.htm" title="Then answered Peter and said to him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed you; what shall we have therefore?">Matthew 19:27</a>; <a href="/luke/12-41.htm" title="Then Peter said to him, Lord, speak you this parable to us, or even to all?">Luke 12:41</a>); sometimes <span class="ital">answers when all are addressed</span> (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm" title="And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.">Matthew 16:16</a>; <a href="/mark/8-29.htm" title="And he said to them, But whom say you that I am?

Our Lord had previously declared that Simon should be so called. But St. Mark avoids as much as possible the recognition of any special honor belonging to St. Peter; so he here simply mentions the fact of this surname having been given to him, a fact which was necessary in order that he might be identified. All the early Christian writers held that Peter was virtually the author of this Gospel. Simon, or Simeon, is from a Hebrew word, meaning "to hear." <span class="cmt_word">James the son of Zebedee,</span> so called to distinguish him from the other James; <span class="cmt_word">and John his brother</span>. In St. Matthew's list, Andrew is mentioned next after Peter, as his brother, and the first called. But here St. Mark mentions James and John first after Peter; these three, Peter and James and John, being the three leading apostles. Of James and John, James is mentioned first, as the eldest of the two brothers. <span class="cmt_word">And them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder</span>. "Boanerges" is the Aramaic pronunciation of the Hebrew <span class="accented">B'ne-ragesh</span>; <span class="accented">B'ne</span>, sons, and <span class="accented">ragesh</span>, thunder. The word was not intended as a term of reproach; although it fitly expressed that natural impetuosity and vehemence of character, which showed itself in their desire to bring down fire from heaven upon the Samaritan village, and in their ambitious request that they might have the highest places of honor in his coming kingdom. But their natural dispositions, under the Holy Spirit's influence, were gradually transformed so as to serve the cause of Christ, and their fiery zeal was transmuted into the steady flame of Christian earnestness and love, so as to become an element of great power in their new life as Christians. Christ called these men "Sons of thunder" because he would make their natural dispositions, when restrained and elevated by his grace, the great instruments of spreading his Gospel. He destined them for high service in his kingdom. By their holy lives they were to be as lightning, and by their preaching they were to be as  thunder to rouse unbelievers, and to bring them to repentance and a holy life. It was no doubt on account of this zeal that James fell so early a victim to the wrath of Herod. A different lot was that which fell to St. John. Spared to a ripe old age, he influenced the early Church by his writings and his teaching. His Gospel begins as with the voice of thunder, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Beza and others, followed by Dr. Morisen, have thought that this distinctive name was given by our Lord to the two brothers on account of some deep-toned peculiarity of voice, which was of much service to them in impressing the message of the Gospel of the kingdom upon their hearers. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>And Simon he surnamed Peter<p>Mark relates only his naming and not his appointment, leaving his appointment to be understood. </body></html>
