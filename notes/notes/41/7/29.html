As she was a good woman, so a good mother. This sent her to Christ. His saying, Let the children first be filled, shows that there was mercy for the Gentiles, and not far off. She spoke, not as making light of the mercy, but magnifying the abundance of miraculous cures among the Jews, in comparison with which a single cure was but as a crumb. Thus, while proud Pharisees are left by the blessed Saviour, he manifests his compassion to poor humbled sinners, who look to him for children's bread.

Christ, who as God is every where, and whose divine power reaches to all places, persons, and things had, in a secret and powerful manner, cast the devil out of this woman's daughter; without going to her, or speaking to him, his power had wrought the miracle effectually. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/mark/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/mark/7-29.htm" title="And he said to her, For this saying go your way; the devil is gone out of your daughter.">Mark 7:29</a>, <span class="greekheb">διὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λόγον</span>, for this <span class="ital">word</span>, which showed the quick wit of the <span class="ital">faith</span> which Mt. specifies as the reason of the exception made in her favour.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/mark/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/mark/7-29.htm" title="And he said to her, For this saying go your way; the devil is gone out of your daughter.">Mark 7:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ τοῦτον τὸν λόγον</span>, <span class="ital">on account of this word</span> [<span class="ital">saying</span>]) This word, and the faith exhibited in it.

And her daughter was healed from that hour." If we suppose St. Mark's words to come in after St. Matthew's words "be it done unto thee even as thou wilt," the two narratives are perfectly consistent. Our Lord could no longer restrain himself, or resist these wonderful appeals of faith. Overcome by the skillful reasoning and importunity of the Canaanite, he gives her that which she asks, and more. He heals her daughter, and he sets a crown of gold upon her head. It is here obvious to remark that this child vexed by the unclean spirit represents the soul tempted by Satan and polluted by sin. In such a condition we must distrust our own strength, and rely only on Christ, and call upon him with humility and repentance; acknowledging ourselves to be but as dogs in his sight; that is, miserable sinners; yet not such as that we should despair of pardon, but rather that we should hope for the mercy of Christ the greater we feel our misery to be. For it is worthy of a great Saviour to cleanse and save great sinners. Again, this Gentile daughter represents the Church of the Gentiles, which, shut out from salvation by the justice of God, enters the kingdom of heaven through the door of mercy. Here was a great conversion indeed; for now the Jews through their unbelief change places with the Gentiles, and, like them, can only be admitted through the same gate of Divine mercy. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Peculiar to Mark.<p>Laid (&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., thrown.
