Accepting this reading, it marks the extreme limit of our Lord’s journeyings—we can hardly say of His ministry, for there is no indication that He went there as a preacher of the Kingdom. We may however, perhaps, trace the feeling which prompted the visit in the words, “It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon,” in <a href="/luke/10-14.htm" title="But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.">Luke 10:14</a>, and in the “Other sheep, not of this fold,” in <a href="/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Decapolis.</span>—Another instance of St. Mark’s use of a Roman nomenclature. St. Matthew says simply, “He departed thence, and came by the Sea of Galilee.” For Decapolis, see Note on <a href="/matthew/4-25.htm" title="And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.">Matthew 4:25</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/mark/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/mark/7-31.htm" title="And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the coasts of Decapolis....">Mark 7:31-36</a>. </span><span class="ital">He came unto the sea of Galilee, </span>&c. — See note on <a href="/context/matthew/15-29.htm" title="And Jesus departed from there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there....">Matthew 15:29-31</a>. <span class="ital">They bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment, </span>&c. — Greek, <span class="greekheb">Μογιλαλον</span>: “He was not absolutely dumb, but stammered to such a degree, that few understood his speech, <a href="/mark/7-35.htm" title="And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain.">Mark 7:35</a>. However, the circumstance of his being able to speak in any manner, shows that his deafness was not natural, but accidental. He had heard formerly, and had learned to speak, but was now deprived of hearing, perhaps, through some fault of his own, which might be the reason that Jesus sighed for grief when he cured him. <span class="ital">And they beseech him to put his hand upon him </span>— His friends interceded for him, because he was not able to speak for himself, so as that any one could understand him. His desire of a cure, however, may have prompted him to do his utmost in speaking, whereby all present were made sensible of the greatness of the infirmity under which he laboured. Our Lord’s exuberant goodness easily prompted him to give this person the relief which his friends begged for him. Yet he would not do it publicly, lest the admiration of the spectators should have been raised so high as to produce bad effects; for the whole country was now following him, in expectation that he would soon set up his kingdom. Or, as Gadara, where his miracle upon the demoniacs had been so ill received, was part of this region, (see on <a href="/luke/8-26.htm" title="And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.">Luke 8:26</a>,) he might shun performing the miracle publicly, because it would have no effect upon so stupid a people. Whatever was the reason, he took the man with his relations aside from the crowd; and, because the deaf are supposed to have their ears shut, and the dumb their tongues so tied, or fastened to the under part of their mouth, as not to be able to move it, (see <a href="/mark/7-35.htm" title="And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain.">Mark 7:35</a>,) he put his fingers into the man’s ears, and then touched or moistened his tongue with his spittle, to make him understand that he intended to open his ears, and loose his tongue.” — Macknight. This, perhaps, was the only reason for these symbolical actions, or our Lord might have other reasons for doing them, of which we are ignorant. “If any should ask,” says Dr. Doddridge, “why our Lord used these actions, when a word alone would have been sufficient; and such means (if they may be called means) could in themselves do nothing at all to answer the end, I frankly confess I cannot tell, nor am I at all concerned to know. Yet I am ready to imagine it might be intended to intimate, in a very lively manner, that we are not to pretend to enter into the reasons of all his actions; and that where we are sure that any observance whatever is appointed by him, we are humbly to submit to it, though we cannot see why it was preferred to others, which our imagination might suggest. Had Christ’s patients, like Naaman, (<a href="/context/2_kings/5-11.htm" title="But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper....">2 Kings 5:11-12</a>,) been too nice in their exceptions on these occasions, I fear they would have lost their cure; and the indulgence of a curious or a petulant mind would have been but a poor equivalent for such a loss.” <span class="ital">And looking up to heaven </span>— That the deaf man whom he could not instruct by words might consider from whence all benefits proceed; <span class="ital">he sighed </span>— Probably the circumstances above mentioned, or some others, to us unknown, made this dumb person a peculiar object of pity. Or by this example of bodily deafness and dumbness, our Lord might be led to reflect on the spiritual deafness and dumbness of men. But whatever was the cause, Christ’s sighing on this occasion evidently displayed the tender love he bore to our kind. For certainly it could be nothing less which moved him to condole our miseries, whether general or particular, in so affectionate a manner. <span class="ital">And saith unto him, Ephphatha </span>— This was a word of SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY, not an address to God for power to heal. Such an address was needless, for Christ had a perpetual fund of power residing in himself, to work all miracles whenever he pleased, even to the raising of the dead, <a href="/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21</a>; <a href="/john/5-26.htm" title="For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;">John 5:26</a>. <span class="ital">And straightway his ears were opened </span>— The word had an immediate effect, and all obstructions to his hearing distinctly, and speaking articulately and plainly, were instantly removed. And, as those bodily impediments vanished before the word of Christ’s power, the impediments of the mind to spiritual acts and duties are removed by the Spirit of Christ. He opens the internal ear, the heart, as he did Lydia’s, to understand and receive the word of God; and opens the mouth in prayer and praise. <span class="ital">And he charged them that they should tell no man </span>— When Jesus formerly cured the demoniac in this country, he ordered him to return to his own house, and show, namely, to his relations and friends, how great things God had done for him. But, at this miracle, the deaf and dumb man’s relations seem to have been present. Wherefore, as they had no need to be informed of the miracle, he required it to be concealed, probably for the reasons assigned in the note on <a href="/mark/5-43.htm" title="And he charged them straightly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.">Mark 5:43</a>. Neither the man, however, nor his friends, obeyed Jesus in this; <span class="ital">but the more he charged them </span>— To conceal it; <span class="ital">so much the more they published it </span>— So greatly were they struck with the miracle, and so charmed with the modesty and humility which Christ manifested, especially the man, who, having the use of his speech given him, was very forward to exercise it in praise of so great a benefactor.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:31-37 Here is a cure of one that was deaf and dumb. Those who brought this poor man to Christ, besought him to observe the case, and put forth his power. Our Lord used more outward actions in the doing of this cure than usual. These were only signs of Christ's power to cure the man, to encourage his faith, and theirs that brought him. Though we find great variety in the cases and manner of relief of those who applied to Christ, yet all obtained the relief they sought.

And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the Sea of Galilee&#8212;or, according to what has very strong claims to be regarded as the true text here, "And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre, He came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee." The manuscripts in favor of this reading, though not the most numerous, are weighty, while the versions agreeing with it are among the most ancient; and all the best critical editors and commentators adopt it. In this case we must understand that our Lord, having once gone out of the Holy Land the length of Tyre, proceeded as far north as Sidon, though without ministering, so far as appears, in those parts, and then bent His steps in a southeasterly direction. There is certainly a difficulty in the supposition of so long a detour without any missionary object: and some may think this sufficient to cast the balance in favor of the received reading. Be this as it may, on returning from these coasts of Tyre, He passed<p>through the midst of the coasts&#8212;frontiers.<p>of Decapolis&#8212;crossing the Jordan, therefore, and approaching the lake on its east side. Here Matthew, who omits the details of the cure of this deaf and dumb man, introduces some particulars, from which we learn that it was only one of a great number. "And Jesus," says that Evangelist (Mt 15:29-31), "departed from thence, and came nigh unto the Sea of Galilee, and went up into a mountain"&#8212;the mountain range bounding the lake on the northeast, in Decapolis: "And great multitudes came unto Him, having with them lame, blind, dumb, maimed"&#8212;not "mutilated," which is but a secondary sense of the word, but "deformed"&#8212;"and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and He healed them: insomuch that the multitude [multitudes] wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see; and they glorified the God of Israel"&#8212;who after so long and dreary an absence of visible manifestation, had returned to bless His people as of old (compare Lu 7:16). Beyond this it is not clear from the Evangelist's language that the people saw into the claims of Jesus. Well, of these cases Mark here singles out one, whose cure had something peculiar in it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/mark/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 31-37. This history is recorded by Mark only. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</span> We heard, <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/7-24.htm" title="And from there he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.">Mark 7:24</a></span>, of his going into those coasts; some think that our Saviour did not go out of the Jewish country, though he went to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the coasts of Tire and Sidon, </span> which were pagan countries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</span> That Decapolis was a union of ten cities so called, is plain by the name; but what those cities were, and whether they lay on the same side of Jordan that Galilee did, or on the other side of Jordan, is disputed; most think they lay on the Galilean side. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">One that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech:</span> some think that he was dumb, but the word signifies one that spake with difficulty, so as it is likely his deafness was not natural; (for all naturally deaf, are also dumb; we learning to speak by hearing); besides that it is said after the cure, that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">he spake plain:</span> it was probably an accidental deafness happening to him after that he could speak.

The Vulgate Latin version reads, "and coming out again from the borders of Tyre, he came through Sidon"; and so two of Beza's copies; the Arabic version, which De Dieu made use of reads "to Sidon"; as he must needs come to it, if he came through it; though the version in the Polyglot Bible of Walton's reads,  "from Sidon": but the greater number of copies, and the Syriac and Persic versions read as we do, and which is rightest; since it does not appear, that Christ went out of the land of Israel, into any Heathen cities: and besides, Sidon was further from Galilee than Tyre, and so did not lie in his way to it; and therefore it is not likely he should pass through that city, in order to go to it. The Ethiopic version reads, "and coming out again from Tyre, he went through Sidon": both these places were in Phoenicia, and it is probable that the woman before mentioned might belong to one or other of them. According to this version, she may be thought to be of Tyre, and that it was there, where the above discourse passed between Christ and her; though some Dutch pictures, Dr. Lightfoot (b) takes notice of, represent her as praying for her daughter, at the gate of Sidon; and Borchard the monk, as he relates from him, says, that before the gate of Sidon eastward, there is a chapel built in the place, where the. Canaanitish woman prayed to our Saviour for her daughter. But Christ, for the reason before given, could be in neither of these places, being out of the land of Israel; besides, the text is express, that it was to the borders of this country he came, and from thence he went; and to, or from, or through any of these places. <p>He came unto the sea of Galilee; or Tiberias, the same with the lake of Gennesaret: he came to those parts of Galilee, which lay by it, where he had been, before he went the borders of Tyre and Sidon: <p>through the midst the coasts of Decapolis; of this place,  See Gill on <a href="/matthew/4-25.htm">Matthew 4:25</a>. It was a country which consisted of ten cities, from whence it had its name: now not through the middle of these cities, or of this country, as the Ethiopic version reads; but through the midst of the borders of it Christ passed, which lay in his way from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, to the sea of Galilee. The Syriac and Persic versions render the words, "unto the borders of Decapolis, or the ten cities"; and the Arabic version, "unto the middle of the coasts of the ten cities"; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/15-29.htm">Matthew 15:29</a>. <p>(b) Chorograph.

The question why Jesus took aside the sick man apart from the people, cannot without arbitrariness be otherwise answered than to the effect that He adopted this measure for the sake of an entirely undisturbed rapport between Himself and the sick man, such as must have appeared to Him requisite, in the very case of this sick man, to the efficacy of the spittle and of the touch. Other explanations resorted to are purely fanciful, such as: that Jesus wished to make no parade (Victor Antiochenus, Theophylact, Euthymius Zigabenus, and many others); that in this region, which was not purely Jewish, He wished to avoid attracting dangerous attention (Lange); that He did not wish to foster the superstition of the spectators (Reinhard, Opusc. II. p. 140). De Wette conjectures that the circumstance belongs to the element of mystery, with which Mark invests the healings. But it is just in respect of the two cases of the application of spittle (here and at <a href="/mark/8-23.htm" title="And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands on him, he asked him if he saw ought.">Mark 8:23</a>) that he relates the withdrawing from the crowd; an inclination to the mysterious would have betrayed itself also in the presenting of the many other miracles. According to Baur, Mark wished to direct the attention of his readers to this precise kind of miraculous cure. This would amount to a fiction in a physiological interest. The spittle[108] (like the oil in <a href="/mark/6-13.htm" title="And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.">Mark 6:13</a>) is to be regarded as the <span class="ital">vehicle</span> of the miraculous power. Comp. on <a href="/john/9-6.htm" title="When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,">John 9:6</a>. It is not, however, to be supposed that Jesus wished in any wise to <span class="ital">veil</span> the marvellous element of the cures (Lange, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> II. 1, p. 282), which would amount to untruthfulness, and would widely differ from the enveloping of the truth in parable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πτύσας</span>] namely, on the tongue of the patient;[109] this was <span class="ital">previous to</span> the touching of the tongue (comp. <a href="/mark/1-41.htm" title="And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and said to him, I will; be you clean.">Mark 1:41</a>, <a href="/mark/8-22.htm" title="And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man to him, and sought him to touch him.">Mark 8:22</a>, <a href="/mark/10-13.htm" title="And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.">Mark 10:13</a>), which was done with the fingers, and not the mode of the touching itself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/mark/7-34.htm" title="And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.">Mark 7:34</a> f. <span class="greekheb">ἐστέναξε</span>] Euthymius Zigabenus well says: <span class="greekheb">ἐπικαμτόμενος τοῖς πάθεσι τοῦ ἀνθρώπου</span> (comp.

It is reading between the lines to say, with Lange, that in this half-heathen region duller forms of faith rendered His work difficult for Him; or with Hofmann (<span class="ital">Schriftbew.</span> II. 2, p. 352), that He saw in the deaf-mute an image of His people incapable of the hearing of faith and of the utterance of confession (comp.

But from the more full statement of St. Mark we learn that he made a circuit, going first northwards through Phoenicia, with Galilee on his right, as far as Sidon; and thence probably over the spurs of Libanus to Damascus, mentioned by Pliny as one of the cities of the Decapolis. This would bring him probably through Caesarea Philippi to the eastern coast of the Sea of Galilee. Here, according to St. Matthew, he remained for a time in the mountainous district above the plain; choosing this position apparently for the sake of quiet and retirement, as also that, being conspicuous to all from the mountain, he might there await the multitude coming to him, whether for instruction or for healing. </body></html>
