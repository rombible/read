The idea on which the practice rested was not one of cleanliness or health, but of arrogant exclusiveness, fastening on the thought of ceremonial purity. They might have come, in the crowd of the market, into passing contact with a Gentile, and his touch was as defiling as if it had been that of a corpse.

Those clean hands and that pure heart which Christ bestows on his disciples, and requires of them, are very different from the outward and superstitious forms of Pharisees of every age. Jesus reproves them for rejecting the commandment of God. It is clear that it is the duty of children, if their parents are poor, to relieve them as far as they are able; and if children deserve to die that curse their parents, much more those that starve them. But if a man conformed to the traditions of the Pharisees, they found a device to free him from the claim of this duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Market - This word means either the place where provisions were sold, or the place where men were convened for any purpose. Here it probably means the former.<p>Except they wash - In the original, "Except they baptize." In this place it does not mean to immerse the whole body, but only the hands. There is no evidence that the Jews washed their "whole bodies" every time they came from market. It is probable that they often washed with the use of a very small quantity of water.<p>The washing of cups - In the Greek, "the baptism of cups."<p>Cups - drinking vessels. Those used at their meals.<p>Pots - Measures of "liquids." Vessels made of wood, used to hold wine, vinegar, etc.<p>brazen vessels - Vessels made of brass, used in cooking or otherwise. These, if much polluted, were commonly passed through the fire: if slightly polluted they were washed. Earthen vessels, if defiled, were usually broken.<p>Tables - This word means, in the original, "beds or couches." It refers not to the "tables" on which they ate, but to the "couches" on which they reclined at their meals. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/23-6.htm">Matthew 23:6</a>. These were supposed to be defiled when any unclean or polluted person had reclined on them, and they deemed it necessary to purify them with water. The word "baptism" is here used - in the original, "the baptism of tables;" but, since it cannot be supposed that "couches" were entirely "immersed" in water, the word "baptism" here must denote some other application of water, by sprinkling or otherwise, and shows that the term is used in the sense of washing in any way. If the word is used here, as is clear it is, to denote anything except entire immersion, it may be elsewhere, and baptism is lawfully performed, therefore, without immersing the whole body in water.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 7<p>Mr 7:1-23.

In Beza's most ancient copy, and in one of Stephens's, it is read as we supply, "when they come": wherefore this respects not things bought in the market, a sense favoured by all the Oriental versions, for many of them could not be washed; but the persons of the Scribes and Pharisees, who when they came from market, or from any court of judicature, immersed themselves all over in water, according to the true sense of the word  here used: for, <p>"if the Pharisees touched but the garments of the common people, they were defiled, all one as if they had touched a profluvious person, , "and needed immersion";'' <p>and were obliged to it (u): hence, when they walked the streets, they walked on the sides of the way, that they might not be defiled by touching the common people (w): <p>wherefore, except they wash, they eat not, or immerse themselves in water, as well as used, , "immersion of the hands", or washing of the hands by immersion; and which, if only intended, is sufficient to support the primary sense of the word, "baptizo": <p>and, many other things there be which they have received to hold; by tradition from their elders; <p>as the washing of cups and pots, brazen, vessels, and of tables: and here the word  "baptism", is rightly used in its proper and primary signification; for all these things were, according to the traditions of the elders, washed by immersion: <p>"in a laver, (they say (x)) which holds forty seahs of water, which are not drawn, every defiled man dips himself, except a profluvious man; and in it    , "they dip all unclean vessels";'' <p>"as cups, pots, and brazen vessels": very particularly brazen vessels are mentioned, because earthen ones that were unclean, were to be broken (y); which were all washed before eaten in, even on a sabbath day, and that by dipping (z): <p>""dishes", in which they eat at evening, (i.e. of the sabbath,) they wash them, to eat in in the morning; in the morning they wash them, to eat in at noon; at noon they wash them, to eat in at the "minchah"; and from the "minchah", and forward, they do not wash again: but "cups", and "jugs", and "pots" they wash, and it goes through all the day; for there is no fixed time for drinking.'' <p>All such vessels, whether had of a Gentile, or an Israelite, or even a wise man, were to be immersed before used (a). <p>"He that buys a vessel for the use of a feast, of Gentiles, whether molten vessels, or glass vessels--Nlybjm, "they dip them", in the waters of the laver; and after that they may eat and drink in them: and such as they use for cold things, as "cups", and "pots", and "jugs", they wash them,   "and dip them", and they are free for use: and such as they use for hot things, as "cauldrons" and "kettles", ("brazen vessels",) they heat them with hot water, and scour them,  "and immerse them", and they are fit to be used: and things which they use at the fire, as spits and gridirons, they heat them in the fire till the crust (the covering of rust, or dirt) falls off,   "and dip them", and they may be lawfully made use of. This is the immersion with which they immerse vessels for a feast, bought of Gentiles; and after that they are free for eating and drinking; for the business of uncleanness and purification is only from the words of the Scribes--and none are obliged to this immersion, but molten vessels for a feast, bought of Gentiles; but if he borrows of Gentiles, or a Gentile leaves in pawn molten vessels, (made of cast brass, or iron,) he washes, or boils, or heats in the fire, but need not immerse them; and so if he buys vessels of wood, or vessels of stone, he washes, or boils them, but need not dip them; and so earthen vessels need not be immersed; but those that are covered with lead, are as molten vessels, , "and need immersion".'' <p>And not only such that were bought of Gentiles, but even that were made by Jews, and scholars too, were to be immersed in water. <p>"Vessels, (they say (b),) that are finished in purity, even though a disciple of a wise man makes them, care is to be taken about them, lo! these ought to be immersed:'' <p>and also "tables", at which they eat; and because their posture at them were lying, reclining, or leaning: hence the word  is used for them here: these were capable of defilement in a ceremonial sense, according to the traditions of the Jews: one of their rules is this (c); <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And <i>when they come</i> from the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> market, except they wash, they eat not.

The scope of this work does not admit of our going into the endless controversy to which this word has given rise. It will be sufficient to give the principal facts concerning its meaning and usage.<p>In classical Greek the primary meaning is to merse. Thus Polybius (i., 51, 6), describing a naval battle of the Romans and Carthaginians, says, "They sank (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) many of the ships." Josephus ("Jewish War," 4., 3, 3), says of the crowds which flocked into Jerusalem at the time of the siege, "They overwhelmed (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;) the city." In a metaphorical sense Plato uses it of drunkenness: drowned in drink (&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, "Symposium," 176); of a youth overwhelmed (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) with the argument of his adversary ("Euthydemus," 277).<p>In the Septuagint the verb occurs four times: <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-4.htm">Isaiah 21:4</a>, Terror hath frighted me. Septuagint, Iniquity baptizes me (&#x3b2;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;); <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15</a>, of Naaman's dipping himself in Jordan (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;); Judith 12:7, Judith washing herself (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;) at the fountain; Sirach 31:25, being baptized (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) from a dead body.<p>The New Testament use of the word to denote submersion for a religious purpose, may be traced back to the Levitical washings.

The word appears to have been at that time the technical term for such washings (compare <a href="/luke/11-38.htm">Luke 11:38</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>; <a href="/mark/7-4.htm">Mark 7:4</a>), and could not therefore have been limited to the meaning immerse. Thus the washing of pots and vessels for ceremonial purification could not have been by plunging them in water, which would have rendered impure the whole body of purifying water. The word may be taken in the sense of washing or sprinkling.<p>"The Teaching of the Apostles" (see on <a href="/matthew/10-10.htm">Matthew 10:10</a>) throws light on the elastic interpretation of the term, in its directions for baptism. "Baptize - in living (i.e., running) water. But if thou hast not living water, baptize in other water; and if thou canst not in cold, then in warm. But if thou hast neither, pour water upon the head thrice into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" (Chap. VII.).<p>Pots (&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Another of Mark's Latin words, adapted from the Latin sextarius, a pint measure. Wyc., cruets. Tynd., cruses.<p>Brazen vessels (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>More literally, copper.<p>Tables (&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Omitted in some of the best manuscripts and texts, and by Rev. The A. V. is a mistranslation, the word meaning couches. If this belongs in the text, we certainly cannot explain &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; as immersion. </body></html>
