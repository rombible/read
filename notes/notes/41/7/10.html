Those clean hands and that pure heart which Christ bestows on his disciples, and requires of them, are very different from the outward and superstitious forms of Pharisees of every age. Jesus reproves them for rejecting the commandment of God. It is clear that it is the duty of children, if their parents are poor, to relieve them as far as they are able; and if children deserve to die that curse their parents, much more those that starve them. But if a man conformed to the traditions of the Pharisees, they found a device to free him from the claim of this duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Full well - These words are capable of different interpretations. Some read them as a question: "Do ye do well in rejecting?" etc. Others suppose they mean "skillfully, cunningly." "You show great cunning or art, in laying aside God's commands and substituting in their place those of men." Others suppose them to be ironical. "How nobly you act! From conscientious attachment to your traditions you have made void the law of God;" meaning to intimate by it that they had acted wickedly and basely.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 7<p>Mr 7:1-23.

That is, God by Moses; for the following precept was spoken by God, and written by him on one of the tables of stone, and delivered into the hands of Moses, to be given to the children of Israel: <p>honour thy father and thy mother, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>, the sanction of which law is, <p>and whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death,  <a href="/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>. As the former of these commands is to be understood, not only of honouring parents in thought, word, and deed, but also of providing for them, when in want and distress, through poverty and old age; so the latter is to be interpreted, not merely of wishing or imprecating the most dreadful things upon parents, which some may not be guilty of, and yet transgress this command; but likewise of every slight put upon them, and neglect of them, when in necessitous circumstances: and both these laws were broken by the Jews, through their tradition hereafter mentioned;  See Gill on <a href="/matthew/15-4.htm">Matthew 15:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> die the death:</span><p>(g) Without hope of pardon, he will be put to death.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/mark/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/mark/7-10.htm" title="For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, Whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death:">Mark 7:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μωσῆς</span>, <span class="ital">Moses</span>; God in Mt., the same thing in Jewish esteem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/mark/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">Honour thy father</span>] The words are quoted partly from <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Exodus 20:12</a>, and partly from <a href="/exodus/21-17.htm" title="And he that curses his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 21:17</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/mark/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/mark/7-10.htm" title="For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, Whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death:">Mark 7:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μωσῆς</span>, <span class="ital">Moses</span>) by Divine direction.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Our Lord now gives an example of one of these human traditions. <span class="cmt_word">Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother</span>; - that is, obey and love them, and succor them, if they need it; for here "honor" means not only reverence and love, but support, as is clear from Ver. 12 - and<span class="cmt_word">, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death</span>; that is, let him "surely die," without any hope of pardon.
