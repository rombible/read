But this sense of the word is altogether unusual. For <span class="greekheb">πυγμη</span>, properly, is the hand, with the fingers contracted into the palm, and made round. “Theophylact’s translation, however,” says Macknight, “exhibits the evangelist’s meaning. For the Jews, when they washed, held up their hands, and, contracting their fingers, received the water that was poured on them by their servants, (who had it for a part of their office, <a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him?

Indeed, some of their rabbis carried this to such a ridiculous height, that one of them determined the neglect of washing to be a greater sin than whoredom; and another declared, it would be much better to die than to omit it. See many instances of this kind in Hammond and Whitby on the place. The Pharisees, therefore, viewing these washings in this important light, did not doubt but our Lord, by authorizing his disciples to neglect them, would expose himself to universal censure, as one who despised the most sacred services of religion; services to which a sanction was given by the approbation and practice of the whole nation. Accordingly, they <span class="ital">asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders? </span>— Hast thou taught them to despise these institutions? But while they pretended nothing but a sorrowful concern for the contempt which the disciples cast on institutions so sacred, their real intention was to make Jesus himself to be detested by the people as a deceiver. But the charge of impiety which they thus brought against him and his disciples, he easily retorted upon them with ten-fold strength. For he shows clearly, that notwithstanding their pretended regard for the duties of godliness, they were themselves guilty of the grossest violations of the divine law. And as they thus transgressed, not through ignorance, but knowingly, they were the worst of sinners, mere hypocrites, who deserved to be abhorred by all good men; and the rather, as God had long ago testified his displeasure against them, in the prophecy which Isaiah had uttered concerning them. <span class="ital">He answered, Well hath Esaias prophesied, </span>&c. — See note on <a href="/context/matthew/15-7.htm" title="You hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,...">Matthew 15:7-9</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-13 One great design of Christ's coming was, to set aside the ceremonial law; and to make way for this, he rejects the ceremonies men added to the law of God's making. Those clean hands and that pure heart which Christ bestows on his disciples, and requires of them, are very different from the outward and superstitious forms of Pharisees of every age. Jesus reproves them for rejecting the commandment of God. It is clear that it is the duty of children, if their parents are poor, to relieve them as far as they are able; and if children deserve to die that curse their parents, much more those that starve them. But if a man conformed to the traditions of the Pharisees, they found a device to free him from the claim of this duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Except they wash their hands oft - Our word "oft" means frequently, often. The Greek wore translated oft has been rendered various ways. Some have said that it means "up to the wrist" - unless they wash their hands up to the wrist. Others have said up to the elbow." There is evidence that the Pharisees had some such foolish rule as this about washing, and it is likely that they practiced it faithfully. But the Greek Word &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;  pugme&#772; - means properly the "fist," and the meaning here is, "Unless they wash their hands (rubbing them) with the fist" - that is, not merely dipping the finger or hands in water as a sign of ablution, but rubbing the hands together as a ball or fist, in the usual Oriental manner when water is poured over them. Hence, the phrase comes to mean "diligently, carefully, sedulously." - Robinson, Lexicon.

The far greater part of them; all, excepting the Sadducees; and especially the Pharisees, were very tenacious of this tradition of washing hands before eating: hence Pharisees are described as such,  , "that eat their common food with cleanness" (n), i.e. of hands: these, <p>except they wash their hands oft, eat not; or except they wash very cautiously, with great care, diligence, and exactness, as the Syriac version suggests; and about which there are various rules given, to be observed with great strictness (o). Some render the words, "they wash their hands to the elbow"; and this is a rule with the Jews, which is closely to be abode by, that the washing of hands is to be,  , "to the joint", which joins the hand and arm together (p): particularly it is observed (q), that <p>"washing of the hands for the eating of the offering, is unto the elbow, and for common food, to the joints of the fingers: he that eats with an ancient man, and does not wash his hands to the elbow, he may not eat with him.'' <p>Well may it be added, <p>holding the tradition of the elders; nor do the Jews pretend the authority of the Scriptures as obliging them to such rules; for, they say, the command concerning washing of hands is, , "from the words of the Scribes" (r); and is , "a command of the wise men" (s). The tradition is this: <p>"they wash hands for common food, but for the tithe, and for the first offering, and for that which is holy, they dip them, and for the sin offering; for if the hands are defiled; the body is defiled (t).'' <p>And this tradition of the elders, the Scribes, and Pharisees, strictly observed. <p>(n) Gloss in T.

When water was poured on the hands, they had to be lifted, yet so that the water should neither run up above the wrist, nor back again upon the hand; best, therefore, by doubling the fingers into a fist.

But these customary washings were distinct from the ceremonial ablutions; in the former water was <span class="ital">poured upon the hands;</span> in the latter the hands were <span class="ital">plunged in water</span>. When, therefore, some of the Pharisees remarked that our Lord’s disciples ate with “<span class="ital">unwashen hands</span>,” it is not to be understood literally that they did not at all wash their hands, but that they did not <span class="ital">wash them ceremonially</span> according to their own practice.
