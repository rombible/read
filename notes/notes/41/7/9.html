How praiseworthy is your conduct! A strong irony. <span class="ital">Ye reject the commandment of God that ye may keep your own tradition — </span>The words, <span class="ital">your own, </span>are emphatical, distinguishing the commandments of men, the corrupt traditions of the Pharisees, from the commandments of God. <span class="ital">For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother </span>— “Lest the charge, which our Lord brought against the Pharisees, should be thought without foundation, because it contained an imputation of such gross profaneness, he supported it by an instance of an atrocious kind.

Nevertheless, ye Pharisees, presumptuously making light of the divine commandment, affirm that it is a more sacred duty to enrich the temple than to nourish one’s parents, though they be in the utmost necessity; pretending that what is offered to the great Parent is better bestowed than that which is given for the support of our parents on earth; as if the interest of God were different from that of his creatures. Nay, ye impiously teach that a man may lawfully suffer his parents to starve, if he can say to them, <span class="ital">It is corban, </span>(a gifts) <span class="ital">&c., by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me</span> — That is, that which should have succoured you, is given to the temple. Thus ye hypocrites have, by your frivolous traditions, made void the commandment of God, though of immutable and eternal obligation; and disguised with the cloak of piety the most horrid and unnatural action that a man can easily be guilty of.” — See Macknight, and the note on <a href="/context/matthew/15-4.htm" title="For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and mother: and, He that curses father or mother, let him die the death....">Matthew 15:4-6</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-13 One great design of Christ's coming was, to set aside the ceremonial law; and to make way for this, he rejects the ceremonies men added to the law of God's making. Those clean hands and that pure heart which Christ bestows on his disciples, and requires of them, are very different from the outward and superstitious forms of Pharisees of every age. Jesus reproves them for rejecting the commandment of God. It is clear that it is the duty of children, if their parents are poor, to relieve them as far as they are able; and if children deserve to die that curse their parents, much more those that starve them. But if a man conformed to the traditions of the Pharisees, they found a device to free him from the claim of this duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Full well - These words are capable of different interpretations. Some read them as a question: "Do ye do well in rejecting?" etc. Others suppose they mean "skillfully, cunningly." "You show great cunning or art, in laying aside God's commands and substituting in their place those of men." Others suppose them to be ironical. "How nobly you act!

The Arabic version reads the words by way of interrogation, "is it fit that you should omit the commandments of God, and keep your own statutes?" and so the Ethiopic, "do ye rightly make void the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own commandment?"
