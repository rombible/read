If some be laid aside, others shall be raised up, to carry on the same work. Observe the great truths Christ preached. By repentance we give glory to our Creator whom we have offended; by faith we give glory to our Redeemer who came to save us from our sins. Christ has joined these two together, and let no man think to put them asunder. Christ puts honour upon those who, though mean in this world, are diligent in their business and kind to one another. Industry and unity are good and pleasant, and the Lord Jesus commands a blessing on them. Those whom Christ calls, must leave all to follow him; and by his grace he makes them willing to do so. Not that we must needs go out of the world, but we must sit loose to the world; forsake every thing that is against our duty to Christ, and that cannot be kept without hurt to our souls. Jesus strictly kept the sabbath day, by applying himself unto, and abounding in the sabbath work, in order to which the sabbath rest was appointed. There is much in the doctrine of Christ that is astonishing; and the more we hear it, the more cause we see to admire it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18-22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 1:14-20.
