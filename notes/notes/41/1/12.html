After this followed the temptation by him in a visible shape, related by Matthew. These forty days, says Dr. Lightfoot, the holy angels ministered to Christ visibly, and Satan tempted him invisibly; at the end of them, Satan puts on the appearance of an angel of light, and pretends to wait on him as they did.

Mark, we may observe, not only gives us a compendium of Matthew’s gospel, but likewise several valuable particulars, which he and the other evangelists have omitted; especially such particulars as might enable the Romans, or Gentiles in general, better to understand him. Thus, as a Roman might not know how wild and uninhabited the deserts of Arabia were, in which Christ was tempted, he adds here, that <span class="ital">he was with the wild beasts.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/mark/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:9-13 Christ's baptism was his first public appearance, after he had long lived unknown. How much hidden worth is there, which in this world is not known! But sooner or later it shall be known, as Christ was. He took upon himself the likeness of sinful flesh; and thus, for our sakes, he sanctified himself, that we also might be sanctified, and be baptized with him, Joh 17:19. See how honourably God owned him, when he submitted to John's baptism. He saw the Spirit descending upon him like a dove. We may see heaven opened to us, when we perceive the Spirit descending and working upon us. God's good work in us, is sure evidence of his good will towards us, and preparations for us. As to Christ's temptation, Mark notices his being in the wilderness and that he was with the wild beasts. It was an instance of his Father's care of him, which encouraged him the more that his Father would provide for him. Special protections are earnests of seasonable supplies. The serpent tempted the first Adam in the garden, the Second Adam in the wilderness; with different success indeed; and ever since he still tempts the children of both, in all places and conditions. Company and conversation have their temptations; and being alone, even in a wilderness, has its own also. No place or state exempts, no business, not lawful labouring, eating, or drinking, not even fasting and praying; often in these duties there are the most assaults, but in them is the sweetest victory. The ministration of the good angels is matter of great comfort in reference to the malignant designs of the evil angels; but much more does it comfort us, to have the indwelling of God the Holy Spirit in our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Here Mark relates concisely what Matthew has recorded more at length in <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/4.htm">Mark 4</a>.<p>The Spirit driveth - The word "driveth" does not mean that he was compelled forcibly against his will to go there, but that he was inclined to go there by the Spirit, or was led there. The Spirit of God, for important purposes, caused him to go. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/9-25.htm">Matthew 9:25</a>, where the same word is used in the original: "And when they were all put forth" in Greek, "all driven out."<p>And was with the wild beasts - This is added to show the desolation and danger of his dwelling there. In this place, surrounded by such dangers, the temptations offered by Satan were the stronger. Amid want and perils, Satan might suppose that he would be more easily seduced from God. But he trusted in his Father, and was alike delivered from dangers, from the wild beasts, and from the power of temptation, thus teaching us what to do in the day of danger and trial.<p>And the angels ministered unto him - From <a href="/luke/4-2.htm">Luke 4:2</a> we learn that in those days he did eat nothing. When Mark says, therefore, that the angels ministered to him, it means after the days of temptation had expired, as is said by <a href="/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 1:12, 13.

As soon as he was baptized, and this testimony had been given of his divine sonship, the very selfsame day, <p>the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness: into a more remote and desolate part of it; for it was in the wilderness John was baptizing and preaching, when Christ came to him, and had the ordinance of baptism administered by him; and it was the same Spirit that descended on him at his baptism, which remained with him; by whose impulse he was moved, though not against his will, to go into, this desert and forlorn place. For this was not the evil spirit Satan, by whom he was tempted; for Matthew expressly says, that he was "led up of the Spirit--to be tempted by the devil", <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>, where the devil that tempted him, is manifestly distinguished from the Spirit by whom he was led, and the same Spirit is meant here, as there.

No, according to Mark, Jesus is to be conceived as <span class="ital">really surrounded by the wild beasts of the desert</span>. He is threatened in a twofold manner; Satan tempts Him, and the wild beasts encompass Him. The <span class="ital">typical</span> reference, according to which Christ is held to appear as the renewer of Paradise (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a>; Usteri in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.

The desert and the forty days remind us of <span class="ital">Moses</span> (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm" title="And Moses went into the middle of the cloud, and got him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-28.htm" title="And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water.

On the contrary, we must simply abide by the view that, according to Mark, is meant <span class="ital">the help which gives protection against Satan and the wild beasts</span>. There is in this respect also a difference from Matthew, that in the latter Gospel the angels do not appear until after the termination of the temptations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The narrative of <span class="ital">Christ’s temptation</span> (regarding it, see on <a href="/matthew/4-11.htm" title="Then the devil leaves him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him.">Matthew 4:11</a>, Remark) appears in Mark in its oldest, almost still germinal, form. It is remarkable, indeed, that in the further development of the evangelic history (in Matthew and Luke) the wonderful element <span class="greekheb">ἦν μετὰ τῶν θηρίων</span> (which, according to Hilgenfeld, merely serves to colour and embellish the meagre extract), should have remained unnoticed. But the entire interest attached itself to Satan and to his anti-Messianic agency. The brevity[52] with which Mark relates the temptation, and which quite corresponds[53] to the still undeveloped <span class="ital">summary beginning of the tradition</span>, is alleged by Baur to proceed from the circumstance that with Mark the matter still lay outside of the historical sphere. Against this we may decisively urge the very fact that he narrates it at all, and places the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχὴ τοῦ εὐαγγ</span>. earlier. Comp. Köstlin, p. 322.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[51] So also von Engelhardt (<span class="ital">de Jesu Christi tentatione</span>, Dorp. 1858, p. 5).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[52] For the idea that <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἀγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">διηκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span>. is only the closing sentence of an originally longer narration (Weisse, <span class="ital">Evangelienfr.</span> p. 163) is fanciful. Only the short, compact account is in harmony with all that surrounds it. Weisse supposes that something has dropped out also after ver. 5 or 6, and after ver. 8.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[53] How awkwardly Mark would here have epitomized, if he had worked as an epitomizer! How, in particular, would he have left unnoticed the rich moral contents of the narrative in Matthew and Luke! Schleiermacher and de Wette reproach him with doing so.
