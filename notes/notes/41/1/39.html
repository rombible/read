He cures, that we may minister to him, and to others who are his, and for his sake. Those kept from public ordinances by sickness or other real hinderances, may expect the Saviour's gracious presence; he will soothe their sorrows, and abate their pains. Observe how numerous the patients were. When others speed well with Christ, it should quicken us in seeking after him. Christ departed into a solitary place. Though he was in no danger of distraction, or of temptation to vain-glory, yet he retired. Those who have the most business in public, and of the best kind, must yet sometimes be alone with God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he preached in their synagogues - See <a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>.<p>All Galilee - See <a href="/matthew/1-22.htm">Matthew 1:22</a>.<p>And cast out devils - See <a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38.

Compare Joh 16:28, "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world," &c.&#8212;another proof, by the way, that the lofty phraseology of the Fourth Gospel was not unknown to the authors of the others, though their design and point of view are different. The language in which our Lord's reply is given by Luke (Lu 4:43) expresses the high necessity under which, in this as in every other step of His work, He acted&#8212;"I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also; for therefore"&#8212;or, "to this end"&#8212;"am I sent." An act of self-denial it doubtless was, to resist such pleadings to return to Capernaum.
