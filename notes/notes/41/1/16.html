If some be laid aside, others shall be raised up, to carry on the same work. Observe the great truths Christ preached. By repentance we give glory to our Creator whom we have offended; by faith we give glory to our Redeemer who came to save us from our sins. Christ has joined these two together, and let no man think to put them asunder. Christ puts honour upon those who, though mean in this world, are diligent in their business and kind to one another. Industry and unity are good and pleasant, and the Lord Jesus commands a blessing on them. Those whom Christ calls, must leave all to follow him; and by his grace he makes them willing to do so. Not that we must needs go out of the world, but we must sit loose to the world; forsake every thing that is against our duty to Christ, and that cannot be kept without hurt to our souls. Jesus strictly kept the sabbath day, by applying himself unto, and abounding in the sabbath work, in order to which the sabbath rest was appointed. There is much in the doctrine of Christ that is astonishing; and the more we hear it, the more cause we see to admire it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18-22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 1:14-20.

The narrative of Mark has the brevity and vividness of an original. Observe, however, how, according to all the evangelists, Jesus begins His work not with working miracles, but with teaching and collecting disciples.[54] This does not exclude the assumption that miracles essentially belonged to His daily work, and were even from the very beginning associated with His teaching, <a href="/mark/1-21.htm" title="And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.">Mark 1:21</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">παράγων</span> (see the critical remarks), <span class="ital">as He passed along by the sea</span>.

Any special purpose for this accuracy of detail is not apparent. It is an arbitrary supposition that it is intended to explain how the sons might leave their father without undutifulness (Paulus, Kuinoel, de Wette, Bleek, and others), in reference to which de Wette charges Mark with taking away from their resolution its nobleness.[55] It may, moreover, be <span class="ital">inferred</span>, that Zebedee carried on his business not altogether on a small scale, and perhaps was not without means.

Weizsäcker, p. 364. But the teaching begins with the announcement of the kingdom, which has as its presupposition the Messianic self-consciousness (Weizsäcker, p. 425). Without reason Schenkel maintains, p. 370, that Jesus <span class="ital">could</span> not at all have regarded Himself at the beginning of His work as the Messiah. He might do so, <span class="ital">without</span> sharing the political Messianic hopes. See Schleiermacher, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> p. 250 f.; Keim, <span class="ital">Geschichtl. Chr.</span> p. 44 f. But the view which makes the beginning of the teaching and miracle-working even precede the baptism (Schleiermacher) has absolutely no foundation in the N. T., not even in the history of the marriage feast at Cana. Nor yet can it be maintained, with Keim (p. 84), that the conviction of being the Messiah gained strength in Jesus gradually from His first emergence up to the decisiveness, which first makes itself manifest at Matthew 11, where He announces the <span class="ital">present</span> kingdom, no longer merely that which is <span class="ital">approaching</span>. For the <span class="ital">approaching</span> kingdom is throughout—only according to a relative conception of time—from the beginning onward to <a href="/luke/21-31.htm" title="So likewise you, when you see these things come to pass, know you that the kingdom of God is near at hand.">Luke 21:31</a> to be taken in an <span class="ital">eschatological</span> reference; and it presupposes, therefore, a Messianic self-certainty in the Son of man, who with this announcement takes up the preaching of the Baptist.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[55] With greater truth, because more naturally, it might be said that that trait places in so much stronger a light the <span class="ital">resignation</span> of those who were called, seeing that they forsook a business so successfully prosecuted.

He then passed along by the seashore towards Capernaum; and on his way found the four disciples whom he had previously nominated, but who were now engaged in their calling of fishermen. St. Mark then relates the circumstances of their call in the exact words of St. Matthew, which were in all probability those of apostolical tradition ('Speaker's Commentary'). It will be seen that St. Mark's account, in this introductory portion of his Gospel, is very concise, and that there are many things to be supplied from the first chapter of St. John; as, for example, that after our Lord's baptism by John, and afar his fasting and temptation in the desert, the Jews sent messengers to the Baptist, to inquire of him whether he were the Christ. John at once confessed that he was not the Christ, but that there was One even then among them, though they knew him not, who was indeed the Christ And then, the very next day after, Jesus came to him, and John then said to those around him, "Behold the Lamb of God!" Upon this two of John's disciples at once betook-themselves to Jesus. The first was Andrew, who forthwith brought his own brother Simon, afterwards called "Peter," to our Lord. Again, the day after the, our Lord called Philip, a fellow-citizen with Andrew and Peter, of Bethsaida. Then Philip brought Nathanael. Here, then, we have some more disciples nominated, who were with Jesus at the marriage in Cana of Galilee. Then Jesus retched again into Judaea; and those disciples "nominate," as we might call them, went back for a time to their occupation of fishermen. Meanwhile our Lord, while in Judaea, wrought miracles and preached, until the envy of the scribes and Pharisees constrained him to return again into Galilee. And then it was that he solemnly called Andrew and Peter, and James and John, as recorded by St. Mark here. So that St John alone gives some account of the events of the first year of our Lord's ministry. The three synoptic Gospels give the narrative of his public ministry, commencing from the second year. <span class="cmt_word">He saw Simon and Andrew, the</span> <span class="cmt_word">brother of Simon casting a net in the sea.</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>). Such was the text underlying the Authorized Version; but a better reading is (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>). St. Mark thinks it unnecessary to mention the net at all; though doubtless it was the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, or casting-net. When our Lord likens <span class="cmt_word">his gospel to a net, he uses the</span> figure of the drag-not (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), a net of a much larger size. But whether it be the casting-net or the drag-net, the comparison is a striking one. It is plain that, in the pursuit of his calling, the fisherman has no power to make any separation between the good fish and the worthless. He has little or no insight into what is going on beneath the surface of the water. So with the "fisher of men." He deals with the world spiritual and invisible; and how, then, can he be fully conscious of the results of his work? His work is pre-eminently a work of faith. It may be observed here that St. Mark, in this earlier part of his narrative, speaks of St. Peter as Simon, though afterwards (<a href="/mark/3-16.htm">Mark 3:16</a>) he calls him Peter. We may also notice here, once for all, St. Mark's constant use of the word "straightway" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>). This word occurs no less than ten times in this chapter. In the Authorized Version the word (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)is rendered indifferently by various English synonyms, as "forthwith," "immediately," etc.; whereas in the Revised Version it has been thought fit to note this peculiarity or mannerism in St. Mark's Gospel by the use of the same English synonym, "straightway," throughout this Gospel. The Holy Spirit, while guiding the minds of those whom he moved to write these records, did not use an overpowering influence, so as to interfere with their own natural modes of expression. Each sacred writer, while guarded against error, has reserved to him his own peculiarities of style and expression. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Casting a net (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18</a>. Mark here uses, more graphically, only the verb, without adding net. Lit., throwing about in the sea. Probably a fisher man's phrase, like a east, a haul. </body></html>
