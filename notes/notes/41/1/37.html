He cures, that we may minister to him, and to others who are his, and for his sake. Those kept from public ordinances by sickness or other real hinderances, may expect the Saviour's gracious presence; he will soothe their sorrows, and abate their pains. Observe how numerous the patients were. When others speed well with Christ, it should quicken us in seeking after him. Christ departed into a solitary place. Though he was in no danger of distraction, or of temptation to vain-glory, yet he retired. Those who have the most business in public, and of the best kind, must yet sometimes be alone with God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All men seek for thee - That is, many men, or multitudes.
