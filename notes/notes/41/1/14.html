If some be laid aside, others shall be raised up, to carry on the same work. Observe the great truths Christ preached. By repentance we give glory to our Creator whom we have offended; by faith we give glory to our Redeemer who came to save us from our sins. Christ has joined these two together, and let no man think to put them asunder. Christ puts honour upon those who, though mean in this world, are diligent in their business and kind to one another. Industry and unity are good and pleasant, and the Lord Jesus commands a blessing on them. Those whom Christ calls, must leave all to follow him; and by his grace he makes them willing to do so. Not that we must needs go out of the world, but we must sit loose to the world; forsake every thing that is against our duty to Christ, and that cannot be kept without hurt to our souls. Jesus strictly kept the sabbath day, by applying himself unto, and abounding in the sabbath work, in order to which the sabbath rest was appointed. There is much in the doctrine of Christ that is astonishing; and the more we hear it, the more cause we see to admire it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now after that John was put in prison - John was imprisoned by Herod, <a href="/matthew/14-3.htm">Matthew 14:3</a>.<p>Jesus came into Galilee - He left Judea and went into the more retired country of Galilee. He supposed that if he remained in Judea, Herod would also persecute him and attempt to take his life. His time of death had not come, and he therefore prudently sought safety in retirement. Hence, we may learn that when we have great duties to perform for the church of God, we are not to endanger our lives wantonly.

He was but about six months older than our Saviour, and was imprisoned as soon as our Saviour entered upon his ministry, indeed before we read of his entrance upon it. Upon his imprisonment, Christ begins to preach in Galilee the gospel by which he set up his kingdom, and which leadeth men to the kingdom of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And saying, The time is fulfilled, </span> the time determined of God for the revelation of the Messias, and the grace of the gospel through him, foretold by the prophets, <span class="bld"><a href="/daniel/2-44.htm" title="And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.">Daniel 2:44</a></span>: hence Christ is said to have come in <span class="ital">the fulness, </span> and <span class="ital">in the dispensation of the</span> fulness of time, <span class="bld"><a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a> <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And the kingdom of God is at hand; </span> the gracious dispensation of God in the gospel is at hand, or hath approached. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Repent ye, </span> turn from the wickedness of your ways, <span class="ital">and believe</span> <span class="ital">the gospel, </span> or, in the gospel: to believe the gospel is one thing, to believe in the gospel (as it is here in the Greek) is another.

There is a repentance that must go before faith, that is the applicative of the promise of pardoning mercy to the soul; though true evangelical repentance, which is a sorrow for sin, flowing from the sense of the love of God in Christ, be the fruit and effect of faith.

Galilee had been specially designated as the scene of the Divine manifestation (see <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1, 2</a>). The land of Galilee, or of Zebulun and Naphtali, had the misfortune to be the first in the sad calamity which fell upon the Jewish nation through the Assyrian invasion; and, in order to console them under this grievious affliction, Isaiah assures them that, by way of recompense, they, above the rest of their brethren, should have the chief share in the presence and ministry of the future promised Messiah. It seems probable that our Lord remained some time in Judaea after his baptism. From thence he went, with Andrew and Peter, two of John's disciples, into Galilee, where he called Philip. And then it was that he turned the water into wine at the marriage feast in Cana. This was his first coming out of Judaea into Galilee, related by St. John (<a href="/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43</a>, etc.). But the Passover brought him back into Judaea, that he might present himself in the temple; and then occurred his first purging of the temple (<a href="/john/2-14.htm">John 2:14</a>). Then came the visit of Nicedemus to him by night; and then he began openly to preach and to baptize (<a href="/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>), and thus incurred the envy of the scribes and Pharisees. Therefore he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee; and this is the departure here recorded by St. Mark and by St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12</a>). Hence it came to pass that it was in Galilee that Christ called to himself four fishermen - Andrew and Peter, James and John. </body></html>
