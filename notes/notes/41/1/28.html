There are many in our assemblies who quietly attend under merely formal teachers; but if the Lord come with faithful ministers and holy doctrine, and by his convincing Spirit, they are ready to say, like this man, What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth! No disorder could enable a man to know Jesus to be the Holy One of God. He desires to have nothing to do with Jesus, for he despairs of being saved by him, and dreads being destroyed by him. See whose language those speak, that say to the Almighty, Depart from us. This unclean spirit hated and dreaded Christ, because he knew him to be a Holy One; for the carnal mind is enmity against God, especially against his holiness. When Christ by his grace delivers souls out of the hands of Satan, it is not without tumult in the soul; for that spiteful enemy will disquiet those whom he cannot destroy. This put all who saw it upon considering, What is this new doctrine? A work as great often is wrought now, yet men treat it with contempt and neglect. If this were not so, the conversion of a notorious wicked man to a sober, righteous, and godly life, by the preaching of a crucified Saviour, would cause many to ask, What doctrine is this?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they were all amazed ... - The power of casting out devils was new to them.<p>It was done by a word. Jesus did it in his own name and by his own authority. This proved that he was superior to all the unclean spirits.

Keim thinks this not a real history but an acted programme, like the change of water into wine in John 2 and like the preaching programme in Luke 4 (<span class="ital">L. J.</span>, ii. 165, 203), a mere duplicate of the Gadara story. Weiss thinks the words spoken by the demoniac (<a href="/mark/1-34.htm" title="And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.">Mark 1:34</a>) are borrowed from that story, and that Mark reproduces the features with which Peter was wont to describe such cases.
