Do we give him the precious ointment of our best affections? Let us love him with all the heart, though it is common for zeal and affection to be misunderstood and blamed; and remember that charity to the poor will not excuse any from particular acts of piety to the Lord Jesus. Christ commended this woman's pious attention to the notice of believers in all ages. Those who honour Christ he will honour. Covetousness was Judas' master lust, and that betrayed him to the sin of betraying his Master; the devil suited his temptation to that, and so conquered him.

It is true that he did this; but the expression means simply that he had charge of it and its contents, or was treasurer to Jesus and the Twelve. What a remarkable arrangement was this, by which an avaricious and dishonest person was not only taken into the number of the Twelve, but entrusted with the custody of their little property! The purposes which this served are obvious enough; but it is further noticeable, that the remotest hint was never given to the Eleven of his true character, nor did the disciples most favored with the intimacy of Jesus ever suspect him, till a few minutes before he voluntarily separated himself from their company&#8212;for ever!<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/mark/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/mark/13-4.htm" title="Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?">Mark 13:4</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence,....
