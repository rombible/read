Do we give him the precious ointment of our best affections? Let us love him with all the heart, though it is common for zeal and affection to be misunderstood and blamed; and remember that charity to the poor will not excuse any from particular acts of piety to the Lord Jesus. Christ commended this woman's pious attention to the notice of believers in all ages. Those who honour Christ he will honour. Covetousness was Judas' master lust, and that betrayed him to the sin of betraying his Master; the devil suited his temptation to that, and so conquered him. And see what wicked contrivances many have in their sinful pursuits; but what appears to forward their plans, will prove curses in the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-1.htm">Matthew 26:1-16</a>.<p><a href="/mark/14-1.htm">Mark 14:1</a><p>And of unleavened bread - So called because at that feast no other bread was used but that which had been made without leaven or yeast.<p>By craft - By subtlety (Matthew); that is, by some secret plan that would secure possession of him without exciting the opposition of the people.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

See Josephus [Antiquities, 20.5.3]. What plan, if any, these ecclesiastics fixed upon for seizing our Lord, does not appear. But the proposal of Judas being at once and eagerly gone into, it is probable they were till then at some loss for a plan sufficiently quiet and yet effectual. So, just at the feast time shall it be done; the unexpected offer of Judas relieving them of their fears. Thus, as Bengel remarks, did the divine counsel take effect.<p>The Supper and the Anointing at Bethany Six Days before the Passover (Mr 14:3-9).<p>The time of this part of the narrative is four days before what has just been related. Had it been part of the regular train of events which our Evangelist designed to record, he would probably have inserted it in its proper place, before the conspiracy of the Jewish authorities. But having come to the treason of Judas, he seems to have gone back upon this scene as what probably gave immediate occasion to the awful deed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/mark/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/mark/14-1.htm" title="After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.">Mark 14:1</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But they said not on the feast day,....

The <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> presupposes that the murder of Jesus during the feast was from the first regarded as out of the question, and the clause following partly makes that fact explicit, partly assigns a reason for it. They wanted to compass His death, but they were in a difficulty, for they felt and said to one another: it may not be on the feast, lest there be a popular disturbance.—<span class="greekheb">μήποτε ἔσται</span>: the fut. ind. instead of the more usual subjunctive after <span class="greekheb">μήποτε</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>, <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm" title="Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.">Hebrews 3:12</a>), implying the almost certain occurrence of a <span class="greekheb">θόρυβος</span> if an attempt were made on the life of Jesus during the feast.

Their first intention, therefore, was not to destroy him until after the close of the Paschal feast; but they were overruled by the course of events, all ordered by God's never-failing providence. The sudden betrayal of our Lord by Judas led them to change their minds. For when they found that he was actually in their hands, they resolved to crucify him forthwith. And thus the Divine purpose was fulfilled that Christ should suffer at that particular time, and so the type be satisfied. For the lamb slain at the Passover was a type of the very Paschal Lamb to be sacrificed at that particular time, in the predetermined purpose of God; and to be lifted up upon the cross for the redemption of the world. St. Matthew (Matthew 26:3) tells us that they were gathered together "unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas." It was necessary to state his name, because the high priests were now frequently changed by the Roman power. </body></html>
