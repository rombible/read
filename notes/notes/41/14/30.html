It was instituted by the example and the practice of our Master, to remain in force till his second coming. It was instituted with blessing and giving of thanks, to be a memorial of Christ's death. Frequent mention is made of his precious blood, as the price of our redemption. How comfortable is this to poor repenting sinners, that the blood of Christ is shed for many! If for many, why not for me? It was a sign of the conveyance of the benefits purchased for us by his death. Apply the doctrine of Christ crucified to yourselves; let it be meat and drink to your souls, strengthening and refreshing your spiritual life. It was to be an earnest and foretaste of the happiness of heaven, and thereby to put us out of taste for the pleasures and delights of sense. Every one that has tasted spiritual delights, straightway desires eternal ones. Though the great Shepherd passed through his sufferings without one false step, yet his followers often have been scattered by the small measure of sufferings allotted to them. How very apt we are to think well of ourselves, and to trust our own hearts! It was ill done of Peter thus to answer his Master, and not with fear and trembling.

The day had begun. It began at six in the evening. It was already advanced. This second crowing of the cock is mentioned by St. Mark only; and it forms an additional aggravation of Peter's sin. The "cockcrowing" was a term used for one of the divisions of the night (see <a href="/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35</a>). But it appears that there were three times at which the cock-crowing might be expected - namely, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span>  early in the night, between eleven and twelve; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> between one and two; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> between five and six. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The two cock crowings here referred to would be the two last of the three here mentioned.
