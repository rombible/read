Do we give him the precious ointment of our best affections? Let us love him with all the heart, though it is common for zeal and affection to be misunderstood and blamed; and remember that charity to the poor will not excuse any from particular acts of piety to the Lord Jesus. Christ commended this woman's pious attention to the notice of believers in all ages. Those who honour Christ he will honour. Covetousness was Judas' master lust, and that betrayed him to the sin of betraying his Master; the devil suited his temptation to that, and so conquered him. And see what wicked contrivances many have in their sinful pursuits; but what appears to forward their plans, will prove curses in the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She hath done what she could - She has showed the highest attachment in her power; and it was, as it is now, a sufficient argument against there being any "real" waste, that it was done for the honor of Christ.

She hath done what she could&#8212;a noble testimony, embodying a principle of immense importance.<p>she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying&#8212;or, as in John (Joh 12:7), "Against the day of my burying hath she kept this." Not that she, dear heart, thought of His burial, much less reserved any of her nard to anoint her dead Lord. But as the time was so near at hand when that office would have to be performed, and she was not to have that privilege even after the spices were brought for the purpose (Mr 16:1), He lovingly regards it as done now. "In the act of love done to Him," says Olshausen beautifully, "she has erected to herself an eternal monument, as lasting as the Gospel, the eternal Word of God. From generation to generation this remarkable prophecy of the Lord has been fulfilled; and even we, in explaining this saying of the Redeemer, of necessity contribute to its accomplishment." "Who but Himself," asks Stier, "had the power to ensure to any work of man, even if resounding in His own time through the whole earth, an imperishable remembrance in the stream of history? Behold once more here the majesty of His royal judicial supremacy in the government of the world, in this, 'Verily I say unto you.'"<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/mark/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/mark/14-4.htm" title="And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?">Mark 14:4</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/mark/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>She hath done what she could,....

Christ signifies by this, that he should shortly die, and that this woman came before hand to anoint him, and, as it were, to perform the funeral rites before he was dead; it being revealed to her by the Spirit, that Jesus would quickly die, and she should not be able to perform this good work when dead, and therefore came to do it before; or, at least, she was directed by the Spirit of God, because she would be prevented doing it afterwards; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/26-12.htm">Matthew 26:12</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/mark/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</span><p>(4) This woman, by the secret influence of the Spirit, anoints Christ, and thus sets before men's eyes his death and burial which were at hand.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/mark/14.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/mark/14-8.htm" title="She has done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body to the burying.">Mark 14:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἔσχεν</span> (suppl. <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν</span>), what she had to do she did; the reference being not to the measure of her power (wealth) but to her opportunity: she did what lay to her hand, and could only be done <span class="ital">then</span>.—<span class="greekheb">προέλαβε μυρίσαι</span>, she anticipated the anointing; the latter verb here only, the former in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-21.htm" title="For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>, <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐνταφιασμόν</span>: the noun answering to the verb in Mt., here and in John and in one place in the classics.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/mark/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">she is come aforehand</span>] The word thus rendered only occurs three times in the New Testament.

She seized the opportunity, which might not occur again, of doing honor to her Lord by anointing him with her very best.

But instead of dwelling on these things, he said, <span class="cmt_word">She hath anointed my body aforehand for the burying</span>. Our Lord here, of course, alludes to the spices and ointments with which the Jews wrapped up the bodies of their dead before their burial. Not that this was what Mary intended. She could hardly have dreamed of his death and burial so near at hand. But she was moved by the Holy Spirit to do this, at this particular time, as though in anticipation of his death and burial. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>She hath done what she could (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., what she had she did.
