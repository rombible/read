But our Lord knows all things about us before they come to pass. If we admit him, he will dwell in our hearts. The Son of man goes, as it is written of him, as a lamb to the slaughter; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed! God's permitting the sins of men, and bringing glory to himself out of them, does not oblige them to sin; nor will this be any excuse for their guilt, or lessen their punishment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A large upper room - The word used here denotes the upper room devoted to purposes of prayer, repose, and often of eating.

At this point it may be well to try to realise the manner in which the Passover was celebrated amongst the Jews in the time of our Lord. (i) With the Passover, by Divine ordinance, there had always been eaten two or three flat cakes of unleavened bread (<a href="/exodus/12-18.htm" title="In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.">Exodus 12:18</a>), and the rites of the feast by immemorial usage had been regulated according to the succession of four cups of red wine always mixed with water (<a href="/psalms/16-5.htm" title="The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.">Psalm 16:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm" title="You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/116-13.htm" title="I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of the LORD.">Psalm 116:13</a>). These were placed before the master of the house where the Paschal Feast was celebrated, or the most eminent guest, who was called the Celebrant, the President, or Proclaimer of the Feast. (ii) After those assembled had reclined, he took one of the Four Cups, known as the “Cup of Consecration,” in his right hand, and pronounced the benediction over the wine and the feast, saying, “<span class="ital">Blessed be Thou, Jehovah, our God, Thou King of the universe, Who hast created the fruit of the vine</span>,” He then tasted the Cup and passed it round. (iii) Water was then brought in, and he washed, followed by the rest, the hands being dipped in water. (iv) The table was then set out with the bitter herbs, such as lettuce, endive, succory, and horehound, the sauce called <span class="ital">Charoseth</span>, and the Passover lamb. (v) The Celebrant then once more blessed God for the fruits of the earth, and taking a portion of the bitter herbs, dipped it in the <span class="ital">charoseth</span>, and ate a piece of it of “the size of an olive,” and his example was followed by the rest. (vi) The <span class="ital">Haggadah</span> or “shewing forth” (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-26.htm" title="For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come.">1 Corinthians 11:26</a>) now commenced, and the Celebrant declared the circumstances of the delivery from Egypt, as commanded by the Law (<a href="/exodus/12-27.htm" title="That you shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.">Exodus 12:27</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-8.htm" title="And you shall show your son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did to me when I came forth out of Egypt.">Exodus 13:8</a>). (vii) Then the second Cup of wine was filled, and a child or proselyte inquired, “<span class="ital">What mean ye by this service?</span>” (<a href="/exodus/12-26.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean you by this service?">Exodus 12:26</a>), to which reply was made according to a prescribed formula or liturgy. The first part of the “Hallel,” Psalms 113, 114, was then sung, and the second Cup was solemnly drunk. (viii) The Celebrant now washed his hands again, and taking two of the unleavened cakes, broke one of them, and pronounced the thanksgiving in these words, “<span class="ital">Blessed be Thou, O Lord our God, Thou King of the universe, Who bringest forth fruit out of the earth</span>.” Then he distributed a portion to each, and all wrapping some bitter herbs round their portion dipped it in the <span class="ital">charoseth</span> and ate it. (ix) The flesh of the lamb was now eaten, and the Master of the house, lifting up his hands, gave thanks over the third Cup of wine, known as the “Cup of Blessing,” and handed it round to each person. (x) After thanking for the food of which they had partaken and for their redemption from Egypt, a fourth Cup, known as the “Cup of Joy,” was filled and drunk, and the remainder of the Hallel (Psalms 115-118) was sung.

This would consist in obtaining the Paschal lamb, and taking it to the temple to be sacrificed by the priests. It would  then be brought to the house to be cooked; and the unleavened bread, the bitter herbs and the wine would have to be provided, and the water for purification. After all these preparations had been made, the two disciples would return to their Master. </body></html>
