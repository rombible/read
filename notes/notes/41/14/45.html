Peter wounded one of the band. It is easier to fight for Christ than to die for him. But there is a great difference between faulty disciples and hypocrites. The latter rashly and without thought call Christ Master, and express great affection for him, yet betray him to his enemies.

It is possible that this was the usual mode with which the disciples greeted Christ when they returned to him after any absence. But Judas abused this token of friendship, using it for a base and treacherous purpose. St. Chrysostom says that he felt assured by the gentleness of Christ that he would not repel him, or that, if he did, the treacherous action would have answered its purpose. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Kissed<p>See on <a href="/matthew/26-49.htm">Matthew 26:49</a>. </body></html>
