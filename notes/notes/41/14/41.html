He began to be sorely amazed; words not used in St. Matthew, but very full of meaning. The terrors of God set themselves in array against him, and he allowed him to contemplate them. Never was sorrow like unto his at this time. Now he was made a curse for us; the curses of the law were laid upon him as our Surety. He now tasted death, in all the bitterness of it. This was that fear of which the apostle speaks, the natural fear of pain and death, at which human nature startles. Can we ever entertain favourable, or even slight thoughts of sin, when we see the painful sufferings which sin, though but reckoned to him, brought on the Lord Jesus? Shall that sit light upon our souls, which sat so heavy upon his? Was Christ in such agony for our sins, and shall we never be in agony about them? How should we look upon Him whom we have pierced, and mourn! It becomes us to be exceedingly sorrowful for sin, because He was so, and never to mock at it. Christ, as Man, pleaded, that, if it were possible, his sufferings might pass from him. As Mediator, he submitted to the will of God, saying, Nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou wilt; I bid it welcome. See how the sinful weakness of Christ's disciples returns, and overpowers them. What heavy clogs these bodies of ours are to our souls! But when we see trouble at the door, we should get ready for it. Alas, even believers often look at the Redeemer's sufferings in a drowsy manner, and instead of being ready to die with Christ, they are not even prepared to watch with him one hour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is enough - There has been much difficulty in determining the meaning of this phrase. Campbell translates it, "all is over" - that is, the time when you could have been of service to me is gone by. They might have aided him by watching for him when they were sleeping, but now the time was past, and he was already, as it were, in the hands of his enemies. It is not improbable, however, that after his agony some time elapsed before Judas came. He had required them to watch - that is, to keep awake during that season of agony. After that they might have been suffered to sleep, while Jesus watched alone. As he saw Judas approach he probably roused them, saying, It is sufficient - as much repose has been taken as is allowable - the enemy is near, and the Son of man is about to be betrayed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/mark/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 14:32-42.

V[135] = <span class="ital">sufficit</span> in Vulgate; one of the puzzling words in Mk.’s vocabulary to which many meanings have been given. Beza, in doubt as to Jerome’s interpretation, was satisfied at last by a quotation from Anacreon coming into his mind, in which the poet, giving instructions to a painter for the portrait of his mistress, concludes: <span class="greekheb">ἀπέχει</span>. <span class="greekheb">βλέπω γὰρ αὐτήν</span>· <span class="greekheb">τάχα</span>, <span class="greekheb">κηρέ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ λαλήσεις</span> = “Enough! the girl herself I view: so like, ’twill soon be speaking, too”.

Most modern commentators accept the rendering, “it is enough”. <span class="ital">Vide</span> an interesting note in Field’s <span class="ital">Otium Nor</span>.

But it is far more consistent with his usual considerate words to suppose that, sympathizing with the infirmity of his disciples, he simply advised them, now that his bitter agony was over, to take some rest during the brief interval that remained. It is <span class="accented">enough.</span> Some commentators have thought that the somewhat difficult Greek verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) would be better rendered, <span class="accented">he is at a distance</span>; as though our Lord meant to say, "There is yet time for you to take some rest. The betrayer is some distance off." Such an interpretation would require a full. stop between the clause now rendered, "it is enough," and the clause, "the hour is come;" so that the passage would read, "Sleep on now, and take your rest; he (that is, Judas) is yet a good way off." Then there would be an interval; and then our Lord would rouse them up with the words, "The hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners." This interpretation all hangs upon the true rendering of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, which, although it might be taken to. mean "he," or "it is distant," is nevertheless quite capable of the ordinary interpretation, "it sufficeth." According to the high authority of Hesychius, who explains it by the words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, it seems safer on the whole to accept the ordinary meaning, "It is enough." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/mark/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>It is enough (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Peculiar to Mark.
