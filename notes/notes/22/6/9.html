Christ goes forth subduing his enemies, while his followers gain victories over the world, the flesh, and the devil. He shows the tenderness of a Redeemer, the delight he takes in his redeemed people, and the workings of his own grace in them. True believers alone can possess the beauty of holiness. And when their real character is known, it will be commended. Both the church and believers, at their first conversion, look forth as the morning, their light being small, but increasing. As to their sanctification, they are fair as the moon, deriving all their light, grace, and holiness from Christ; and as to justification, clear as the sun, clothed with Christ, the Sun of righteousness, and fighting the good fight of faith, under the banners of Christ, against all spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The king contrasts the bride with the other claimants for her royal estate or favor Sol 6:8.

Of these titles, see Sol 2:14. Christ's church is called one, in distinction from the many before mentioned; and either designs her small number, in comparison of the nations of the world, and of false churches, like one to sixty or eighty, and even to an innumerable company; see <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:14</a>, <a href="/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>; or else her unity in herself, being but one general assembly and church of the firstborn, made up of various particular congregated churches; and "one body", consisting of various members, united together in affection, and partakers of the same grace, blessings, and privileges; actuated by "one Spirit", the Spirit of God, <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>; and having but "one Head", Christ Jesus, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>, and it may signify that the church is the spouse of Christ; that though other princes may have sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and virgins without number, to wait on them, Sol 6:8; Christ had but one, and was well pleased with her, and desired no other; <p>she is the only one of her mother; the Jerusalem above, the mother of us all: or the sense is, she was to Christ as a mother's only child, most tenderly beloved by him; <p>she is the choice one of her that bare her; esteemed and loved best of all her mother's children. The word may be rendered, "the pure" or "clean one" (l); so the church is, as clothed in "clean" linen, the righteousness of Christ; cleansed from sin in his blood; sprinkled with the clean water of the covenant, and of an unspotted conversation. <p>The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her: it may seem strange that concubines should praise a queen; but it was not unusual in the eastern countries; with the Persians, as the queen admitted of many concubines by the order of her lord the king, so the queen was had in great veneration, and even adored by the concubines (m): which may respect either the great esteem the church had, or should have, in the world, even from the great men of it, as she will have in the latter day, <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>; or which young converts have for her; who may more especially be meant by the "daughters" and "virgins", who, in Sol 6:1, call the church the "fairest among women": these blessed her, and pronounced her happy, and wished all happiness to her; they "praised her", spoke well of her, and commended her for her beauty; which was pleasing to Christ, and therefore observed by him. <p>(l) "munda", Montanus, Mercerus; "pura", Vatablus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Marckius, Michaelis.

The only thing against this is that the adj. <span class="ital">bar</span> is not used in the O.T. in any sense but ‘pure’ or ‘clean’ (see <span class="ital">Oxf. Lex</span>.).

On our view, it would be quite natural, and unless the bride be brought in some such way as we suppose into connexion with Solomon’s court it is impossible to imagine how this verse could be true. Budde admits the difficulty, but gets over it in a very light-hearted fashion. He admits that a figure of speech which would permit the bridegroom who is called Solomon only because he is a bridegroom, to refer with scorn to the hareem of the actual Solomon, would be bold; but in a somewhat obscure sentence he says it hardly goes beyond what is possible in the circumstances as he supposes them to be. Few, we imagine, will be of that opinion.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>3 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Who feeds among the lilies,<p>Shulamith farther proceeds, followed by the daughters of Jerusalem, to seek her friend lost through her own fault.
