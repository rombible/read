Christ goes forth subduing his enemies, while his followers gain victories over the world, the flesh, and the devil. He shows the tenderness of a Redeemer, the delight he takes in his redeemed people, and the workings of his own grace in them. True believers alone can possess the beauty of holiness. And when their real character is known, it will be commended. Both the church and believers, at their first conversion, look forth as the morning, their light being small, but increasing. As to their sanctification, they are fair as the moon, deriving all their light, grace, and holiness from Christ; and as to justification, clear as the sun, clothed with Christ, the Sun of righteousness, and fighting the good fight of faith, under the banners of Christ, against all spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even for the king the gentle eyes of the bride have an awe-striking majesty. Such is the condescension of love. Now follows Sol 6:5-7 the longest of the repetitions which abound in the Song, marking the continuance of the king's affection as when first solemnly proclaimed Sol 4:1-6. The two descriptions belong, according to some (Christian) expositors, to the Church of different periods, e. g. to the primitive Church in the splendor of her first vocation, and to the Church under Constantine; other (Jewish) expositors apply them to "the congregation of Israel" under the first and second temples respectively.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/songs/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

That part of the description, respecting the church's lips and speech, in Sol 4:3; is here omitted, though added at the end of Sol 6:6; by the Septuagint; but is not in the Hebrew copies, nor taken notice of in the Targum; yea, the Masorah, on Sol 4:2, remarks some words as only used in that place, and therefore could not be repeated here in the copies then in use. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/songs/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The daughters of Jerusalem now offer to seek along with Shulamith for her beloved, who had turned away and was gone.<p>1 Whither has thy beloved gone,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou fairest of women?<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Whither has thy beloved turned,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That we may seek him with thee?<p>The longing remains with her even after she has wakened, as the after effect of her dream.
