By a playful turn the poet heightens the description of the lover’s beauty by the impression supposed to be produced on the imaginary bystanders to whom the picture has been exhibited. They express a desire to share the pleasures of his company with the heroine, but she, under the figure before employed (<a href="/context/songs/4-12.htm" title="A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.">Song of Solomon 4:12-16</a>), declares that his affections are solely hers, and that, so far from being at their disposal, he is even now hastening to complete his and her happiness in their union. Difficulties crowd on the dramatic theory at this passage. Most of its advocates have recourse to some arbitrary insertion, such as, “here the lovers are re-united,” but they do not tell us how the distance from the harem at Jerusalem to the garden in the north was traversed, or the obstacles to the union surmounted. In the imagination of the poet all was easy and natural.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/songs/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/songs/6-1.htm" title="Where is your beloved gone, O you fairest among women? where is your beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with you....">Song of Solomon 6:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Whither is thy beloved gone </span>— Namely, from thee: see chap. 5:6, 8.

The title is the same used by them, and by Christ before them, Sol 1:8; and here repeated, to assure her that they were serious in asking this question, and that it was in great respect to her they put it; and which, to the same sense, in other words, is expressed, <p>whither is thy beloved turned aside? which way did he take? on what hand did he turn, to the right or left, when he went from thy door? They ask no longer who or what he was, being satisfied with the church's description of him; by which they had gained some knowledge of him, and had their affections drawn out unto him; and were desirous of knowing more of him and of being better acquainted with him, and to enjoy his company and presence; though as yet they had but little faith in him, and therefore could not call him "their" beloved, only "her" beloved: and this question is put and repeated in this manner, to show that they were serious and in earnest; yea, were in haste, and impatient to know which way he went; say they, <p>that we may seek him with thee; it was not mere speculation or curiosity that led them to put the above questions; they were desirous to go into practice, to join with the church in the search of Christ, to seek him with her in the word and ordinances; upon which they were determined, could they get any hint from her whither he was gone, and where it was most likely to find him: for so the words may be rendered, "and we will seek him with thee" (p); this they had resolved on among themselves, and only wanted directions which way to steer their course, or a grant to go along with the church in quest of her beloved. <p>(p)  Sept.

Whither hath thy beloved turned him, that we may seek him with thee?</span> The dialogue still continues, possibly because, as Delitzsch suggests, the effect of the dream which Shulamith narrates is not passed away in the morning. Under the influence of it she goes forth and meets the daughters of Jerusalem, who offer their assistance. But there is no necessity for this. The poetry merely demands that the idea of the dream should  be still kept before the mind of the reader. The scene is still in the palace. The ladies playfully carry on the bride's cue, and help her to pour out her feelings. The bridegroom, they know, is near at hand, and is coming to delight himself in his bride; but the bride has not yet drawn him back completely to her side. This is evident from the fact that there is no distress in the language of the bride. She is not complaining and crying out in agony under a sense of desertion; she is waiting for the return of her beloved, and so she calmly sings of his love and his perfect truthfulness, even though absent from her. He is where his perfect beauty and fragrance might well be. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11 His head is precious fine gold,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His locks hill upon hill,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black as the raven.<p>The word-connection &#1508;&#1468;&#1494; &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501;, occurring only here, serves as a designation of the very finest pure gold; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; (hiding, then that which is hidden), from &#1499;&#1514;&#1501;, R. &#1499;&#1514; (vid., concerning the words appertaining to this root, under <a href="/psalms/87-6.htm">Psalm 87:6</a>), is the name of fine gold, which was guarded as a jewel (cf. <a href="/proverbs/25-12.htm">Proverbs 25:12</a>), and &#1508;&#1468;&#1494; (with long a&#772;), is pure gold freed from inferior metals, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1494;&#1494;, to set free, and generally violently to free (cf. zahav muphaz, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>, with zahav tahor, <a href="/2_chronicles/9-17.htm">2 Chronicles 9:17</a>). The Targ. to the Hagiog. translate &#1508;&#1494; by &#1488;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1494;&#1488; (e.g., <a href="/psalms/119-127.htm">Psalm 119:127</a>), or &#1488;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; (e.g., <a href="/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>), &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, i.e., gold which has stood the fire-proof (obrussa) of the cupel or the crucible. Grammatically regarded, the word-connection kethem paz is not genit., like kethem ophir, but appositional, like narrah bethulah, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-28.htm">Deuteronomy 22:28</a>, zevahim shelamim, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, etc. The point of comparison is the imposing nobility of the fine form and noble carriage of his head. In the description of the locks of his hair the lxx render &#1514;&#1500;&#1514;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, Jerome by sicut elatae palmarum, like the young twigs, the young shoots of the palm. Ewald regards it as a harder parall. form of &#1494;&#1500;&#1494;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>, vine-branches; and Hitzig compares the Thousand and One Nights, iii. 180, where the loose hair of a maiden is likened to twisted clusters of grapes. The possibility of this meaning is indisputable, although (Arab.) taltalat, a drinking-vessel made of the inner bark of palm-branches, is named, not from taltalah, as the name of the palm-branch, but from taltala, to shake down, viz., in the throat. The palm-branch, or the vine-branch, would be named from &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;, pendulum esse, to hang loosely and with a wavering motion, the freq. of &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, pendere. The Syr. also think on &#1514;&#1500;&#1492;, for it translates "spread out," i.e., a waving downward; and the Venet., which translates by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;. The point of comparison would be the freshness and flexibility of the abundant long hair of the head, in contrast to motionless close-lying smoothness. One may think of Jupiter, who, when he shakes his head, moves heaven and earth. But, as against this, we have the fact: (1) That the language has other names for palm-branches and vine-branches; the former are called in the Sol 7:9, sansinnim. (2) That &#1514;&#1500;&#1514;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, immediately referred to the hair, but not in the sense of "hanging locks" (Bttch.), is still in use in the post-bibl. Heb. (vid., under Sol 5:2); the Targ. also, in translating &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, cumuli cumuli, thinks &#1514;&#1500;&#1514;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, Menachoth 29b. A hill is called &#1514;&#1500;, (Arab.) tall, from &#1496;&#1500;&#1500;, prosternere, to throw along, as of earth thrown out, sand, or rubbish; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;, after the form &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, in use probably only in the plur., is a hilly country which rises like steps, or presents an undulating appearance. Seen fro his neck upwards, his hair forms in undulating lines, hill upon hill. In colour, these locks of hair are black as a raven, which bears the Semitic name &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1489; from its blackness (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;), but in India is called ka&#770;rava from its croaking. The raven-blackness of the hair contrasts with the whiteness and redness of the countenance, which shines forth as from a dark ground, from a black border. The eyes are next described. </body></html>
