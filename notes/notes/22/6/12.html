But not in the retirement of the idle, the self-indulgent, or the trifler. When the Christian is released from the discharge of his duties in life, the world has no attractions for him. His prayer is, that all things belonging to the Spirit may live and grow within him, and around him. Such are the interesting cares and employments of him whom the world wrongly deems unhappy, and lost to his true interests. In humility and self-abasement, the humble Christian would turn away from the sight of all; but the Lord delights to honour him. Chiefly, however, may the reference be to the ministering angels who shall be sent for the soul of the Christian. Their approach may startle, but the departing soul shall find the Lord its strength and its portion for ever. The church is called the Shulamite: the word signifies perfection and peace; not in herself, but in Christ, in whom she is complete, through his righteousness; and has peace, which he made for her through his blood, and gives unto her by his Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The bride's words may be paraphrased: "You speak of me as a glorious beauty; I was lately but a simple maiden engaged in rustic toils. I went down one day into the walnut-garden" (the walnut abounded on the shores of Lake Gennesaret, and is still common in Northern Palestine) "to inspect the young plants of the vale" (i. e., the wady, or watercourse, with now verdant banks in the early spring after the rainy season), "and to watch the budding and blossoming of vine and pomegranate." Compare Sol 2:11-13 notes. "Then, suddenly, ere I was myself aware, my soul" (the love-bound heart) "had made me the chariot of a lordly people" (i. e., an exalted personage, one who resides on the high places of the earth; compare <a href="/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>, where Elijah and Elisha, as the spiritual leaders of the nation, are "the chariot and horsemen of Israel," compare also <a href="/isaiah/22-18.htm">Isaiah 22:18</a>). This last clause is another instance of the love for military similitudes in the writer of the Song.<p>Ammi-nadib - literally, my people a noble one. The reference is either to Israel at large as a wealthy and dominant nation, under Solomon, or to the bride's people (the Shulamites) in particular, to the chief place among whom, by her union with the king, she is now exalted. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/songs/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

Ammi-nadib is supposed to be some eminent charioteer then well known, and famous for his speed in driving chariots.

These are either the words of the church or of Christ, saying, "I know not" (y) as the first clause may be rendered: if the words of the church, the sense may be, that though she knew not where her beloved was gone, when he went from her, yet she ran about in search of him as swiftly as the chariots of Amminadib; and when she did know that he was gone down into the garden, immediately, on a sudden, at an unawares, such was the strength of her love and affection to him, the she moved as swiftly after him as if she had been in one of those chariots; and this may signify also her courage and resolution, that, notwithstanding all difficulties and discouragements she met with, she drove on as briskly and as courageously after him as ever Amminadib did, in one of his chariots, in the field of battle: or, "I know not"; whether in the body or out of the body; such was the rapture and ecstasy she was in, when she heard her beloved say, "I went down into the garden of nuts", &amp;c. or, when she heard the daughters' commendations of her, she did not think that such belonged to her, and therefore said, "I know not"; however, this caused her to make the greater haste to answer such characters, and to enjoy the company of her beloved. But rather they are the words of Christ, who was now in his garden, observing the condition it was in, and says, "I know not", or do not perceive (z), that it was in a fruitful and flourishing case, and therefore took all the speedy methods he could to bring it into a better; or being in a transport of love to his church, it caused him speedily to return unto her, and grant her his presence; offer all necessary assistance, and be as chariots to her, to carry her through difficulties, and to protect and defend her from all enemies: and this his soul caused him to do, not her worth and worthiness, love and loveliness, but his own good will and pleasure, and cordial affection for her. Many take Amminadib to be the proper name of a person, who was one of Solomon's chariot drivers, that understood his business well, and drove swiftly, and with success, to whom Christ compares himself, when returning to his church with haste: but I rather think, with Jarchi, Aben Ezra, and others, that it is an appellative, consisting of two words, "ammi", my people, and "nadib", willing or princely, and may be rendered, "the chariots of my willing" or "princely people" (a); meaning, not angels, nor ministers, but the people of Christ themselves, to whom he is as chariots; for so I should choose to translate the words, "my soul made me as chariots to my willing" or "princely people"; and so describes the persons who share in this instance of his grace; they are such who are made willing by Christ, in the day of his power on them, to be saved by him, and serve him, <a href="/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>; and who are of a free, princely, and munificent spirit, <a href="/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>; being princes, and the sons and daughters of a prince, Sol 7:1; to these Christ makes himself as chariots, as he now was to the church, and took her up along with him to enjoy his presence, she had sought for and desired. Wherefore the daughters of Jerusalem, who had accompanied her hitherto in search of him, perceiving she was going from then, say what follows. <p>(y)  , Sept. "nescivi", V. L. "non novi", Montanus.

This is probably the most difficult verse in the whole book to interpret satisfactorily. Perhaps it may best be rendered as in R.V. <span class="bld">my soul</span> (or, <span class="bld">desire</span>, marg.) <span class="bld">set me among the chariots of my princely people</span>. That <span class="ital">nephesh</span> may mean ‘appetite’ or ‘desire’ is clear from <a href="/proverbs/23-2.htm" title="And put a knife to your throat, if you be a man given to appetite.">Proverbs 23:2</a>. So taken, the words would mean that when she was engaged in inspecting and enjoying the gardens, suddenly, before she knew, her longing to see the plants brought her among the chariots of her noble people, i.e. of noble people who were hers, i.e. rulers of her land. She suddenly came upon the train of King Solomon, as they were on the way from or to some royal dwelling in the North. But it must be confessed that the translation of Ammi-nadib as ‘my princely people’ is not very satisfactory, though the omission of the article with the adj. after a noun defined by a pronominal suffix is not uncommon. (Cp. Ges.-K. <span class="ital">Gramm</span>. § 126, <span class="ital">h</span> and <span class="ital">z</span>). The text may be corrupt, but the extensive changes of reading proposed by Budde, Grätz, and Cheyne do not mend matters much, and are none of them convincing. But if the meaning we have found in these words is even generally correct, it is fatal to Budde’s theory that the book is a mere collection of unconnected marriage songs. Nothing can be made of them on that hypothesis, and all who support it have to get rid of them, either by amending them, or excising them.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>5a Turn away thine eyes from me,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For overpoweringly they assail me.<p>Dpke translates, ferocire me faciunt; Hengst.: they make me proud; but although &#1492;&#1512;&#1492;&#1497;&#1489;, after <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/138-3.htm">Psalm 138:3</a>, may be thus used, yet that would be an effect produced by the eyes, which certainly would suggest the very opposite of the request to turn them away. The verb &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; means to be impetuous, and to press impetuously against any one; the Hiph. is the intens. of this trans. signification of the Kal: to press overpoweringly against one, to infuse terror, terrorem incutere. The lxx translates it by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, which is also used of the effect of terror ("to make to start up"), and the Syr. by afred, to put to flight, because arheb signifies to put in fear, as also arhab  equals  khawwaf, terrefacere; but here the meaning of the verb corresponds more with the sense of Arab. r''b, to be placed in the state of ro'b, i.e., of paralyzing terror. If she directed her large, clear, penetrating eyes to him, he must sink his own: their glance is unbearable by him. This peculiar form the praise of her eyes here assume; but then the description proceeds as at Sol 4:1, Sol 2:3. The words used there in praise of her hair, her teeth, and her cheeks, are here repeated.<p>5b Thy hair is like a flock of goats<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which repose downwards on Giliad.<p>6 Thy teeth like a flock of lambs<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Which come up from the washing,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; All of them bearing twins,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And a bereaved one is not among them.<p>7 Like a piece of pomegranate thy temples<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind thy veil.<p>The repetition is literal, but yet not without change in the expression, - there, &#1490;&#1500; &#1502;&#1492;&#1512;, here, &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;; there, &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509;, tonsarum, here, &#1492;&#1512;&#1495;, agnarum (Symm., Venet. &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;); for &#1512;&#1495;&#1500;, in its proper signification, is like the Arab. rachil, richl, richleh, the female lamb, and particularly the ewe. Hitzig imagines that Solomon here repeats to Shulamith what he had said to another donna chosen for marriage, and that the flattery becomes insipid by repetition to Shulamith, as well as also to the reader. But the romance which he finds in the Song is not this itself, but his own palimpsest, in the style of Lucian's transformed ass. The repetition has a morally better reason, and not one so subtle. Shulamith appears to Solomon yet more beautiful than on the day when she was brought to him as his bride. His love is still the same, unchanged; and this both she and the reader or hearer must conclude from these words of praise, repeated now as they were then. There is no one among the ladies of the court whom he prefers to her, - these must themselves acknowledge her superiority. </body></html>
