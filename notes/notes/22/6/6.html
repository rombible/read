Christ goes forth subduing his enemies, while his followers gain victories over the world, the flesh, and the devil. He shows the tenderness of a Redeemer, the delight he takes in his redeemed people, and the workings of his own grace in them. True believers alone can possess the beauty of holiness. And when their real character is known, it will be commended. Both the church and believers, at their first conversion, look forth as the morning, their light being small, but increasing. As to their sanctification, they are fair as the moon, deriving all their light, grace, and holiness from Christ; and as to justification, clear as the sun, clothed with Christ, the Sun of righteousness, and fighting the good fight of faith, under the banners of Christ, against all spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even for the king the gentle eyes of the bride have an awe-striking majesty. Such is the condescension of love. Now follows Sol 6:5-7 the longest of the repetitions which abound in the Song, marking the continuance of the king's affection as when first solemnly proclaimed Sol 4:1-6. The two descriptions belong, according to some (Christian) expositors, to the Church of different periods, e. g. to the primitive Church in the splendor of her first vocation, and to the Church under Constantine; other (Jewish) expositors apply them to "the congregation of Israel" under the first and second temples respectively.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/songs/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

The meaning, "the mouth for kissing," which Bttch. gives to the word, is fanciful; &#1495;&#1498; ( equals  h&#803;nk, Arab. h&#803;anak) is the inner palate and the region of the throat, with the uvula underneath the chin. Partly with reference to his words, his lips have been already praised, 13b; but there the fragrance of his breath came into consideration, his breath both in itself and as serving for the formation of articulate words. But the naming of the palate can point to nothing else than his words. With this the description comes to a conclusion; for, from the speech, the most distinct and immediate expression of the personality, advance is made finally to the praise of the person. The pluraliatant. &#1502;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; designate what they mention in richest fulness. His palate, i.e., that which he speaks and the manner in which he speaks it, is true sweetness (cf. <a href="/proverbs/16-21.htm">Proverbs 16:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-15.htm">Psalm 55:15</a>), and his whole being true loveliness.
