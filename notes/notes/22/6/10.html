And when their real character is known, it will be commended. Both the church and believers, at their first conversion, look forth as the morning, their light being small, but increasing. As to their sanctification, they are fair as the moon, deriving all their light, grace, and holiness from Christ; and as to justification, clear as the sun, clothed with Christ, the Sun of righteousness, and fighting the good fight of faith, under the banners of Christ, against all spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chorus address the bride here only as the Shulamite, and beg her to perform for their entertainment a sacred dance (see Sol 6:13) of her own country.

These words may be connected with the preceding, by a supplement of the word "saying"; and so may express what the daughters said, when they blessed and praised the church, wondering at her beauty, it being like the rising morning; so Helena is said to show her beautiful face,  as the morning, when it springs forth (n): there was a city in the tribe of Reuben, called Zarethshahar, the beauty or splendour of the morning, <a href="/joshua/13-19.htm">Joshua 13:19</a>. Homer often describes the morning by her rosy fingers (o), and as clothed with a saffron garment (p), and as beautiful and divine (q), and fair haired (r); and as on a golden throne and beautiful (s). And as these words describe the progressive gradations of light, so they may set forth the state and condition of the church in the several ages of the world; its first state in this clause, which may reach from the first dawn of light to Adam, <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; increasing in the times of the patriarchs, Noah, Abraham, and Jacob, and in which and to whom were various displays of Gospel light and grace; to the time of the giving of the law by Moses, when the church might be said to be <p>fair as the moon; which, though it receives its light from the sun, yet splendour and brightness are ascribed to it, <a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>; and, by other writers (t), is represented as fair and beautiful; and the beautiful form of persons is expressed by it (u): and very fitly is the state of the church under the law signified by the moon, by which the ceremonial law seems intended, in <a href="/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>; that lying much in the observation of new moons, by the which the several festivals under the law were regulated; and which law gave light in the night of Jewish darkness, into the person, offices, and grace of Christ; and though it was imperfect, variable, waxed old, and at length vanished away, yet the church under it was "fair"; there being a beauty and amiableness in the worship of that dispensation, <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>. The next clause, "clear as the sun", may describe the church under the Gospel dispensation; when the "sun of righteousness" arose, and made the famous Gospel day; when the shadows of the old law fled away, Christ, the substance, being come; when there were more light and knowledge, and a clear discerning of spiritual and evangelic things: and, in all those periods, the church was "terrible as an army with banners"; to her enemies, being in a militant state; See Gill on Sol 6:4. The whole of this may be applied to particular believers; who, at first conversion, "look forth as the morning", their light being small, but increasing; and, as to their sanctification, are "fair as the moon", having their spots and imperfections, and deriving all their light, grace, and holiness, from Christ; and, as to their justification, <p>clear as the sun, being clothed with Christ, the sun of righteousness, <a href="/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>; and so all fair and without spot; <p>and terrible as an army with banners, fighting the good fight of faith, under the banners of Christ, against all spiritual enemies. <p>(n) Theocrit.

The word rendered "looketh forth" is literally "bendeth forward," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in order to look out or forth (cf. <a href="/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2</a>), LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> Venet., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. <a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>, "stooping down and looking into the Word as into well"). The idea seems to be that of a rising luminary, looking forth from the background,  breaking through the shades of the garden, like the morning star appearing above the horizon (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Venetian) (cf. <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>, where the morning star is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>).

The fierce rays of the Eastern sun are terrible to those who encounter them. The glory of the Church is a glory overwhelming as against all that opposes it. The description is pure hyperbole as applied to a fair bride, referring to the blazing beauty of her face and adornments, but symbolically it has always been felt a precious contribution to religious language. Perhaps no sentence in the Old Testament has been more frequently on the lips of devout men, especially when they have been speaking of the victories of the truth and the glowing prospects of the Saviour's kingdom. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With Sol 6:4 Solomon's address is resumed, and a new scene opens. Shulamith had found him again, and she who is beautiful in herself appears now so much the more beautiful, when the joy of seeing him again irradiates her whole being.<p>4 Beautiful art thou, my friend, as Tirzah,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Comely as Jerusalem,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrible as a battle-array.<p>In the praise of her beauty we hear the voice of the king. The cities which are the highest ornament of his kingdom serve him as the measure of her beauty, which is designated according to the root conceptions by &#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, after the equality of completeness; by &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, after the quality of that which is well-becoming, pleasing. It is concluded, from the prominence given to Tirzah, that the Song was not composed till after the division of the kingdom, and that its author was an inhabitant of the northern kingdom; for Tirzah was the first royal city of this kingdom till the time of Omri, the founder of Samaria. But since, at all events, it is Solomon who here speaks, so great an historical judgment ought surely to be ascribed to a later poet who has imagined himself in the exact position of Solomon, that he would not represent the king of the undivided Israel as speaking like a king of the separate kingdom of Israel. The prominence given to Tirzah has another reason. Tirzah was discovered by Robinson on his second journey, 1852, in which Van de Velde accompanied him, on a height in the mountain range to the north of Nabls, under the name Tullzah. Brocardus and Breydenback had already pointed out a village called Thersa to the east of Samaria. This form of the name corresponds to the Heb. better than that Arab. Tullu&#770;zah; but the place is suitable, and if Tullzah lies high and beautiful in a region of olive trees, then it still justifies its ancient name, which means pleasantness or sweetness. But it cannot be sweetness on account of which Tirzah is named before Jerusalem, for in the eye of the Israelites Jerusalem was "the perfection of beauty" (<a href="/psalms/50-2.htm">Psalm 50:2</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>). That there is gradation from Tirzah to Jerusalem (Hengst.) cannot be said; for &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; (decora) and &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; (pulchra) would be reversed if a climax were intended. The reason of it is rather this, that Shulamith is from the higher region, and is not a daughter of Jerusalem, and that therefore a beautiful city situated in the north toward Sunem must serve as a comparison of her beauty. That Shulamith is both beautiful and terrible (&#1488;&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; from &#1488;&#1497;&#1501;) is not contradiction: she is terrible in the irresistible power of the impression of her personality, terrible as ni&#770;dgaloth, i.e., as troops going forth with their banners unfurled (cf. the Kal of this v. denom., <a href="/psalms/20-6.htm">Psalm 20:6</a>). We do not need to supply &#1502;&#1510;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, which is sometimes fem., <a href="/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-9.htm">Genesis 32:9</a>, although the attribute would here be appropriate, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>, cf. Song <a href="/numbers/10-5.htm">Numbers 10:5</a>; still less &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, which occurs in the sense of military service, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>, and a war-expedition, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-12.htm">Daniel 8:12</a>, but not in the sense of war-host, as fem. Much rather nidgaloth, thus neut., is meant of bannered hosts, as &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (not &#1488;&#1512;), <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>, of those that are marching. War-hosts with their banners, their standards, go forth confident of victory. Such is Shulamith's whole appearance, although she is unconscious of it - a veni, vidi, vici. Solomon is completely vanquished by her. But seeking to maintain himself in freedom over against her, he cries out to her: </body></html>
