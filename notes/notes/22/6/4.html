These are the words of Christ, who had been absent for some time, and till now silent; but, like another Joseph, could not refrain any longer, but makes himself known to his church, and bursts out in strong expressions of love to her, and in high commendations of her; for, notwithstanding her behavior toward him, she was his love still, and as "beautiful" and as comely in his sight as ever: and for which he compares her here to Tirzah; which is either the name of some beautiful woman, well known in those times; so one of the daughters of Zelophehad is called by this name, <a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a>; but whether from her beauty is nowhere said: or rather a city of this name is here meant, since, in the next clause, the church is compared to the city of Jerusalem for the same reason. There was a city in the land of Canaan, called Tirzah, formerly the seat of one of the ancient kings of Canaan, and, in later times, of Jeroboam and some of his successors; and which, no doubt, was a very pleasant and delightful place, as its name imports, either from its situation or buildings, <a href="/joshua/12-24.htm">Joshua 12:24</a>. Adrichomius (x) says, it was an heroic city, situated on a high mountain. In some of the Greek versions, it is read as an appellative, and tendered, as "good will" or "good pleasure" (y), and so may respect the sweetness of her temper and disposition; which is heightened by using the abstract, she was all good nature and good will; not only sweet, as the Vulgate Latin version, but "sweetness" itself, as she says of him, Sol 5:16; and this may be said of her, as she was the object of God's good will and pleasure in election, of Christ's in redemption, and of the Spirit's in effectual calling; and as she was the subject of good will, bearing one to God, to Christ, to his people, word, worship, ways, and ordinances. The word comes from a root which signifies to be "grateful and accepted": and so Jarchi interprets the word here "acceptable": and so some ancient writings of the Jews (z): and may denote the acceptableness of the church in Christ, with whom God is well pleased in him for his righteousness's sake, in which she appears exceeding fair and lovely. And for the same reason is said to be <p>comely as Jerusalem; the metropolis of Judea, and seat of the kings of it; and, as Pliny (a) says, was far the most famous of any of the cities of the east; it was a city well built and compact together, beautiful for situation, very rich in Solomon's time, the place of divine worship, and was strongly fortified by nature and art: and hence the church of God often bears this name, both in the Old and New Testament, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>, being the city of the great King, built on Christ, the Rock; consisting of saints, fitly and closely united together; rich with the unsearchable riches of Christ; where the several parts of spiritual and evangelic worship are performed; possessed of many privileges, and well secured by the power and salvation of God. Yet <p>terrible as an army with banners; to her enemies, though so lovely to Christ. This shows that not a single person is meant all along, who could not with propriety be compared to an army; but a collective body, as the church is: and that the church on earth is militant, and, like a well disciplined army, in good order, and provided with proper officers and suitable armour, and in a posture of defence, and ready to fight when attacked; and so "terrible" to her enemies, Satan and his principalities, wicked men and false teachers; who are terrified by their having such a General at the head of them as Christ, and being under such banners as his, and provided with such good weapons of warfare, as are mighty through God; by their close union to one another; and by the constancy, undauntedness, and invincibleness of their faith; and are awed by their pious conversation and good examples. Perhaps some respect may be had by Christ to the church's courage and constancy in seeking after him; the force of whose faith and love he felt, which he could not withstand, and therefore says as follows: <p>(x) Theatrum Terrae Sanctae, p. 74.

It was an ancient Canaanite city, famed as its name and our passage shew for its beautiful situation. It was the royal residence of the Northern kings from the time of the abandonment of Shechem by Jeroboam I till the 6th year of Omri, who left it for Samaria, but it was apparently still of importance in the time of Menahem (<a href="/2_kings/15-14.htm" title="For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.">2 Kings 15:14</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-16.htm" title="Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.">2 Kings 15:16</a>). Neither the O.T. nor Josephus contains any indication as to the situation of Tirzah. But Brocardus in the 13th century, and Breydenbach in the 15th, mention a <span class="ital">Thersa</span>, three hours eastward of Samaria. Robinson, therefore, has identified it with the large village of <span class="ital">Talluza</span>, two-and-a-half hours E. of Samaria, and two hours N. of Nablous. Conder, however, has suggested that the village of <span class="ital">Teiasir</span> may be Tirzah. It lies two-and-a-half hours to the N. of <span class="ital">Talluza</span>, and has been identified by Porter in Murray’s <span class="ital">Guide-book</span>, 1858, with <span class="ital">Asher</span> a town of Manasseh, placed by Eusebius on the 15th mile from Neapolis to Scythopolis, anciently Bçthshe’ân. An objection which seems fatal is, that it lies too far from the great thoroughfare of the country for the ancient seat of the Israelite kings. From Tirzah being mentioned along with Jerusalem, this reference probably is to it as the capital of the N. kingdom. Its ancient rank as a Canaanite royal city can hardly have been in the writer’s mind. Consequently, unless this be an interpolation, as Budde makes it, the Song cannot have been written by Solomon. But it does not prove that it was written during the period that Tirzah was the capital. For the name of the town at least was known up till the 15th century of our era, and the site must always have been beautiful. Therefore, if the writer of the Song was a Northern man, who knew its beauty and history, he might have inserted the reference centuries after it had become an unimportant place, or even a ruin. Tirzah may have been chosen along with Jerusalem instead of Samaria, because of the evil odour in which the latter was held after Nehemiah’s day, or for its significant name and well-known beauty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">terrible as</span> an army <span class="ital">with banners</span>] The last four words represent the Heb. word <span class="ital">nidhgâlôth</span>, partic. niphal of a denominative from <span class="ital">deghel</span> = a banner. Cp. <span class="ital">dâghûl</span>, ch. <a href="/songs/6-10.htm" title="Who is she that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?">Song of Solomon 6:10</a> : literally it would be ‘beflagged things,’ if we might coin such an expression; hence companies of soldiers gathered about a flag. Rightly the LXX, θάμβος ὡς τεταγμέναι (sc. φὰλαγγες), a terror (i.e. terrible) as ranked (phalanxes). As Oettli remarks, this simile indicates that a king, not a shepherd, is speaking here. Whether the bannered hosts are terrible as overcoming, conquering, so that we have here praise of the Shulammite’s beauty, or whether we have praise of her inaccessibility as frowning upon her flatterers, must be left to individual taste. The former seems simpler, but the latter agrees best with the next clause. Cheyne suspects corruption in the text (<span class="ital">Jew. Quart. Rev</span>. Jan. 1899). For Tirzah he would read <span class="ital">chabhatstseleth</span>, and for Jerusalem and the words following it, he would read <span class="ital">keshôshannath ǎmâqîm</span>. His translation would therefore be, ‘Thou art fair, my friend, as the crocus, and comely as the lily of the valleys.’ But this would make the verse a mere repetition of <a href="/songs/2-1.htm" title="I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.">Song of Solomon 2:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for they have overcome me</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">for they</span> [i.e. thine eyes] <span class="bld">have made me afraid</span>. The word translated ‘overcome’ in A.V. is found elsewhere in the O.T. only in <a href="/psalms/138-3.htm" title="In the day when I cried you answered me, and strengthened me with strength in my soul.">Psalm 138:3</a>, where it is variously translated; A.V. ‘thou didst strengthen,’ R.V. ‘encourage,’ <span class="ital">Variorum</span> <span class="ital">Bib</span>. ‘make proud.’ Here also some have taken it in this sense. But against that is the last clause of <span class="ital"><a href="/songs/6-4.htm" title="You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.">Song of Solomon 6:4</a></span>, and the “turn away” of <span class="ital"><a href="/songs/6-5.htm" title="Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me: your hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.">Song of Solomon 6:5</a></span>. Moreover Hitzig has shewn that in Syr. and Arab. the forms corresponding to that here used in Heb. mean, ‘to terrify.’ The LXX seem to favour that view, for their translation ἀνεπτέρωσάν με may mean ‘agitate me,’ probably with fear (cp. θάμβος in the previous verse). This would suit the context best. It is not probable that there is in the words any reference to the magic of the evil eye.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From here to the end of <span class="ital"><a href="/songs/6-7.htm" title="As a piece of a pomegranate are your temples within your locks.">Song of Solomon 6:7</a></span> we have a mere repetition of <a href="/context/songs/4-1.htm" title="Behold, you are fair, my love; behold, you are fair; you have doves' eyes within your locks: your hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead....">Song of Solomon 4:1-3</a><span class="ital"> b</span>, with very slight variation. The only differences are that here we have ‘from Gilead’ instead of ‘from mount Gilead,’ and instead of ‘shorn ewes,’ simply, ‘ewes.’ For the commentary see <a href="/songs/4-1.htm" title="Behold, you are fair, my love; behold, you are fair; you have doves' eyes within your locks: your hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.">Song of Solomon 4:1</a>, &c. The repetition may be intended to indicate that the words are mere stock phrases in Solomon’s mouth (Oettli), but more probably they are stock phrases taken by the poet from the marriage <span class="ital">wasfs</span>, which must have consisted mainly of just such phrases.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Chap. <a href="/context/songs/6-4.htm" title="You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners....">Song of Solomon 6:4-13</a>. The King fascinated<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here we have a renewed assault by Solomon.

Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats that lie along the side of Gilead. Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes which are come up from the washing, whereof every one hath twins, and none is bereaved among them. Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil.</span> The king is not far off. The bride knows that he is near. She prepares herself for him with words of love. He is coming among his "rosebud garden. of girls." His voice is heard as he approaches. And as he enters the chamber he bursts forth with lavish praises of his bride. Tirzah and Jerusalem, two of the most beautiful cities of the world, are taken as symbols of the surpassing beauty of the bride - doubtless also with an intended reference to the symbology of Scripture, where the people of God are compared throughout to a city. Tirzah was discovered by Robinson in 1852, on a height in the mountain range to the north of Nablus, under the name <span class="accented">Tulluzah</span>, high and beautiful, in a region of olive trees. The name itself signifies sweetness, which might be so employed even if there were no actual city so called. Jerusalem is said to have been "the perfection of beauty" (<a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-2.htm">Psalm 50:2</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>). Cities are generally spoken of as females, as also nations. The Church is the city of God. The new Jerusalem is the bride of the Lamb. If the prophets did not take their language from this Song of Solomon, then the phraseology and symbology which we find here must have been familiarly known and used among the people of Israel from the time of Solomon. The beauty of the bride is overwhelming, it is subduing and all-conquering, like a warrior host with flying banners going forth to victory. Solomon confesses that he is vanquished. This, of course, is the hyperbole of love, but it is full of significance to the spiritual mind. The Church of Christ in the presence and power of the Lord is irresistible. It is not until he appears that the bride is seen in her perfection. She hangs her head and  complains while he is absent; but when he comes and reveals himself, delighting in his people, their beauty, which is a reflection of his, will shine forth as the sun forever and ever. The word which is employed, "terrible," is from the root "to be impetuous," "to press impetuously upon," "to infuse terror," LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, "to make to start up," referring to the flash of the eyes, the overpowering brightness of the countenance. So the purity and excellence of the Church shall delight the Lord, and no earthly power shall be able to stand before it. Heaven and earth shall meet in the latter days. Wickedness shall fly before righteousness as a detbated host before a victorious army. Is there not something like a practical commentary on these words in the history of all great revivals of religion and eras of reformation? Are there not signs even now that the beauty of the Church is becoming more and more army-like, and bearing down opposition? The remainder of the description is little more than a repetition of what has gone before, with some differences. Mount Gilead is here simply Gilead. The flock of shorn sheep is here the flock of ewes with their young. Perhaps there is intended to be a special significance in the use of the same description. The bride is the same, and therefore the same terms apply to her; but she is more beautiful than ever in the eyes of the bridegroom. Is it not a delicate mode of saying, "Though my absence from thee has made thee complain for a while, thou art still the same to me"? There is scope here for variety of interpretation which there is no need to follow. Some would say the reference is to the state of the Church at different periods - as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> to the primitive Church in its simplicity and purity, to the Church of the empire in its splendour and growing dominion. The Jewish expositors apply it to the different stages in the history of Israel, "the congregation" being the bride, as under the first temple and under the second temple. Ibn Ezra, and indeed all expositors, recognize the reason for the repetition as in the sameness of affection. "The beloved repeats the same things here to show that it is still his own true bride to whom he speaks, the sameness in the features proving it." So the Targum. The flock of goats, the flock of ewes, the piece of pomegranate, all suggest the simple purity of country life in which the king found so much satisfaction, he is wrapt up in his northern beauty, and idolizes her. One cannot help thinking of the early Jewish Church coming forth from Galilee, when all spoke of the freshness and genuineness of a simple-hearted piety drawn forth by the preaching of the Son of Mary - the virgin-born Bridegroom whose bride was like the streams and flowers, the birds and flocks, of beautiful Galilee; a society of believing peasants untouched by the conventionalities of Judaea, and ready to respond to the grand mountain like earnestness and heavenly purity of the new Prophet, the Shepherd of Israel, "who feedeth his flock among the lilies." There is a correspondence in the early Church, before corruption crept in and sophistication obscured the simplicity of faith and life among Christians, to this description of the bride, the Lamb's wife. There must be a return to that primitive ideal before there can be the rapturous joy of the Church which is promised. We are too much turned aside from the Bridegroom to false and worthless attractions which do not delight the Beloved One. When he sees his bride as he first saw her, he will renew his praises and lift her up to himself. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>14a His hands golden cylinders,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filled in with stones of Tarshish.<p>The figure, according to Gesen., Heb. Wrterbuch, and literally also Heilgst., is derived from the closed hand, and the stained nails are compared to precious stones. both statements are incorrect; for (1) although it is true that then Israelitish women, as at the present day Egyptian and Arabian women, stained their eyes with stibium (vid., under <a href="/isaiah/54-11.htm">Isaiah 54:11</a>), yet it is nowhere shown that they, and particularly men, stained the nails of their feet and their toes with the orange-yellow of the Alhenna (Lane's Egypt, I-33-35); and (2) the word used is not &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, but &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;; it is thus the outstretched hands that are meant; and only these, not the closed fist, could be compared to "lilies," for &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; signifies not a ring (Cocc., Dpke, Bttch., etc.), but that which is rolled up, a roller, cylinder (<a href="/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a>), from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, which properly means not &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; (Venet., after Gebhardt: &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), but &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. The hands thus are meant in respect of the fingers, which on account of their noble and fine form, their full, round, fleshy mould, are compared to bars of gold formed like rollers, garnished (&#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, like &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17</a>) with stones of Tarshish, to which the nails are likened. The transparent horn-plates of the nails, with the lunula, the white segment of a circle at their roots, are certainly, when they are beautiful, an ornament to the hand, and, without our needing to think of their being stained, are worthily compared to the gold-yellow topaz. Tarshish is not the onyx, which derives its Heb. name &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1501; from its likeness to the finger-nail, but the &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, by which the word in this passage before us is translated by the Quinta and the Sexta, and elsewhere also by the lxx and Aquila. But the chrysolite is the precious stone which is now called the topaz. It receives the name Tarshish from Spain, the place where it was found. Pliny, xxxviii. 42, describes it as aureo fulgore tralucens. Bredow erroneously interprets Tarshish of amber. There is a kind of chrysolite, indeed, which is called chryselectron, because in colorem electri declinans. The comparison of the nails to such a precious stone (Luther, influenced by the consonance, and apparently warranted by the plena hyacinthis of the Vulg., has substituted golden rings, vol Trkissen, whose blue-green colour is not suitable here), in spite of Hengst., who finds it insipid, is as true to nature as it is tender and pleasing. The description now proceeds from the uncovered to the covered parts of his body, the whiteness of which is compared to ivory and marble.<p>14b His body an ivory work of art,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Covered with sapphires.<p>The plur. &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1502;&#1506;&#1492; or &#1502;&#1506;&#1497; (vid., under <a href="/psalms/40-9.htm">Psalm 40:9</a>), signifies properly the tender parts, and that the inward parts of the body, but is here, like the Chald. &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-32.htm">Daniel 2:32</a>, and the &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503;, Sol 7:3, which also properly signifies the inner part of the body, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, transferred to the body in its outward appearance. To the question how Shulamith should in such a manner praise that which is for the most part covered with clothing, it is not only to be answered that it is the poet who speaks by her mouth, but also that it is not the bride or the beloved, but the wife, whom he represents as thus speaking. &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; (from the peculiar Hebraeo-Chald. and Targ. &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, which, after <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>, like k&#803;halak, creare, appears to proceed from the fundamental idea of smoothing) designates an artistic figure. Such a figure was Solomon's throne, made of &#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, the teeth of elephants, ivory, <p>(Note: Ivory is fully designated by the name &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, Lat. ebur, from the Aegypt. ebu, the Aegypto-Indian ibha, elephant.)<p><a href="/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>. Here Solomon's own person, without reference to a definite admired work of art, is praised as being like an artistic figure made of ivory, - like it in regard to its glancing smoothness and its fine symmetrical form. When, now, this word of art is described as covered with sapphires (&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;, referred to &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, as apparently gramm., or as ideal, fem.), a sapphire-coloured robe is not meant (Hitzig, Ginsburg); for &#1506;&#1500;&#1507;, which only means to disguise, would not at all be used of such a robe (<a href="/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14</a>; cf. <a href="/genesis/24-65.htm">Genesis 24:65</a>), nor would the one uniform colour of the robe be designated by sapphires in the plur. The choice of the verb &#1506;&#1500;&#1507; (elsewhere used of veiling) indicates a covering shading the pure white, and in connection with &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, thought of as accus., a moderating of the bright glance by a soft blue. For &#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; (a genuine Semit. word, like the Chald. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;; cf. regarding &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;, under <a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>) is the sky-blue sapphire (<a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>), including the Lasurstein (lapis lazuli), sprinkled with golden, or rather with gold-like glistening points of pyrites, from which, with the l omitted, sky-blue is called azur (azure) (vid., under <a href="/job/28-6.htm">Job 28:6</a>). The word of art formed of ivory is quite covered over with sapphires fixed in it. That which is here compared is nothing else than the branching blue veins under the white skin. </body></html>
