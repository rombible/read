There are hopes of those who begin to inquire concerning Christ and his perfections. Christians, who are well acquainted with Christ themselves, should do all they can to make others know something of him. Divine glory makes him truly lovely in the eyes of all who are enlightened to discern spiritual things. He is white in the spotless innocence of his life, ruddy in the bleeding sufferings he went through at his death. This description of the person of the Beloved, would form, in the figurative language of those times, a portrait of beauty of person and of grace of manners; but the aptness of some of the allusions may not appear to us. He shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all that believe.

This, and the following verses, contain the church's answer to the question of the daughters; she first gives a general description of her beloved, and then descends to particulars: the description of him in general is, that he is "white and ruddy"; having the whiteness of the lily, and the redness of the rose, Sol 2:1; which make a perfect beauty. Some understand this of the two natures in Christ, divine and human; with respect to his divine nature, "white", expressive of his simplicity, purity and holiness; which colour, Cicero says (r), is chiefly becoming God, it being simple, and having no mixture and composition in it: with respect to his human nature, "red", being a partaker of the same flesh and blood with his people. Others, only of the human nature; "white" denoting the purity and holiness of it, being without either original or actual sin; "red", or "ruddy", his bloody sufferings in it for the sins of his people. But it may denote, in general, his fairness, beauty, and glory; being, as a divine Person, the brightness of his Father's glory; as man; fairer than the children of men; as the Mediator, full of grace and truth; and in all his offices, as Prophet, Priest, and King, and in all the relations he stands in to his, as Father, Husband, Brother, and Friend, he appears most lovely and amiable; <p>the chiefest among ten thousand; whether angels or men; he is the Creator of angels, the object of their worship; and has a more excellent name and nature than they, to whom they are subject, and are ministering spirits; he is superior to men, good and bad, high and low; Lord of all, King of kings, and Head of saints, and has the pre-eminence over all creatures. The Septuagint version is, "chosen out of" or "from ten thousand"; Christ, as man, is chosen of God, from among the myriads of the individuals of human nature, to union with the divine Word, or Son of God; see <a href="/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a>; as God-man and Mediator, to be the alone Saviour and Redeemer of his people; to be the Head of the body, the church; and to be the Judge of quick and dead; and he is chosen by sensible sinners to be the object of their love; to be their only Saviour; and to be their Ruler and Governor, whose laws, commands, and ordinances, they choose to obey; see <a href="/psalms/73-24.htm">Psalm 73:24</a>; The words may be rendered, "the standard bearer", or "one standarded by" or "over ten thousand" (s); the church is militant, and has many enemies; in the name of the Lord, she sets up her banners against them, and the banner over her is the "love" of Christ, Sol 2:4; and he is the standard bearer, who has a multitude of angels and saints under his standard; and how stately and majestic does he look, and what a noble sight is it to see him bearing the standard before such a company! <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>. Or the sense is, Christ is a more excellent standard bearer than all others (t); there may be ten thousand persons that carry a flag, but none to be compared with him, for comeliness, strength, and courage: or he is lifted up, as a standard, above others, angels and men; as he was upon the cross, and now, in the ministry of the word, that souls may gather unto him, and enlist themselves in his service; see <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>. <p>(r) De Legibus, l. 2.((s)  "vexillatus a decem millibus", Montanus; "sub signis habens exercitum decem millium", Tigurine version.

The word <span class="accented">tsach</span>, from the root <span class="accented">tsahach</span> (cf. <a href="/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>), means a bright, shining clearness; it is not the same as <span class="accented">lavan</span>, which would mean "dead white." So in Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> differs from <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The red <span class="accented">adhom</span>, from the root <span class="accented">dam</span>, which means "to condense," is dark red (<span class="accented">rouge puce</span>), no doubt as betokening health and vigour. The pure, delicate white among the Caucasians denotes high rank, superior training, hereditary nobility, as among ourselves the "aristocratic paleness" (cf. Hom., 'I1,' 4:141, "<span class="accented">ivory with purple</span>;" Virg., 'AEn.,' 12:65; Ovid, 'Am.,' 2; ' Eleg.,' 5:39; Hor., Od., 1:13, etc.; Tibull., 'Eleg.,' ext. 4, etc.). The chiefest, that is, the distinguished one, the chosen (so the Greek versions, Syriac, Jerome, Luther). The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">e cohorte selectus.</span> Another rendering is "bannered," furnished with a banner or pennon (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>) hence the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> as a past participle (so the Venetian <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The numeral (<span class="accented">revava</span>) "<span class="accented">ten thousand"</span> is simply used to represent an innumerable multitude; "myriad" is so used among ourselves (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>4 My beloved stretched his hand through the opening,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And my heart was moved for him.<p>&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <p>(Note: Cf. the Arab. ghawr (gho&#770;r), as a sinking of the earth, and khawr (kho&#770;r), as a breaking through, and, as it were, a piercing. The mouth of a river is also called kho&#770;r, because there the sea breaks into the riv.)<p>from the verb &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, in the sense of to break through (R. &#1495;&#1512;, whence also &#1495;&#1512;&#1494;, Sol 1:10, and &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;, Arab. kharam, part. broken through, e.g., of a lattice-window), signifies foramen, a hole, also caverna (whence the name of the Troglodytes, &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;, and the Haurn, &#1495;&#1493;&#1512;&#1503;), here the loophole in the door above (like khawkht, the little door for the admission of individuals in the street or house-door). It does not properly mean a window, but a part of the door pierced through at the upper part of the lock of the door (the door-bolt). &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512; is understood from the standpoint of one who is within; "by the opening from without to within," thus "through the opening;" stretching his hand through the door-opening as if to open the door, if possible, by the pressing back of the lock from within, he shows how greatly he longed after Shulamith. And she was again very deeply moved when she perceived this longing, which she had so coldly responded to: the interior of her body, with the organs which, after the bibl. idea, are the seat of the tenderest emotions, or rather, in which they reflect themselves, both such as are agreeable and such as are sorrowful, groaned within her, - an expression of deep sympathy so common, that "the sounding of the bowels," <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>, an expression used, and that anthropopathically of God Himself, is a direct designation of sympathy or inner participation. The phrase here wavers between &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; (thus, e.g., Nissel, 1662). Both forms are admissible. It is true we say elsewhere only naphshi 'a&#772;lai, ruhi 'a&#772;lai, libbi 'a&#772;lai, for the Ego distinguishes itself from its substance (cf. System d. bibl. Psychologie, p. 151f.); meai 'alai, instead of bi (&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;), would, however, be also explained from this, that the bowels are meant, not anatomically, but as psychical organs. But the old translators (lxx, Targ., Syr., Jerome, Venet.) rendered &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, which rests on later MS authority (vid., Norzi, and de Rossi), and is also more appropriate: her bowels are stirred, viz., over him, i.e., on account of him (Alkabez: &#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;). As she will now open to him, she is inwardly more ashamed, as he has come so full of love and longing to make her glad. </body></html>
