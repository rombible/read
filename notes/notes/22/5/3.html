We ought to notice our spiritual slumbers and distempers. Christ knocks to awaken us, knocks by his word and Spirit, knocks by afflictions and by our consciences; thus, Re 3:20. When we are unmindful of Christ, still he thinks of us. Christ's love to us should engage ours to him, even in the most self-denying instances; and we only can be gainers by it. Careless souls put slights on Jesus Christ. Another could not be sent to open the door. Christ calls to us, but we have no mind, or pretend we have no strength, or we have no time, and think we may be excused. Making excuses is making light of Christ. Those put contempt upon Christ, who cannot find in their hearts to bear a cold blast, or to leave a warm bed for him. See the powerful influences of Divine grace.  He put in his hand to unbolt the door, as one weary of waiting. This betokens a work of the Spirit upon the soul. The believer's rising above self-indulgence, seeking by prayer for the consolations of Christ, and to remove every hinderance to communion with him; these actings of the soul are represented by the hands dropping sweet-smelling myrrh upon the handles of the locks. But the Beloved was gone! By absenting himself, Christ will teach his people to value his gracious visits more highly. Observe, the soul still calls Christ her Beloved. Every desertion is not despair. Lord, I believe, though I must say, Lord, help my unbelief. His words melted me, yet, wretch that I was, I made excuses. The smothering and stifling of convictions will be very bitter to think of, when God opens our eyes. The soul went in pursuit of him; not only prayed, but used means, sought him in the ways wherein he used to be found. The watchmen wounded me. Some refer it to those who misapply the word to awakened consciences. The charge to the daughters of Jerusalem, seems to mean the distressed believer's desire of the prayers of the feeblest Christian. Awakened souls are more sensible of Christ's withdrawings than of any other trouble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She makes trivial excuses, as one in a dream. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/songs/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Shulamith represents herself as failing in love, not meeting the condescension and affection of her lover as she should. Sloth, reluctance, ease, keep her back. "Woe to them that are at ease in Zion!" The scene is, of course, only ideally true; it is not meant to be a description of an actual occurrence. Fancy in dreams stirs up the real nature, though it also  disturbs it. Shulamith has forsaken her first love. She relates it with sorrow, but not with despondency. She comes to herself again, and her repentance and restoration are the occasion for pouring out the fulness of her affection, which had never really changed, though it has been checked and restrained by self-indulgence. How true a picture both of the individual soul and of the Church in its decline!

"If I only knew here," says Rocke, "how to disclose the meaning, certainly all these flowers and fruits, in the figurative language of the Orient, in the flower-language of love, had their beautiful interpretation." In the old German poetry, also, the phrase bluomen brechen to break flowers was equivalent to: to enjoy love; the flowers and fruits named are figures of all that the amata offers to the amator. Most of the plants here named are exotics; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1505; (heaping around, circumvallation, enclosing) is a garden or park, especially with foreign ornamental and fragrant plants - an old Persian word, the explanation of which, after Spiegel, first given in our exposition of the Song, 1851 (from pairi  equals  &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;, and de&#770;z, R. diz, a heap), has now become common property (Justi's Handb. der Zendsprache, p. 180). &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; (from &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;, which corresponds to The Arab. mejd, praise, honour, excellence; vid., Volck under <a href="/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13</a>) are fructus laudum, or lautitiarum, excellent precious fruits, which in the more modern language are simply called &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (Shabbath 127b, &#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, all kinds of fine fruits); cf. Syr. magdo, dried fruit. Regarding &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;, vid., under Sol 1:14; regarding &#1502;&#1512;, under Sol 1:13; also regarding &#1504;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;, under Sol 1:12. The long vowel of &#1504;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468; corresponds to the Pers. form na&#770;rd, but near to which is also nard, Indian nalada (fragrance-giving); the e&#772; is thus only the long accent, and can therefore disappear in the plur. For &#1504;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, Grtz reads &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, roses, because the poet would not have named nard twice. The conjecture is beautiful, but for us, who believe the poem to be Solomonic, is inconsistent with the history of roses (vid., under Sol 2:1), and also unnecessary. The description moves forward by steps rhythmically.<p>&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1499;&#1501; is the crocus stativus, the genuine Indian safran, the dried flower-eyes of which yield the safran used as a colour, as an aromatic, and also as medicine; safran is an Arab. word, and means yellow root and yellow colouring matter. The name &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1499;&#1501;, Pers. karkam, Arab. karkum, is radically Indian, Sanscr. kunkuma. &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, a reed (from &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, R. qn, to rise up, viewed intrans.), <p>(Note: In this general sense of "reed" (Syn. arundo) the word is also found in the Gr. and Lat.: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), reed-mats, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, a wicker basket, canna, canistrum, without any reference to an Indo-Germ. verbal stem, and without acquiring the specific signification of an aromatic plant.)<p>viz., sweet reed, acorus calamus, which with us now grows wild in marshes, but is indigenous to the Orient.<p>&#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1503; is the laurus cinnamomum, a tree indigenous to the east coast of Africa and Ceylon, and found later also on the Antilles. It is of the family of the laurineae, the inner bark of which, peeled off and rolled together, is the cinnamon-bark (cannella, French cannelle); Aram. &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1502;&#1488;, as also the Greek &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; and &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Lat. (e.g., in the 12th book of Pliny) cinnamomum and cinnamum, are interchanged, from &#1511;&#1504;&#1501;, probably a secondary formation from &#1511;&#1504;&#1492; (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, whence &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;), to which also Syr. qenu&#770;ma&#772;', &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and the Talm.-Targ. &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1511;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;, an oath (cf. &#1511;&#1497;&#1501;), go back, so that thus the name which was brought to the west by the Phoenicians denoted not the tree, but the reed-like form of the rolled dried bark. As "nards" refer to varieties of the nard, perhaps to the Indian and the Jamanic spoken of by Strabo and others, so "all kinds of incense trees" refers definitely to Indo-Arab. varieties of the incense tree and its fragrant resin; it has its name fro the white and transparent seeds of this its resin (cf. Arab. luba&#770;n, incense and benzoin, the resin of the storax tree, &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;); the Greek &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (Lat. thus, frankincense, from &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;), is a word derived from the Pheonicians.<p>&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (which already in a remarkable way was used by Balaam, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>, elsewhere only since the time of Solomon) is the Semitized old Indian name of the aloe, agaru or aguru; that which is aromatic is the wood of the aloe-tree (aloxylon agallochum), particularly its dried root (agallochum or lignum alos, &#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;, according to which the Targ. here: &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, after the phrase in Aruch) mouldered in the earth, which chiefly came from farther India.<p>(Note: Vid., Lassen's Ind. Alterthumsk. I 334f. Furrer, in Schenkel's Bib. Lex., understands &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; of the liliaceae, indigenous to Palestine as to Arabia, which is also called alo. But the drastic purgative which the succulent leaves of this plant yield is not aromatic, and the verb &#1488;&#1495;&#1500; "to glisten," whence he seeks to derive the name of this aloe, is not proved. Cf. besides, the Petersburg Lex. under aguru ("not difficult"), according to which is this name of the amyris agallocha, and the aquilaria agallocha, but of no liliaceae. The name Adlerholz ("eagle-wood") rests on a misunderstanding of the name of the Agila tree. It is called "Paradiesholz," because it must have been one of the paradise trees (vid., Bereshith rabba under <a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>). Dioskorides says of this wood: &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; the Song therefore places it along with myrrh and frankincense. That which is common to the lily-aloe and the wood-aloe, is the bitter taste of the juice of the former and of the resinous wood of the latter. The Arab. name of the aloe, s&#803;abir, is also given to the lily-aloe. The proverbs: amarru min es&#803;-s&#803;abir, bitterer than the aloe, and es-sabr sabir, patience is the aloe, refer to the aloe-juice.)<p>continued...</body></html>
