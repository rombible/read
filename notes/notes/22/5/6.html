We ought to notice our spiritual slumbers and distempers. Christ knocks to awaken us, knocks by his word and Spirit, knocks by afflictions and by our consciences; thus, Re 3:20. When we are unmindful of Christ, still he thinks of us. Christ's love to us should engage ours to him, even in the most self-denying instances; and we only can be gainers by it. Careless souls put slights on Jesus Christ. Another could not be sent to open the door. Christ calls to us, but we have no mind, or pretend we have no strength, or we have no time, and think we may be excused. Making excuses is making light of Christ. Those put contempt upon Christ, who cannot find in their hearts to bear a cold blast, or to leave a warm bed for him. See the powerful influences of Divine grace.  He put in his hand to unbolt the door, as one weary of waiting. This betokens a work of the Spirit upon the soul. The believer's rising above self-indulgence, seeking by prayer for the consolations of Christ, and to remove every hinderance to communion with him; these actings of the soul are represented by the hands dropping sweet-smelling myrrh upon the handles of the locks. But the Beloved was gone! By absenting himself, Christ will teach his people to value his gracious visits more highly. Observe, the soul still calls Christ her Beloved. Every desertion is not despair. Lord, I believe, though I must say, Lord, help my unbelief. His words melted me, yet, wretch that I was, I made excuses. The smothering and stifling of convictions will be very bitter to think of, when God opens our eyes. The soul went in pursuit of him; not only prayed, but used means, sought him in the ways wherein he used to be found. The watchmen wounded me. Some refer it to those who misapply the word to awakened consciences. The charge to the daughters of Jerusalem, seems to mean the distressed believer's desire of the prayers of the feeblest Christian. Awakened souls are more sensible of Christ's withdrawings than of any other trouble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sweet smelling myrrh - Or (as in the margin) "running myrrh," that which first and spontaneously exudes, i. e., the freshest, finest myrrh.

Which was what he desired, and was done in virtue of his putting in his hand by the hole of the door; or by the exertion of his efficacious grace, working in her both to will and to do, without which it would not have been done; namely, her heart dilated, the desires and affections of her soul enlarged towards Christ, and every grace drawn forth and exercised on him; and though the heart of a believer is sometimes shut to Christ, yet when it is opened, it is only patent to him; the church thought Christ was still at the door, and might be the more confirmed in it by what she found on the handles of the lock; but lo her mistake, <p>but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: a sad disappointment this! she expected to have seen him, and been received in his arms and embraced in his bosom; but instead of that, he was gone out of sight and hearing: this withdrawing was to chastise her for her former carriage, and to show her more the evil of her sin, and his resentment of it; to try the truth and strength of her grace to inflame her love the more, and sharpen her desires after his presence, to prize it more when she had it, and be careful not to lose it: her using two words of the same import, "he turned himself" (h), and was gone, signifies that he was really gone, and not in her imagination only; and that he was gone suddenly, at an unawares, and, as she might fear, would never return; and these words being without a copulative, "had withdrawn himself, he was gone", show her haste in speaking, the confusion she was in, thee strength of her passion, the greatness of her disappointment and sorrow; it is as if she was represented wringing her hands and crying, He is gone, he is gone, he is gone; <p>my soul failed when he spake; or "went out" (i); not out of her body, but she fell into a swoon, and was as one dead; for a while; and this was "at" or "through his word" (k), as it may be rendered; through what he said when he turned about and departed, expressing his resentment at her behavior; or rather at the remembrance of his kind and tender language he used when he first called her to arise, "saying, open to me, my sister, my spouse", &amp;c.

This is the explanation of his departure. She had fainted when she heard his voice, and when she came to herself and opened the door he was gone. This seems to be the simple explanation of a clause which has greatly vexed interpreters. Hitzig, Ewald, and Oettli would read for <span class="ital">bĕdhabbĕrô</span> = ‘when he spake,’ <span class="ital">bĕdhobhrô</span>, in the sense ‘when he turned away.’ But this is an Aramaic meaning, and though, according to the <span class="ital">Oxford Heb.

Now I am made sensible of my own deficiency. I call after him. I long for his return, but it is in vain (cf. the two disciples going to Emmaus, <a href="/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>, "Did not our heart burn within us," etc.?). Similar allusion to the effect of the voice of the beloved is found in Terence, 'And.,' 1:5, 16, "Oratio haec," etc. The failing or departing of the soul at the sound of the voice must refer to the lack of response at the time, therefore it was that she sought him and cried out after him. <span class="accented">When he spake</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in his speaking</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when he said, "I will not now come because at first refused;" cf. <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20-33</a>, the solemn warning against the loss of opportunity.

If there is any spiritual meaning at all in Solomon's Song, it certainly is a book which he who wrote the first chapter of Proverbs is likely to have written. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king's praise is for Shulamith proof of his love, which seeks a response. But as she is, she thinks herself yet unworthy of him; her modesty says to her that she needs preparation for him, preparation by that blowing which is the breath of God in the natural and in the spiritual world.<p>16 Awake, thou North (wind), and come, thou South!<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blow through my garden, cause its spices to flow - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let my beloved come into his garden,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And eat the fruits which are precious to him.<p>The names of the north and south, denoting not only the regions of the heavens, but also the winds blowing from these regions, are of the fem. gender, <a href="/isaiah/43-6.htm">Isaiah 43:6</a>. The east wind, &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, is purposely not mentioned; the idea of that which is destructive and adverse is connected with it (vid., under <a href="/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>). The north wind brings cold till ice is formed, Sir. 43:20; and if the south wind blow, it is hot, <a href="/luke/12-55.htm">Luke 12:55</a>. If cold and heat, coolness and sultriness, interchange at the proper time, then growth is promoted. And if the wind blow through a garden at one time from this direction and at another from that, - not so violently as when it shakes the trees of the forest, but softly and yet as powerfully as a garden can bear it, - then all the fragrance of the garden rises in waves, and it becomes like a sea of incense. The garden itself then blows, i.e., emits odours; for (&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;  equals  the Arab. fakh, fah, cf. fawh, pl. afwa&#770;h, sweet odours, fragrant plants) as in &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>, the idea underlies the expression, that when it is evening the day itself blows, i.e., becomes cool, the causative &#1492;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;, connected with the object-accus. of the garden, means to make the garden breezy and fragrant. &#1504;&#1494;&#1500; is here used of the odours which, set free as it were from the plants, flow out, being carried forth by the waves of air. Shulamith wishes that in her all that is worthy of love should be fully realized. What had to be done for Esther (<a href="/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>) before she could be brought in to the king, Shulamith calls on the winds to accomplish for her, which are, as it were, the breath of the life of all nature, and as such, of the life-spirit, which is the sustaining background of all created things. If she is thus prepared for him who loves her, and whom she loves, he shall come into his garden and enjoy the precious fruit belonging to him. With words of such gentle tenderness, childlike purity, she gives herself to her beloved. </body></html>
