None besides can speak to the heart. She sees him come. This may be applied to the prospect the Old Testament saints had of Christ's coming in the flesh. He comes as pleased with his own undertaking. He comes speedily. Even when Christ seems to forsake, it is but for a moment; he will soon return with everlasting loving-kindness. The saints of old saw him, appearing through the sacrifices and ceremonial institutions. We see him through a glass darkly, as he manifests himself through the lattices. Christ invites the new convert to arise from sloth and despondency, and to leave sin and worldly vanities, for union and communion with him. The winter may mean years passed in ignorance and sin, unfruitful and miserable, or storms and tempests that accompanied his conviction of guilt and danger. Even the unripe fruits of holiness are pleasant unto Him whose grace has produced them. All these encouraging tokens and evidences of Divine favour, are motives to the soul to follow Christ more fully. Arise then, and come away from the world and the flesh, come into fellowship with Christ. This blessed change is owing wholly to the approaches and influences of the Sun of righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Arise, my friend, my beautiful one, and come away - The stanza begins and ends with this refrain, in which the bride reports the invitation of the beloved that she should come forth with him into the open champaign, now a scene of verdure and beauty, and at a time of mirth and mutual affection.

Then first the Gentile Church is called "beloved, which was not beloved" (Ro 9:25). So "the winter" of estrangement and sin is "past" to the believer (Isa 44:22; Jer 50:20; 2Co 5:17; Eph 2:1). The rising "Sun of righteousness" dispels the "rain" (2Sa 23:4; Ps 126:5; Mal 4:2). The winter in Palestine is past by April, but all the showers were not over till May. The time described here is that which comes directly after these last showers of winter. In the highest sense, the coming resurrection and deliverance of the earth from the past curse is here implied (Ro 8:19; Re 21:4; 22:3). No more "clouds" shall then "return after the rain" (Ec 12:2; Re 4:3; compare Ge 9:13-17); "the rainbow round the throne" is the "token" of this.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/songs/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The winter; </span> which made the ways in some sort unpassable, and so might seem to hinder or affright thee from coming to me.

A season of the year which keeps persons within doors, makes going abroad unsafe, unpleasant, and uncomfortable; very unfit for travelling, roads bad, rivers impassable, and journeying very difficult; but now this season being over, and the spring come, the weather fair, and every thing gay and pleasant, it is inviting to be abroad; winter is by some writers (r) used not for the season of the year, but for a storm or tempest. Thus the winter and rain may be descriptive of the state and condition of Jews and Gentiles before the coming of Christ (s), and which then ceased; it having been a stormy dispensation with the one, and a time of darkness and ignorance with the other, <a href="/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18</a>; or rather it may in general represent the state of God's people both before and after conversion; before conversion it is a time of darkness, coldness, barrenness, and unfruitfulness; and which are removed by the powerful and efficacious grace of Christ: and after conversion it is often a winter season with them, through the blustering winds of Satan's temptations; the storms of impending wrath for sin, as they imagine; the nipping blasts of persecution, and sharp and severe afflictions they are at times exposed unto: moreover, they are often in great darkness of soul, clouds interpose between Christ and them; a great deal of coldness attends them, their hearts are frozen up and hard, and no impression made on them by the preaching of the word, or by the providences of God; there is a coolness in their love to God and Christ, his people, ordinances, cause, and interest; great barrenness and unfruitfulness in them, they look like trees in winter, and no appearance of fruit on them; their hands are sealed up from working, and they become indolent and inactive; and by all these fellowship with Christ is greatly interrupted: but, when the spring returns again, light breaks in upon them, and their hearts are melted with a sense of love; they become lively in their frames, and in the exercise of grace, and are fruitful in good works; and enjoy much calmness and serenity, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost: sometimes they think the winter is not over when it is, and fear more storms are behind, even of divine wrath and vengeance, though without reason; since Christ has bore all wrath for them, and has satisfied law and justice, and has delivered them from wrath to come; and he that has done this says, "the winter is past", &amp;c. <p>(r) "Grandaevumque patrem supplex, miseranda rogabo unam hyemem", Statii Achill. l. 1. v. 50, 51.

The Jews in Jerusalem to this day call rain <span class="accented">shataa.</span> The rain; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the showers. The flowers, or the flowery time, corresponding with the singing time. Several versions, as the LXX. and other Greek, Jerome in the Latin, and the Targum and Venetian, render, "the time of pruning," taking the <span class="accented">zamir</span> from a root <span class="accented">zamar</span>, "to prune the vine." It is, however, regarded by most critics as an onomatopoetic word meaning "song," "music," like <span class="accented">zimrah</span>, "singing." The reference to the voice of the turtledove, the cooing note which is so sweet and attractive among the woods, shows that the time of spring is intended. Ginsburg says wherever <span class="accented">zamir</span> occurs, either in the singular or plural, it means "singing" (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>). The form of the word conveys the idea of the time of the action, as we see in the words for "harvest" (<span class="accented">asiph</span>) and "ploughing time" (<span class="accented">charish</span>). The fig tree and the vine were both employed as symbols of prosperity and peace, as the fig and grape were so much used as food (see <a href="/1_kings/5-5.htm">1 Kings 5:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-31.htm">2 Kings 18:31</a>). The little fruits of the fig tree begin, when the spring commences, to change colour from green to red (cf. <a href="/mark/11-13.htm">Mark 11:13</a>, where the Passover time is referred to). The word "to ripen" is literally, "to grow red or sweet." The blossoming vines give forth a very delicate and attractive fragrance. The description is acknowledged by all to be very beautiful. The invitation is to fellowship in the midst of the pure loveliness of nature, when all was adapted to meet and sustain the feelings of awakened love. The emotions of the soul are blended easily with the sensations derived from the outward world. When we carefully avoid extravagance, and put the soul first and not second, then the delights of the senses may help the heart to realize the deepest experience of Divine communion. But the bridegroom first solicits the bride. We reverse the true spiritual order when we place too much dependence on the influence of external objects or sensuous pleasures. Art may assist religion to its expression, but it must never be made so prominent that the artistic pleasure swallows up the religious emotion. Love of nature is not love of Christ. Love of music is not love of Christ. Yet the soul that seeks him may rejoice in art and music, because they blend their attractions with its devotion, and help it to be a joy and a passion.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>5 Support me with grape-cakes,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Refresh me with apples:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For I am sick with love.<p>She makes use of the intensive form as one in a high degree in need of the reanimating of her almost sinking life: &#1505;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; is the intens. of &#1505;&#1502;&#1498;, to prop up, support, or, as here, to under-prop, uphold; and ripeed, the intens. of &#1512;&#1508;&#1491; (R. &#1512;&#1507;), to raise up from beneath (vid., at <a href="/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>), to furnish firm ground and support. The apple is the Greek attribute of Aphrodite, and is the symbol of love; but here it is only a means of refreshing; and if thoughts of love are connected with the apple-tree (Sol 2:3; Sol 8:5), that is explained from Shulamith's rural home. Bttcher understands quinces; Epstein, citrons; but these must needs have been more closely denoted, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>, by some addition to the expression. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, to establish, make firm) are (cf. <a href="/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>) grapes pressed together like cakes; different from &#1510;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, dried grapes (cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;), fig-cakes (Arab. dabbu&#770;le, a mass pressed together), and &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;, placenta, from the pressed-out form. A cake is among the gifts (<a href="/2_samuel/6-19.htm">2 Samuel 6:19</a>) which David distributed to the people on the occasion of the bringing up of the ark; date-cakes, e.g., at the monastery at Sinai, are to the present day gifts for the refreshment of travellers. If Shulamith's cry was to be understood literally, one might, with Noack, doubt the correctness of the text; for "love-sickness, even in the age of passion and sentimentality, was not to be cured with roses and apples." But (1) sentimentality, i.e., susceptibility, does not belong merely to the Romantic, but also to Antiquity, especially in the Orient, as e.g., is shown by the symptoms of sympathy with which the prophets were affected when uttering their threatenings of judgment; let one read such outbreaks of sorrow as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a>, which, if one is disposed to scorn, may be derided as hysterical fits. Moreover, the Indian, Persian, and Arabic erotic (vid., e.g., the Romance Siret 'Antar) is as sentimental as the German has at any time been. (2) The subject of the passage here is not the curing of love-sickness, but bodily refreshment: the cry of Shulamith, that she may be made capable of bearing the deep agitation of her physical life, which is the consequence, not of her love-sickness, but of her love-happiness. (3) The cry is not addressed (although this is grammatically possible, since &#1505;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is, according to rule,  equals  &#1505;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1497;) to the daughters of Jerusalem, who would in that case have been named, but to some other person; and this points to its being taken not in a literal sense. (4) It presupposes that one came to the help of Shulamith, sick and reduced to weakness, with grapes and apple-scent to revive her fainting spirit. The call of Shulamith thus means: hasten to me with that which will revive and refresh me, for I am sick with love. This love-sickness has also been experienced in the spiritual sphere. St. Ephrem was once so overcome by such a joy that he cried out: "Lord, withdraw Thine hand a little, for my heart is too weak to receive so great joy." And J. R. Hedinger (&#8224; 1704) was on his deathbed overpowered with such a stream of heavenly delight that he cried: "Oh, how good is the Lord! Oh, how sweet is Thy love, my Jesus! Oh, what a sweetness! I am not worthy of it, my Lord! Let me alone; let me alone!" As the spiritual joy of love, so may also the spiritual longing of love consume the body (cf. <a href="/job/19-27.htm">Job 19:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/63-2.htm">Psalm 63:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>); there have been men who have actually sunk under a longing desire after the Lord and eternity. It is the state of love-ecstasy in which Shulamith calls for refreshment, because she is afraid of sinking. The contrast between her, the poor and unworthy, and the king, who appears to her as an ideal of beauty and majesty, who raises her up to himself, was such as to threaten her life. Unlooked for, extraordinary fortune, has already killed many. Fear, producing lameness and even death, is a phenomenon common in the Orient.<p>(Note: "Ro&#8219;b (&#1512;&#1506;&#1489;, thus in Damascus), or ra&#8219;b (thus in the Hauran and among the Beduins), is a state of the soul which with us is found only in a lower degree, but which among the Arabians is psychologically noteworthy. The wahm, i.e., the idea of the greatness and irresistibility of a danger or a misfortune, overpowers the Arabian; all power of body and of soul suddenly so departs from him, that he falls down helpless and defenceless. Thus, on the 8th July 1860, in a few hours, about 6000 Christian men were put to death in Damascus, without one lifting his hand in defence, or uttering one word of supplication. That the ro&#8219;b kills in Arabia, European and native physicians have assured me; and I myself can confirm the fact. Since it frequently produces a stiffening of the limbs, with chronic lameness, every kind of paralysis is called ro&#8219;b, and every paralytic mar&#8219;u&#770;b. It is treated medically by applying the 'terror-cup' (ta&#770;set er-ro&#8219;b), covered over with sentences engraved on it, and hung round with twenty bells; and since, among the Arabians, the influence of the psychical on the physical is stronger and more immediate than with us, the sympathetic cure may have there sometimes positive results." - Wetstein.)<p>If Pharaoh's daughter, if the Queen of Sheba, finds herself in the presence of Solomon, the feeling of social equality prevents all alarm. But Shulamith is dazzled by the splendour, and disconcerted; and it happens to her in type as it happened to the seer of Patmos, who, in presence of the ascended Lord, fell at His feet as one dead, <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>. If beauty is combined with dignity, it has always, for gentle and not perverted natures, something that awakens veneration and tremor; but if the power of love be superadded, then it has, as a consequence, that combination of awe and inward delight, the psychological appearance of which Sappho, in the four strophes which begin with "&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;," has described in a manner so true to nature. We may thus, without carrying back modern sentimentality into antiquity, suppose that Shulamith sank down in a paroxysm caused by the rivalry between the words of love and of praise, and thus thanking him, - for Solomon supports and bears her up, - she exclaims:  </body></html>
