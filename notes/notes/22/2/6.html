The lily is a very noble plant in the East; it grows to a considerable height, but has a weak stem. The church is weak in herself, yet is strong in Him that supports her. The wicked, the daughters of this world, who have no love to Christ, are as thorns, worthless and useless, noxious and hurtful. Corruptions are thorns in the flesh; but the lily now among thorns, shall be transplanted into that paradise where there is no brier or thorn. The world is a barren tree to the soul; but Christ is a fruitful one. And when poor souls are parched with convictions of sin, with the terrors of the law, or the troubles of this world, weary and heavy laden, they may find rest in Christ. It is not enough to pass by this shadow, but we must sit down under it. Believers have tasted that the Lord Jesus is gracious; his fruits are all the precious privileges of the new covenant, purchased by his blood, and communicated by his Spirit; promises are sweet to a believer, and precepts also. Pardons are sweet, and peace of conscience sweet. If our mouths are out of taste for the pleasures of sin, Divine consolations will be sweet to us. Christ brings the soul to seek and to find comforts through his ordinances, which are as a banqueting-house where his saints feast with him. The love of Christ, manifested by his death, and by his word, is the banner he displays, and believers resort to it. How much better is it with the soul when sick from love to Christ, than when surfeited with the love of this world! And though Christ seemed to have withdrawn, yet he was even then a very present help. All his saints are in his hand, which tenderly holds their aching heads. Finding Christ thus nigh to her, the soul is in great care that her communion with him is not interrupted. We easily grieve the Spirit by wrong tempers. Let those who have comfort, fear sinning it away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render as a wish or prayer: "O that his left hand were under my head, and that his right hand did embrace me!"

The "stay" she prayed for (So 2:5) is granted (De 33:12, 27; Ps 37:24; Isa 41:16). None can pluck from that embrace (Joh 10:28-30). His hand keeps us from falling (Mt 14:30, 31); to it we may commit ourselves (Ps 31:5).<p>left hand&#8212;the left is the inferior hand, by which the Lord less signally manifests His love, than by the right; the secret hand of ordinary providence, as distinguished from that of manifested grace (the "right"). They really go together, though sometimes they seem divided; here both are felt at once. Theodoret takes the left hand, equivalent to judgment and wrath; the right, equivalent to honor and love. The hand of justice no longer is lifted to smite, but is under the head of the believer to support (Isa 42:21); the hand of Jesus Christ pierced by justice for our sin supports us. The charge not to disturb the beloved occurs thrice: but the sentiment here, "His left hand," &c., nowhere else fully; which accords with the intensity of joy (So 2:5) found nowhere else; in So 8:3, it is only conditional, "should embrace," not "doth."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/songs/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Is under my head, </span> as a pillow for me to rest upon.

The church, having desired to be stayed, supported, strengthened, and comforted, presently found her beloved with her, who with both hands sustained her; which shows his tender love to her, care of her, and regard for her; and is expressive of the near and intimate communion she had with him, as the effect of union to him, often enjoyed in his house and ordinances; likewise of blessings of every kind she received from him; temporal, mercies, or left hand blessings, which are necessary to support and carry through this wilderness; and spiritual, or right hand blessings, as justification, pardon, adoption, &amp;c. and, moreover, may denote the safety and security of the church, being encircled in the arms of her beloved, sustained by Christ's left hand, and embraced by his right hand, out of whose hands none can pluck. Some read the words prayer wise, "let his left hand be", &amp;c. (b); still desiring further tokens of his love to her, and more and nearer communion with him: others read it in the future, "his left hand will be", &amp;c.

Hitzig remarks, that up to "my beloved" the words appear as those of mutual politeness - that therefore &#1504;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (charming) is added at once to distinguish her beloved from the king, who is to her insufferable. But if a man and a woman are together, and he says &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1499;&#1498; and she says &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1498;, that is as certainly an interchange of address as that one and one are two and not three. He praises her beauty; but in her eyes it is rather he who is beautiful, yea charming: she rejoices beforehand in that which is assigned to her. Where else would her conjugal happiness find its home but among her own rural scenes? The city with its noisy display does not please her; and she knows, indeed, that her beloved is a king, but she thinks of him as a shepherd. Therefore she praises the fresh green of their future homestead; cedar tops will form the roof of the house in which they dwell, and cypresses its wainscot. The bed, and particularly the bridal-bower (D. M. Z. xxii. 153), - but not merely the bed in which one sleeps, but also the cushion for rest, the divan (<a href="/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>), - has the name &#1506;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, from &#1506;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, to cover over; cf. the "network of goats' hair" (<a href="/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>) and the &#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; of Holofernes (Judith 10:21; 13:9), (whence our kanapee  equals  canopy), a bed covered over for protection against the &#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, the gnats. &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, whence here the fem. adj. accented on the ult., is not a word of colour, but signifies to be extensible, and to extend far and wide, as lentus in lenti salices; we have no word such as this which combines in itself the ideas of softness and juicy freshness, of bending and elasticity, of looseness, and thus of overhanging ramification (as in the case of the weeping willow). The beams are called &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, from &#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, to meet, to lay crosswise, to hold together (cf. congingere and contignare). &#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1496;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (after another reading, &#1512;&#1495;, from &#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1496;, with Kametz immutable, or a virtual Dag.) is North Palest.  equals  &#1512;&#1492;  equals  .tse (Ker&#305;&#770;), for in place of &#1512;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, troughs (<a href="/exodus/2-16.htm">Exodus 2:16</a>), the Samarit. has &#1512;&#1495;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. sahar and sahhar, circumire, zahar and zahhar, whence the Syr. name of scarlet); here the word, if it is not defect. plur. (Heiligst.), is used as collect. sing. of the hollows or panels of a wainscoted ceiling, like &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, whence the lxx &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (Symm. &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), and like lacunae, whence lacunaria, for which Jerome has here laquearia, which equally denotes the wainscot ceiling. Abulwald glosses the word rightly by &#1502;&#1512;&#1494;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, gutters (from &#1512;&#1492;&#1496;, to run); only this and &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; of the Gr. Venet. is not an architectural expression, like &#1512;&#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, which is still found in the Talm. (vid., Buxtorf's Lex.). To suppose a transposition from &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1496;&#1504;&#1493;, from &#1495;&#1512;&#1496;, to turn, to carve (Ew., Heiligst., Hitz.), is accordingly not necessary. As the &#1514; in &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; belongs to the North Palest. (Galilean) form of speech, <p>(Note: Pliny, H. N. xxiv. 102, ed. Jan., notes brathy as the name of the savin-tree Juniperus sabina. Wetstein is inclined to derive the name of Beirut from &#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, as the name of the sweet pine, the tree peculiar to the Syrian landscape, and which, growing on the sandy hills, prevents the town from being filled with flying sand. The cypress is now called (Arab.) sanawbar; regarding its old names, and their signification in the figurative language of love, vid., under <a href="/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a>.)<p>so also &#1495; for &#1492; in this word: an exchange of the gutturals was characteristic of the Galilean idiom (vid., Talm. citations by Frankel, Einl. in d. jerus.

Well knowing that a mere hut was not suitable for the king, Shulamith's fancy converts one of the magnificent nature-temples of the North Palest. forest-solitudes into a house where, once together, they will live each for the other. Because it is a large house, although not large by art, she styles it by the poet. plur. ba&#772;attenu.
