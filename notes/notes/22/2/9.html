None besides can speak to the heart. She sees him come. This may be applied to the prospect the Old Testament saints had of Christ's coming in the flesh. He comes as pleased with his own undertaking. He comes speedily. Even when Christ seems to forsake, it is but for a moment; he will soon return with everlasting loving-kindness. The saints of old saw him, appearing through the sacrifices and ceremonial institutions. We see him through a glass darkly, as he manifests himself through the lattices. Christ invites the new convert to arise from sloth and despondency, and to leave sin and worldly vanities, for union and communion with him. The winter may mean years passed in ignorance and sin, unfruitful and miserable, or storms and tempests that accompanied his conviction of guilt and danger. Even the unripe fruits of holiness are pleasant unto Him whose grace has produced them. All these encouraging tokens and evidences of Divine favour, are motives to the soul to follow Christ more fully. Arise then, and come away from the world and the flesh, come into fellowship with Christ. This blessed change is owing wholly to the approaches and influences of the Sun of righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Like a roe - Gazelle (compare <a href="/proverbs/5-19.htm">Proverbs 5:19</a> note).

The legal wall of partition was not to be removed until His death (Eph 2:14, 15; Heb 10:20). Even now, He is only seen by faith, through the windows of His Word and the lattice of ordinances and sacraments (Lu 24:35; Joh 14:21); not full vision (1Co 13:12); an incentive to our looking for His second coming (Isa 33:17; Tit 2:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/songs/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Like a roe or a young hart; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The church, upon the swift and speedy approach of Christ unto her, compares him to these creatures; which are well known for their swiftness (l) in running, and agility in leaping, as before observed: and, besides these things, Christ may be compared to them on other accounts; they are pleasant and lovely, choice and valuable; bear an antipathy to serpents, which they easily overcome; are very good for food, and very agreeable, and are long lived creatures (m); Christ is lovely and amiable in his person, and high in the esteem of his divine Father, angels and men; is choice and excellent in his nature, offices, and grace; bears an antipathy to the old serpent, the devil, whose works and powers he came to destroy, and has got an entire victory over them; and is very agreeable food to faith; his flesh is meat indeed, and the more so through his sufferings and death; as the flesh of those creatures is said to be the more tender and agreeable, by being hunted; and Christ, though dead, is alive, and lives for evermore; <p>behold, he standeth behind our wall; not the middle wall of the ceremonial law, behind which, Christ, under the Old Testament dispensation, stood, showing himself to believers; nor the wall of our humanity he partook of, when he came in the flesh, and under which his glorious deity was in some measure covered and hid; but rather the wall of our hearts, <a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>; the hardness, infidelity, and carnal reasonings of it, which are so many walls of separation between Christ and his people; behind which he stands, showing his resentment of them, and in order to demolish them, and get admittance: he is represented here, as nearer than when she first saw him, even at her very home; <p>he looketh forth at the windows; this is coming nearer still; for, by the manner of the expression, it seems that he was within doors, since he is said, not to look through the windows, but to look forth at them, meaning the ordinances; which are that to the church as windows to a house, the means of letting in light into the souls of men; and where Christ shows himself, in his glory and beauty, as kings and great personages look out at windows to show themselves to their people: though Christ may also be said to look in at, those windows, to observe the behaviour of his people in his house and ordinances, with what attention, affection, faith, and reverence, they wait upon him in them; <p>showing himself through the lattice; by which may be meant the same things, only a larger and clearer discovery of Christ in them, of which ordinances are the means; and yet, unless Christ shows himself through them, he cannot be seen in them: and a "behold" being prefixed to these gradual discoveries of himself, show them to be wonderful! a glance of him behind the wall is surprising; his looking in at the windows still more so; but his showing himself, in all his glories and excellencies, through the lattice, is enough to throw into the greatest rapture, to fill with joy unspeakable and full of glory! Some render the word "flourishing" (n), like a rose or lily, or like a vine, or jessamine; which grow up by a window or lattice, and, seen through them, took very pleasant and delightful. But the allusion is rather to the quick sighted roe, or young hart; which, as it is remarkable for its swiftness, referred to, Sol 2:8, so for the sharpness of its sight; Pliny (o) says it is never dim sighted; it has its name "dorcas", in Greek, from its sight. <p>(l) "Cervi veloces", Virgil.

The allegorical interpreters all made the bridegroom look out from a safe and quiet dwelling into which the bride desired to come. But, obviously, when the scene actually portrayed is realised, it is seen that he is outside, seeking her, and comes close up to the windows and lattices and peers in. The word translated <span class="ital">glanceth</span> denotes glimmering, shining, and indicates that the <span class="ital">charakkim</span> = ‘lattices’ are openings narrower than windows, and the lover had come so close to them that the gleam of his eyes could be seen.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My beloved is like a roe or a young hart; behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh in at the windows, he showeth himself through the lattice.</span> The <span class="accented">tsevi</span> is the gazelle, Arabic <span class="accented">ghazal.</span> Our word is derived through the Spanish or Moorish <span class="accented">gazela</span>. The young hart, or chamois, is probably so called from the covering of young hair (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-5.htm">Proverbs 6:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>). Shulamith represents herself as within the house, waiting for her friend. Her beloved is standing behind the wall, outside before the house; he is playfully looking through the windows, now through one and now through another, seeking her with peering eyes of love. Both the words employed, convey, the meaning of searching and moving quickly. The <span class="accented">windows</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the openings</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a window broken through a wall, or the meaning may be a lattice window, a pierced wooden structure. The word is not the common word for a window, which is <span class="accented">shevaka</span> (now <span class="accented">shabbaka</span>), from a root meaning "to twist," "to make a lattice." Spiritually, we may see an allusion to the glimpses of truth and tastes of the goodness of religion, which precede the real fellowship of the soul with God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>3a As an apple-tree among the trees of the wood,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is my beloved among the sons.<p>The apple-tree, the name of which, &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, is formed from &#1504;&#1508;&#1495;, and denominates it from its fragrant flower and fruit, is as the king among fruit trees, in Shulamith's view. &#1497;&#1506;&#1512; (from &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;, to be rough, rugged, uneven) is the wilderness and the forest, where are also found trees bearing fruit, which, however, is for the most part sour and unpalatable. But the apple-tree unites delicious fruit along with a grateful shade; and just such a noble tree is the object of her love.<p>3b Under his shadow it delighted me to sit down;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his fruit is sweet to my taste.<p>In concupivi et consedi the principal verb completes itself by the co-ordinating of a verb instead of an adv. or inf. as <a href="/isaiah/42-21.htm">Isaiah 42:21</a>; <a href="/esther/8-7.htm">Esther 8:7</a>; Ewald, 285. However, concupivi et consedi is yet more than concupivi considere, for thereby she not only says that she found delight in sitting down, but at the same time also in sitting down in the shadow of this tree. The Piel &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;, occurring only here, expresses the intensity of the wish and longing. The shadow is a figure of protection afforded, and the fruit a figure of enjoyment obtained. The taste is denoted by &#1495;&#1498;  equals  &#1495;&#1504;&#1498;, from &#1495;&#1504;&#1498;, to chew, or also imbuere; and that which is sweet is called &#1502;&#1514;&#1493;&#1511;, from the smacking connected with an agreeable relish. The usus loq. has neglected this image, true to nature, of physical circumstances in words, especially where, as here, they are transferred to the experience of the soul-life. The taste becomes then a figure of the soul's power of perception (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;); a man's fruit are his words and works, in which his inward nature expresses itself; and this fruit is sweet to those on whom that in which the peculiar nature of the man reveals itself makes a happy, pleasing impression. But not only does the person of the king afford to Shulamith so great delight, he entertains her also with what can and must give her enjoyment. </body></html>
