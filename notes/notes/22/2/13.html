None besides can speak to the heart. She sees him come. This may be applied to the prospect the Old Testament saints had of Christ's coming in the flesh. He comes as pleased with his own undertaking. He comes speedily. Even when Christ seems to forsake, it is but for a moment; he will soon return with everlasting loving-kindness. The saints of old saw him, appearing through the sacrifices and ceremonial institutions. We see him through a glass darkly, as he manifests himself through the lattices. Christ invites the new convert to arise from sloth and despondency, and to leave sin and worldly vanities, for union and communion with him. The winter may mean years passed in ignorance and sin, unfruitful and miserable, or storms and tempests that accompanied his conviction of guilt and danger. Even the unripe fruits of holiness are pleasant unto Him whose grace has produced them. All these encouraging tokens and evidences of Divine favour, are motives to the soul to follow Christ more fully. Arise then, and come away from the world and the flesh, come into fellowship with Christ. This blessed change is owing wholly to the approaches and influences of the Sun of righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The vines ... - The vines in blossom give forth fragrance.

Another sign of spring being come, nay, of its being pretty much advanced, since Christ makes this a token of summer being at hand, <a href="/matthew/24-32.htm">Matthew 24:32</a>. Theopompus (e) speaks of figs in the middle of the spring. This tree puts forth its fruit at once, and does not flower or blossom (f), wherefore <a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a> is wrongly translated; See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a>, though Arianus (g) speaks of its flowering: Aben Ezra thinks the word signifies the sweetening of the figs, and so points at the time when they are sweet and eatable. By the "fig tree" may be meant the saints putting forth their grace in exercise on Christ, who may be compared to fig trees for their leaves and fruit, and for the putting forth the latter before the former (h); for the fig tree is a tree full of large leaves, which may be an emblem of a profession of religion, and of a conversation agreeably to it, which yet are no covering, only the righteousness of Christ is that, yet ought to be and are ornamental; and for the fruit of it, which is wholesome, pleasant, and delightful, as are the fruits of the Spirit, the fruits of grace and righteousness, fruits meet for repentance, which ought to appear before a profession of religion is made. If the Egyptian fig tree is meant, that is a very fruitful tree; it is said to bear fruit seven times a year, but ripens no other way than by scratching it with iron hooks (i); and its wood cut down and cast into water, being dry, sinks, but when thoroughly wet will swim. Saints should bear fruit always, and ever continue to do so, even to old age; nor do any ever become fruitful until their hearts have been pricked and cut by the word of God; and they never grow better, or are more fruitful, than when attended with afflictions and tribulations; when they first enter into the waters of affliction, like Peter, they sink, but, when more used to them, they lift up their heads above them, and bear up with great courage and resolution. By the "green figs" may be meant the beginnings of grace in the soul, some stirrings of affection to Christ, desires of knowledge of him, pantings and breathings after his ordinances, love to his people; all which appear soon, are very imperfect, and, like unripe figs, liable to be shaken off; and it is a miracle of grace that the first impressions of it are not destroyed by the force of corruption and temptation; and it may be observed, that grace in its first appearance, though but small, is not despised, but taken notice of by Christ: yea, he makes use of it as exercised by young converts to stir up old professors, as here the church, to be more active and vigorous in it; <p>and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell; or "being in flower give a good smell" (k), as the word is used in the Targum in <a href="/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>; and that vines do flower appears from the same place, and from <a href="/genesis/40-10.htm">Genesis 40:10</a>; as well as is observed by naturalists and others (l); and these flowers, and not the tender grapes, emit a sweet smell; and, as some say (m), not in the vineyards only, but in the country round about; and these are fitly mentioned next to figs, since the black fig is by some called the sister of the vine (n). By the vines may be intended distinct congregated churches of Christ, or particular believers; vines are very weak; and cannot bear up of themselves, must be fixed to some place, and be supported by something else; and being supported, will run up a great height, and bring forth much fruit. So saints are weak in themselves, and cannot support themselves; their strength is in Christ, and they are upheld by him, and have their dependence on him; and being supported by him they grow up to the stature of the fulness of Christ; and through their grafting into him, and abiding in him the true vine, bring forth much fruit to the glory of God, and such as is not to be found in others. The wood of the vine is of very little worth or use, <a href="/ezekiel/15-2.htm">Ezekiel 15:2</a>; and yet is very lasting. Pliny (o) ascribes a sort of an eternity to it. Believers in Christ, however weak and worthless they are in themselves, as are their best works and services, yet being in Christ they shall abide in him for ever, and never perish, but have everlasting life. And by the "tender grapes", or "flowers", may be designed either the graces of the spirit, as before; or rather young converts, the fruit of Christ's vines, the churches, who, though weak and tender, yet are dear to Christ; and when there is a large appearance of them, it is a great encouragement to churches, and promises a glorious vintage. And the "smell" of these vines, with their grapes and flowers, may intend the fragrancy, of believers through the righteousness of Christ on them, and the odour of their graces, as exercised on him; and the sweet savour of their godly conversation, observed by all about them. <p>Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away; repeated from Sol 2:10; which shows sluggishness on the part of the church, that she needed one exhortation after another; and great love on the part of Christ, that notwithstanding this he persists in calling her; and even importunity in him, that he will have no denial (p): and it may be observed, that what is entertaining to most of the senses is mentioned to engage the church to arise and go along with her beloved; the flowery fields would be pleasing to her eye, the chirping birds to her ear, the sweet and ripening figs to her taste, and the refreshing odour of the vines to her smell. <p>(e) Apud Atheanei Deipnosoph. l. 3. c. 4. p. 77.

According to Riehm’s <span class="ital">Handwörterbuch</span>, the fig bears two kinds of figs. (1) There is the early fig (Heb. <span class="ital">bikkûrâh</span>). These, when unripe, are called <span class="ital">paggîm</span>. They grow upon the old wood and appear before the leaf-buds, but require about four months, as a rule, to ripen. They are ripe towards the end of June. (2) The late figs (Heb. <span class="ital">tě’çnîm</span>) which grow successively upon the new branches so long as the development of vegetation continues, and ripen at various times. In Palestine they ripen from August onwards. Often, especially in the older trees, there are many figs still unripe when the leaves fall and vegetation stops. These remain on the tree in their unripe state throughout the winter and become ripe only in spring, partly before, and partly after, the coming of the leaves. These, which are usually darker and partly violet coloured, are called winter figs. These latter are the only ones that can be referred to here, for they are a mark of the coming of spring. Probably they too were called <span class="ital">paggîm</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">putteth forth</span>] With regard to the word thus translated there is much difference of opinion. It is <span class="ital">châněṭä́h</span>, and the verb occurs elsewhere in Scripture only in <a href="/genesis/50-2.htm" title="And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.">Genesis 50:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/50-26.htm" title="So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.">Genesis 50:26</a>, where it means ‘to embalm.’ The dictionaries give two meanings, (1) to spice, (2) to embalm. The latter is here out of the question, but the words may mean, <span class="ital">the fig tree spiceth her unripe figs</span>, that is, gives taste and perfume to them. On the other hand it may be rendered <span class="ital">reddeneth</span> as the Heb. word for ‘wheat,’ viz. <span class="ital">chiṭṭâh</span>, is in all probability derived from this root, and means the red or reddish-brown (cp. Levy’s <span class="ital">Neuhebr. Wörterb</span>. 11. 203 <span class="ital">a</span>). The corresponding Arabic word which means to redden, occurs of leather only, but all the data suggest that it was also used of the colour of plants approaching maturity. Here consequently it most probably means, <span class="bld">the fig tree maketh red ripe her winter figs</span>, which <span class="bld">grow red</span> or even violet as they ripen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the vines</span> with <span class="ital">the tender grape give a</span> good <span class="ital">smell</span>] Rather, as R.V., <span class="bld">and the vines</span> (are) <span class="bld">in blossom, they give forth their fragrance</span>. <span class="ital">Blossom</span> is in Heb. <span class="ital">sěmâdhar</span>, a word which occurs only in the Song of Solomon. The Rabbis and the Mishnah say that the word signifies the tender grapes when they first appear. Twenty days later they become <span class="ital">bôsěrîm</span> = ὄμφακες, and when they are fully ripe they are called <span class="ital">‘anâbhîm</span>. Similarly Kimchi. But in the Targum to <a href="/isaiah/18-5.htm" title="For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.">Isaiah 18:5</a> <span class="ital">nitztzâh</span> = ‘flower’ is translated by <span class="ital">semâdhar</span>, and in the Syriac version of <a href="/isaiah/17-11.htm" title="In the day shall you make your plant to grow, and in the morning shall you make your seed to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.">Isaiah 17:11</a> the same word is used where we have, “thou makest thy seed to blossom,” so that probably it is to be taken as ‘bloom’ or flower, more especially as the vines would hardly have rudimentary grapes so early as April, which is the time when the rain is over and gone. The derivation of the word is unknown.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my love</span>] Here, as in <span class="ital"><a href="/songs/2-10.htm" title="My beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.">Song of Solomon 2:10</a></span> and elsewhere, <span class="ital">my friend</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Arise, my love</span>] should be <span class="ital">Rise up, my friend</span>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>7 I adjure you, ye daughters of Jerusalem,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; By the gazelles or the hinds of the field,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That ye arouse not and disturb not love<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Till she pleases.<p>It is permitted to the Israelites to swear, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;, only by God (<a href="/genesis/21-23.htm">Genesis 21:23</a>); but to adjure, &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;, by that which is not God, is also admissible, although this example before us is perhaps the only direct one in Scripture. &#1510;&#1489;&#1497; ( equals  &#1510;&#1489;&#1497;, dialect. &#1496;&#1489;&#1497;), fem. &#1510;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; (Aram. &#1496;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;, <a href="/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36</a>), plur. tsebaim or tsebajim, fem. tsabao&#772;th (according with the pl. of &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;), softened from tsebajo&#772;th, is the name for the gazelle, from the elegance of its form and movements. &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is the connecting form of &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, whose consonantal Yod in the Assyr. and Syr. is softened to the diphthong ailuv, ailaa; the gen. "of the field," as not distinguishing but describing, belongs to both of the animals, therefore also the first is without the article. &#1488;&#1493; (after the etymon corresponding to the Lat. vel) proceeds, leaving out of view the repetition of this so-called Slumber-Song (Sol 3:5; cf. Sol 8:4, as also Sol 2:9), from the endeavour to give to the adjuration the greatest impression; the expression is varied, for the representations flit from image to image, and the one, wherever possible, is surpassed by the other (vid., at <a href="/proverbs/30-31.htm">Proverbs 30:31</a>).<p>Under this verse Hengst. remarks: "The bride would not adjure by the hinds, much more would she adjure by the stage." He supposes that Solomon is here the speaker; but a more worthless proof for this could not be thought of. On the contrary, the adjuration by the gazelles, etc., shows that the speaker here is one whose home is the field and wood; thus also not the poet (Hitz.) nor the queen-mother (Bttch.), neither of whom is ever introduced as speaking. The adjuration is that love should not be disturbed, and therefore it is by the animals that are most lovely and free, which roam through the fields. Zckler, with whom in this one point Grtz agrees, finds here, after the example of Bttch. and Hitz., the earnest warning against wantonly exciting love in themselves (cf. Lat. irritamenta veneris, irritata voluptas) till God Himself awakens it, and heart finds itself in sympathy with heart. But the circumstances in which Shulamith is placed ill accord with such a general moralizing. The adjuration is repeated, Sol 3:5; Sol 8:4, and wherever Shulamith finds herself near her beloved, as she is here in his arms. What lies nearer, then, than that she should guard against a disturbance of this love-ecstasy, which is like a slumber penetrated by delightful dreams? Instead of &#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, should be more exactly the words &#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1503;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;; but the gram. distinction of the genera is in Heb. not perfectly developed. We meet also with the very same synallage generis, without this adjuration formula, at Sol 5:8; Sol 7:1; Sol 4:2; Sol 6:8, etc.; it is also elsewhere frequent; but in the Song it perhaps belongs to the foil of the vulgar given to the highly poetic. Thus also in the vulgar Arab. the fem. forms jak&#803;tulna, tak&#803;tulna, corresponding to &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;&#1504;&#1492;, are fallen out of use. With &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, expergefacere, there is connected the idea of an interruption of sleep; with &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;, excitare, the idea, which goes further, of arousing out of sleep, placing in the full activity of awakened life.<p>(Note: The distinction between these words is well explained by Lewisohn in his Investigationes Linguae (Wilna, 1840), p. 21: "The &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; is satisfied that the sleeper wakes, and it is left to him fully to overcome the influence of sleep; the &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;, however, arouses him at once from sleepiness, and awakes him to such a degree that he is secured against falling asleep again.")<p>The one adjuration is, that love should not be awakened out of its sweet dream; the other, that it should not be disturbed from its being absorbed in itself. The Pasek between &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493; and the word following has, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>, the design of keeping the two Vavs distinct, that in reading they might not run together; it is the Pasek which, as Ben Asher says, serves "to secure to a letter its independence against the similar one standing next it." &#1492;&#1488;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; is not abstr. pro concreto, but love itself in its giving and receiving. Thus closes the second scene of the first act: Shulamith lies like one helpless in the arms of Solomon; but in him to expire is her life; to have lost herself in him, and in him to find herself again, is her happiness. </body></html>
