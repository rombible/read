In the sight of Christ believers are the excellent of the earth, fitted to be instruments for promoting his glory. The spiritual gifts and graces which Christ bestows on every true believer, are described by the ornaments then in use, ver. 10,11. The graces of the saints are many, but there is dependence upon each other. He who is the Author, will be the Finisher of the good work. The grace received from Christ's fulness, springs forth into lively exercises of faith, affection, and gratitude. Yet Christ, not his gifts, is most precious to them. The word translated camphire, signifies atonement or propitiation. Christ is dear to all believers, because he is the propitiation for their sins. No pretender must have his place in the soul. They resolved to lodge him in their hearts all the night; during the continuance of the troubles of life. Christ takes delight in the good work which his grace has wrought on the souls of believers. This should engage all who are made holy, to be very thankful for that grace which has made those fair, who by nature were deformed. The spouse (the believer) has a humble, modest eye, discovering simplicity and godly sincerity; eyes enlightened and guided by the Holy Spirit, that blessed Dove. The church expresses her value for Christ. Thou art the great Original, but I am but a faint and imperfect copy. Many are fair to look at, yet their temper renders them unpleasant: but Christ is fair, yet pleasant. The believer, ver. 16, speaks with praise of those holy ordinances in which true believers have fellowship with Christ. Whether the believer is in the courts of the Lord, or in retirement; whether following his daily labours, or confined on the bed of sickness, or even in a dungeon, a sense of the Divine presence will turn the place into a paradise. Thus the soul, daily having fellowship with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, enjoys a lively hope of an incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rows ... borders - The same Hebrew word in both places; ornaments forming part of the bride's head-dress, probably strings of beads or other ornaments descending on the cheeks. The introduction of "jewels" and "gold" in Sol 1:10 injures the sense and destroys the climax of Sol 1:11, which was spoken by a chorus (hence "we," not "I," as when the king speaks, Sol 1:9). They promise the bride ornaments more worthy and becoming than the rustic attire in which she has already such charms for the king: "Ornaments of gold will we make for thee with studs (or 'points') of silver." The "studs" are little silver ornaments which it is proposed to affix to the golden (compare <a href="/proverbs/25-12.htm">Proverbs 25:12</a>), or substitute for the strung beads of the bride's necklace.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/songs/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

He crowns His own work in us (Isa 26:12). The "borders" here are equivalent to "rows" (So 1:10); but here, the King seems to give the finish to her attire, by adding a crown (borders, or circles) of gold studded with silver spots, as in Es 2:17. Both the royal and nuptial crown, or chaplet. The Hebrew for "spouse" (So 4:8) is a crowned one (Eze 16:12; Re 2:10). The crown is given at once upon conversion, in title, but in sensible possession afterwards (2Ti 4:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/songs/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">We; </span> I thy Bridegroom, with the cooperation of my Father, and of the Holy Spirit.

Christ here in his own name, and in the name of the other two divine Persons, promises to the church a greater glory than as yet she had enjoyed; and seems to have respect to the Gospel dispensation; for by "golden borders" studded with "silver" may be meant the ordinances of the Gospel, preferable to those under the law; and therefore said to be of "gold and silver", for their glory, splendour, and durableness: or else the doctrines of the Gospel, being of more worth than thousands of gold and silver; and being called "borders", or rather "rows" (e), may denote their orderly disposition and connection, their harmony and agreement with and dependence on each other: and the Gospel is full of silver "specks" or "studs" of exceeding great and precious promises; a variety of them useful and pleasant; a greater measure of the grace of the Spirit may be here promised: or the "borders" may intend the groundwork of the church's faith and hope, the justifying righteousness of Christ, more clearly revealed; and the "studs of silver" the curious work of sanctification, more enlarged and increased; and so take in both Christ's righteousness imputed to her, and his grace implanted in her; but perhaps these phrases may be best of all understood of the New Jerusalem state, and of the ultimate glory of the saints in heaven, sometimes set forth by such similes, <a href="/isaiah/54-11.htm">Isaiah 54:11</a>. Both grace and glory are given by Christ, and in which all the three divine Persons are concerned; for not angels, nor the daughters of Jerusalem, are here the speakers, to whom such things promised cannot agree; nor God, speaking after the manner of men, and for honour's sake, is designed: but the trinity of Persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, are meant; the ordinances are of their institution, and administered in their name, <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>; they have all a concern it, the Gospel and the doctrines of it, which is called the Gospel of God, and the Gospel, of Christ, and the ministering of the Spirit; the grace of God, in regeneration and conversion, is sometimes ascribed to one and sometimes to another; and an increase of it in the heart is wished for from all three, <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; and they have a hand in all the glory the saints shall enjoy hereafter: the Father has prepared the kingdom from the foundation of the world; the Son has made way for it by his obedience, sufferings, and death; and the Spirit is the earnest of it, makes meet for it, and introduces into it. <p>(e) "ordines", Marckius, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/songs/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/songs/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">strings of golden beads</span> <span class="ital">will we make thee, with</span> <span class="bld">points</span> <span class="ital">of silver</span>.

She is, as will afterwards appear, from Lower Galilee; - and it may be remarked, in the interest of the mystical interpretation, that the church, and particularly her first congregations, according to the prophecy, was also Galilean, for Nazareth and Capernaum are their original seats; - and if Shulamith is a poetico-mystical Mashal or emblem, then she represents the synagogue one day to enter into the fellowship of Solomon - i.e., of the son of David, and the daughters of Jerusalem, i.e., the congregation already believing on the Messiah. Yet we confine ourselves to the nearest sense, in which Solomon relates a self-experience. Shulamith, the lightly esteemed, cannot boast that she is so ruddy and fair of countenance as they who have just sung how pleasant it is to be beloved by this king; but yet she is not so devoid of beauty as not to venture to love and hope to be loved: "Black am I, yet comely." These words express humility without abjectness. She calls herself "black," although she is not so dark and unchangeably black as an "Ethiopian" (<a href="/jeremiah/13-23.htm">Jeremiah 13:23</a>). The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; has the general primary idea of growing dark, and signifies not necessarily soot-blackness (modern Arab. shuhwar, soot), but blackness more or less deep, as &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;, the name of the morning twilight, or rather the morning grey, shows; for (Arab.) sah&#803;ar <p>(Note: After an improbable etymology of the Arab., from sah&#803;ar, to turn, to depart, "the departure of the night" (Lane). Magic appears also to be called sihar, as nigromantia (Mediaev. from nekromantia), the black art.)<p>denotes the latter, as distinguished from (Arab.) fajr, the morning twilight (vid., under <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-11.htm">Isaiah 47:11</a>). She speaks of herself as a Beduin who appears to herself as (Arab.) sawda, black, and calls <p>(Note: The houri (damsel of paradise) is thus called h&#803;awaryyt, adj. relat. from h&#803;awra, from the black pupil of the eye in the centre of the white eyeball.)<p>the inhabitants of the town (Arab.) h&#803;awaryyat (cute candidas). The Vav we have translated "yet" ("yet comely"); it connects the opposite, which exists along with the blackness. &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; is the fem. of the adj. &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;  equals  &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;, which is also formed by means of the doubling of the third stem-letter of &#1504;&#1488;&#1492;  equals  &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;, &#1504;&#1488;&#1497; (to bend forward, to aim; to be corresponding to the aim, conformable, becoming, beautiful), e.g., like &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, to be full of sap, green. Both comparisons run parallel to nigra et bella; she compares on the one hand the tents of Kedar, and on the other the tapestry of Solomon. &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; signifies originally, in general, the dwelling-place, as &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; the place where one spends the night; these two words interchange: ohel is the house of the nomad, and baith is the tent of him who is settled. &#1511;&#1491;&#1512; (with the Tsere, probably from (Arab.) k&#803;adar, to have ability, be powerful, though of after the Heb. manner, as Theodoret explains and Symm. also translates: &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, from (Heb.) Kadar, atrum esse) is the name of a tribe of North. Arab. Ishmaelites (<a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>) whom Pliny speaks of (Cedraei in his Hist. Nat. Sol 5:11), but which disappeared at the era of the rise of Islam; the Karaite Jefeth uses for it the word (Arab.) K&#803;arysh, for he substitutes the powerful Arab tribe from which Muhammed sprung, and rightly remarks: "She compares the colour of her skin to the blackness of the hair tents of the Koreishites," - even to the present day the Beduin calls his tent his "hair-house" (be&#770;t wabar, or, according to a more modern expression, be&#770;t sa'r, &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;); for the tents are covered with cloth made of the hair of goats, which are there mostly black-coloured or grey. On the one hand, dark-coloured as the tents of the Kedarenes, she may yet, on the other hand, compare herself to the beautiful appearance of the &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; of Solomon. By this word we will have to think of a pleasure-tent or pavilion for the king; pavillon (softened from Lat. papilio) is a pleasure-tent spread out like the flying butterfly. This Heb. word could certainly also mean curtains for separating a chamber; but in the tabernacle and the temple the curtains separating the Most Holy from the Holy Place were not so designated, but are called &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514; and &#1502;&#1505;&#1498;; and as with the tabernacle, so always elsewhere, &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;, to tremble, to move hither and thither) is the name of the cloths or tapestry which formed the sides of the tent (<a href="/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>); of the tent coverings, which were named in parall. with the tents themselves as the clothing of their framework (<a href="/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-20.htm">Jeremiah 4:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-20.htm">Jeremiah 10:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>). Such tent hangings will thus also be here meant; precious, as those described <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26</a> and 36, and as those which formed the tabernacle on Zion (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/17-1.htm">1 Chronicles 17:1</a>) before the erection of the temple. Those made in Egypt <p>(Note: Vid., Wetzstein's Isaiah (1869), p. 698.)<p>were particularly prized in ancient times. </body></html>
