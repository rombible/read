The kisses of his mouth mean those assurances of pardon with which believers are favoured, filling them with peace and joy in believing, and causing them to abound in hope by the power of the Holy Ghost. Gracious souls take most pleasure in loving Christ, and being loved of him. Christ's love is more valuable and desirable than the best this world can give. The name of Christ is not now like ointment sealed up, but like ointment poured forth; which denotes the freeness and fulness of the setting forth of his grace by the gospel. Those whom he has redeemed and sanctified, are here the virgins that love Jesus Christ, and follow him whithersoever he goes, Re 14:4. They entreat him to draw them by the quickening influences of his Spirit. The more clearly we discern Christ's glory, the more sensible shall we be that we are unable to follow him suitably, and at the same time be more desirous of doing it. Observe the speedy answer given to this prayer. Those who wait at Wisdom's gate, shall be led into truth and comfort. And being brought into this chamber, our griefs will vanish. We have no joy but in Christ, and for this we are indebted to him. We will remember to give thanks for thy love; it shall make more lasting impressions upon us than any thing in this world. Nor is any love acceptable to Christ but love in sincerity, Eph 6:24. The daughters of Jerusalem may mean professors not yet established in the faith. The spouse was black as the tents of the wandering Arabs, but comely as the magnificent curtains in the palaces of Solomon. The believer is black, as being defiled and sinful by nature, but comely, as renewed by Divine grace to the holy image of God. He is still deformed with remains of sin, but comely as accepted in Christ. He is often base and contemptible in the esteem of men, but excellent in the sight of God. The blackness was owing to the hard usage that had been suffered. The children of the church, her mother, but not of God, her Father, were angry with her. They had made her suffer hardships, which caused her to neglect the care of her soul. Thus, under the emblem of a poor female, made the chosen partner of a prince, we are led to consider the circumstances in which the love of Christ is accustomed to find its objects. They were wretched slaves of sin, in toil, or in sorrow, weary and heavy laden, but how great the change when the love of Christ is manifested to their souls!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because ... - Better, For fragrance are thine ointments good, making with the clause that follows two steps of a climax: "thy perfumes are good, thy name the best of all perfumes."

The holy anointing oil of the high priest, which it was death for anyone else to make (so Ac 4:12), implies the exclusive preciousness of Messiah's name (Ex 30:23-28, 31-38). So Mary brake the box of precious ointment over Him, appropriately (Mr 14:5), the broken box typifying His body, which, when broken, diffused all grace: compounded of various spices, &c.

It was usual for lovers to anoint themselves, their hair, garments, &amp;c. to commend themselves to each other; and it was common to commend each other's ointments, and the grateful smell of them (q) none being like them, or so agreeable as theirs: by these ointments may be meant the grace of Christ, the fulness of it, the oil of gladness with which he is anointed above his fellows, and without measure; and which so greatly recommends him to his church and people, <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>; <p>thy name is as ointment poured forth; which emits the greater odour for its being poured forth out of the box. The very names of lovers are dear to one another, sweeter than nectar itself (r); the very mention of them gives an inexpressible pleasure. This may respect not merely the fame of Christ spread abroad in the world through the ministry of the word; nor the Gospel only, which is his name, <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; and is like a box of ointment broke open, which diffuses the savour of his knowledge everywhere; but some precious name of his, as Immanuel, God with us; Jesus, a Saviour; but more particularly his name Messiah, which signifies anointed, the anointed Prophet, Priest, and King of his church; <p>therefore do the virgins love thee: for the preciousness of his person, the fulness of grace in him, and the truths of his Gospel: and which love shows itself in a desire of his presence, and communion with him; in a regard to his word and worship, to his truths and ordinances; and to his people, to conversation and communion with them. By these virgins are meant either congregational churches that strictly adhere to Christ, and to his pure worship; or particular believers, for their inviolate attachment to him; for the singleness and sincerity of their love to him; for their uncorruptness in the doctrine of faith; for the truth and spirituality of their worship; for the purity of their lives and conversations; for their beauty and comeliness through Christ; for their colourful and costly attire, being clothed with his righteousness; and for their modest behaviour, having the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit. <p>(q) "Nam omuium unguentum odos prae tua nautea est", Plauti Curculio, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>.

Lovely and delightful thou art. As thy perfumes are so precious, so is thy name; the more it is spread, the more delight is found in it. The idea is that the person is the sweetest, and that his communications are elevating and inspiring. The "virgins" may be taken generally, "Those who are full of the sensibility of youth appreciate thy attractions." The word <span class="accented">almah</span> is much disputed about, but the meaning is simply that of "young woman," whether virgin or married. "Thou art the delight of all the young."

The lxx, Aq., and Theod. translate darvonoth by &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, the Venet. by &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;; and that is also correct. The word is one of three found in the Jerus. Gemara, Sanhedrin x. 1, to designate a rod for driving (oxen) - &#1491;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503; (from &#1491;&#1512;&#1489;, to sharpen, to point), &#1502;&#1500;&#1502;&#1491; (from &#1500;&#1502;&#1491;, to adjust, teach, exercise), and &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1506; (from &#1512;&#1491;&#1506;, to hold back, repellere); we read ka-da&#772;revonoth; Gesen., Ewald, Hitz., and others are in error in reading dorvonoth; for the so-called light Metheg, which under certain circumstances can be changed into an accent, and the Kametz chatuph exclude one another.<p>(Note: The Kametz is the Kametz gadhol (opp. Kametz chatuph), and may for this reason have the accent Munach instead of Metheg. Vid., Michlol 153b, 182b. The case is the same as at <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/39-3.htm">Genesis 39:3</a>, where mimmachoraath is to be read. Cf. Baer's Metheg-Setz. 27 and 18.)<p>If &#1491;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503; is the goad, the point of comparison is that which is to be excited intellectually and morally. Incorrectly, Gesen., Hitz., and others: like goads, because easily and deeply impressing themselves on the heart as well as on the memory. For goads, aculei, the Hebrews use the word &#1511;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;; darevonoth also are goads, but designed for driving on, thus stimuli (Jerome); and is there a more natural commendation for the proverbs of the wise men than that they incite to self-reflection, and urge to all kinds of noble effort? Divre and darevonoth have the same three commencing consonants, and, both for the ear and the eye, form a paronomasia. In the following comparison, it is a question whether ba'ale asuppoth (plur. of ba'al asuppoth, or of the double plur. ba'al asuppah, like e.g., sare missim, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>, of sar mas) is meant of persons, like ba'al hallashon, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:11</a>, cf. ba'al kenaphayim, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>, or of things, as ba'al piphiyoth, <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>; and thus, whether it is a designation parallel to &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; or to &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;. The Talm. Jer. Sanhedrin x. 1, wavers, for there it is referred first to the members of the assemblies (viz., of the Sanedrium), and then is explained by "words which are spoken in the assembly." If we understand it of persons, as it was actually used in the Talm., then by asuppoth we must understand the societies of wise men, and by ba'ale asuppoth, of the academicians (Venet.: &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;; Luther: "masters of assemblies") belonging to such academies. But an appropriate meaning of this second comparison is not to be reached in this way. For if we translate: and as nails driven in are the members of the society, it is not easy to see what this wonderful comparison means; and what is then further said: they are given from one shepherd, reminds us indeed of <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>, but, as said of this perfectly unknown great one, is for us incomprehensible. Or if we translate, after <a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a> : and (the words of the wise are) like the fastened nails of the members of the society, it is as tautological as if I should say: words of wise men are like fastened nails of wise men bound together in a society (as a confederacy, union). Quite impossible are the translations: like nails driven in by the masters of assemblies (thus e.g., Lightfoot, and recently Bullock), for the accus. with the pass. particip. may express some nearer definition, but not (as of the genit.) the effective cause; and: like a nail driven in are the (words) of the masters of assemblies (Tyler: "those of editors of collections"), for ellipt. genit., dependent on a governing word carrying forward its influence, are indeed possible, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>, but that a governing word itself, as ba'ale, may be the governed genit. of one omitted, as here divre, is without example.<p>(Note: Regarding this omission of the mud&#803;a&#770;f the governing noun, where this is naturally supplied before a genitive from the preceding, cf. Samachschari's Mufas&#803;s&#803;al, p. 43, l. 8-13.)<p>It is also inconsistent to understand ba'ale asuppoth after the analogy of ba'ale masoreth (the Masoretes) and the like. It will not be meant of the persons of the wise, but of the proverbs of the wise. So far we agree with Lang and Hoelem. Lang (1874) thinks to come to a right understanding of the "much abused" expression by translating, "lords of troops," - a designation of proverbs which, being by many acknowledged and kept in remembrance, possess a kind of lordship over men's minds; but that is already inadmissible, because asuppoth designates not any multitude of men, but associations with a definite end and aim. Hoelem. is content with this idea; for he connects together "planted as leaders of assemblies," and finds therein the thought, that the words of the wise serve as seeds and as guiding lights for the expositions in the congregation; but ba'ale denotes masters, not in the sense of leaders, but of possessors; and as ba'ale berith, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>, signifies "the confederated," ba'ale shevu'ah, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-18.htm">Nehemiah 6:18</a>, "the sworn," and the frequently occurring ba'ale ha'ir, "the citizens;" so ba'ale asuppoth means, the possessors of assemblies and of the assembled themselves, or the possessors of collections and of the things collected. Thus ba'ale asuppoth will be a designation of the "words of the wise" (as in shalishim, choice men  equals  choice proverbs, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-20.htm">Proverbs 22:20</a>, in a certain measure personified), also of those which form or constitute collections, and which stand together in order and rank (Hitz., Ewald, Elst., Zckl., and others). Of such it may properly be said, that they are like nails driven in, for they are secured against separations, - they are, so to speak, made nail-feast, they stand on one common ground; and their being fixed in such connection not only is a help to the memory, but also to the understanding of them. The Book of Koheleth itself is such an asuppah; for it contains a multitude of separate proverbs, which are thoughtfully ranged together, and are introduced into the severe, critical sermon on the nothingness of all earthly things as oases affording rest and refreshment; as similarly, in the later Talmudic literature, Haggadic parts follow long stretches of hair-splitting dialectics, and afford to the reader an agreeable repose.<p>And when he says of the "proverbs of the wise," individually and as formed into collections: &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, i.e., they are the gift of one shepherd, he gives it to be understood that his "words of Koheleth," if not immediately written by Solomon himself, have yet one fountain with the Solomonic Book of Proverbs, - God, the one God, who guides and cares as a shepherd for all who fear Him, and suffers them to want nothing which is necessary to their spiritual support and advancement (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>). "Me&#772;ro'eh ehad," says Grtz, "is yet obscure, since it seldom, and that only poetically, designates the Shepherd of Israel. It cannot certainly refer to Moses." Not to Moses, it is true (Targ.), nor to Solomon, as the father, the pattern, and, as it were, the patron of "the wise," but to God, who is here named the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; as spiritual preserver (provider), not without reference to the figure of a shepherd from the goad, and the figure of household economy from the nails; for &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, in the language of the Chokma (<a href="/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a>), is in meaning cogn. to the N.T. conception of edification.<p>(Note: Vid., my Heb. Rmerbrief, p. 97.)<p>Regarding masmeroth (iron nails), the word is not used of tent spikes (Spohn, Ginsb.), - it is masc., the sing. is &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1512; (&#1502;&#1505;&#1502;&#1512;), Arab. misma&#770;r. &#1504;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; is  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. <a href="/daniel/11-45.htm">Daniel 11:45</a> with <a href="/genesis/31-25.htm">Genesis 31:25</a>), post-bibl. (vid., Jer. Sanhedrin) &#1511;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (Jerome, in altum defixi). Min with the pass., as at <a href="/job/21-1.htm">Job 21:1</a>; <a href="/job/28-4.htm">Job 28:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a> (Ewald, 295b), is not synonymous with the Greek &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;. The lxx well: "given by those of the counsel from one shepherd." Hitzig reads &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, and accordingly translates: "which are given united as a pasture," but in me&#772;ro'eh ehad there lies a significant apologetic hint in favour of the collection of proverbs by the younger Solomon (Koheleth) in relation to that of the old. This is the point of the verse, and it is broken off by Hitzig's conjecture.<p>(Note: J. F. Reimmann, in the preface to his Introduction to the Historia Litterarum antediluviana, translates, <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a> : "The words of the wise are like hewn-out marble, and the beautiful collectanea like set diamonds, which are presented by a good friend." A Disputatio philologica by Abr. Wolf, Knigsberg 1723, contends against this &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;.) </body></html>
