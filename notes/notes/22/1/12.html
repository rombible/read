In the sight of Christ believers are the excellent of the earth, fitted to be instruments for promoting his glory. The spiritual gifts and graces which Christ bestows on every true believer, are described by the ornaments then in use, ver. 10,11. The graces of the saints are many, but there is dependence upon each other. He who is the Author, will be the Finisher of the good work. The grace received from Christ's fulness, springs forth into lively exercises of faith, affection, and gratitude. Yet Christ, not his gifts, is most precious to them. The word translated camphire, signifies atonement or propitiation. Christ is dear to all believers, because he is the propitiation for their sins. No pretender must have his place in the soul. They resolved to lodge him in their hearts all the night; during the continuance of the troubles of life. Christ takes delight in the good work which his grace has wrought on the souls of believers. This should engage all who are made holy, to be very thankful for that grace which has made those fair, who by nature were deformed. The spouse (the believer) has a humble, modest eye, discovering simplicity and godly sincerity; eyes enlightened and guided by the Holy Spirit, that blessed Dove. The church expresses her value for Christ. Thou art the great Original, but I am but a faint and imperfect copy. Many are fair to look at, yet their temper renders them unpleasant: but Christ is fair, yet pleasant. The believer, ver. 16, speaks with praise of those holy ordinances in which true believers have fellowship with Christ. Whether the believer is in the courts of the Lord, or in retirement; whether following his daily labours, or confined on the bed of sickness, or even in a dungeon, a sense of the Divine presence will turn the place into a paradise. Thus the soul, daily having fellowship with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, enjoys a lively hope of an incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The bride's reply Sol 1:12 may mean, "While the king reclines at the banquet I anoint him with my costliest perfume, but he has for me a yet sweeter fragrance" Sol 1:13-14.

These are the words of the church, relating what influence the presence of Christ, her Lord and King, had upon the exercise of her graces, while he was keeping the nuptial feast, on account of his marriage with her. He was anointed King of saints from eternity, before his incarnation, when he was rejoicing before God his Father, as if at a feast; and while he was thus distant, the faith, hope, desire, and expectation of the saints, were exercised on him, as their Lord and King, that was to come: when he did come, he came as a King, as was foretold of him, though his kingdom was not of this world; and while he was here, the Gospel of the kingdom of heaven was preached, and emitted a sweet savour in Judea: and when he went up to heaven, after his resurrection, he was declared Lord and Christ, and sat down at the right hand of God, "in his circuit" (f), or at his round table; alluding to such the ancients used, and great personages fed on, peculiar to themselves (g); being encircled by angels and glorified saints: and in the mean while, before his second coming as King, when he will appear as such in a more glorious manner, he sits down at his table, in the ordinance of the supper, feasting with, entertaining, and welcoming his church and people. When as follows, she says, <p>my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof: or "nard", of which there are many sorts; but that which grows in spikes is reckoned the best, and from thence is called "spikenard": it was a chief ingredient in ointments, as Pliny says (h); see <a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>; and was much used at festivals, to anoint guests with; and with which their head and hair being anointed, gave a fragrant smell, and therefore used to make them acceptable (i): in Syria, at royal banquets, as this here was, it was usual to go round the guests, to sprinkle them with Babylonian ointment (k). This may have respect to the grace of the Spirit in the church, comparable to the most excellent ointment; and which grace being in exercise in her, both before and after the incarnation of Christ, and since his ascension to heaven, and while he grants his presence in Gospel ordinances, is very delightful and acceptable to Christ; or this spikenard, according to some (l), may be meant of Christ himself, just as he is said to be "a bundle of myrrh" in Sol 1:13, and "a cluster of camphire", in Sol 1:14; and as ointments were used at feasts, and the church was at one with Christ, and as he was both master and feast, so he was the ointment of spikenard to her; and it is as if she should say, my beloved is at table with me; he is my food, and he is my spikenard (m) I need no other; he is instead of spikenard, myrrh, cypress, or any unguents made of these: his person is exceeding precious; his graces, of ointments, have a delightful savour in them; his sacrifice is of a sweet odour; his garments of righteousness and salvation smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; he is all in all. <p>(f) "in circuitu suo", Montanus, Piscator, Michaelis.

And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep.

Here it would mean a seat, in some public reception-room probably, in any case outside the hareem. The meaning seems here to be that so long as Solomon was absent from her, her <span class="ital">nard</span>, “a figure,” as Delitzsch says, “for the happiness of love,” gave forth its fragrance. She was then free to let her thoughts go out to her rustic lover.

My beloved is unto me as a bundle of myrrh, that lieth betwixt my breasts. My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna flowers in the vineyards of Engedi.</span> The preterite is best taken poetically for the present. The words are evidently a response to those of the king. As such they refer to present feeling and not to a past state. The bride expresses her delight in the king. The table is used generally. The Hebrew word is from a root "to sit round." The habit of reclining at table was introduced much later, during the Persian, Greek, and Roman period. The spikenard was a powerful perfume, probably of Indian origin, as the Indian word <span class="accented">nalada</span>, meaning "that which yields fragrance," shows. The Persian is <span class="accented">nard</span>, the Old Arabic <span class="accented">nardu</span>. It was made from an Indian plant, the <span class="accented">Valeriana</span>, called <span class="accented">Nardo-stachys</span> '<span class="accented">Gatamansi</span>, growing in Northern and Eastern India. The hairy part of the stem immediately above the root yields the perfume. That it was "very precious" we see from the account of Mary's offering, which was worth more than three hundred denarii, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> &pound;8 10s. (<a href="/mark/14-5.htm">Mark 14:5</a>; <a href="/john/12-2.htm">John 12:2</a>). Horace promised Virgil a whole cask, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> nine gallons, of the best wine in exchange for a small onyx box full of the perfume. The metaphor represents the intense longing of love. <span class="accented">Myrrh</span> was an exotic introduced into Palestine from Arabia, Abyssinia, and India. Like frankincense, it is one of the amyridae. The <span class="accented">Balsamodendron myrrha</span> is the tree itself with its leaves and flowers. From the tree came a resin or gum (<span class="accented">Gummi myrrhae</span>), which either dropped from the leaves or was artificially obtained by incisions in the bark. The natural product was the more valuable. It was much prized as a perfume, and employed for many purposes. The Hebrew women were accustomed to carry little bags or bottles of myrrh suspended from their necks and hanging down between the breasts under the dress, diffusing an attractive fragrance round them. The word <span class="accented">tseror</span> is, properly, "a little bag," <span class="accented">sacculus</span>, "that which one ties up," rather than a "bundle." The meaning, of course, is rhetorical - He is at my heart and delightful to all my thoughts as the fragrance to my senses. The henna flowers, or cypress, in the vineyards of Engedi, is a very beautiful figure. <span class="accented">Copher</span>, the cypress cluster, - in Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: in Arabic, <span class="accented">al-henna</span> (<span class="accented">Lawsonia</span>) - grows in Palestine and Egypt, as we are told by Pliny ('Nat. Hist.' 12:24). It is a tall shrub reaching to eight or ten feet, exceedingly beautiful in appearance, and giving forth a delightful odour. It is named from a root "to be white or yellow-white." The Moslem women stain their hands and feet with it to give them a yellow tint. Engedi was a lovely district  on the west of the Dead Sea - Hazezon Tamar, now <span class="accented">Ain Tidy</span>, where Solomon made terraces on the hillsides and covered them with gardens and vineyards. The allusion confirms the date of the writing as contemporary with Solomon, as the gardens would then be in their perfection. The figure is, perhaps, intended to be an advance in rhetorical force upon that which preceded - the fragrance diffused and almost overpowering, as of a blossoming tree. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Shulamith now explains, to those who were looking upon her with inquisitive wonder, how it is that she is swarthy:<p>6a Look not on me because I am black,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the sun has scorched me.<p>If the words were &#1489;&#1497; (&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;) &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, then the meaning would be: look not at me, stare not at me.

Besides, as the Scriptures ascribe twinkling to the morning dawn, so it ascribes eyes to the sun (<a href="/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11</a>), which is itself as the eye of the heavens.<p>(Note: According to the Indian idea, it is the eye of Varuna; the eye (also after Plato: &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;) is regarded as taken from the sun, and when men die returning to the sun (Muir in the Asiatic Journal, 1865, p. 294, S. 309).)<p>The poet delicately represents Shulamith as regarding the sun as fem. Its name in Arab. and old Germ. is fem., in Heb. and Aram. for the most part mas. My lady the sun, she, as it were, says, has produced on her this swarthiness.<p>She now says how it has happened that she is thus sunburnt:<p>6b My mother's sons were angry with me,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appointed me as keeper of the vineyards - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine own vineyard have I not kept.<p>If "mother's sons" is the parallel for "brothers" (&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;), then the expressions are of the same import, e.g., <a href="/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>; but if the two expressions stand in apposition, as <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-76.htm">Deuteronomy 13:76</a>, then the idea of the natural brother is sharpened; but when "mother's sons" stands thus by itself alone, then, after <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9</a>, it means the relationship by one of the parents alone, as "father's wife" in the language of the O.T. and also <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a> is the designation of a step-mother. Nowhere is mention made of Shulamith's father, but always, as here, only of her mother, Sol 3:4; Sol 8:2; Sol 6:9; and she is only named without being introduced as speaking. One is led to suppose that Shulamith's own father was dead, and that her mother had been married again; the sons by the second marriage were they who ruled in the house of their mother. These brothers of Shulamith appear towards the end of the melodrama as rigorous guardians of their youthful sister; one will thus have to suppose that their zeal for the spotless honour of their sister and the family proceeded from an endeavour to accustom the fickle or dreaming child to useful activity, but not without step-brotherly harshness. The form &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, Ewald, 193c, and Olsh. p. 593, derive from &#1495;&#1512;&#1512;, the Niph. of which is either &#1504;&#1495;&#1512; or &#1504;&#1495;&#1512; ( equals  &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1512;), Gesen. 68, An. 5; but the plur. of this &#1504;&#1495;&#1512; should, according to rule, have been &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. however, &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, profanantur, <a href="/ezekiel/7-24.htm">Ezekiel 7:24</a>); and what is more decisive, this &#1504;&#1495;&#1512; from &#1495;&#1512;&#1512; everywhere else expresses a different passion from that of anger; Bttch. 1060 (2, 379). &#1495;&#1512;&#1492; is used of the burning of anger; and that &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (from &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;  equals  &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;) can be another form for &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, is shown, e.g., by the interchange of &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;; the form &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, like &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>, resisted the bringing together of the &#1495; and the half guttural &#1512;. Ne&#780;he&#780;ra&#772; (here as <a href="/isaiah/41-11.htm">Isaiah 41:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>) means, according to the original, mid. signif. of the Niph., to burn inwardly, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  equals  &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. Shulamith's address consists intentionally of clauses with perfects placed together: she speaks with childlike artlessness, and not "like a book;" in the language of a book, &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; would have been used instead of &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;. But that she uses &#1504;&#1496;&#1512;&#1492; (from &#1504;&#1496;&#1512;, R. &#1496;&#1512;  equals  &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;; cf. Targ. <a href="/genesis/37-11.htm">Genesis 37:11</a> with <a href="/luke/2-51.htm">Luke 2:51</a>), and not &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;, as they were wont to say in Judea, after <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18</a>, and after the designation of the tower for the protection of the flocks by the name of "the tower of the no&#772;tsri&#772;m" the watchmen, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9</a>, shows that the maid is a Galilean, whose manner of speech is Aramaizing, and if we may so say, platt-Heb. ( equals  Low Heb.), like the Lower Saxon plattdeutsch. Of the three forms of the particip. &#1504;&#1496;&#1512;&#1492;, &#1504;&#1493;&#1496;&#1512;&#1492;, &#1504;&#1493;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514;, we here read the middle one, used subst. (Ewald, 188b), but retaining the long e&#772; (ground-form, na&#770;t&#803;ir). The plur. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1498;&#1468; does not necessarily imply that she had several vineyards to keep, it is the categ. plur. with the art. designating the genus; custodiens vineas is a keeper of a vineyard. But what kind of vineyard, or better, vine-garden, is that which she calls &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;, i.e., meam ipsius vineam? The personal possession is doubly expressed; she&#780;lli is related to ca&#780;rmi&#772; as a nearer defining apposition: my vineyard, that which belongs to me (vid., Fr. Philippi's Status constr. pp. 112-116). Without doubt the figure refers to herself given in charge to be cared for by herself: vine-gardens she had kept, but her own vine-garden, i.e., her own person, she had not kept. Does she indicate thereby that, in connection with Solomon, she has lost herself, with all that she is and has? Thus in 1851 I thought; but she certainly seeks to explain why she is so sunburnt. She intends in this figurative way to say, that as the keeper of a vineyard she neither could keep nor sought to keep her own person. In this connection ca&#780;armi&#772;, which by no means  equals  the colourless memet ipsam, is to be taken as the figure of the person in its external appearance, and that of its fresh-blooming attractive appearance which directly accords with &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, since from the stem-word &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; (Arab.), karuma, the idea of that which is noble and distinguished is connected with this designation of the planting of vines (for &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, Arab. karm, cf. karmat, of a single vine-stock, denotes not so much the soil in which the vines are planted, as rather the vines themselves): her ke&#780;re&#780;m is her (Arab.) karamat, i.e., her stately attractive appearance. If we must interpret this mystically then, supposing that Shulamith is the congregation of Israel moved at some future time with love to Christ, then by the step-brothers we think of the teachers, who after the death of the fathers threw around the congregation the fetters of their human ordinances, and converted fidelity to the law into a system of hireling service, in which all its beauty disappeared. Among the allegorists, Hengstenberg here presents the extreme of an interpretation opposed to what is true and fine. </body></html>
