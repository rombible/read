The mountain of myrrh appears to mean the mountain Moriah, on which the temple was built, where the incense was burned, and the people worshipped the Lord. This was his residence till the shadows of the law given to Moses were dispersed by the breaking of the gospel day, and the rising of the Sun of righteousness. And though, in respect of his human nature, Christ is absent from his church on earth, and will continue to be so till the heavenly day break, yet he is spiritually present in his ordinances, and with his people. How fair and comely are believers, when justified in Christ's righteousness, and adorned with spiritual graces! when their thoughts, words, and deeds, though imperfect, are pure, manifesting a heart nourished by the gospel!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Section <a href="//biblehub.com/songs/4-7.htm">Songs 4:7-5:1:</a> The king meeting the bride in the evening of the same day, expresses once more his love and admiration in the sweetest and tenderest terms and figures.

Being justified by the righteousness of Christ, washed in his blood, and sanctified by his Spirit; of the title, my "love", see Sol 1:9. The church is often said by Christ to be "fair", his "fair one", and the "fairest among women", Sol 1:8; but here "all fair", being a perfection of beauty, and perfectly comely through his comeliness: this is said to show her completeness in Christ, as to justification; and that, with respect to sanctification, she had a perfection of parts, though not of degrees; and to observe, that the church and "all" the true members of it were so, the meanest and weakest believer, as well as the greatest and strongest. It is added, <p>there is no spot in thee; not that the saints have no sin in them; nor any committed by them; nor that their sins are not sins; nor that they have no spots in them, with respect to sanctification, which is imperfect; but with respect to their justification, as having the righteousness of Christ imputed to them, and covered with that spotless robe, they are considered as having no spot in them; God sees no sin in them, so as to reckon it to them, and condemn them for it; and they stand unblamable and unreproveable in his sight; and will be presented by Christ, both to himself and to his father, and in the view of men and angels, "not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing", <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>, upon them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/songs/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art all fair, my love; and there is no spot in thee.</span> The bridegroom speaks. The sweet humility and modesty of the bride kindles his love afresh. He praised the loveliness of her bodily form, and she by her response showed the exceeding loveliness of her soul. It must not be forgotten that, whether borrowed from this book or not, such language is undoubtedly employed in Scripture of the Church, the bride, the Lamb's wife, who is described as "not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing" (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>). It should be noticed that the king immediately addresses his love as "bride," and "sister-bride," to show that there is more than admiration of her person in his thoughts. She is his by assimilation and by eternal union, and he invites her to enter fully into the new life which he has prepared for her, as in <a href="/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a>, "forgetting her own people, and her father's house." It is not enough that feeling should be stirred, or even that it should take possession of the soul, if it be only feeling; it is required of us that our inner life of emotion should become practical devotedness, "counting all things but loss" for the sake of him we love. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>1a Lo, thou art fair, my friend! yes, thou art fair!<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine eyes are doves behind thy veil.<p>The Gr. Venet. translates, after Kimchi, "looking out from behind, thy hair flowing down from thy head like a mane." Thus also Schultens, capillus plexus; and Hengst., who compares &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9</a>, and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3</a>, passages which do not accord with the case of Shulamith; but neither &#1510;&#1502;&#1501;, Arab. s&#803;mm, nor t&#803;mm signifies to plait; the latter is used of the hair when it is too abundant, and ready for the shears. To understand the hair as denoted here, is, moreover, inadmissible, inasmuch as &#1502;&#1489;&#1506;&#1491; cannot be used of the eyes in relation to the braids of hair hanging before them. Symm. rightly translates &#1510;&#1502;&#1492; by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; veil (in the Song the lxx erroneously renders by &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; behind thy silence), <a href="/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2</a>. The verb &#1510;&#1502;&#1501;, (Arab.) s&#803;mam, a stopper, and (Arab.) als&#803;amma, a plaid in which one veils himself, when he wraps it around him.<p>(Note: Regarding this verbal stem and its derivatives, see The's Schlafgemach der Phantasie, pp. 102-105.)<p>The veil is so called, as that which closely hides the face. In the Aram. &#1510;&#1502;&#1501;, Palp. &#1510;&#1502;&#1510;&#1501;, means directly to veil, as e.g., Bereshith rabba c. 45, extr., of a matron whom the king lets pass before him it is said, &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; &#1510;&#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1502;&#1492;. Shulamith is thus veiled. As the Roman bride wore the velum flammeum, so also the Jewish bride was deeply veiled; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24-65.htm">Genesis 24:65</a>, where Rebecca veiled herself (Lat. nubit) before her betrothed. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;, constr. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;, a segolate noun, which denotes separation, is a prep. in the sense of pone, as in Arab. in that of post. Ewald, sec. 217m, supposes, contrary to the Arab., the fundamental idea of covering (cogn. &#1489;&#1490;&#1491;); but that which surrounds is thought of as separating, and at the same time as covering, the thing which it encompasses. From behind her veil, which covered her face (vid., Bachmann, under <a href="/judges/3-23.htm">Judges 3:23</a>), her eyes gleam out, which, without needing to be supplemented by `&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, are compared, as to their colour, motion, and lustre, to a pair of doves.<p>From the eyes the praise passes to the hair.<p>1b Thy hair is like a flock of goats<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which repose downwards on Mount Gilead.<p>The hair of the bride's head was uncovered. We know from later times that she wore in it a wreath of myrtles and roses, or also a "golden city" (&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;), i.e., an ornament which emblematically represented Jerusalem. To see that this comparison is not incongruous, we must know that sheep in Syria and Palestine are for the most part white; but goats, for the most part, black, or at least dark coloured, as e.g., the brown gedi Mamri.<p>(Note: Burns, the Scottish poet, thinking that goats are white, transfers the comparison from the hair to the teeth:<p>"Her teeth are like a flock of sheep,<p>With fleeces newly washen clean,<p>That slowly mount the rising steep;<p>And she's twa glancin', sparklin' een.")<p>continued...</body></html>
