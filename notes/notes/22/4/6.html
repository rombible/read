The mountain of myrrh appears to mean the mountain Moriah, on which the temple was built, where the incense was burned, and the people worshipped the Lord. This was his residence till the shadows of the law given to Moses were dispersed by the breaking of the gospel day, and the rising of the Sun of righteousness. And though, in respect of his human nature, Christ is absent from his church on earth, and will continue to be so till the heavenly day break, yet he is spiritually present in his ordinances, and with his people.

Historically, the hill of frankincense is Calvary, where, "through the eternal Spirit He offered Himself"; the mountain of myrrh is His embalmment (Joh 19:39) till the resurrection "daybreak." The third Canticle occupies the one cloudless day of His presence on earth, beginning from the night (So 2:17) and ending with the night of His departure (So 4:6). His promise is almost exactly in the words of her prayer (So 2:17), (the same Holy Ghost breathing in Jesus Christ and His praying people), with the difference that she then looked for His visible coming. He now tells her that when He shall have gone from sight, He still is to be met with spiritually in prayer (Ps 68:16; Mt 28:20), until the everlasting day break, when we shall see face to face (1Co 13:10, 12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/songs/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Until the day break, and the shadows flee away:</span> these words are uttered by the bride, <span class="bld"><a href="/songs/2-17.htm" title="Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be you like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.">Song of Solomon 2:17</a></span>, and here returned by the Bridegroom, as an answer to that request. And this place may be understood either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of the day of the gospel, when all legal shadows shall vanish; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Of the day of glory, or of the general resurrection, when all manner of shadows and ordinances shall cease; till which time either the spouse feeds among lilies, as was now said, <span class="bld"><a href="/songs/2-5.htm" title="Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.">Song of Solomon 2:5</a></span>, or the Bridegroom <span class="ital">gets</span> him to the mountains, &c., as it follows.

To the temple at Jerusalem, which is oft and fitly expressed by the name of a mountain or hill, because it was built upon a mountain, and which may be called a mountain of myrrh and frankincense, because of the abundance of myrrh and frankincense which was there used and offered; in which place the church was to feed, and Christ would continue his presence, until the dawning of the gospel day. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. To my church upon earth, which was typified by the mountain of Moriah, and the temple upon it, and which in prophetical writings is called a mountain, as <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a>,3 Mic 4:1,2</span>, and elsewhere; and which may well be called <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">a mountain of myrrh and frankincense, </span> both for the acceptable services which are there offered to God, and for the precious gifts, and graces, and comforts of the Holy Spirit, which are of a sweet-smelling savour to God and men, and which there, and there only, are poured forth. Thus Christ directs his bride, to wit, particular believers, where they may find and enjoy him, namely, in his church and ordinances. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/songs/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Until the day break, and the shadows flee away,.... Until the day of grace breaks on every elect sinner, and the shadows of darkness, ignorance, and unbelief, are in a great measure fled and gone; or until the everlasting day breaks, and there will be no more night, nor any darkness of affliction, nor any more desertion, doubts, and fears; see Sol 2:17. They are the words of Christ, declaring whither he would go till that time came, as follows: <p>I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense: the allusion may be to the mountains and hills where these odoriferous plants grew. It is said of Pompey the great, that when he passed over Lebanon (later mentioned, Sol 4:8) and by Damascus, he went through sweet smelling groves and woods of frankincense and balsam (s); and Lebanon is thought, by some (t), to have its name from the frankincense that grew upon it; though rather from the whiteness of the snow continually on it. By this "mountain" and "hill" may be meant the church of Christ, gathered together in Gospel order, so called for its visibility and immovableness, <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; and for the trees of righteousness which are planted and flourish there, the saints; and for the fragrancy of their graces; and for the sweet smelling odour of their sacrifices of prayer and praise; and because of the delight and pleasure Christ takes in his people, and they in him here; where they have mutual communion, so that it is to them both a mountain of myrrh and a hill of frankincense: particularly, here Christ delights to be, and here he resolves to dwell until his second coming. <p>(s) Florus de Gest.

This seems much preferable to the interpretations which find in these words allegorical references to the person of the bride.

But no one could say that he was going on one afternoon to both Lebanon and Hermon, which is the highest peak of Anti-Libanus. The emendation would be feasible only if the whole complex of mountains were included in the name Lebanon.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</span> If this be the language of the bride, which most modern interpreters think, the meaning is to check the ardour of her lover, in the modesty of her fresh and maidenly feeling - Let me retire from such praises. They are too ardent for me. It is only a moment's interruption, which is followed by still more loving words from the bridegroom. We must naturally connect the words with <a href="/songs/2-17.htm">Song of Solomon 2:17</a>, where the bride certainly speaks. Louis de Leon thinks that the meaning is general, "shady and fragrant places." Anton (1773) suggests that she is desiring to escape and be free. It cannot be included as a description of the neighbourhood of the royal palace. She might, however, mean merely - Let me walk alone in the lovely gardens of the palace until the shades of night shall hide my blushes. It is unlikely that the words are in the mouth of Solomon; for then it would be impossible to explain their use by Shulamith previously. She is not referring to Lebanon and its neighbourhoed, and there can be no idea of looking back to a lover from whom she is torn. The interpretation which connects it with maidenly feeling is certainly the most in harmony with what has preceded. Perhaps the typical meaning is underlying the words - Let me find a place of devout meditation to feed my thoughts on the sweetness of this Divine love into which I have entered. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At the close of the scene, the call now goes forth to the daughters of Zion, i.e., the women of Jerusalem collectively, to behold the king, who now shows himself to the object of his love and to the jubilant crowd, as the festal procession approaches.<p>11 Come out, yet daughters of Zion, and see<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King Solomon with the crown<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With which his mother crowned him<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day of his espousal,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the day of the gladness of his heart.<p>The women of the court, as distinguished from the Galilean maiden, are called "daughters of Jerusalem;" here, generally, the women of Zion or Jerusalem (<a href="/lamentations/5-11.htm">Lamentations 5:11</a>) are called "daughters of Zion." Instead of &#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; (since the verb Lamed Aleph is treated after the manner of verbs Lamed He, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/50-20.htm">Jeremiah 50:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/23-49.htm">Ezekiel 23:49</a>), &#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, and that defect. &#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, <p>(Note: Without the Jod after Aleph in the older ed.

In the punctuation of the Aleph with Tsere or Segol the Codd. vary, according to the different views of the punctuation.

It is seen from the Sota (ix. 14) that the old custom for the bridegroom to wear a "crown" was abolished in consequence of the awful war with Vespasian. Rightly Epstein, against Grtz, shows from <a href="/job/31-36.htm">Job 31:36</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103-4.htm">Psalm 103:4</a>, that men also crowned themselves. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1496;&#1512;&#1492; (with the crown) is, according to the best authorities, without the art., and does not require it, since it is determined by the relat. clause following. &#1495;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492; is the marriage (the word also used in the post-bibl. Heb., and interchanging with &#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, properly &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;, <a href="/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>), from the verb &#1495;&#1514;&#1503;, which, proceeding from the root-idea of cutting into (Arab. khatn, to circumcise; R. &#1495;&#1514; .R ;, whence &#1495;&#1514;&#1498;, &#1495;&#1514;&#1501;, &#1495;&#1514;&#1512;), denotes the pressing into, or going into, another family; &#1495;&#1514;&#1503; is he who enters into such a relation of affinity, and &#1495;&#1496;&#1503; the father of her who is taken away, who also on his part is related to the husband.<p>(Note: L. Geiger (Ursprung der Sprache, 1869, p. 88) erroneously finds in R. &#1495;&#1514; (&#1495;&#1514;&#1501;, etc.) the meaning of binding. The (Arab.) noun Khatan means first a married man, and then any relation on the side of the wife (Lane); the fundamental idea must be the same as that of Khatn, circumcidere (cf. <a href="/exodus/4-25.htm">Exodus 4:25</a>), viz., that of penetrating, which &#1495;&#1514;&#1514;, percellere, and &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, descendere (cf. e.g., ferrum descendit haud alte in corpus, in Livy, and <a href="/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a>), also exhibit.)<p>Here also the seduction fable is shattered. The marriage with Shulamith takes place with the joyful consent of the queen-mother. In order to set aside this fatal circumstance, the "crown" is referred back to the time when Solomon was married to Pharaoh's daughter. Cogitandus est Salomo, says Heiligst., qui cum Sulamitha pompa sollemni Hierosolyma redit, eadem corona nuptiali ornatus, qua quum filiam regis Aegyptiorum uxorem duxeret ornatus erat. But was he then so poor or niggardly as to require to bring forth this old crown? and so basely regardless of his legitimate wife, of equal rank with himself, as to wound her by placing this crown on his head in honour of a rival? No; at the time when this youthful love-history occurred, Pharaoh's daughter was not yet married. The mention of his mother points us to the commencement of his reign. His head is not adorned with a crown which had already been worn, but with a fresh garland which his mother wreathed around the head of her youthful son. The men have already welcomed the procession from afar; but the king in his wedding attire has special attractions for the women - they are here called upon to observe the moment when the happy pair welcome one another. </body></html>
