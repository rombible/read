It is, 1. A precept; so this is Christ's call to his church to come off from the world. These hills seem pleasant, but there are in them lions' dens; they are mountains of the leopards. 2. As a promise; many shall be brought as members of the church, from every point. The church shall be delivered from her persecutors in due time, though now she dwells among lions, Ps 57:4. Christ's heart is upon his church; his treasure is therein; and he delights in the affection she has for him; its working in the heart, and its works in the life. The odours wherewith the spouse is perfumed, are as the gifts and graces of the Spirit. Love and obedience to God are more pleasing to Christ than sacrifice or incense. Christ having put upon his spouse the white raiment of his own righteousness, and the righteousness of saints, and perfumed it with holy joy and comfort, he is well pleased with it. And Christ walks in his garden unseen. A hedge of protection is made around, which all the powers of darkness cannot break through. The souls of believers are as gardens enclosed, where is a well of living water, Joh 4:14; 7:38, the influences of the Holy Spirit. The world knows not these wells of salvation, nor can any opposer corrupt this fountain. Saints in the church, and graces in the saints, are fitly compared to fruits and spices. They are planted, and do not grow of themselves. They are precious; they are the blessings of this earth. They will be kept to good purpose when flowers are withered. Grace, when ended in glory, will last for ever. Christ is the source which makes these gardens fruitful; even a well of living waters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The similes employed refer to the graces of adornment, speech, and gesture, as expressions of inward character and sentiment.<p><a href="/songs/4-9.htm">Songs 4:9</a><p>With one of thine eyes - Rather, with one look of thine.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/songs/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. love&#8212;Hebrew, "loves"; manifold tokens of thy love.<p>much better&#8212;answering to her "better" (So 1:2), but with increased force.

The allusion to the lips may be a mere amplification of the word "love," but it may also refer to speech, and we think of the nineteenth psalm and the description of the words and testimony of the Lord, "more to be desired than gold, and sweeter than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb" (cf. <a href="/genesis/27-27.htm">Genesis 27:27</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-7.htm">Hosea 4:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>).

In <a href="/nehemiah/3-25.htm">Nehemiah 3:25</a>. it is called the "tower which lieth out from the king's high house," i.e., not the palace, but a government house built on Zion, which served as a court of justice. But what is the meaning of the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;? Grtz translates: for a prospect; but the Greek &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, of which he regards &#1514;&#1500; as the Heb. abstr., is a word so rare that its introduction into the Semitic language is on that account improbable. Hengst. translates: built for hanging swords; and he sees in the word a compound of &#1514;&#1468;&#1500; (from &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, with which forms such as &#1497;&#1491;  equals  jadj, &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;  equals  shadj, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-7.htm">2 Samuel 6:7</a>, are compared) and &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;; but this latter word signifies, not swords, but edges of the (double-edged) sword; wherefore Kimchi (interpreting &#1514;&#1468;&#1500; as the constr. of &#1514;&#1500;, as &#1488;&#1500;, in &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1488;&#1500;, is of &#1510;&#1500;) explains: an erection of sharp-cornered stones; and, moreover, the Heb. language knows no such nmm. comp. appellativa: the names of the frog, &#1510;&#1508;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1506;, and the bat, &#1506;&#1496;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507; (cf. the Beth in [Arab.] sa'lab, fox, with the added Pe), are not such; and also tsalma&#772;veth, the shadow of death, is at a later period, for the first time, restamped <p>(Note: Cf. regarding such double words belonging to the more modern Semitic language, Jesurun, pp. 232-236.)<p>as such from the original tsalmuth (cf. Arab. zalumat  equals  tenebrae). Gesen. obtains the same meanings; for he explains &#1500;&#1514;&#1500; by exitialibus (sc.,, armis), from an adj. &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1507;  equals  Arab. talifa, to perish, the inf. of which, talaf, is at the present day a word synon. with halak (to perish); (Arab.) matlaf (place of going down) is, like &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, a poetic name of the wilderness. The explanation is acceptable but hazardous, since neither the Heb. nor the Aram. shows a trace of this verb; and it is thus to be given up, if &#1514;&#1500;&#1507; can be referred to a verbal stem to be found in the Heb. and Aram. This is done in Ewald's explanation, to which also Bttcher and Rdig. give the preference: built for close (crowded) troops (so, viz., that many hundreds or thousands find room therein); the (Arab.) verb aff, to wrap together (opp. nashar, to unfold), is used of the packing together of multitudes of troops (liff, plur. lufuf), and also of warlike hand-to-hand conflicts; &#1514;&#1500;&#1507; would be traced to a verb &#1500;&#1508;&#1492; synon. therewith, after the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;. But if &#1514;&#1500;&#1507; were meant of troops, then they would be denoted as the garrison found therein, and it would not be merely said that the tower was built for such; for the point of comparison would then be, the imposing look of the neck, overpowering by the force of the impression proceeding from within. But now, in the Aram., and relatively in the Talm. Heb., not only &#1500;&#1508;&#1507; and &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; occur, but also &#1500;&#1508;&#1497; (Af. &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;), and that in the sense of enclosure, i.e., of joining together, the one working into the other, - e.g., in the Targ.: of the curtain of the tabernacle (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497;, place of the joining together  equals  &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514; or &#1502;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; of the Heb. text); and in the Talm.: of the roofs of two houses (Bathra 6a, &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, the joining)<p>(Note: The Arab. lafa, vi., proceeding from the same root-idea, signifies to bring in something again, to bring in again, to seek to make good again.).<p>Accordingly &#1500;&#1514;&#1500;&#1507;, if we interpret the Lamed not of the definition, but of the norm, may signify, "in ranks together." The Lamed has already been thus rendered by Dderl.: "in turns" (cf. &#1500;&#1508;&#1514;, to turn, to wind); and by Meier, Mr.: "in gradation;" and Aq. and Jerome also suppose that &#1514;&#1500;&#1507; refers to component parts of the building itself, for they understand <p>(Note: Vid., also Lagarde's Onomastica, p. 202: &#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3b8; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3be;&#x3b7; (read &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;) &#x3b7;&#787;&#769; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;.)<p>pinnacles or parapets (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, propugnacula); as also the Venet.: &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;. But the name for pinnacles is &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, and their points, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;; while, on the contrary, &#1514;&#1500;&#1507; is the more appropriate name for terraces which, connected together, rise the one above the other. Thus to build towers like terraces, and to place the one, as it were, above the other, was a Babylonian custom.<p>(Note: Vid., Oppert's Grundzge der Assyr. Kunst (1872), p. 11.)<p>The comparison lies in this, that Shulamith's neck was surrounded with ornaments so that it did not appear as a uniform whole, but as composed of terraces. That the neck is represented as hung round with ornaments, the remaining portion of the description shows.<p>&#1502;&#1490;&#1503; signifies a shield, as that which protects, like clupeus (clypeus), perhaps connected with &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;  equals  (Arab.) shalita, as a hard impenetrable armour. The latter is here the more common word, which comprehends, with &#1502;&#1490;&#1503;, the round shield; also &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, the oval shield, which covers the whole body; and other forms of shields. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1503; &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, "the thousand shields," has the indicative, if not (vid., under Sol 1:11) the generic article. The appositional &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468; is not intended to mean: all shields of (von) heroes, which it would if the article were prefixed to col and omitted before gibborim, or if &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, Sol 3:8, were used; but it means: all the shields of heroes, as the accentuation also indicates. The article is also here significant. Solomon made, according to <a href="/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16</a>., 200 golden targets and 300 golden shields, which he put in the house of the forest of Lebanon. These golden shields Pharaoh Shishak took away with him, and Rehoboam replaced them by "shields of brass," which the guards bore when they accompanied the king on his going into the temple (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26-28</a>; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-9.htm">2 Chronicles 12:9-11</a>); these "shields of David," i.e., shields belonging to the king's house, were given to the captains of the guard on the occasion of the raising of Joash to the throne, <a href="/2_kings/11-10.htm">2 Kings 11:10</a>; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/23-9.htm">2 Chronicles 23:9</a>. Of these brazen shields, as well as of those of gold, it is expressly said how and where they were kept, nowhere that they were hung up outside on a tower, the tower of David. Such a display of the golden shields is also very improbable. We will perhaps have to suppose that 4b describes the tower of David, not as it actually was, but as one has to represent it to himself, that it might be a figure of Shulamith's neck. This is compared to the terraced tower of David, if one thinks of it as hung round by a thousand shields which the heroes bore, those heroes, namely, who formed the king's body-guard. Thus it is not strange that to the 200 + 300 golden shields are here added yet 500 more; the body-guard, reckoned in companies of 100 each, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>, is estimated as consisting of 1000 men. The description, moreover, corresponds with ancient custom. The words are &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;; the outer wall of the tower is thought of as decorated with shields hung upon it. That shields were thus hung round on tower-walls, Ezekiel shows in his prophecy regarding Tyre, <a href="/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>; cf. 1 Macc. 4:57, and supra foris Capitolinae aedis, Pliny, Hist. Nat. xxxv. 3; and although we express the presumption that Solomon's imagination represented David's tower as more gorgeous than it actually was, yet we must confess that we are not sufficiently acquainted with Solomon's buildings to be able to pass judgment on this. These manifold inexplicable references of the Song to the unfolded splendour of Solomon's reign, are favourable to the Solomonic authorship of the book. This grandiose picture of the distinguished beauty of the neck, and the heightening of this beauty by the ornament of chains, is now followed by a beautiful figure, which again goes back to the use of the language of shepherds, and terminates the description:  </body></html>
