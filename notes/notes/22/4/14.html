It is, 1. A precept; so this is Christ's call to his church to come off from the world. These hills seem pleasant, but there are in them lions' dens; they are mountains of the leopards. 2. As a promise; many shall be brought as members of the church, from every point. The church shall be delivered from her persecutors in due time, though now she dwells among lions, Ps 57:4. Christ's heart is upon his church; his treasure is therein; and he delights in the affection she has for him; its working in the heart, and its works in the life. The odours wherewith the spouse is perfumed, are as the gifts and graces of the Spirit. Love and obedience to God are more pleasing to Christ than sacrifice or incense. Christ having put upon his spouse the white raiment of his own righteousness, and the righteousness of saints, and perfumed it with holy joy and comfort, he is well pleased with it. And Christ walks in his garden unseen. A hedge of protection is made around, which all the powers of darkness cannot break through. The souls of believers are as gardens enclosed, where is a well of living water, Joh 4:14; 7:38, the influences of the Holy Spirit. The world knows not these wells of salvation, nor can any opposer corrupt this fountain. Saints in the church, and graces in the saints, are fitly compared to fruits and spices. They are planted, and do not grow of themselves. They are precious; they are the blessings of this earth. They will be kept to good purpose when flowers are withered. Grace, when ended in glory, will last for ever. Christ is the source which makes these gardens fruitful; even a well of living waters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Orchard - This is the renderlng here and in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5</a> of "pardes" (see <a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a> note).

The picture here is best regarded as a purely ideal one, having no corresponding reality but in the bride herself.

The former is the best sort of nard, and therefore mentioned and repeated, to which saints may be compared, because of the graces of the Spirit in them; which, when exercised, give a sweet odour, and are exceeding grateful to Christ; see Sol 1:12; and the latter, according to Schindler (s), seems to have been read "carcos", the same with "crocus", and is a plant well known by us for its cheering nature; and has its name from the Arabic, "zaffran", because of its yellow or golden colour; but "crocus", from "Corycus" (t), a mountain in Cilicia, where it grew; it is properly joined with spikenard, since itself is a "spica", and is sometimes called "spica Cilissa" (u). Next follow <p>calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; "calamus" is the sweet cane in <a href="/isaiah/43-24.htm">Isaiah 43:24</a>; "cinnamon" is the rind or bark of a tree; both grow in India (w) and in Arabia (x); as also trees of "frankincense", which are only in Arabia; hence one of the Arabias is called "thurifera" (y), for they do not grow in all Arabia: the two first were ingredients in the holy anointing oil, and the latter in the holy perfume, <a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>; <p>myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices; Solomon's gardens might be furnished with all these; and with the above trees, plants, and spices, from Arabia Felix, where, as Appianus (z) says, "cassia" grew in marshy places; myrrh and frankincense were gathered from trees, cinnamon from shrubs, and their meadows naturally produced nard; hence called "aromatifera", the spicy country (a): myrrh was also an ingredient in the anointing oil; and aloes, according to the Targum, is the same with lign aloes; see <a href="/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>; not the herb which has a very bitter juice, but the tree of a sweet odour, which Isidore (b) distinguishes, and is what is meant in <a href="/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>; and were both of a very fragrant smell. Now all these trees, plants, and spices, signify truly precious souls, possessed of the graces of the Spirit; comparable to them for their valuableness and excellency, their sweet smell, and the reviving and refreshing nature of them; which make the subjects of these graces very agreeable to Christ, and to one another.

It is notable that all the trees of this ‘paradise’ are rare exotics, probably to hint that the bride’s charms are as rare and as much to be admired as such plants are. But the rare and foreign character of all the objects to which the bride is compared is entirely incompatible with the supposition that our book is a collection of popular songs (<span class="ital">Volkslieder</span>). In them the comparisons are always with homely well-known objects.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>8 With me from Lebanon, my bride,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With me from Lebanon shalt thou come;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Shalt look from the top of Amana,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; From the top of Shenir and Hermon,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; From dens of lions,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; From mountains of leopards.<p>Zckl. interprets &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in the sense of &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; in the sense of journeying to this definite place: "he announces to her in overflowing fulness of expression that from this time forth, instead of the lonely mountainous regions, and the dangerous caves and dens, she shall inhabit with him the royal palace." Thus also Kingsbury. But the interpretation, however plausible, cannot be supported. For (1) such an idea ought to be expressed either by &#1514;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; or by &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1489;, instead of &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;; (2) Shulamith is not from Lebanon, nor from the Anti-Libanus, which looks toward Damascus; (3) this would be no answer to Shulamith's longing for lonely quietness. We therefore hold by our explanation given in 1851. He seeks her to go with him up the steep heights of Lebanon, and to descend with him from thence; for while ascending the mountain one has no view before him, but when descending he has the whole panorama of the surrounding region lying at his feet. Thus &#1514;&#1513;&#1473; is not to be understood as at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-9.htm">Isaiah 57:9</a>, where it has the meaning of migrabas, but, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/23-9.htm">Numbers 23:9</a>, it means spectabis. With &#1502;&#1512; the idea of prospect lies nearer than that of descending; besides, the meaning spectare is secondary, for &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; signifies first "to go, proceed, journey," and then "going to view, to go in order to view." Se&#770;r in Arab. means "the scene," and se&#770;r etmek in Turkish, "to contemplate" (cf. Arab. tamashy, to walk, then, to contemplate). Lebanon is the name of the Alpine range which lies in the N.-W. of the Holy Land, and stretches above 20 (German) miles from the Leontes (Nahr el-Kasme) northwards to the Eleutheros (Nahr el-Kebr). The other three names here found refer to the Anti-Libanus separated from the Lebanon by the Coelo-Syrian valley, and stretching from the Banis northwards to the plain of Hamth.<p>Amana denotes that range of the Anti-Libanus from which the springs of the river Amana issue, one of the two rivers which the Syrian captain (<a href="/2_kings/5-12.htm">2 Kings 5:12</a>) named as better than all the waters of Israel. These are the Amana and Pharpar, i.e., the Barad and A'wadsh; to the union of the Barad (called by the Greeks Chrysorrhoas, i.e., "golden stream") with the Feidshe, the environs of Damascus owe their ghuwdat, their paradisaical beauty. <p>Hermon (from &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;, to cut of; cf. Arab. kharom and makhrim, the steep projection of a mountain) is the most southern peak of the Anti-Libanus chain, the lofty mountains (about 10, 000 feet above the level of the sea) which form the north-eastern border of Palestine, and from which the springs of the Jordan take their rise.<p>Another section of the Anti-Libanus range is called Senir, not Shenir. The name, in all the three places where it occurs (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23</a>), is, in accordance with tradition, to be written with Sin. The Onkelos Targum writes &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;; the Jerusalem paraphrases, &#1496;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; &#1491;&#1502;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497; &#1508;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1497; (the mountain whose fruits become putrid, viz., on account of their superabundance); the Midrash explains otherwise: &#1513;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1513;&#1493;&#1489;&#1488; &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1512; (the mountain which resists being broken up by the plough), - everywhere the writing of the word with the letter Sin is supposed. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>, this was the Amorite name of Hermon. The expression then denotes that the Amorites called Hermon - i.e., the Anti-Libanus range, for they gave the name of a part to the whole range - by the name Senr; Abulfeda uses Arab. sni&#770;r as the name of the part to the north of Damascus, with which the statement of Schwarz (Das h. Land, p. 33) agrees, that the Hermon (Anti-Libanus) to the north-west of Damascus is called Senr.<p>&#1504;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, panthers, to the present day inhabit the clefts and defiles of the Lebanon, and of the Anti-Libanus running parallel to it; whereas lions have now altogether disappeared from the countries of the Mediterranean. In Solomon's time they were to be met with in the lurking-places of the Jordan valley, and yet more frequently in the remote districts of the northern Alpine chains. From the heights of these Alps Solomon says Shulamith shall alone with him look down from where the lions and panthers dwell. Near these beasts of prey, and yet inaccessible by them, shall she enjoy the prospect of the extensive pleasant land which was subject to the sceptre of him who held her safe on these cliffs, and accompanied her over these giddy heights. If "mountain of myrrh," so also "the top of Amana" is not without subordinate reference. Amana, proceeding from the primary idea of firmness and verification, signifies fidelity and the faithful covenant as it is established between God and the congregation, for He betrothes it to Himself b'mwnh ("in faithfulness"), <a href="/hosea/2-22.htm">Hosea 2:22</a> [20]; the congregation of which the apostle (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>) says the same as is here said by Solomon of Shulamith. Here for the first time he calls her &#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, not &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;; for that, according to the usus loq., would mean "my daughter-in-law." Accordingly, it appears that the idea of "daughter-in-law" is the primary, and that of "bride" the secondary one. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, which is  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, as &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, a cake, is  equals  &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, that which is pierced through (cf. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, being espoused; <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>), appears to mean <p>(Note: L. Geiger's Ursprung d.

Arab. qkll, to be garlanded; te&#772;kli&#770;l, garlanding; iklil, Syr. kelilo, a wreath), or her who is brought to completion (cf. the verb, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-4.htm">Ezekiel 27:4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>), i.e., has reached the goal of her womanly calling. Besides, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, like "Braut" in the older German (e.g., Gudrun), means not only her who is betrothed, but also her who has been lately married. </body></html>
