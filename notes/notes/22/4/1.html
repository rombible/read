This was his residence till the shadows of the law given to Moses were dispersed by the breaking of the gospel day, and the rising of the Sun of righteousness. And though, in respect of his human nature, Christ is absent from his church on earth, and will continue to be so till the heavenly day break, yet he is spiritually present in his ordinances, and with his people.

Contrast with the bride's state by nature (Isa 1:6) her state by grace (So 4:1-7), "perfect through His comeliness put upon her" (Eze 16:14; Joh 15:3). The praise of Jesus Christ, unlike that of the world, hurts not, but edifies; as His, not ours, is the glory (Joh 5:44; Re 4:10, 11). Seven features of beauty are specified (So 4:1-5) ("lips" and "speech" are but one feature, So 4:3), the number for perfection. To each of these is attached a comparison from nature: the resemblances consist not so much in outward likeness, as in the combined sensations of delight produced by contemplating these natural objects.<p>doves'&#8212;the large melting eye of the Syrian dove appears especially beautiful amid the foliage of its native groves: so the bride's "eyes within her locks" (Lu 7:44). Maurer for "locks," has "veil"; but locks suit the connection better: so the Hebrew is translated (Isa 47:2). The dove was the only bird counted "clean" for sacrifice. Once the heart was "the cage of every unclean and hateful bird." Grace makes the change.<p>eyes&#8212;(Mt 6:22; Eph 1:18; contrast Mt 5:28; Eph 4:18; 1Jo 2:16). Chaste and guileless ("harmless," Mt 10:16, Margin; Joh 1:47). John the Baptist, historically, was the "turtledove" (So 2:12), with eye directed to the coming Bridegroom: his Nazarite unshorn hair answers to "locks" (Joh 1:29, 36).<p>hair &#8230; goats&#8212;The hair of goats in the East is fine like silk. As long hair is her glory, and marks her subjection to man (1Co 11:6-15), so the Nazarite's hair marked his subjection and separation unto God. (Compare Jud 16:17, with 2Co 6:17; Tit 2:14; 1Pe 2:9).

Yet because the church is a body, consisting of divers members, and enriched with variety of gifts and graces, I know no reason but the several parts of this description may have a more special regard to one or other of them.

The same as in Sol 1:15; here repeated by Christ, to introduce the following commendation; to express the greatness of his love to his church; and show that he had the same opinion of her, and esteem for her, notwithstanding what had passed between that time and this; <p>thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks; the same comparison; see Gill on Sol 1:15; only with this difference, here her eyes are said to be "within her locks": which, whether understood of the ministers of the Gospel; or of the eyes of the understanding, particularly of, the eye of faith, as has been observed on the above place; do not seem so much to design the imperfection of the sight of the one or of the other, in the present state, as eyes within or under locks and in some measure covered with them, hinder the sight of them; as the modesty of either of them; locks being decently tied up, as the word signifies (i), is a sign thereof, as the contrary is a sign of boldness and wantonness. Doves' eyes themselves are expressive of modesty and humility, and, this phrase added to them, increases the idea; such ministers, who have the largest gifts, greatest grace, light, and knowledge, are the most humble, witness the Apostle Paul; and this phrase expresses the beauty of them, not only in the eyes of Christ, but in the eyes of those to whom they publish the good tidings of salvation: and so it may denote what an exceeding modest grace faith is, which receives all from Christ, and gives him all the glory, and takes none to itself; and what a beauty there is in it, insomuch that Christ is ravished with it, Sol 4:9; and seems rather to be the sense here; <p>thy hair is as a flock of goats; like the hair of goats, so Ben Melech. Hair adds much to the comeliness of persons, and is therefore frequently mentioned, both with respect to the bride and bridegroom, in this song, Sol 5:1; and so in all poems of this kind (k); and one part of the comeliness of women lies in their hair; <p>"let a woman, says Apuleius (l), be adorned with ever such fine garments, and decked with gold and jewels, yet, without this ornament, she will not be pleasing; no, not Verus herself.'' <p>The women (m) in Homer, are described by their beautiful hair; nor is it unusual to compare the hair of women, and represent it as superior to a fleece of the choicest flock (n). And here the church's hair is said to be like the hair of goats, for that is the sense of the expression; and which is thought to be most like to human hair, <a href="/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>; and it is compared to that, not so much for its length and sleekness, as for its colour, being yellowish; which, with women formerly, was in esteem, and reckoned graceful (o); this being the colour of the hair of some of the greatest beauties, as Helena, Philoxena, and others, whose hair was flaxen and yellow; hence great care was taken to make it look so, even as yellow as gold (p): the Jewish women used to have their perukes, or false hair, of goats' hair, and still have in some places to this day (q); and it should seem the Roman women also had, to which the poet (r) refers. And the church's hair here is said to be like the hair of a flock of goats, <p>that appear from Mount Gilead; or rather "on Mount Gilead", as Noldius: Gilead was a mountain in the land of Israel, beyond Jordan, famous for pasturage for cattle, where flocks of goats were fed, as was usual on mountains (s); and, being well fed, their hair was long, smooth, neat, and glistering; and so to spectators, at a distance, looked very beautiful and lovely; especially in the morning at sun rising, and, glancing on them with its bright and glittering rays, were delightful. So R. Jonah, from the use of the word in the Arabic language, which signifies the morning, interprets it, which "rise early in the morning"; and which, as Schultens (t) observes, some render, <p>"leading to water early in the morning;'' <p>the Vulgate Latin version is, "that ascend from Mount Gilead", from a lower to a higher part of it; which is approved of by Bochart (u). Now the hair of the church may be interpreted either of believers, the several members of the church of Christ; the hairs of the head are numerous, grow upon the head, and have their nourishment from it; are weak in themselves, but depend upon the head, and are an ornament to it: so the saints, though few in comparison of the world, yet by themselves are a great number, which no man can number; these grow upon Christ, the Head of the church, and receive their nourishment from him; and, though weak in themselves, have strength from him, and have their dependence on him; and are an ornament and crown of glory to him; and who are cared for and numbered by him, so that no one can be lost; see <a href="/ezekiel/5-1.htm">Ezekiel 5:1</a>. Or rather it may be interpreted of the outward conversation of the saints; hair is visible, is a covering, and an ornament, when taken care of, and managed aright, and has its dependence and is influenced by the head: the good conversation of the church and its members is visible to all, as the hair of the head, and as a flock of goats on Mount Gilead; and is a covering, though not from divine justice, yet from the reproaches of men; is ornamental to believers, and to the doctrine they profess; especially when their conversation is ordered aright, according to the weird of God, and is influenced by grace, communicated from Christ, the Head. <p>(i) "intra ligamina tua", some in Vatablus; "vittam suam", Cocceius; "constrictam comam tuam", Michaelis, so Jarchi.

The translation <span class="ital">locks</span> is that of the Jewish commentators, Kimchi and Rashi. The <span class="ital">burqu‘</span> or face-veil of a lady is thus described in Lane’s <span class="ital">Modern Egyptians</span>, vol. 1. p. 57. It is a long strip of white muslin, concealing the whole of the face except the eyes, and reaching nearly to the feet. It is suspended at the top by a narrow band, which passes up the forehead, and which is sewed, as are also the two upper corners of the veil, to a band which is tied round the head. Lane remarks that though worn for the purpose of disguising whatever is attractive in the wearer, it fails in accomplishing its main purpose, displaying the eyes, which are almost always beautiful, making them to appear still more so by concealing the other features which are seldom of equal beauty. But as it was not the custom that Hebrew women should be secluded, as is now the custom in Syria, the veil must have been used as part of full dress. This would account for its being worn in the house as it appears to be here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thy hair is as a flock of goats</span>] i.e. each braid in its glossy blackness is like a separate goat of the herd. The usual colour of goats was black.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that appear from mount Gilead</span>] Literally, <span class="ital">that recline from mount Gilead</span>. The picture the words suggest is that of a herd of goats reclining on the slopes of mount Gilead, and raising their heads when disturbed. This gives a picture of rows of goats reclining on an undulating slope, and this latter is the point of comparison. For, if the Heb. <span class="ital">gâleshû</span> is connected with the Arabic <span class="ital">galasa</span>, as seems likely, it means ‘to sit up after lying down.’ It may be doubted however whether so much can be legitimately put by pregnant construction into the <span class="ital">from</span>. Budde connects the word with the movement of the herds, and refers to the late Heb. <span class="ital">gâlash</span>, which means ‘to boil up,’ and is used of water. Levy also, <span class="ital">sub voce</span>, translates this passage, “which go by in waves”; F. Delitzsch’s “swarm forth from,” quoted in the <span class="ital">Variorum Bible</span>, is practically the same. Budde says mount Gilead is the S. portion of the range called now the <span class="ital">Belqa</span>, which is mostly pasture land. It lies within view of Judah and Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Chap. <a href="/context/songs/4-1.htm" title="Behold, you are fair, my love; behold, you are fair; you have doves' eyes within your locks: your hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead....">Song of Solomon 4:1-7</a>. The Royal Suitor<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>King Solomon is here the speaker, and in these verses he presses his suit anew by praise of the Shulammite’s beauty. The whole song is evidently modelled, as several of the succeeding songs are, on the <span class="ital">wasf</span> or description of the bride, which is so prominent a thing at marriage festivals in Syria to this day. To have established this is Wetzstein’s great merit, for until his <span class="ital">Essay on the Threshing-Board</span> appeared these descriptions were to a large extent inexplicable. But the discovery that the <span class="ital">wasf</span> is an ancient form of song connected by prescription with love and marriage explains its appearance here. In a series of love-songs disposed so as to give scenes of a connected narrative, it was natural and almost inevitable that the <span class="ital">wasf</span> should be imitated. It has been noticed by many that the spontaneity and originality of the other poems disappear in these descriptions. This is due to their being written according to a stereotyped form. That the <span class="ital">wasf</span> was imitated when no regular marriage <span class="ital">wasf</span> was intended, but only a love-song, is proved by the fact that in one of the <span class="ital">Mu‘allaqât</span>, the seven poems said to have been hung in the Caaba at Mekka in pre-Islamic times, that viz. of Amru ibn Kulthum, in <a href="/context/songs/4-13.htm" title="Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,...">Song of Solomon 4:13-16</a> inclusive, there is a description of a woman much in the tone of this.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil; thine hair is as a flock of goats, that lie along the side of Mount Gilead.</span> We commence, at this verse, the loving converse of the bridegroom with the bride, which we must suppose is heard as they travel together in the bridal procession. The words of adoring affection are chiefly spoken by the bridegroom, as is natural in the circumstances, and the reference to the journey, and its consummation in ver. 8, make it certain that the intention is to carry us in thought to the palanquin and the breathings of first love in bridal joy. The poetry is exquisite and truly Eastern, while yet absolutely chaste and pure. The praise of the eyes is common in all erotic poetry. Her eyes gleam, in colour, motion, and lustre, like a pair of doves from behind the veil; showing that the bride is thought of as travelling. The bride was always deeply veiled (see <a href="/genesis/24-65.htm">Genesis 24:65</a>), as the Roman bride wore the <span class="accented">velum flamineum</span>. The LXX. have mistaken the meaning, rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>. The veil might typify silence or reserve, but the word is <span class="accented">tsammah</span>, which is from a root "to veil," and is righty rendered by Symmachus <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. The hair was long and dark, and lay down the shoulders uncovered and free, which added much to the graceful attraction of the bride. In later times it was customary for the hair to be adorned with a wreath of myrtle or roses, or a golden ornament representing Jerusalem. The goats in Syria and the neighbouring countries are mostly black or dark brown, while the sheep are white. Delitzsch says, "A flock of goats encamped upon a mountain (rising up, to one looking from a distance, as in a steep slope and almost perpendicularly), and as if hanging down lengthwise on its sides, presents a lovely view adorning the landscape." It would be especially lovely amid the romantic scenery of Gilead. The, verb rendered "lie along" is otherwise taken by the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, and by the Vulgate <span class="accented">ascenderunt.</span> The rabbis differ from one another in their renderings. One says, "which, look, down;" another, "make bare," "quit," or "descend;" another, "are seen." The modern translators vary. Luther says, "shorn;" Houbigant, "hang down;" Kleuken and Ewald, "shows itself;" Gesenius and others, "lie down;" Ginsburg, "rolling down," "running down." Our Revised Version gives, <span class="accented">lie along</span>, which is a very probable meaning. The reference is to the luxuriance and rich colour of the hair. Gilead would be a recollection of the bride's native place. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>6 Who is this coming up from the wilderness<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Like pillars of smoke,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With all aromatics of the merchants? <p>It is possible that &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; may be connected; but &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; &#1494;&#1492;, <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a> (this poor man, properly, this, a poor man), is not analogous, it ought to be &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1494;&#1488;&#1514;. Thus zoth will either be closely connected with &#1502;&#1497;, and make the question sharper and more animated, as is that in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12-18.htm">Genesis 12:18</a>, or it will be the subject which then, as in <a href="/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-2.htm">Job 38:2</a>, cf. below Sol 7:5, <a href="//biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>, is more closely written with indeterminate participles, according to which it is rightly accented. But we do not translate with Heiligst. quid est hoc quod adscendit, for mi&#772; asks after a person, ma&#772; after a thing, and only per attract. does mi&#772; stand for ma&#772; in <a href="/genesis/33-8.htm">Genesis 33:8</a>; <a href="/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17</a>; <a href="/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>; also not quis est hoc (Vaih.), for zoth after mi has a personal sense, thus: quis (quaenam) haec est. That it is a woman that is being brought forward those who ask know, even if she is yet too far off to be seen by them, because they recognise in the festal gorgeous procession a marriage party. That the company comes up from the wilderness, it may be through the wilderness which separates Jerusalem from Jericho, is in accordance with the fact that a maiden from Galilee is being brought up, and that the procession has taken the way through the Jordan valley (Ghr); but the scene has also a typical colouring; for the wilderness is, since the time of the Mosaic deliverance out of Egypt, an emblem of the transition from a state of bondage to freedom, from humiliation to glory (vid., under <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-11.htm">Hosea 1:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>). The pomp is like that of a procession before which the censer of frankincense is swung. Columns of smoke from the burning incense mark the line of the procession before and after. &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; (&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;) here and at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3.htm">Job 3</a> (vid., Norzi) is formed, as it appears, from &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;, to strive upwards, a kindred form to &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;; cf. <a href="/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>; the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;, whence the date-palm receives the name &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;, is a secondary formation, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; to &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;. Certainly this form &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; (cf. on the contrary, &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;&#1492;) is not elsewhere to be supported; Schlottm. sees in it &#1514;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;; but such an expansion of the word for Dag. dirimens is scarcely to be supposed. This naming of the pillars of smoke is poet., as <a href="/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3</a>; cf. "a pillar of smoke," <a href="/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a>. She who approaches comes from the wilderness, brought up to Jerusalem, placed on an elevation, "like pillars of smoke," i.e., not herself likened thereto, as Schlottm. supposes it must be interpreted (with the tertium comp. of the slender, precious, and lovely), but encompassed and perfumed by such. For her whom the procession brings this lavishing of spices is meant; it is she who is incensed or perfumed with myrrh and frankincense. Schlottm. maintains that &#1502;&#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; cannot mean anything else than "perfumed," and therefore he reads &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514; (as Aq. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and Jerome). But the word mekutte&#780;re&#780;th does not certainly stand alone, but with the genit. foll.; and thus as "rent in their clothes," <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-31.htm">2 Samuel 13:31</a>, signifies not such as are themselves rent, but those whose clothes are rent (Ewald, 288b, compare also de Sacy, II 321), so &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1511;&#1496; can also mean those for whom (for whose honour) this incense is expended, and who are thus fumigated with it. &#1502;&#1512; .t, myrrh, (Arab.) murr (vid., above under Sol 1:13), stands also in <a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a> and <a href="/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a> at the head of the perfumes; it came from Arabia, as did also frankincense levo&#772;na&#772;, Arab. luba&#770;n (later referred to benzoin); both of the names are Semitic, and the circumstance that the Tra required myrrh as a component part of the holy oil, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>, and frankincense as a component part of the holy incense, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34</a>, points to Arabia as the source whence they were obtained. To these two principal spices there is added &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500; (cf. <a href="/genesis/6-20.htm">Genesis 6:20</a>; <a href="/genesis/9-2.htm">Genesis 9:2</a>) as an et cetera. &#1512;&#1493;&#1499;&#1500; denotes the travelling spice merchants (traders in aromatics), and traders generally. &#1488;&#1489;&#1511;&#1492;, which is related to &#1488;&#1489;&#1511; as powder to dust (cf. abacus, a reckoning-table, so named from the sand by means of which arithmetical numbers were reckoned), is the name designating single drugs (i.e., dry wares; cf. the Arab. elixir  equals  &#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;). </body></html>
