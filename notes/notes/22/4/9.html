It is, 1. A precept; so this is Christ's call to his church to come off from the world. These hills seem pleasant, but there are in them lions' dens; they are mountains of the leopards. 2. As a promise; many shall be brought as members of the church, from every point. The church shall be delivered from her persecutors in due time, though now she dwells among lions, Ps 57:4. Christ's heart is upon his church; his treasure is therein; and he delights in the affection she has for him; its working in the heart, and its works in the life. The odours wherewith the spouse is perfumed, are as the gifts and graces of the Spirit. Love and obedience to God are more pleasing to Christ than sacrifice or incense. Christ having put upon his spouse the white raiment of his own righteousness, and the righteousness of saints, and perfumed it with holy joy and comfort, he is well pleased with it. And Christ walks in his garden unseen. A hedge of protection is made around, which all the powers of darkness cannot break through. The souls of believers are as gardens enclosed, where is a well of living water, Joh 4:14; 7:38, the influences of the Holy Spirit. The world knows not these wells of salvation, nor can any opposer corrupt this fountain. Saints in the church, and graces in the saints, are fitly compared to fruits and spices. They are planted, and do not grow of themselves. They are precious; they are the blessings of this earth. They will be kept to good purpose when flowers are withered. Grace, when ended in glory, will last for ever. Christ is the source which makes these gardens fruitful; even a well of living waters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The similes employed refer to the graces of adornment, speech, and gesture, as expressions of inward character and sentiment.<p><a href="/songs/4-9.htm">Songs 4:9</a><p>With one of thine eyes - Rather, with one look of thine.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/songs/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. sister &#8230; spouse&#8212;This title is here first used, as He is soon about to institute the Supper, the pledge of the nuptial union.

Here another new title is given to the church, "my sister", with the repetition of the former, my "spouse": for one and the same person, with the Hebrews, might be sister and spouse; see <a href="/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>. And this may be used in a love strain, and so not improper in a love poem, as this was (g); see Sol 8:8; likewise the church may be called Christ's sister, because of his incarnation, in virtue of which he is not ashamed to call his people his brethren, and so his sisters, <a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>; and on account of their adoption; in which respect, he that is Christ's Father is theirs; and which is evidenced in regeneration; when they, through grace, do the will of his Father, and so are his brother, and sister, and mother, <a href="/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>. And, upon the whole, it is used to express the great affection of Christ for the church, and his high esteem of her; and which appears by his saying, "thou hast ravished my heart"; which is but one word in the Hebrew text, and nowhere else used, and is variously rendered: the Vulgate Latin version is, "thou hast wounded my heart" (h): with one of love's darts, Sol 2:5; "thou hast drawn my heart unto thee", so some Jewish writers (i); which is surprising, since no love nor loveliness are in her of herself; this shows how free and unmerited the love of Christ is; according to the use of the word with the Talmudists (k), the sense is, "thou hast coupled mine heart with thine"; the heart of Christ and his church are so closely knit and joined together in love, that they are but one heart, and can never be separated: others, "thou hast seized my heart"; or, "claimed it for thyself" (l); thou art master over it; it is no more mine, but thine The Septuagint version is, "thou hast unhearted us"; Father, Son, and Spirit; particularly the second Person: or thou hast stolen away my heart; I have no heart left in me; which, as it is the case through fear, is sometimes through love: this sense is approved by Aben Ezra. Some render it just the reverse, "thou hast heartened me" (m); put heart into me, animated me, made me of good cheer; so the word is used in the Syriac version of <a href="/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a>. The sense may be, that such was the love of Christ to his church, and so much was he charmed by her, that the thought of his having her company in heaven to all eternity animated him to endure all sufferings he did for her sake, <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>; The Targum is, <p>"thy love is fixed upon the table of my heart;'' <p>where the church herself was fixed, Sol 8:6; <p>thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes; the allusion may be to the custom of the eastern women; who, when they walked abroad or spoke to any, showed but one eye, the other, with the rest of the face, being covered with a veil (n): the eyes of women are ensnaring to lovers (o); the church has more eyes than one. Mention is made of the eyes of the understanding, <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; faith is one of them, and may he here chiefly intended; by which a soul looks on Christ, the glories of his person, and the fulness of his grace; and looks so him for the blessings of grace now, and eternal glory hereafter: and with this Christ's heart is ravished; even with "one look" from it, or "glance" of it, as some (p) render it; <p>with one chain of thy neck; with the several graces of the Spirit, linked together as in a chain; which were about the neck of the church, and as ornamental to her as a pearl necklace, Sol 1:10; and with every link in this chain Christ's heart is ravished and delighted. The Vulgate Latin version is, "with one lock of hair of thy neck": which hung down in it, and looked very beautiful; and with which lovers are sometimes taken (q). <p>(g) "Sive tibi conjux, sive futura soror", Tibullus.

Some translators take the first clause as though the word "ravished" should be rendered "emboldened." Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, literally, "heartened," may mean, as in Aramaic, "make courageous." Love in the beginning overpowers, <span class="accented">unhearts</span>, but the general idea must be that of "smitten" or "captured." So the LXX., Venetian, and Jerome, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">vulnerasti cor meum</span> (cf. <a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>). <span class="accented">My sister, my bride</span>, is, of course, the same as "my sisterly bride," a step beyond "my betrothed." Gesenius thinks that "one of thine eyes" should be "one look of thine;" but may it not refer to the eye appearing through the veil, as again one chain of the neck may glitter and attract all the more that the whole ornamentation did not appear in view? If but a portion of her beauty so overpowers, what will be the effect of the whole blaze of her perfection? As the Church advances in her likeness to her Lord, she becomes more and more the object of his delight, and as the soul receives more and more grace, so is her fellowship with Christ more and more assured and joyful. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The mouth is next praised:<p>3a Like a thread of crimson thy lips,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy mouth is lovely,<p>As distinguished from red-purple, &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; (properly, shining, glistening; for this form has an active signification, like &#1504;&#1511;&#1497;, as well as a passive, like &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;) - fully, &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514; - signifies the kermes or worm-colour; the karmese, the red juice of the cochineal. &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (&#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;) is translated by the lxx "thy speech;" Jerome, eloquium; and the Venet.
