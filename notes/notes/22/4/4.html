This was either the strong hold of Zion; or some tower erected by David for an armoury, wherein his worthies or mighty men bring up their shields; Mr. Sandys (k) says, it stood aloft in the utmost angle of a mountain, whose ruins are yet extant: though the neck is compared to this, not for its height, seeing a high and outstretched neck is a token of pride and haughtiness with the Jews, <a href="/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a>; see <a href="/psalms/74-5.htm">Psalm 74:5</a>; and so the phrase is used in Latin writers (l); but for its being ornamented with spoils hung up in it, as golden shields after mentioned, as the neck is with pearls, jewels, and chains of gold, Sol 1:10; The word for "armoury" is from "alaph", "to teach"; not as being a pattern to teach artificers, as Jarchi; nor to show passengers their way, as R. Jonah and others, who think this tower was built as a "pharus", for such a purpose (m); but it was as an arsenal, in which young learners of the art of war laid up their weapons, as well as what were taken from an enemy; or what were made and laid up here, as a store in time of need. By the church's neck may be meant either the ministers of the word, set in the highest part of the body, the church, next to Christ the Head, and in subjection to him; to whom they hold, and whose name, cause, and interest, they bear up and support in the world; and are the means of conveying spiritual food from him to the souls of men; and are adorned with the gifts and graces of the Spirit: and may be compared to the "tower of David", for their integrity and uprightness, and for their strength and immovableness, standing firm and unmoved against the batteries of Satan and the world, and for the defence of the Gospel; and to that "built for an armoury", they being furnished with the whole armour of God. An ancient writer (n) supposes the Apostle Paul is particularly meant; that eminent exalter of Christ the Head, and who was set for the defence of the Gospel: or it may be rather the Scriptures themselves are meant; which point out and hold forth Christ the Head, and make him manifest to the sons of men; and are a means of conveying spiritual breath; when attended with a divine power, then are they spirit and life; and of conveying food to the souls of men, very nourishing and satisfying; and are bespangled with glorious truths and precious promises; where every truth is a golden link, and every promise a pearl, to a believer: and they may be compared to the "tower of David" for their sublimity, being out of the reach and above the capacity of a natural man; and for their firmness and immovableness, which Satan and all his emissaries will never be able to remove out of the world; and like to that as "built for an armoury", <p>whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men: no other armour is mentioned, as in this armoury, but shields; they being a principal part of armour, and are especially (o) so called, as in the Septuagint version of <a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>; these shields are armour of mighty men; mighty, through God and his grace, to perform mighty actions, and do great exploits; being furnished from the spiritual armoury with the whole armour of God, to repel Satan's temptations, to defend the Gospel, and refute error; particularly the ministers of the word are those mighty men; though it is applicable to all saints. <p>(k) Travels, p. 139.

This rendering of a very difficult word follows the Talmud, which takes it to be a compound of <span class="ital">tal</span>, a form of the const. of <span class="ital">tel</span>, and <span class="ital">piyyôth</span> = ‘edges,’ i.e. swords. That gives ‘a mound in which swords were stored,’ ‘an armoury.’ But to compare a beautiful neck to a mound is impossible, and to call swords simply <span class="ital">edges</span> in a common name like this, would be very strange. Ewald renders ‘built for war hosts,’ connecting <span class="ital">talpiyyôth</span> with a similar Arabic word having that meaning. Delitzsch on the other hand translates, ‘built in or according to terraces.’ Perhaps the best rendering is Rothstein’s, <span class="ital">built for trophies</span>. He takes the root to be <span class="ital">lâphâh</span>, which in late Heb. in Aphel means to set in rows. <span class="ital">Talpiyyôth</span> would then be ‘repetitions of the act of setting in rows,’ and then ‘the things so set.’ The bride’s neck would, in that case, be compared to a tower adorned with trophies. Margoliouth in the <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, Jan. 1900, p. 45, takes the word to be a proper name. He points out that the LXX take it for the name of a place, and that the Arabic geographer Yakut says, <span class="ital">Talfiatha</span> is one of the villages of the <span class="ital">ghutah</span> or plain of Damascus. He would therefore translate, ‘the tower of David built towards Talpioth,’ and compares <a href="/songs/7-4.htm" title="Your neck is as a tower of ivory; your eyes like the fish pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: your nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>, “the tower of Lebanon which looks towards Damascus.” But can <span class="ital">built to</span> mean built so as to face?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whereon there hang a thousand bucklers</span>] Heb. the <span class="ital">thousand bucklers</span>, denoting that those referred to were known as belonging to the tower of David.

In that case the translation would be, ‘all the equipments of the heroes.’ But shields hung round a tower might be used as a comparison for a beautiful neck adorned with jewels; suits of armour would not be so appropriate.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy neck is like the tower of David, builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all the shields of the mighty men.</span> There is an evident change here in the character of the similitudes. The royal bridegroom does not forget to praise the majesty of his bride. The description now suits a royal queen. She is full of dignity and grace in her bearing. The tower referred to was no doubt that which was sometimes called "The tower of the flock" (<a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>), that from which David surveyed the flock of his people (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/3-16.htm">Nehemiah 3:16, 25</a>) - the government building erected on Mount Zion which served as a court of justice. The word <span class="accented">talpiyoth</span> is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;</span>, as if a proper name. Hengstenberg would render it "built for hanging swords," supposing it composed of two words - <span class="accented">tal</span>, from a root "to hang," and <span class="accented">piyoth</span>, "swords." But the word <span class="accented">piyoth</span> does not mean "swords," but the "double edges" of the swords. Kimchi renders. "an erection of sharp-cornered stones." Gesenius takes it from two roots, "to perish" and "to go," that is, <span class="accented">exitialibus armis</span>, which is very doubtful. Ewald's explanation seems the best, "built for close troops, so that many hundreds or thousands find room therein," taking it from a root, connected with the Arabic, meaning, "to wrap together." Delitzsch, however, observes that both in Aramaic and Talmudic Hebrew words occur, like this, in the sense of "enclosure," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> joining together, one working into the other, so that it may be taken as meaning, "in ranks together." This view is supported by Doderlein, Meier, Aquila, Jerome, Vulgate (<span class="accented">propugnacula</span>), and Venetian (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). If this be accepted, it may mean "terraced," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> built in stories one above another. This would convey the appearance of the tall, straight neck better than any. Surrounded with ornaments, the neck would so appear. There is another suggestion, supported by Ginsburg and taken from Rashi and Rashbun, Jewish writers, that the word is a contraction for a noun meaning "instruction," and means "the model tower" - the tower built for an architect's model. It would be rendered, "built for the builder's model." The meaning "armoury" takes it as composed of two words, <span class="accented">tael</span>," a hill," and <span class="accented">piyoth</span>," swords." It was decorated with a thousand shields, which was a customary adornment of towers and castles (see <a href="/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>). <span class="accented">All the</span>  <span class="accented">shields of heroes.</span> We can scarcely doubt the reference in such words to the time of Solomon, and therefore to his authorship, as the allusion to heroes, or mighty men of valour, would be customary soon after the time of David. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Another voice now describes the splendour of the bed of state which Solomon prepared in honour of Shulamith:<p>9 A bed of state hath King Solomon made for himself<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the wood of Lebanon.<p>10 Its pillars hath he made of silver,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its support of gold, its cushion of purple;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its interior is adorned from love<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the daughters of Jerusalem.<p>The sound of the word, the connection and the description, led the Greek translators (the lxx, Venet., and perhaps also others) to render &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, by &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, litter palanquin (Vulg. ferculum). The appiryon here described has a silver pedestal and a purple cushion - as we read in Athenaeus v. 13 (II p.  ed. Schweigh.) that the philosopher and tyrant Athenion showed himself "on a silver-legged &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, with purple coverlet;" and the same author, v. 5 (II p. , also says, that on the occasion of a festal procession by Antiochus Epiphanes, behind 200 women who sprinkled ointments from golden urns came 80 women, sitting in pomp on golden-legged, and 500 on silver-legged, &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1; - this is the proper name for the costly women's-litter (Suidas: &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), which, according to the number of bearers (Mart. VI 77: six Cappadocians and, ix. 2, eight Syrians), was called &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (hexaphorum, Mart. II 81) or &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (octophorum, Cicero's Verr. v. 10). The Mishna, Sota ix. 14, uses appiryon in the sense of &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;: "in the last war (that of Hadrian) it was decreed that a bride should not pass through the town in an appiryon on account of the danger, but our Rabbis sanctioned it later for modesty's sake;" as here, "to be carried in an appiryon," so in Greek, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;. In the Midrash also, Bamidbar rabba c. 12, and elsewhere, appiryon of this passage before us is taken in all sorts of allegorical significations in most of which the identity of the word with &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; is supposed, which is also there written &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; (after Aruch), cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>, Targ., and is once interchanged with &#1508;&#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, papilio (parillon), pleasure-tent. But a Greek word in the Song is in itself so improbable, that Ewald describes this derivation of the word as a frivolous jest; so much the more improbable, as &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; as the name of a litter (lectica) occurs first in such authors (of the &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;) as Plutarch, Polybuis, Herodian, and the like, and therefore, with greater right, it may be supposed that it is originally a Semitic word, which the Greek language adopted at the time when the Oriental and Graeco-Roman customs began to be amalgamated. Hence, if mitta&#772; Sol 3:7, means a portable bed, -  is evident from this, that it appears as the means of transport with an escort, - then appiryon cannot also mean a litter; the description, moreover, does not accord with a litter. We do not read of rings and carrying-poles, but, on the contrary, of pillars (as those of a tent-bed) instead, and, as might be expected, of feet. Schlottm., however, takes mitta&#772; and appiryon as different names for a portable bed; but the words, "an appiryon has King Solomon made," etc., certainly indicate that he who thus speaks has not the appiryon before him, and also that this was something different from the mitta&#772;. While Schlottm. is inclined to take appiryon, in the sense of a litter, as a word borrowed from the Greek (but in the time of the first king?), Gesen. in his Thes. seeks to derive it, thus understood, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, cito ferri, currere; but this signification of the verb is imaginary.<p>We expect here, in accordance with the progress of the scene, the name of the bridal couch; and on the supposition that appiryon, Sota 12a, as in the Mishna, means the litter (Aruch) of the bride, Arab. maziffat, and not torus nuptialis (Buxt.), then there is a possibility that appiryon is a more dignified word for 'e&#780;re&#780;s, Sol 1:17, yet sufficient thereby to show that &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488; is the usual Talm. name of the marriage-bed (e.g., Mezia 23b, where it stand, per meton., for concubitus), which is wittily explained by &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; (Kethuboth 10b, and elsewhere). The Targ. has for it the form &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; (vid., Levy). It thus designates a bed with a canopy (a tent-bed), <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-50.htm">Deuteronomy 32:50</a>, Jerus; so that the ideas of the bed of state and the palanquin (cf. &#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, canopy, and &#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1514; &#1495;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, bridal-bed, Succa 11a) touch one another. In general, &#1508;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488; (&#1508;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, as is also the case with appiryon, must have been originally a common designation of certain household furniture with a common characteristic; for the Syr. aprautha, plur. parjevatha (Wiseman's Horae, p. 255), or also parha (Castell.), signifies a cradle. It is then to be inquired, whether this word is referable to a root-word which gives a common characteristic with manifold applications. But the Heb. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, from the R. pr, signifies to split, <p>(Note: Vid., Friedr. Delitzsch's Indogerman.-semit. Studien, p. 72.)<p>to tear asunder, to break forth, to bring fruit, to be fruitful, and nothing further. Paaraa has nowhere the signification to run, as already remarked; only in the Palest.-Aram. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; is found in this meaning (vid., Buxt.). The Arab. farr does not signify to run, but to flee; properly (like our "ausreissen"  equals  be tear out, to break out), to break open by flight the rank in which one stands (as otherwise turned by horse-dealers: to open wide the horse's mouth). But, moreover, we do not thus reach the common characteristic which we are in search of; for if we may say of the litter that it runs, yet we cannot say that of a bed or a cradle, etc. The Arab. farfa&#770;r, species vehiculi muliebris, also does not help us; for the verb farfar, to vacillate, to shake, is its appropriate root-word.<p>(Note: The Turkish Ka&#770;mu&#770;s says of farfa&#770;r: "it is the name of a vehicle (merkeb), like the camel-litter (haudej), destined merely for women." This also derives its name from rocking to and fro. So farfa&#770;r, for farfara is to the present day the usual word for agiter, scouer les ailes; farfarah, for lgret; furfu&#770;r, for butterfly (cf. Ital. farfalla); generally, the ideas of that which is light and of no value - e.g., a babbler-connect themselves with the root far in several derivatives.)<p>With better results shall we compare the Arab. fary, which, in Kal and Hiph., signifies to break open, to cut out (couper, tailler une toffe), and also, figuratively, to bring forth something strange, something not yet existing (yafry alfaryya, according to the Arab. Lex.  equals  yaty bal'ajab fy 'amalh, he accomplishes something wonderful); the primary meaning in Conj. viii. is evidently: yftarra kidban, to cut out lies, to meditate and to express that which is calumnious (a similar metaphor to khar'a, findere, viii. fingere, to cut out something in the imagination; French, inventer, imaginer). With this fary, however, we do not immediately reach &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;, &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;; for fary, as well as fara (farw), are used only of cutting to pieces, cutting out, sewing together of leather and other materials (cf. Arab. farwat, fur; farra&#772;, furrier), but not of cutting and preparing wood.<p>But why should not the Semitic language have used &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, also, in the sense of the verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, which signifies <p>continued...</body></html>
