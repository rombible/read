Such honour have all his saints; and having put on Christ, they are distinguished by their beautiful and glorious apparel. They adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Consistent believers honour Christ, recommend the gospel, and convince and awaken sinners. The church resembles the stately and spreading palm; while her love for Christ, and the obedience resulting therefrom, are precious fruit of the true Vine. The King is held in the galleries. Christ takes delight in the assemblies and ordinances of his people; and admires the fruit of his grace in them.

These are the words of the King in the galleries, wondering at the church's beauty, it being incomparable and inexpressible, it could not be said well how great it was; and expressing the strength of his love to her, which was invariably the same as ever. Of the "fairness" of the church, and of this title, "love", see Sol 1:9; and here she is said also to be "pleasant" to him, as his spouse and bride, in whom he takes infinite delight and pleasure, loving her with a love of complacency and delight; and therefore adds, "for delights", which he had in her before the world was, <a href="/proverbs/8-31.htm">Proverbs 8:31</a>. She was all delight (g) to him; her words, her actions and gestures, her comely countenance, her sweet and pleasant voice in prayer and praise, her ravishing looks of faith and love, her heavenly airs, and evangelic walk; in all which she appeared beautiful and delightful, beyond all human thought and expression. <p>(g) "Meae deliciae", Plauti Stichus, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/5.htm">Acts 5</a>.

The word translated <span class="ital">delights</span> does not necessarily, or even generally, mean sensuous delights, as some say. Cp. <a href="/proverbs/19-10.htm" title="Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.">Proverbs 19:10</a>; <a href="/micah/1-16.htm" title="Make you bald, and poll you for your delicate children; enlarge your baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from you.">Micah 1:16</a>; <a href="/micah/2-9.htm" title="The women of my people have you cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have you taken away my glory for ever.">Micah 2:9</a>. This sudden turn to the praise of love, not the beloved, is abrupt, but it has frequent parallels in the love poetry of the East, cp. the ode written out for Wetzstein at Kenakir. (Cp. his <span class="ital">Essay on the Threshing-Board, loc. cit</span>.) That the Heb. verb <span class="ital">yâphâh</span> may be used of love in this abstract sense may be inferred from <a href="/ezekiel/28-7.htm" title="Behold, therefore I will bring strangers on you, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they shall defile your brightness.">Ezekiel 28:7</a>, where the noun of this root is used in a similar abstract way in the phrase, “the beauty of thy wisdom.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-9.</span> - (<span class="accented">Song of the bridegroom rejoicing over the bride.</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. I said, I will climb up into the palm tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof: let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy breath like apples; and thy mouth like the best wine, that goeth down smoothly for my beloved, gliding through the lips of them that are asleep.</span> The  abstract "love" is plainly here used for the concrete, "O loved one." It is just possible that the meaning may be - How delightful is the enjoyment of love! but the bodily description which follows suggests that the words are addressed directly to Shulamith. We certainly have in <a href="/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, an apostolic apostrophe to love, which Delitzsch calls the Apostle Paul's spiritual song of songs. But it would be somewhat irrelevant here. The king is deeply moved as he watches the beautiful figure before him, and delights in the thought that so lovely a creature is his own. The rapture which he pours out may be taken either as a recollection of how he was captivated in the past, or the past may be used for the present, as it frequently is in Hebrew. The meaning is the same in both cases. The palm tree may be selected on account of its elegance, but it is commonly employed in Eastern poetry as the emblem of love. The mystical writers use it to denote the Divine manifestation. The comparison of the breasts to clusters of grapes is quite natural, but no doubt reference is intended to the fruit as luscious and refreshing. Both the palm and the vine in the East are remarkable for the abundance and beauty of their fruits. In the case of the palm - "dark brown or golden-yellow clusters, which crown the summit of the stem and impart a wonderful beauty to the tree, especially when seen in the evening twilight." The palm and the vine are both employed in Scripture in close connection with the Church. "The righteous shall flourish as the palm tree;" "The vine brought out of Egypt" (Ps <a href="/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>.), and the "vineyard of the beloved" (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>.), and the "true vine," to which the Lord Jesus Christ compares himself, remind us that the illustration was perfectly familiar among the Jews; and we can scarcely doubt that the reference in this case would be understood. The Lord delighteth in those "fruits of righteousness" which come forth from the life and love of his people. They are the true adornment of the Church. The people of God are never so beautiful in the eyes of their Saviour as when they are covered with gifts and graces in their active expression in the world. Then it is that he himself fills his Church with his presence. The ninth verse is somewhat difficult to explain. The words are no doubt still in the lips of the king. There is no change of speaker until ver. 10, when Shulamith replies to the king's adoring address. Ginsburg says, "Her voice is not merely compared to wine because it is sweet to everybody, but to such wine as would be sweet to a friend, and on that account is more valuable and pleasant." The Authorized Version is supported by some critics as the best, "causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak." Delitzsch adheres to this. The LXX. renders it thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "accommodating itself to my lips and teeth." So Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Jerome, <span class="accented">Labiisque et dentibus illius ad ruminandum.</span> Luther strangely renders, "which to my friend goes smoothly down and speaks of the previous year" (pointing <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). Another rendering is, "which comes unawares upon the lips of the sleepers." Some think it refers to the smacking of the lips after wine. "Generous wine is a figure of the love responses of the beloved, sipped in, as it were, with pleasing satisfaction, which hover around the sleepers in delightful dreams, and fill them with hallucinations." Another reading substitutes "the ancient" for "them that are asleep." The general meaning must be wine that is very good and easily taken, or which one who is a good judge of wine will praise. It is possible that there is some slight corruption in the text. The passage is not to be rendered with absolute certainty. Delitzsch and others think that it is an interruption of the bride's, but they have little support for that view. The bride begins to speak at ver. 10. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Encouraged by Shulamith's unassuming answer, the daughters of Jerusalem now give utterance to an entreaty which their astonishment at her beauty suggests to them.<p>13 Come back, come back, O Shulamith!<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come back, come back, that we may look upon thee!<p>She is now (Sol 6:10.) on the way from the garden to the palace. The fourfold "come back" entreats her earnestly, yea, with tears, to return thither with them once more, and for this purpose, that they might find delight in looking up her; for &#1489; &#1495;&#1494;&#1492; signifies to sink oneself into a thing, looking at it, to delight (feast) one's eyes in looking on a thing. Here for the first time Shulamith is addressed by name. But &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; cannot be a pure proper name, for the art. is vocat., as e.g., &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;, "O daughter of Jerusalem!" Pure proper names like &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; are so determ. in themselves that they exclude the article; only such as are at the same time also nouns, like &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;, are susceptible of the article, particularly also of the vocat., <a href="/psalms/114-5.htm">Psalm 114:5</a>; but cf. <a href="/zechariah/11-1.htm">Zechariah 11:1</a> with <a href="/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>. Thus &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; will be not so much a proper name as a name of descent, as generally nouns in  (with a few exceptions, viz., of ordinal number, &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;, &#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;, etc.) are all gentilicia. The lxx render &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; by &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and this is indeed but another form for &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, i.e., she who is from Sunem. Thus also was designated the exceedingly beautiful Abishag, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-3.htm">1 Kings 1:3</a>, Elisha's excellent and pious hostess, <a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a> ff. Sunem was in the tribe of Issachar (<a href="/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>), near to Little Hermon, from which it was separated by a valley, to the south-east of Carmel. This lower Galilean Sunem, which lies south from Nain, south-east from Nazareth, south-west from Tabor, is also called Shulem. Eusebius in his Onomasticon says regarding it: &#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc; (l. &#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;) &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x399;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; &#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bc; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;., i.e., as Jerome translates it: Sunem in tribue Issachar. et usque hodie vicus ostenditur nomine Sulem in quinto miliario montis Thabor contra australum plagam. This place if found at the present day under the name of Suwlam (Slam), at the west end of Jebel ed-Duhi (Little Hermon), not far from the great plain (Jisre'el, now Zer'n), which forms a convenient way of communication between Jordan and the sea-coast, but is yet so hidden in the mountain range that the Talmud is silent concerning this Sulem, as it is concerning Nazareth. Here was the home of the Shulamitess of the Song. The ancients interpret the name by &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;, or by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; (vid., Lagarde's Onomastica), the former after Aquila and the Quinta, the latter after Symm. The Targum has the interpretation: &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; &#1489;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492; &#1506;&#1501; &#1492; (vid., Rashi). But the form of the name (the Syr. writes &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;) is opposed to these allegorical interpretations. Rather it is to be assumed that the poet purposely used, not hshwb', but hshwl', to assimilate her name to that of Solomon; and that it has the parallel meaning of one devoted to Solomon, and thus, as it were, of a passively-applied &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;  equals  &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;, is the more probable, as the daughters of Jerusalem would scarcely venture thus to address her who was raised to the rank of a princess unless this name accorded with that of Solomon.<p>Not conscious of the greatness of her beauty, Shulamith asks - <p>1ba What do you see in Shulamith?<p>She is not aware that anything particular is to be seen in her; but the daughters of Jerusalem are of a different opinion, and answer this childlike, modest, but so much the more touching question - <p>1bb As the dance of Mahanaim!<p>They would thus see in her something like the dance of Manahaa&#x3bf;m. If this be here the name of the Levitical town (now Mahneh) in the tribe of Gad, north of Jabbok, where Ishbosheth resided for two years, and where David was hospitably entertained on his flight from Absalom (Luthr.: "the dance to Mahanaa&#x3bf;m"), then we must suppose in this trans-Jordanic town such a popular festival as was kept in Shiloh, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>, and we may compare Abel-meholah  equals  meadow of dancing, the name of Elisha's birth-place (cf. also Herod. i.:16: "To dance the dance of the Arcadian town of Tegea"). But the Song delights in retrospective references to Genesis (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-11.htm">Genesis 4:11</a>, <a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>). At <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>, however, by Mahanaa&#x3bf;m <p>(Note: B&#x3c6;ttcher explains Mahanaa&#x3bf;m as a plur.; but the plur. of &#1502;&#1510;&#1504;&#1492; is &#1502;&#1510;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; the plur. termination ajim is limited to &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;.)<p>is meant the double encampment of angels who protected Jacob's two companies (<a href="/genesis/32-8.htm">Genesis 32:8</a>). The town of Mahanaam derives its name from this vision of Jacob's. The word, as the name of a town, is always without the article; and here, where it has the article, it is to be understood appellatively. The old translators, in rendering by "the dances of the camps" (Syr., Jerome, choros castrorum, Venet. &#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;), by which it remains uncertain whether a war-dance or a parade is meant, overlook the dual, and by exchanging &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; with &#1502;&#1510;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, they obtain a figure which in this connection is incongruous and obscure. But, in truth, the figure is an angelic one. The daughters of Jerusalem wish to see Shulamith dance, and they designate that as an angelic sight. Mahanaam became in the post-bibl. dialect a name directly for angels. The dance of angels is only a step beyond the responsive song of the seraphim, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-13</a>. Engelkoere angel-choir and "heavenly host" are associated in the old German poetry.<p>(Note: Vid., Walther von der Vogelweide, 173. 28. The Indian mythology goes farther, and transfers not only the original of the dance, but also of the drama, to heaven; vid., Gtting. Anziegen, 1874, p. 106.)<p>The following description is undeniably that (let one only read how Hitzig in vain seeks to resist this interpretation) of one dancing. In this, according to biblical representation and ancient custom, there is nothing repulsive. The women of the ransomed people, with Miriam at their head, danced, as did also the women who celebrated David's victory over Goliath (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>). David himself danced (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a>) before the ark of the covenant. Joy and dancing are, according to Old Testament conception, inseparable (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:4</a>); and joy not only as the happy feeling of youthful life, but also spiritual holy joy (<a href="/psalms/87-7.htm">Psalm 87:7</a>). The dance which the ladies of the court here desire to see, falls under the point of view of a play of rival individual artistes reciprocally acting for the sake of amusement. The play also is capable of moral nobility, if it is enacted within the limits of propriety, at the right time, in the right manner, and if the natural joyfulness, penetrated by intelligence, is consecrated by a spiritual aim. Thus Shulamith, when she dances, does not then become a Gaditanian (Martial, xiv. 203) or an Alma (the name given in Anterior Asia to those women who go about making it their business to dance mimic and partly lascivious dances); nor does she become a Bajadere (<a href="/isaiah/23-15.htm">Isaiah 23:15</a> f.), <p>(Note: Alma is the Arab. 'ualmah (one skilled, viz., in dancing and jonglerie), and Bajadere is the Portug. softening of baladera, a dancer, from balare (ballare), mediaev. Lat., and then Romanic: to move in a circle, to dance.)<p>continued...</body></html>
