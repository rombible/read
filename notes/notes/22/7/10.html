She humbly desires communion with him. Let us walk together, that I may receive counsel, instruction, and comfort from thee; and may make known my wants and my grievances to thee, with freedom, and without interruption. Communion with Christ is what all that are made holy earnestly breathe after. And those who would converse with Christ, must go forth from the world. Wherever we are, we may keep up communion with God. Nor should we go where we cannot in faith ask him to go with us. Those who would go abroad with Christ, must begin early in the morning of their days; must begin every day with him, seek him early, seek him diligently. A gracious soul can reconcile itself to the poorest places, if it may have communion with God in them; but the most delightful fields will not satisfy, unless the Beloved is there. Let us not think to be satisfied with any earthly object. Our own souls are our vineyards; they should be planted with useful trees. We should often search whether we are fruitful in righteousness. Christ's presence will make the vine flourish, and the tender grapes appear, as the returning sun revives the gardens. If we can appeal to him, Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee; if his Spirit witness with our spirit, that our souls prosper, it is enough. And we must beg of him to search and try us, to discover us to ourselves. The fruits and exercises of graces are pleasant to the Lord Jesus. These must be laid up, and always ready; that by our bringing forth much fruit, he may be glorified. It is all from him, therefore it is fit it should be all for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His desire is toward me - All his affection has me for its object.

These are the words of the church, strongly expressing the assurance of faith she had of her union to Christ, and interest in him; which shows that "that" grace is attainable, and that there may be a continuation of the exercise of it; it may be expressed again and again, as it is by the church in this Song, Sol 2:16; and that the exercise of it often follows, upon the enjoyment of Christ's presence, as here, upon his going tap to the palm tree; and that this grace has no tendency to licentiousness, but excites to duty, and makes more careful in it, of which Sol 7:11 is a proof, "Come, let us go forth", &amp;c. Moreover, these words may be considered as a modest acknowledgment of the church's, that all she were and had were Christ's, and came from him; all the beauty he had commended in her; all fruitfulness in grace, and strength in the exercise of it; her light and knowledge in divine truths; her zeal and courage to defend them; her upright stature, and holy walk and conversation, and every good thing else, were owing to his grace. And here she also makes a voluntary surrender of all to him again; as she received all from him, she devotes all to him: <p>and his desire is towards me; and only to her, as his spouse and bride: it was towards her from everlasting, when he asked her of his Father, and he gave her to him; and so it was in time, to procure her salvation; hence he became incarnate, and suffered and died in her stead: his desire is towards his people before conversion, waiting to be gracious to them; and, after conversion, to have their company, and their grace exercised on him, and to behold their beauty; nor will his desires be fully satisfied until he has got them all with him in glory. And this phrase not only signifies the conjugal relation of the church to Christ, he being her husband, and she his wife, the desire of his eyes, as a wife is called, <a href="/ezekiel/24-16.htm">Ezekiel 24:16</a>; but takes in the whole care and concern of Christ for her, as her husband; who sympathizes with her under all her distresses; protects her from all dangers and enemies; and provides everything necessary for her, for time and eternity. Some render the words, "seeing his desire is towards me" (b); therefore she expresses her faith in him, and gives up herself to him. <p>(b) So Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/songs/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{d}</span> I <i>am</i> my beloved's, and his desire <i>is</i> toward me.</span><p>(d) This the spouse speaks.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/songs/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. In this verse the bride openly rejects the king whom she had already tacitly rejected, saying, ‘I belong to my beloved alone, and he on his part longs after me only.’ As Oettli says, the words should be conceived as uttered with an almost triumphant gesture of rejection towards Solomon. Budde supposes <span class="ital"><a href="/songs/7-10.htm" title="I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.">Song of Solomon 7:10</a></span> to be perhaps an editorial connecting clause borrowed from ch. <a href="/songs/2-16.htm" title="My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feeds among the lilies.">Song of Solomon 2:16</a>, as Martineau and Bickell also do.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am my beloved's, and his desire is towards me.</span> So in <a href="/songs/6-3.htm">Song of Solomon 6:3</a> and Song 2:16. It seems possible that a portion of the bride's speech may have dropped out - "My beloved is mine" - or she may wish to adopt the language of <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, and represent herself as a true wife, whose husband is wrapt up in her love. By "desire" is intended the impulse of love, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, from a root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span>, "to move or impel." The thought seems to be this - As my beloved is full of worshipping affection, and I am wholly his, let his love have free course, and let us retire together away from all the distractions and artificiality of the town life to the simplicity and congenial enjoyments of the country, which are so much more to my taste. The more real and fervent the religious emotions of the soul and the spiritual life of the Church, the more natural and simple will be their expression. We do not require any profuse ceremonies, any extravagant decorations, any complicated and costly religions services, in order to draw forth in the Christian Church the highest realization of the Saviour's fellowship. We want the Christianity we profess to take possession of us, body and soul. And so it will be as Christians learn more of Christ. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>4a Thy neck like an ivory tower.<p>The article in &#1495;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1503; may be that designating species (vid., under Sol 1:11); but, as at Sol 7:5 and Sol 4:4, it appears to be also here a definite tower which the comparison has in view: one covered externally with ivory tablets, a tower well known to all in and around Jerusalem, and visible far and wide, especially when the sun shone on it; had it been otherwise, as in the case of the comparison following, the locality would have been more definitely mentioned. So slender, so dazzlingly white, is imposing, and so captivating to the eye did Shulamith's neck appear. These and the following figures would be open to the objection of being without any occasion, and monstrous, if they referred to an ordinary beauty; but they refer to Solomon's spouse, they apply to a queen, and therefore are derived from that which is most splendid in the kingdom over which, along with him, she rules; and in this they have the justification of their grandeur.<p>4ba Thine eyes pools in Heshbon,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the gate of the populous (city).<p>Hesbhon, formerly belonging to the Amorites, but at this time to the kingdom of Solomon, lay about 5 1/2 hours to the east of the northern point of the Dead Sea, on an extensive, undulating, fruitful, high table-land, with a far-reaching prospect. Below the town, now existing only in heaps of ruins, a brook, which here takes it rise, flows westward, and streams toward the Gh&#x3c4;r as the Nahr Hesb&#x3b1;n. It joins the Jordan not far above its entrance into the Dead Sea. The situation of the town was richly watered. There still exists a huge reservoir of excellent masonry in the valley, about half a mile from the foot of the hill on which the town stood. The comparison here supposes two such pools, but which are not necessarily together, though both are before the gate, i.e., near by, outside the town. Since &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, except at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>, is fem., &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, in the sense of &#1506;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a> (cf. for the non-determin. of the adj., <a href="/ezekiel/21-25.htm">Ezekiel 21:25</a>), is to be referred to the town, not to the gate (Hitz.); Blau's <p>(Note: In Merx' Archiv. III355.)<p>conjectural reading, bath-'akrabbim, does not recommend itself, because the craggy heights of the "ascent of Akrabbim" (<a href="/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a>), which obliquely cross <p>(Note: Vid., Robinson's Phys. Geogr. p. 51.)<p>the Ghr to the south of the Dead Sea, and from remote times formed the southern boundary of the kingdom of the Amorites (<a href="/judges/1-36.htm">Judges 1:36</a>), were too far off, and too seldom visited, to give its name to a gate of Heshbon. But generally the crowds of men at the gate and the topography of the gate are here nothing to the purpose; the splendour of the town, however, is for the figure of the famed cisterns like a golden border. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; (from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, to spread out, vid., Genesis, p. 98; Fleischer in Levy, I 420b) denotes a skilfully built round or square pool. The comparison of the eyes to a pool means, as Wetstein <p>(Note: Zeitschr. fr allgem. Erdkunde, 1859, p. 157 f.)<p>remarks, "either thus glistening like a water-mirror, or thus lovely in appearance, for the Arabian knows no greater pleasure than to look upon clear, gently rippling water." Both are perhaps to be taken together; the mirroring glance of the moist eyes (cf. Ovid, De Arte Am. ii. 722):<p>"Adspicies obulos tremulo fulgore micantes,<p>Ut sol a liquida saepe refulget aqua"<p>continued...</body></html>
