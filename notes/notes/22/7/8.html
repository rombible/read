Consistent believers honour Christ, recommend the gospel, and convince and awaken sinners. The church resembles the stately and spreading palm; while her love for Christ, and the obedience resulting therefrom, are precious fruit of the true Vine. The King is held in the galleries.

Which is easy of ascent; having, in the bark of the trunk or body of the tree, rings like steps, whereby the eastern people climb it with incredible swiftness, as Pliny (n) relates: these steps are made by the lower boughs being lopped off, whose knots, or "pollices", as Dr. Shaw (o) calls them, being gradually left upon the trunk of the tree, serve, like so many rungs of a ladder, to climb up the tree; either to fecundate it, or to lop it, or to gather the fruit; and Lucian says (p), <p>"those that have seen how men get up into palm trees, in Arabia, Egypt, and other places, must needs understand what he says about climbing the Phalli, in the temple of Hierapolis in Syria, he is describing.'' <p>By the "palm tree" may be meant the church militant, who yet gets the victory over all her enemies, of which the palm tree is an emblem; and Christ's "going up" to it is expressive of his right to it, and property in it, which he has by his Father's gift, his own purchase, and the power of his grace, and may go up to it when he pleases; also of his presence with his church, and of the delight he takes in her, viewing her stature, fruit, and flourishing circumstances; <p>I will take hold of the boughs thereof; either to crop them, the tops of them, which, of the first year's growth, are very tender and sweet, and may be eaten (q); the top of the palm tree is said to be very sweet (r); and which some call the "cerebrum", or brain of it, and is spoken of as very pleasant and nourishing (s): or to gather the fruit on them; his own grace in exercise, and good works performed under the influence of it; see Sol 4:16; or to prune them; which he does by the ministry of the word, reproving sin, and refuting error; and, by afflictive providences, purging away sin; and by suffering persecution to befall his churches, whereby he clears them of carnal professors, and lops off withered and fruitless branches; <p>now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine; round, full, soft, and succulent, like the berries of the vine tree, the grapes that grow in clusters on it; of these; see Gill on Sol 7:7; <p>and the smell of thy nose like apples; See Gill on Sol 7:4. Here it may denote the inward constitution and outward conduct of the church, which were sound and healthful; she had an inward principle of grace, from whence proceeded a savoury conduct, a savoury breath, a holy breathing after divine and spiritual things: or it may intend the things she had a savour of, as divine truths and excellent doctrines, comparable to "apples", Sol 2:5; and all spiritual and heavenly things, when they have the presence of Christ, and the quickening influences of his Spirit. <p>(n) Ibid.

He therefore changes &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1498; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1498;, "thy pudenda." But (1) it is no voluptuary who speaks here, and particularly not a man, but women who speak; certainly, above all, it is the poet, who would not, however, be so inconsiderate as to put into the mouths of women immodest words which he could use if he wished to represent the king as speaking. Moreover (2) &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  equals  (Arab.) surr, secret (that which is secret; in Arab. especially referred to the pudenda, both of man and woman), is a word that is <p>(Note: Vid., Tebrzi, in my work entitled Jud.-Arab. Poesien, u.s.w. (1874), p. 24.)<p>foreign to the Heb. language, which has for "Geheimnis" secret the corresponding word &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; (vid., under <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>), after the root-signification of its verbal stem (viz., to be firm, pressed together); and (3) the reference - preferred by Dpke, Magnus, Hahn, and others, also without any change of punctuation - of &#1513;&#1473;&#1512; to the interfeminium mulieris, is here excluded by the circumstance that the attractions of a woman dancing, as they unfold themselves, are here described. Like the Arab. surr, &#1513;&#1473;&#1512; ( equals  shurr), from &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;, to bind fast, denotes properly the umbilical cord, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a>, and then the umbilical scar. Thus, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a>, where most recent critics prefer, for &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1468;&#1498;, to read, but without any proper reason, &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1498;  equals  &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, "to thy flesh," the navel comes there into view as the centre of the body, - which it always is with new-born infants, and is almost so with grown-up persons in respect of the length of the body, - and as, indeed, the centre. whence the pleasurable feeling of health diffuses its rays of heat. This middle and prominent point of the abdomen shows itself in one lightly clad and dancing when she breathes deeply, even through the clothing; and because the navel commonly forms a little funnel-like hollow (Bttch.: in the form almost of a whirling hollow in the water, as one may see in nude antique statues), therefore the daughters of Jerusalem compare Shulamith's navel to a "basin of roundness," i.e., which has this general property, and thus belongs to the class of things that are round. &#1488;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503; does not mean a Becher (a cup), but a Bechen (basin), pelvis; properly a washing basin, ijjanah (from &#1488;&#1490;&#1503;  equals  ajan, to full, to wash  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1505;); then a sprinkling basin, <a href="/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6</a>; and generally a basin, <a href="/isaiah/22-24.htm">Isaiah 22:24</a>; here, a mixing basin, in which wine was mingled with a proportion of water to render it palatable (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;, from &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, temperare), - according to the Talm. with two-thirds of water. In this sense this passage is interpreted allegorically, Sanhedrin 14b, 37a, and elsewhere (vid., Aruch under &#1502;&#1494;&#1490;). &#1502;&#1494;&#1490; .)&#1502;&#1494; is not spiced wine, which is otherwise designated (Sol 8:2), but, as Hitzig rightly explains, mixed wine, i.e., mixed with water or snow (vid., under <a href="/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>). &#1502;&#1494;&#1490; is not borrowed from the Greek &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (Grtz), but is a word native to all the three chief Semitic dialects, - the weaker form of &#1502;&#1505;&#1498;, which may have the meaning of "to pour in;" but not merely "to pour in," but, at that same time, "to mix" (vid., under <a href="/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2</a>). &#1505;&#1492;&#1512;, with &#1488;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503;, represents the circular form (from &#1505;&#1492;&#1512;  equals  &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;), corresponding to the navel ring; Kimchi thinks that the moon must be understood (cf. &#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, lunula): a moon-like round basin; according to which the Venet., also in Gr., choosing an excellent name for the moon, translates: &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;. But "moon-basin" would be an insufficient expression for it; Ewald supposes that it is the name of a flower, without, however, establishing this opinion. The "basin of roundness" is the centre of the body a little depressed; and that which the clause, "may not mixed wine be lacking," expresses, as their wish for her, is soundness of health, for which no more appropriate and delicate figure can be given than hot wine tempered with fresh water.<p>The comparison in 3b is the same as that of R. Johanan's of beauty, Meza 84a: "He who would gain an idea of beauty should take a silver cup, fill it with pomegranate flowers, and encircle its rim with a garland of roses." <p>(Note: See my Gesch. d. Jd. Poesie, p. 30 f. Hoch (the German Solomon) reminds us of the Jewish marriage custom of throwing over the newly-married pair the contents of a vessel wreathed with flowers, and filled with wheat or corn (with money underneath), accompanied with the cry, &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; be fruitful and multiply.)<p>To the present day, winnowed and sifted corn is piled up in great heaps of symmetrical half-spherical form, which are then frequently stuck over with things that move in the wind, for the purpose of protecting them against birds. "The appearance of such heaps of wheat," says Wetstein (Isa. p. 710), "which one may see in long parallel rows on the thrashing-floors of a village, is very pleasing to a peasant; and the comparison of the Song; Sol 7:3, every Arabian will regard as beautiful." Such a corn-heap is to the present day called s&#803;ubbah, while &#8219;aramah is a heap of thrashed corn that has not yet been winnowed; here, with &#1506;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, is to be connected the idea of a s&#803;ubbah, i.e., of a heap of wheat not only thrashed and winnowed, but also sifted (riddled). &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;, enclosed, fenced about (whence the post-bibl. &#1505;&#1497;&#1490;, a fence), is a part. pass. such as &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, scattered (vid., under <a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>). The comparison refers to the beautiful appearance of the roundness, but, at the same time, also the flesh-colour shining through the dress; for fancy sees more than the eyes, and concludes regarding that which is veiled from that which is visible. A wheat-colour was, according to the Moslem Sunna, the tint of the first created man. Wheat-yellow and lily-white is a subdued white, and denotes at once purity and health; by &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; wheat one thinks of &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1; - heaped up wheat developes a remarkable heat, a fact for which Biesenthal refers to Plutarch's Quaest. In accordance with the progress of the description, the breasts are now spoken of: </body></html>
