The LXX., in stead of <span class= "ital">siphtheî yesheynîm, </span>lips of sleepers, read <span class= "ital">sephathaîm veshinnayîm, </span><span class= "greekheb">χέιλεσί μου καὶ ὸδοῦσι</span>. The Marg., instead of <span class= "ital">yesheynîm, </span>sleepers, reads <span class= "ital">yeshanîm, </span>the ancient, which Luther adopts, translating “of the previous year.” <span class= "ital">Ledôdî, </span>for my beloved, is evidently either an accidental insertion of the copyist, the eye having caught <span class= "ital">dôdî </span>in the next verse, or more probably is wrongly vowelled. The verse is untranslatable as it stands; but by reading <span class= "ital">ledôdaî, </span>“to my caresses” (comp. <a href="/songs/1-2.htm" title="Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for your love is better than wine.">Song of Solomon 1:2</a>; <a href="/songs/4-10.htm" title="How fair is your love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is your love than wine! and the smell of your ointments than all spices!">Song of Solomon 4:10</a>; <a href="/songs/7-12.htm" title="Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give you my loves.">Song of Solomon 7:12</a>), we get a sense entirely harmonious with the context, and this is a change less violent than to reject <span class= "ital">ledôdî </span>altogether. It is the old figure, comparing kisses to wine (comp. <a href="/songs/1-2.htm" title="Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for your love is better than wine.">Song of Solomon 1:2</a>; <a href="/songs/2-4.htm" title="He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.">Song of Solomon 2:4</a>; <a href="/songs/5-1.htm" title="I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>). “The roof of the mouth” (comp. <a href="/songs/5-16.htm" title="His mouth is most sweet: yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.">Song of Solomon 5:16</a>), or palate, is put by metonymy for the mouth generally. <span class= "ital">Dôbeb </span>is either from the root <span class= "ital">dôb, </span>cognate with <span class= "ital">zôb = </span>flow gently, and means <span class= "ital">suffusing, </span>in which case we translate “Thy mouth pours out an exquisite wine, which runs sweetly down in answer to my caresses, and suffuses (LXX. <span class= "greekheb">ἱκανούμενος</span><span class= "ital">, accommodating itself to</span>) our lips as we fall asleep”—or, according to the Rabbinical interpretation, followed by the Authorised Version (which connects <span class= "ital">dôbeb </span>with <span class= "ital">dabab, </span>a Talmudic word = speaking), there may be in it the idea of a dream making the lips move as in speech.

Consistent believers honour Christ, recommend the gospel, and convince and awaken sinners. The church resembles the stately and spreading palm; while her love for Christ, and the obedience resulting therefrom, are precious fruit of the true Vine. The King is held in the galleries.

Which may intend, either her taste, as the word is rendered in Sol 2:3; by which she can distinguish good wine from bad, truth from error; or her breath, sweet and of a good smell, like the best wine; the breathings of her soul in prayer, which are sweet odours, perfumed with the incense of Christ's mediation; or rather her speech, the words of her mouth; the roof of the mouth being an instrument of speech; the same word is sometimes rendered "the mouth", Sol 5:16; and may denote both her speech in common conversation, which is warming, refreshing, comforting, and quickening; and in prayer and praise, which is well pleasing and delightful to Christ; and especially the Gospel preached by her ministers, comparable to the best wine for its antiquity, being an ancient Gospel; for its purity, unadulterated, and free from mixture, and as faithfully dispensed; its delight, flavour, and taste, to such who have their spiritual senses exercised; and for its cheering, refreshing, and strengthening nature, to drooping weary souls. It follows, <p>for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly; is received and taken down with all readiness, by those who have once tasted the sweetness and felt the power of it. Or, "that goeth to righteousnesses" (t); leading to the righteousness of Christ for justification, and teaching to live soberly and righteously: or, "that goeth to my beloved, straightway" or "directly" (u); meaning either to his Father, Christ calls his beloved, to whose love the Gospel leads and directs souls, as in a straight line, as to the source of salvation, and all the blessings of grace; or to himself, by a "mimesis", whom the church calls so; the Gospel leading souls directly to him, his person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, for peace, pardon, justification, and atonement: or, "that goeth to my beloved to uprightnesses" (w); that is, to the church, who is Christ's beloved, consisting of upright men in heart and life, whom Christ calls his beloved and his friends, Sol 5:1; and whom Christ treats with his best wine, his Gospel; and which is designed for them, their pleasure, profit, comfort, and establishment: <p>causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak; either such who are in the dead sleep of sin; who, when the Gospel comes with power, are quickened by it; and it produces in them humble confessions of sin; causes them to speak in praise of Christ, and his grace, and of the salvation which he has procured for lost sinners; it brings them to Zion, to declare what great things God has done for them: or else drowsy professors, in lifeless frames, and much gone back in religion; who, when aroused and quickened by the Gospel, and brought out of their lethargy, are ready to acknowledge their backslidings with shame; to speak meanly and modestly of themselves, and very highly of Christ and his grace, who has healed their backslidings, and still loves them freely; none more ready to exalt and magnify Christ, and speak in praise of what he has done for them. Some render the words, "causing the lips of ancient men to speak" (x); whose senses are not so quick, nor they so full of talk, as in their youthful days: wherefore this serves to commend this wine; that it should have such an effect as to invigorate ancient men, and give them a juvenile warmth and sprightliness, and make them loquacious, which is one effect of wine, when freely drunk (y); and softens the moroseness of ancient men (z): wine is even said to make an ancient man dance (a). <p>(t) "ad rectitudines", Montanus; "ad ea quae roetissima sunt", Tigurine version.

But <span class="ital">dôbhçbh</span> has no connexion with <span class="ital">dibbâh</span>, but is rather related to <span class="ital">zâbh</span>, and means ‘to go softly,’ hence the translation ‘going softly’ or ‘gliding’ over the lips of sleepers, or of those about to sleep. The whole clause would then mean that this wine was such that men drank it till they were rendered slumberous by it. But this is not very satisfactory, and the suggestion that, following the LXX, Aq., Syr., Vulg., we should read ‘gliding over my lips and teeth,’ or ‘over his lips and teeth,’ might perhaps be adopted.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>3 Thy two breasts are like two fawns,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Twins of a gazelle.<p>Sol 4:5 is repeated, but with the omission of the attribute, "feeding among lilies," since lilies have already been applied to another figure.
