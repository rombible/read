She humbly desires communion with him. Let us walk together, that I may receive counsel, instruction, and comfort from thee; and may make known my wants and my grievances to thee, with freedom, and without interruption. Communion with Christ is what all that are made holy earnestly breathe after. And those who would converse with Christ, must go forth from the world. Wherever we are, we may keep up communion with God. Nor should we go where we cannot in faith ask him to go with us. Those who would go abroad with Christ, must begin early in the morning of their days; must begin every day with him, seek him early, seek him diligently. A gracious soul can reconcile itself to the poorest places, if it may have communion with God in them; but the most delightful fields will not satisfy, unless the Beloved is there. Let us not think to be satisfied with any earthly object. Our own souls are our vineyards; they should be planted with useful trees. We should often search whether we are fruitful in righteousness. Christ's presence will make the vine flourish, and the tender grapes appear, as the returning sun revives the gardens. If we can appeal to him, Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee; if his Spirit witness with our spirit, that our souls prosper, it is enough. And we must beg of him to search and try us, to discover us to ourselves. The fruits and exercises of graces are pleasant to the Lord Jesus. These must be laid up, and always ready; that by our bringing forth much fruit, he may be glorified. It is all from him, therefore it is fit it should be all for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His desire is toward me - All his affection has me for its object.

After a night's lodging in the fields, or among the "Cyprus trees". By which "vineyards" may be meant particular churches, gathered according to Gospel order, and distinguished from the world, planted with fruitful vines, and fenced by almighty power: hither the church proposes to "get up early", very early in the morning; being willing to take the first and most seasonable opportunity of visiting the saints, to know their state and condition; and, that her visit might not be in vain, she is for taking Christ along with her; <p>let us see if the vine flourish; true believers in Christ; who, though weak and worthless in themselves, yet being ingrafted in Christ, the true vine, bring forth fruit, and become flourishing in grace and good works; of the flourishing or flowering of the vine; see Gill on Sol 2:13; <p>whether the tender grape appear; or when "the flower of the vine opens" (e), and goes off, and the small grape appears: by which young converts may be meant, who are tender, and have but a small degree of faith and knowledge; and yet these are not overlooked, much less despised, by Christ and his church, but are delighted with the promising appearance they make; <p>and the pomegranates bud forth; stronger believers, taller and more fruitful than the former; see Sol 4:13; the actings and exercise of whose grace are signified by "budding forth", in an open and visible manner: the church is concerned for the good and welfare of the saints of all ranks and sizes; of vines and pomegranates, as well as tender grapes; and of the budding of the one, as well as of the opening and flowering of the other. And seeing these ends proposed by her are the same with Christ's, Sol 6:11; she might conclude they would prevail upon him to go with her, particularly what follows: <p>there will I give thee my loves; in the fields, villages, and vineyards, when alone, and observing the state and condition of particular churches and saints; and having communion with Christ, the church might hope and expect to have her heart enlarged, and drawn forth in love to Christ more abundantly; and that she should be able to manifest it more largely to him, and give clearer and fuller proofs of it: and this she observes in order to gain her point, and get him to go along with her; knowing that her love, in the actings and exercise of it, was very acceptable to him, Sol 4:10; I see not why the word for "loves" may not be rendered "my lovely flowers"; as a word nearly the same, in Sol 7:13, is by some rendered, "these lovely flowers give a good smell", which seems to refer to the flowers here; such as were to be met with in plenty, in fields and vineyards, among vines and pomegranates, as lilies, violets, &amp;c. and may be an allusion to lovers, who used to give to those they loved sweet smelling flowers (f); and here may signify the graces of the Spirit, and the actings of them, which are fragrant, and acceptable to Christ. <p>(e)  "num si, vel gemmas suas aperuerit flos vitis", Michaelis; to the same sense Pagninus, Montanus, Tigurine version, Junius &amp; Tremellius.

There is nothing more admirable than love, i.e., the uniting or mingling together of two lives, the one of which gives itself to the other, and so finds the complement of itself; nor than this self-devotion, which is at the same time self-enrichment. All this is true of earthly love, of which Walther v. d. Vogelweide says: "minne ist sweier herzen wnne" love is the joy of two hearts, and it is true also of heavenly love; the former surpasses all earthly delights (also such as are purely sensuous, <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>), and the latter is, as the apostle expresses himself in his spiritual "Song of Songs," <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>, in relation to faith and hope, "greater than these," greater than both of them, for it is their sacred, eternal aim. In &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1514; it is indicated that the idea, and in &#1504;&#1506;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468; that the eudaemonistic feature of the human soul attains its satisfaction in love. The lxx, obliterating this so true and beautiful a promotion of love above all other joys, translate &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (in the enjoyment which thou impartest). The Syr., Jerome, and others also rob the Song of this its point of light and of elevation, by reading &#1488;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; O beloved! instead of &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1492;. The words then declare (yet contrary to the spirit of the Hebrew language, which knows neither &#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; nor &#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; as vocat.) what we already read at Sol 4:10; while, according to the traditional form of the text, they are the prelude of the love-song, to love as such, which is continued in Sol 8:6. </body></html>
