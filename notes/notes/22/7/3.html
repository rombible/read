Such honour have all his saints; and having put on Christ, they are distinguished by their beautiful and glorious apparel. They adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Consistent believers honour Christ, recommend the gospel, and convince and awaken sinners. The church resembles the stately and spreading palm; while her love for Christ, and the obedience resulting therefrom, are precious fruit of the true Vine. The King is held in the galleries. Christ takes delight in the assemblies and ordinances of his people; and admires the fruit of his grace in them. When applied to the church and to each faithful Christian, all this denotes that beauty of holiness, in which they shall be presented to their heavenly Bridegroom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or, Thy lap is like a moon-shaped bowl where mixed wine faileth not." The wine in the bowl rising to the brim adds to the beauty of the vessel, and gives a more pleasing image to the eye.

There, it refers to her who was brought to the king; here, it refers to her who moves in that which is his as her own. There, the "this" is followed by &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; appositionally; here, by &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; looking forth determ., and thus more closely connected with it; but then indeterm., and thus apposit. predicates follow. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1507; signifies to bend forward, to overhang; whence the Hiph. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497;&#1507; and Niph. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1507;, to look out, since in doing so one bends forward (vid., under <a href="/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2</a>). The lxx here translates it by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;, the Venet. by &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;, both of which signify to look toward something with the head inclined forward. The point of comparison is, the rising up from the background: Shulamith breaks through the shades of the garden-grove like the morning-red, the morning dawn; or, also: she comes nearer and nearer, as the morning-red rises behind the mountains, and then fills always the more widely the whole horizon. The Venet. translates &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; but the morning star is not &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;, but &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;, <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>; shahhar, properly, the morning-dawn, means, in Heb., not only this, like the Arab. shah&#803;ar, but rather, like the Arab. fajr, the morning-red, - i.e., the red tinge of the morning mist. From the morning-red the description proceeds to the moon, yet visible in the morning sky, before the sun has risen. It is usually called &#1497;&#1512;&#1495;, as being yellow; but here it is called &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;, as being white; as also the sun, which here is spoken of as having risen (<a href="/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>), is designated not by the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;, as the unwearied (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-6.htm">Psalm 19:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/19-6.htm">Psalm 19:6</a>), but, on account of the intensity of its warming light (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>), is called &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;. These, in the language of poetry, are favourite names of the moon and the sun, because already the primitive meaning of the two other names had disappeared from common use; but with these, definite attributive ideas are immediately connected. Shulamith appears like the morning-red, which breaks through the darkness; beautiful, like the silver moon, which in soft still majesty shines in the heavens (<a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>); pure (vid., regarding &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; in this signification: smooth, bright, pure under Isa.Isa 49:2) as the sun, whose light (cf. &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512; with the Aram. &#1502;&#1497;&#1492;&#1512;&#1488;, mid-day brightness) is the purest of the pure, imposing as war-hosts with their standards (vid., Sol 6:4).
