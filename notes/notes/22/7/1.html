Some understand this of some ornaments worn by women upon those parts; for the word rendered <span class="ital">joints</span> may signify <span class="ital">girdles</span>, or any ornament which encompasseth any part of the body, and the same words which signify <span class="ital">thighs</span> are both in Hebrew and other languages sometimes used concerning the <span class="ital">legs</span>; which being admitted, this might seem to be understood of the bride’s garters, about her legs, which not unfitly follows the shoes upon her feet last mentioned.

So this signifies the uprightness and decency of her going, which depends very much upon the right situation of the hip or thigh-bone, which when it is dislocated or disordered causeth a lameness or uncomeliness in going; whereby he understands the orderliness and amiableness of her conversation. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/songs/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>How beautiful are thy feet with shoes,.... It is no unusual thing to describe the comeliness of women by their feet, and the ornaments of them; so Hebe is described by Homer (d) as having beautiful feet, and Juno by her golden shoes: particular care was taken of, and provision made for, the shoes of queens and princesses in the eastern countries; Herodotus (e) tells us, that the city of Anthylla was given peculiarly to the wife of the king of Egypt, to provide her with shoes; which custom, he says, obtained when Egypt became subject to Persia; See Gill on <a href="/esther/2-18.htm">Esther 2:18</a>. Shoes of a red, or scarlet, or purple colour, were in esteem with the Jews; and so the Targum here is, <p>"purple shoes:'' <p>the word used is thought by some (f) to signify a colour between scarlet and purple; see <a href="/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a>; and also with the Tyrian virgins (g); and so with the Romans (h); and with whom likewise white shoes (i) were much in use. That this is said of the church, is plain from the appellation of her, <p>O Prince's daughter! the same with the King's daughter, <a href="/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13</a>; the daughter of the King of kings; for, being espoused to Christ, his Father is her Father, and his God her God: besides, she is born of him who is the Prince of the kings of the earth, <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>; she is both a Prince's wife and a Prince's daughter. It may be rendered, "O noble", or "princely daughter" (k)! being of a free princely spirit, in opposition to a servile one, <a href="/psalms/51-12.htm">Psalm 51:12</a>; of a bountiful and liberal spirit, as in, <a href="/isaiah/32-5.htm">Isaiah 32:5</a>; in distributing temporal things to the necessities of the poor; and in communicating spiritual things to the comfort and edification of others. Some take these to be the words of the daughters of Jerusalem, wondering at the church's beauty, on turning herself to them as they desired: but they are rather the words of Christ; who, observing the church speak so meanly of herself, in order to encourage her, gives a high commendation of her in this and some following verses, and begins with her "feet"; not her ministers, who are "shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace", <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/6-15.htm">Ephesians 6:15</a>, and who appear beautiful in the eyes of those who have any knowledge of the good things they publish and proclaim; for they are set in the highest place in the church: but here the lowest and meanest members of the church are meant; whose outward walk, the feet are the instruments of, may be said to be "beautiful with shoes", when they are ready to every good work; when their conversation is ordered aright, is agreeably to the word of God, and as becomes the Gospel of Christ; and which, like shoes, is a fence against the briers and thorns, the reproaches and calumnies, of the world; and when there is such a lustre upon it that it cannot but be seen and observed by spectators, by which they are excited to glorify God, it is so beautiful in the eyes of Christ, that to such he shows the salvation of God; <p>the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman; a skilful artificer, a goldsmith or jeweller: the allusion seems to be to some ornaments about the knees or legs, wore by women in those times; see <a href="/isaiah/3-18.htm">Isaiah 3:18</a>; and this may serve to set off the lustre and beauty of the church's conversation. And since it seems not so decent to describe the parts themselves mentioned, the words may rather design the "femoralia", or garments, with which they were covered; and may signify the garments of salvations and robe of Christ's righteousness, whereby the church's members are covered, so that their nakedness is not seen; but with them are as richly adorned bridegroom and bride with their ornaments and which are not the bungling work of a creature, but of one that is God as well as man, and therefore called the righteousness of God. Some have thought that the girdle about the loins is meant, the thighs being put for the loins, <a href="/genesis/46-26.htm">Genesis 46:26</a>; and so may intend the girdle of truth, mentioned along with the preparation of the Gospel of peace the feet are said to be shod with, <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>; and the metaphor of girding is used when a Gospel conversation is directed to, <a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35</a>. But it seems best by these "joints", or "turnings of the thighs" (l), by which they move more orderly and regularly, to understand the principles of the walk and conversation of saints, as one observes (m); without which it cannot be ordered aright; for principles denominate actions, good and bad; and the principles of grace, by which believers move in their Christian walk, are as valuable and as precious as jewels, such as faith and love, and a regard to the glory of God; and which are curiously wrought by the finger of God, by his Holy Spirit, who "works in them both to will and to do of his good pleasure", <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>. <p>(d) Odyss. 11. v. 602, 603.

Budde emphasises the fact that the feet are not spoken of here, but the steps, i.e. in his view the dancing movements of the feet in the sword dance. Oettli on the other hand emphasises the shoes, pointing out that the country maiden had probably not worn them before, but the ladies say how well she walks, and how well they become her. The latter is the sense which accords best with the view of the poem which we have taken.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">O prince’s daughter</span>] This does not mean that the bride was actually of a noble family. Even if Budde’s interpretation of the poem were accepted, it would be a strange thing to call the bride a nobleman’s daughter, for it would be ridiculous to call a peasant bride, who was a queen only as a bride, a prince’s daughter, and even if Abishag were referred to she was not that either. Nor can the phrase be a substitute for queen, for strictly speaking Solomon’s queens were not noblemen’s but kings’ daughters. On the dramatic view, <span class="ital">bath nâdhîbh</span> must mean ‘a born lady’ as we say, i.e. one who would adorn any station. Siegfried thinks that the words arise from a confusion with the Shunammite woman in <a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm" title="And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread.

The Praises of the Ladies of the Hareem<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This song or section contains the praises of the Shulammite by the ladies of the hareem; but the circumstances under which the words are spoken are in no way indicated. Some, as Oettli, would make it part of the previous scene. But we can hardly suppose that her dress in the presence of Solomon would be such as to suggest the kind of references to her person here made. It would rather seem to us that they were made in the privacy of the women’s apartments, when the Shulammite was being dressed by the women of the court to receive Solomon. In that case it would stand by itself as a separate picture. The object of this fulsome flattery would be to induce her to accept the king’s addresses. The phrase ‘a king is prisoner in its locks’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/songs/7-5.htm" title="Your head on you is like Carmel, and the hair of your head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.">Song of Solomon 7:5</a></span>) is the climax, and reveals the purpose of the whole.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</span> To the ladies who are looking on the bride appears simply noble and royal. The word <span class="accented">naudhib</span> which is used, translated "prince's daughter," means "noble in disposition," and so in birth and rank, as in <a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/113-8.htm">Psalm 113:8</a>; so in <a href="/songs/6-12.htm">Song of Solomon 6:12</a>, "the princely people." The description, which is perfectly chaste, is intended to bring before the eye the lithe and beautiful movements of an elegant dancer; the bendings of the body, full of activity and grace, are compared to the swinging to and fro of jewelled ornaments made in chains. The cunning workman or artist is one who is master of that which abides beautiful. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, like, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, "whose truthful work can be trusted." The description passes from the thighs or loins to the middle part of the body, because in the mode of dancing prevailing in the East the breast and the body, are raised, and the outlines of the form appear through the clothing, which is of a light texture. We must not expect to find a symbolical meaning for all the details of such a description. The general intention is to set forth the beauty and glory of the bride. The Church of Christ is most delightful in his sight when it is most full of activity and life, and every portion of it is called forth into manifest excellence. "<span class="accented">Arise</span>, <span class="accented">shine</span>," is the invitation addressed to the whole Church, "shake thyself from the dust," "put on thy beautiful garments," be ready for thy Lord. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>8 There are sixty queens,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And eighty concubines,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And virgins without number.<p>9 One is my dove, my perfect one, - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The only one of her mother,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice one of her that bare her.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The daughters saw her and called her blessed, - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Queens and concubines, and they extolled her.<p>Even here, where, if anywhere, notice of the difference of gender was to be expected, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; stands instead of the more accurate &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (e.g., <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>). The number off the women of Solomon's court, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>, is far greater (700 wives and 300 concubines); and those who deny the Solomonic authorship of the Song regard the poet, in this particular, as more historical than the historian. On our part, holding as we do the Solomonic authorship of the book, we conclude from these low numbers that the Song celebrates a love-relation of Solomon's at the commencement of his reign: his luxury had not then reached the enormous height to which he, the same Solomon, looks back, and which he designates, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>, as vanitas vanitatum. At any rate, the number of 60 &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., legitimate wives of equal rank with himself, is yet high enough; for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>, Rehoboam had 18 wives and 60 concubines. The 60 occurred before, at Sol 3:7. If it be a round number, as sometimes, although rarely, sexaginta is thus used (Hitzig), it may be reduced only to 51, but not further, especially here, where 80 stands along with it. &#1508;&#1497;&#1500;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;), Gr. &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769; (Lat. pellex), which in the form &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1511;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; (&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1511;&#1514;&#1488;) came back from the Greek to the Aramaic, is a word as yet unexplained. According to the formation, it may be compared to &#1495;&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;, from &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;, to cut off; whence also the harem bears the (Arab.) name h&#803;aram, or the separated synaeconitis, to which access is denied. And ending in is (&#1513;) is known to the Assyr., but only as an adverbial ending, which, as 'istinis  equals  &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;, alone, solus, shows is connected with the pron. su. These two nouns appear as thus requiring to be referred to quadrilitera, with the annexed &#1513;&#1473;; perhaps &#1508;&#1500;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;, in the sense of to break into splinters, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;, to divide (whence a brook, as dividing itself in its channels, has the name of &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;), points to the polygamous relation as a breaking up of the marriage of one; so that a concubine has the name pille&#780;ge&#780;sh, as a representant of polygamy in contrast to monogamy.<p>In the first line of Sol 6:9 &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; is subj. (one, who is my dove, my perfect one); in the second line, on the contrary, it is pred. (one, unica, is she of her mother). That Shulamith was her mother's only child does not, however, follow from this; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;, unica, is equivalent to unice dilecta, as &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3</a>, is equivalent to unice dilectus (cf. Keil's <a href="/zechariah/14-7.htm">Zechariah 14:7</a>). The parall. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; has its nearest signification electa (lxx, Syr., Jerome), not pura (Venet.); the fundamental idea of cutting and separating divides itself into the ideas of choosing and purifying. The Aorists, Sol 6:9, are the only ones in this book; they denote that Shulamith's look had, on the part of the women, this immediate result, that they willingly assigned to her the good fortune of being preferred to them all, - that to her the prize was due. The words, as also at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28</a>, are an echo of <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-13.htm">Genesis 30:13</a>, - the books of the Chokma delight in references to Genesis, the book of pre-Israelitish origin. Here, in Sol 6:8, Sol 6:9, the distinction between our typical and the allegorical interpretation is correctly seen. The latter is bound to explain what the 60 and the 80 mean, and how the wives, concubines, and "virgins" of the harem are to be distinguished from each other; but what till now has been attempted in this matter has, by reason of its very absurdity or folly, become an easy subject of wanton mockery. But the typical interpretation regards the 60 and the 80, and the unreckoned number, as what their names denote, - viz. favourites, concubines, and serving-maids. But to see an allegory of heavenly things in such a herd of women - a kind of thing which the Book of Genesis dates from the degradation of marriage in the line of Cain - is a profanation of that which is holy. The fact is, that by a violation of the law of God (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>), Solomon brings a cloud over the typical representation, which is not at all to be thought of in connection with the Antitype. Solomon, as Jul Sturm rightly remarks, is not to be considered by himself, but only in his relation to Shulamith. In Christ, on the contrary, is no imperfection; sin remains in the congregation. In the Song, the bride is purer than the bridegroom; but in the fulfilling of the Song this relation is reversed: the bridegroom is purer than the bride. </body></html>
