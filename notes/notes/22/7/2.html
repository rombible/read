Such honour have all his saints; and having put on Christ, they are distinguished by their beautiful and glorious apparel. They adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Consistent believers honour Christ, recommend the gospel, and convince and awaken sinners. The church resembles the stately and spreading palm; while her love for Christ, and the obedience resulting therefrom, are precious fruit of the true Vine. The King is held in the galleries. Christ takes delight in the assemblies and ordinances of his people; and admires the fruit of his grace in them.

The "shoes" (So 7:1) prove that dress is throughout presupposed on all parts where it is usually worn. She is "a bride adorned for her husband"; the "uncomely parts," being most adorned (1Co 12:23). The girdle-clasp was adorned with red rubies resembling the "round goblet" (crater or mixer) of spice-mixed wine (not "liquor," So 8:2; Isa 5:22).

For the navel is the proper instrument of nourishing the child or children which are in the womb. And so this seems to signify the church’s fruitfulness, partly in herself, in cherishing and improving all the graces and good motions of God’s Spirit within her; and principally in reference to those many children which she bears and feeds in her womb with the wholesome liquor of God’s ordinances. Thy belly, in which thy children are for a time contained and fed, is like a heap of wheat, i.e. of wheat corn, round and swelling, as it is in women with child, and full of nourishment, not only of liquor, as was last said, but also of meat, which may note the various provisions which Christ hath laid up in his church according to the several capacities of her children, milk for babes, and stronger meat for those who are grown up. Set about with lilies; not for defence, which the church doth not need, having the strong God for her Protector, but for ornament and beauty; whereby is implied that she is not only fruitful, but beautiful, and that her children are not only numerous and well fed, but also comely and delightful to the eye, as lilies are, and withal pure and innocent, in which respect both Christ and the church are compared to lilies, <span class="bld"><a href="/songs/2-1.htm" title="I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.">Song of Solomon 2:1</a>,2</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/songs/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thy navel is like a round goblet,.... According to some, not the navel itself is meant; but a covering of it, a jewel or plate of gold in the shape of it; and because the word for "round", in the Chaldee language, signifies the "moon", and so Ben Melech interprets it, some have thought of the "round tire like the moon", <a href="/isaiah/3-18.htm">Isaiah 3:18</a>; though that was rather an ornament about the neck. Bishop Patrick is of opinion that it refers to "the clothing of wrought gold", <a href="/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13</a>; which had, on the part that covered the belly, a raised embossed work, resembling a heap or sheaves of wheat; about which was an embroidery of curious flowers, particularly lilies; and, in the midst of the whole, a fountain or conduit, running with several sorts of liquor, into a great bowl or basin: and Fortunatus Scacchus (n) interprets it of a garment, covering this part, embroidered with lilies. All which may represent the beautiful robe of Christ's righteousness the church is adorned with. But rather the part itself is meant, and designs the ministers of the Gospel; who, in the administration of the word and ordinances, are that to the church as the navel is to a human body; that is in an eminent part of it, is the strength of the intestines, conduces much to the health of the body, and by which the child in the womb is supposed to receive its nourishment: ministers are set in the highest place in the church; are strong in themselves, through the grace and power of Christ and the means of strengthening others; and of keeping the church a good plight and healthful state, by the wholesome words and sound doctrines they preach; and also of nourishing souls in embryo, and when new born, with the sincere milk of the word: and as the navel is said to be like a "round goblet", cup, bowl, or basin, this aptly describes that part; and may express the perfection of Gospel ministers, their gifts and grace, not in an absolute, but comparative sense, the round or circular form being reckoned the most perfect; and also the workmanship bestowed on them, the gifts and grace of the Spirit, a round goblet being turned and formed by some curious artist; and likewise their capacity to hold and retain Gospel truths. And they are compared, not to an empty one, but to one <p>which wanteth not liquor; meaning the large and never failing supplies of gifts and grace from Christ; so that they never want the liquor, the oil and wine of Gospel truths, to communicate to others, <a href="/zechariah/4-12.htm">Zechariah 4:12</a>. The word used signifies a "mixture", or a "mixed liquor" (o), as of wine and milk, Sol 5:1; or rather of wine and water, much used in the eastern countries; so the wine of Sharon used to be mixed, two parts water and one wine (p): and this designs, not a mixture of divine truths and human doctrines, which ought not to be made; but the variety of Gospel truths ministers deliver to others, and that in a manner they are most capable of receiving them. Some (q) render the words as a wish, "let there not want", &amp;c. and so they declare the tender concern of Christ, that his church might have a continual supply in the ministry of the word; <p>thy belly is like a heap of wheat; which denotes the fruitfulness of the church in bringing souls to Christ, comparable to a pregnant woman; and whose fruit, young converts born in her, are compared to "a heap of wheat" for their number, choiceness, and solidity, being able to bear the fan of persecution: it was usual with the Jews to scatter wheat on the heads of married persons at their weddings, three times, saying, "increase and multiply" (r); see <a href="/isaiah/66-8.htm">Isaiah 66:8</a>. This heap of wheat is said to be "set about", or "hedged, with lilies" (s); which suggests, that it was not a heap of wheat on the corn floor which is meant, but a field of standing wheat, enclosed and fenced, not with thorns, but lilies; and these lilies may signify grown saints, who are often compared to lilies in this book, by whom young converts are encompassed and defended; or the beauties of holiness, in which they appear as soon as born again, <a href="/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>. <p>(n) Eleochrysm.

The soft curves of such a heap may also be referred to. The lilies may possibly indicate some part of the dress, but most probably belong to the simile only. Heaps of corn are still decorated with flowers on festal occasions, and the contrast of the scarlet lilies or anemones would bring out the colour of the grain.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy navel is like a round goblet, wherein no mingled wine is wanting: thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.</span> It must be remembered that ladies are speaking of one who is in the ladies' apartment. There is nothing indelicate in the description, though it is scarcely Western. The "round goblet," or basin, with mixed wine, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wine with water or snow mixed with it, is intended to convey the idea of the shape of the lovely body with its flesh colour appearing through the semitransparent clothing, and moving gracefully like the diluted wine in the glass goblet. The navel is referred to simply as the center  of the body, which it is in infants, and nearly so in adults. Perhaps Delitzsch is right in thinking that there may be an attempt to describe the navel itself as like the whirling hollow of water in a basin. In the latter part of the verse the shape of the body is undoubtedly intended. "To the present day winnowed and sifted corn is piled up in great heaps of symmetrical, half-spherical form, which are then frequently stuck over with things that move in the wind, for the purpose of protecting them against birds. The appearance of such heaps of wheat," says Wetstein, "which one may see in long parallel rows on the threshing floors of a village, is very pleasing to a peasant; and the comparison of the song every Arabian will regard as beautiful." According to the Moslem Sunnas, the colour of wheat was that of Adam. The white is a subdued white, denoting both perfect spotlessness and the purity of health. The smooth, round, fair body of the maiden is seen to advantage in the varied movements of the dance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>8 There are sixty queens,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And eighty concubines,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And virgins without number.<p>9 One is my dove, my perfect one, - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The only one of her mother,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice one of her that bare her.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The daughters saw her and called her blessed, - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Queens and concubines, and they extolled her.<p>Even here, where, if anywhere, notice of the difference of gender was to be expected, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; stands instead of the more accurate &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (e.g., <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>). The number off the women of Solomon's court, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>, is far greater (700 wives and 300 concubines); and those who deny the Solomonic authorship of the Song regard the poet, in this particular, as more historical than the historian. On our part, holding as we do the Solomonic authorship of the book, we conclude from these low numbers that the Song celebrates a love-relation of Solomon's at the commencement of his reign: his luxury had not then reached the enormous height to which he, the same Solomon, looks back, and which he designates, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>, as vanitas vanitatum. At any rate, the number of 60 &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., legitimate wives of equal rank with himself, is yet high enough; for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>, Rehoboam had 18 wives and 60 concubines. The 60 occurred before, at Sol 3:7. If it be a round number, as sometimes, although rarely, sexaginta is thus used (Hitzig), it may be reduced only to 51, but not further, especially here, where 80 stands along with it. &#1508;&#1497;&#1500;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;), Gr. &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769; (Lat. pellex), which in the form &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1511;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; (&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1511;&#1514;&#1488;) came back from the Greek to the Aramaic, is a word as yet unexplained. According to the formation, it may be compared to &#1495;&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;, from &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;, to cut off; whence also the harem bears the (Arab.) name h&#803;aram, or the separated synaeconitis, to which access is denied. And ending in is (&#1513;) is known to the Assyr., but only as an adverbial ending, which, as 'istinis  equals  &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;, alone, solus, shows is connected with the pron. su. These two nouns appear as thus requiring to be referred to quadrilitera, with the annexed &#1513;&#1473;; perhaps &#1508;&#1500;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;, in the sense of to break into splinters, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;, to divide (whence a brook, as dividing itself in its channels, has the name of &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;), points to the polygamous relation as a breaking up of the marriage of one; so that a concubine has the name pille&#780;ge&#780;sh, as a representant of polygamy in contrast to monogamy.<p>In the first line of Sol 6:9 &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; is subj. (one, who is my dove, my perfect one); in the second line, on the contrary, it is pred. (one, unica, is she of her mother). That Shulamith was her mother's only child does not, however, follow from this; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;, unica, is equivalent to unice dilecta, as &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1491;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3</a>, is equivalent to unice dilectus (cf. Keil's <a href="/zechariah/14-7.htm">Zechariah 14:7</a>). The parall. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; has its nearest signification electa (lxx, Syr., Jerome), not pura (Venet.); the fundamental idea of cutting and separating divides itself into the ideas of choosing and purifying. The Aorists, Sol 6:9, are the only ones in this book; they denote that Shulamith's look had, on the part of the women, this immediate result, that they willingly assigned to her the good fortune of being preferred to them all, - that to her the prize was due. The words, as also at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28</a>, are an echo of <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-13.htm">Genesis 30:13</a>, - the books of the Chokma delight in references to Genesis, the book of pre-Israelitish origin. Here, in Sol 6:8, Sol 6:9, the distinction between our typical and the allegorical interpretation is correctly seen. The latter is bound to explain what the 60 and the 80 mean, and how the wives, concubines, and "virgins" of the harem are to be distinguished from each other; but what till now has been attempted in this matter has, by reason of its very absurdity or folly, become an easy subject of wanton mockery. But the typical interpretation regards the 60 and the 80, and the unreckoned number, as what their names denote, - viz. favourites, concubines, and serving-maids. But to see an allegory of heavenly things in such a herd of women - a kind of thing which the Book of Genesis dates from the degradation of marriage in the line of Cain - is a profanation of that which is holy. The fact is, that by a violation of the law of God (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>), Solomon brings a cloud over the typical representation, which is not at all to be thought of in connection with the Antitype. Solomon, as Jul Sturm rightly remarks, is not to be considered by himself, but only in his relation to Shulamith. In Christ, on the contrary, is no imperfection; sin remains in the congregation. In the Song, the bride is purer than the bridegroom; but in the fulfilling of the Song this relation is reversed: the bridegroom is purer than the bride. </body></html>
