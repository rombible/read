The night is a time of coldness, darkness, and drowsiness, and of dim apprehensions concerning spiritual things. At first, when uneasy, some feeble efforts are made to obtain the comfort of communion with Christ. This proves in vain; the believer is then roused to increased diligence. The streets and broad-ways seem to imply the means of grace in which the Lord is to be sought. Application is made to those who watch for men's souls. Immediate satisfaction is not found. We must not rest in any means, but by faith apply directly to Christ. The holding of Christ, and not letting him go, denotes earnest cleaving to him. What prevails is a humble, ardent suing by prayer, with a lively exercise of faith on his promises. So long as the faith of believers keeps hold of Christ, he will not be offended at their earnest asking, yea, he is well pleased with it. The believer desires to make others acquainted with his Saviour. Wherever we find Christ, we must take him home with us to our houses, especially to our hearts; and we should call upon ourselves and each other, to beware of grieving our holy Comforter, and provoking the departure of the Beloved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The city - One near the bride's native home, possibly Shunem. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/songs/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. watchmen&#8212;ministers (Isa 62:6; Jer 6:17; Eze 3:17; Heb 13:17), fit persons to consult (Isa 21:11; Mal 2:7).<p>found me&#8212;the general ministry of the Word "finds" individually souls in quest of Jesus Christ (Ge 24:27, end of verse Ac 16:14); whereas formalists remain unaffected.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/songs/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The watchmen; </span> the ministers of Christ, and rulers of the church, who are oft called watchmen, as <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm" title="I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: you that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,">Isaiah 62:6</a> <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm" title="Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.">Ezekiel 3:17</a></span>, and elsewhere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That go about the city, </span> to prevent disorders and dangers by night. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Found me, </span> whilst they walked round about the city, according to their duty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To whom I said, </span> without either fear or shame, as being transported and wholly swallowed up with love, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?</span> she doth not name him, because she thought it needless, as supposing that a person of such transcendent excellency could not be unknown to men in that public capacity.

By whom are meant the ministers of the Gospel; who are called watchmen, as the prophets were under the Old Testament, <a href="/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>; in allusion to watchmen in cities; and are so called in regard to themselves, it being their duty to watch over themselves; and to their doctrine, and all opportunities to preach it, and the success of it: their business with respect to others is to give the time of night; to point out the state and condition of the church; to give notice of danger to sinners in the broad road to destruction; and to saints, through the prevalence of error, heresy, and immorality; all which require sobriety, vigilance, prudence, courage, and faithfulness; and show the necessity and utility of the Gospel ministry, and the awfulness of it; and the care Christ takes of his churches, in providing such officers in them. These are said to "go about the city", denoting their industry and diligence; and being in the way of their duty, they "found" the church, fell upon her case in their ministry, and hit it exactly; which shows the efficacy of the word under a divine direction; which finds out sinners, and their sins; saints, and their particular cases, unknown to ministers; and the church, having met with something suitable to her case under their ministry, <p>to whom I said, took an opportunity privately to discourse with them, and put this question to them, <p>Saw ye him whom my soul loveth? meaning Christ; who was still the object of her love, and uppermost in her thoughts; whom she thus describes, without mentioning his name, as if he was the only "Him" in the world worthy of any regard; which shows how much he was in her mind, how much the desires and affections of her soul were towards him, and that these ministers needed no other description of him. No answer is returned to her question that is recorded; not because they were not able to give one, nor because they did not; and if they did not, it might be owing to her haste, not waiting for one; and if they did, she not being able to apply it to her case, no notice is taken of it: however, though she did not find immediate relief by them, yet she met with something from them that was of use to her afterwards, as appears by what follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/songs/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> watchmen that go about the city found me: <i>to whom I said</i>, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?</span><p>(c) Which declares that we must seek to all of whom we hope to have any help.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/songs/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">The watchmen</span>] For the practice of having watchmen in cities, cp. <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm" title="Except the LORD build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman wakes but in vain.">Psalm 127:1</a>, “Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.” Grätz supposes that the mention of watchmen favours his very late date for the book. But probably this very obvious precaution was taken in Palestine from the earliest times, and in any case the passage quoted above shews that it was an established custom comparatively early. Cp. also <a href="/isaiah/21-11.htm" title="The burden of Dumah. He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?">Isaiah 21:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Saw ye</span>, &c.] The A.V. rightly inserts <span class="ital">to whom I said</span>, but in the Heb. her dream-question is introduced with the same vivid abruptness as her previous utterance, <span class="ital">Come let me arise</span>, and without any interrogative particle. She also, as we all do in dreams, takes it for granted that all men know what the object of her preoccupation is. It would however be possible to translate <span class="ital">ye have seen</span> in the sense <span class="ital">ye must have seen</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The watchmen that go about the city found me:</span> (to whom I said) <span class="cmt_word">Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?</span> The simplicity of these words is very striking. They confirm the view that the bride is recalling what occurred in her country life. The watchmen make no reply, and do not treat her ill, as in the dream related in <a href="/songs/5-7.htm">Song of Solomon 5:7</a>, where they are keepers of the walls, and smite her and wound her. In a small country town she might have been recognized, or known to be really in trouble. But such incidents must not be pressed too much in a poem. The allegorical view finds considerable support in the fact that it is difficult on any hypothesis exactly to explain the language as descriptive of real occurrences. In such instances as <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a> the reference to watchmen in  the city shows that such a metaphor would be familiarly understood. Whether adopted from Solomon's Song or not, the figure of a city watched and guarded, and the people of God as watching for the glory of Zion, was common in the prophetic writings. The soul seeking for its object and for the restoration of its peace calls in the aid of the faithful guardians of the holy city, the friends alike of the Saviour and of those who desire to be his. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Solomon further relates how he drew her to himself out of her retirement:<p>My dove in the clefts of the rock,<p>In the hiding-place of the cliff;<p>Let me see thy countenance,<p>Let me hear thy voice!<p>For thy voice is sweet and thy countenance comely.<p>"Dove" (for which Castellio, columbula, like vulticulum, voculam) is a name of endearment which Shulamith shares with the church of God, <a href="/psalms/74-19.htm">Psalm 74:19</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1</a>; <a href="/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>. The wood-pigeon builds its nest in the clefts of the rocks and other steep rocky places, <a href="/jeremiah/48-28.htm">Jeremiah 48:28</a>.<p>(Note: Wetstein's Reisebericht, p. 182: "If the Syrian wood-pigeon does not find a pigeon-tower, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, it builds its nest in the hollows of rocky precipices, or in the walls of deep and wide fountains." See also his Nord-arabien, p. 58: "A number of scarcely accessible mountains in Arabia are called alkunnat, a rock-nest.")<p>That Shulamith is thus here named, shows that, far removed from intercourse with the world, her home was among the mountains. &#1495;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;, from &#1495;&#1490;&#1493;, or also &#1495;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;, requires a verb &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;  equals  (Arab.) khajja, findere. (&#1505;&#1500;, as a Himyar. lexicographer defines it, is a cleft into the mountains after the nature of a defile; with &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, only the ideas of inaccessibility and remoteness are connected; with &#1505;&#1500;&#1506;, those of a secure hiding-place, and, indeed, a convenient, pleasant residence. &#1502;&#1491;&#1512;&#1490;&#1492; is the stairs; here the rocky stairs, as the two chalk-cliffs on the Rgen, which sink perpendicularly to the sea, are called "Stubbenkammer," a corruption of the Slavonic Stupnhkamen, i.e., the Stair-Rock. "Let me see," said he, as he called upon her with enticing words, "thy countenance;" and adds this as a reason, "for thy countenance is lovely." The word &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1498;, thus pointed, is sing.; the Jod Otians is the third root letter of &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;, retained only for the sake of the eye. It is incorrect to conclude from ashre&#772;ch, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:17</a>, that the ech may be also the plur. suff., which it can as little be as e&#770;hu in <a href="/proverbs/29-18.htm">Proverbs 29:18</a>; in both cases the sing. e&#780;she&#780;r has substituted itself for ashre&#772;. But, inversely, ma&#780;rai&#772;ch cannot be sing.; for the sing. is simply mare&#772;ch. Also ma&#780;ra&#772;v, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a>, is not sing.: the sing. is mare&#772;hu, <a href="/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16</a>; Sol 5:15. On the other hand, the determination of such forms as &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, is difficult: these forms may be sing. as well as plur. In the passage before us, &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; is just such a non-numer. plur. as &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. But while pani&#772;m is an extensive plur., as Bttcher calls it: the countenance, in its extension and the totality of its parts, - mari&#772;m, like maro&#772;th, vision, a stately term, <a href="/exodus/40-2.htm">Exodus 40:2</a> (vid., Deitrich's Abhand. p. 19), is an amplificative plur.: the countenance, on the side of its fulness of beauty and its overpowering impression. </body></html>
