The night is a time of coldness, darkness, and drowsiness, and of dim apprehensions concerning spiritual things. At first, when uneasy, some feeble efforts are made to obtain the comfort of communion with Christ. This proves in vain; the believer is then roused to increased diligence. The streets and broad-ways seem to imply the means of grace in which the Lord is to be sought. Application is made to those who watch for men's souls. Immediate satisfaction is not found. We must not rest in any means, but by faith apply directly to Christ. The holding of Christ, and not letting him go, denotes earnest cleaving to him. What prevails is a humble, ardent suing by prayer, with a lively exercise of faith on his promises. So long as the faith of believers keeps hold of Christ, he will not be offended at their earnest asking, yea, he is well pleased with it. The believer desires to make others acquainted with his Saviour. Wherever we find Christ, we must take him home with us to our houses, especially to our hearts; and we should call upon ourselves and each other, to beware of grieving our holy Comforter, and provoking the departure of the Beloved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By night - i. e., In the night-hours. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/songs/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>So 3:1-11.<p>1.

Four times (So 3:1-4) she calls Jesus Christ, "Him whom my soul loveth," designating Him as absent; language of desire: "He loved me," would be language of present fruition (Re 1:5). In questioning the watchmen (So 3:3), she does not even name Him, so full is her heart of Him. Having found Him at dawn (for throughout He is the morning), she charges the daughters not to abridge by intrusion the period of His stay.

The day being not yet broke, the night of Jewish darkness still on the church, and the shadow of the ceremonial law as yet stretched upon her; and having some knowledge of Christ by types and prophecies, desires more, and seeks it in the use of means: though the words may be taken in a more large sense, and represent the state and condition of the church and of all true believers in any age, and at one time as well as another; who, when their beloved is absent, it is "night" with them; as Christ's presence makes day, his absence makes night; and it was now night with the Church, either of affliction, or of darkness and desertion, and indeed of both. The word is plural, "by nights" (i); one night after another, successively, she sought her beloved; which both expresses the continuance of her state, and her diligence and constancy in seeking Christ. The place where she sought him was "her bed"; not the same as in Sol 1:16; which was both Christ's and hers, and where a different word is used; but this was purely her own: either a bed of affliction, when good men usually seek the Lord, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>, <a href="/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>; or rather of carnal ease and security, in which she continued, and rose not up from it to seek her beloved; which shows the cold, lukewarm, lazy frame she was in, and formal manner in which she sought him, and so succeeded not: however, he was stilt the person "whom her soul loved", cordially and sincerely, though not so fervently as she had done; true love, though it may be abated, cannot be lost; <p>I sought him, but I found him not; because she sought him not aright; not timely, nor fervently and diligently, nor in a proper place; not in her closet, by prayer, reading, and meditation, nor in public ordinances, she afterwards did; but on her bed. <p>(i) , Sept.

A Dream<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Almost all commentators agree that we have here a dream narrated to some persons, in which the Shulammite seems to herself to have sought her lover in the city and failed to find him. Those who take the dramatic view think of it as narrated to the women of the court. Oettli’s view is that the Shulammite expected her lover to return at sunset. He did not come, and so her agitated heart sought him in this dream, which she tells to her companions, adding the refrain already used in <a href="/songs/2-7.htm" title="I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that you stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.">Song of Solomon 2:7</a>, which deprecates the stirring up of love before it arises spontaneously. Ewald, who regards the end of ch. 2 as dealing only with a waking dream, and not a real incident, thinks of this as a narrative of what she remembered to have dreamed during her sad night in the king’s palace. Delitzsch again, who thinks of the lover as Solomon, considers the dream to be one that came to her night after night, when she had become doubtful of the king’s love for her. Budde’s view is one that entirely contradicts his theory that lovers could not meet and have such intercourse as is depicted in the book before marriage. He makes this a strong point in his criticism of the dramatic theory, yet here he says of this section, “The bride speaks. She narrates a dream she had as a girl, for what she narrates can be understood only as a dream. She had so loved her husband for a length of time that she dreamt she was married to him.” Martineau, because of a misunderstanding of the passage and on other insufficient grounds, would strike out the verses altogether. In any case they describe a dream, and of all the suggestions as to the occasion Oettli’s seems the best.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</span> The bride is probably relating a dream. The time referred to is the close of the day on which she had been visited by her lover. She is retired to rest, and dreams that she searches for the beloved object in the neighbouring city (cf. <a href="/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15</a>). It is another way of telling her love. She is always longing for the beloved one. She had been waiting for him, and he came not, and retired to rest with a heart troubled and anxious because her lover did not appear as she expected at the evening hour. The meaning may be "night after night (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>)" (cf. <a href="/songs/3-8.htm">Song of Solomon 3:8</a>), or the plural maybe used poetically for the singular. Ginsburg observes that "by night on my bed" is opposed to midday couch (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/4-5.htm">2 Samuel 4:5</a>), merely to express what came into her thoughts at night in her dreams or as the result of a dream. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the bride intends to represent herself as suffering from self-reproach in having grieved her lover and kept him away from her. In that case the typical meaning would be simple and direct. The soul grieves when it is conscious of estrangement from him whom it loves, and the sense of separation becomes intolerable, impelling to new efforts to deepen the spiritual life. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11 For, lo! the winter is past,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain is over, is gone.<p>12 The flowers appear in the land;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time of song has come,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the voice of the turtle makes itself heard in our land.<p>13 The fig-tree spices her green figs,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the vines stand in bloom, they diffuse fragrance; - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rise up, my love, my fair one, and go forth! <p>The winter is called &#1505;&#1514;&#1493;, perhaps from a verb &#1505;&#1514;&#1492; (of the same root as &#1505;&#1514;&#1512;, &#1505;&#1514;&#1501;, without any example, since &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>, is certainly not derived from a verb &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;), to conceal, to veil, as the time of being overcast with clouds, for in the East winter is the rainy season; (Arab.) shataa&#772; is also used in the sense of rain itself (vid., D. M. Zeitsch. xx. 618); and in the present day in Jerusalem, in the language of the people, no other name is used for rain but shataa&#772; (not metar). The word &#1505;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, which the Ker&#305;&#770; substitutes, only means that one must not read &#1505;&#1514;&#1493;, but &#1505;&#1514;&#1493;, with long a; in the same way &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, humble, from &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, to be bowed down, and &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, a quail, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1492;, to be fat, are formed and written. Rain is here, however, especially mentioned: it is called ge&#780;she&#780;m, from ga&#772;sha&#780;m, to be thick, massy (cf. revi&#772;vi&#772;m, of density). With &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, to pass by, there is interchanged &#1495;&#1500;&#1507;, which, like (Arab.) khalaf, means properly to press on, and then generally to move to another place, and thus to remove from the place hitherto occupied. In &#1500;&#1493; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, with the dat. ethicus, which throws back the action on the subject, the winter rain is thought of as a person who has passed by. &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1503;, with the noun-ending n, is the same as &#1504;&#1497;&#1505;&#1503;, and signifies the flower, as the latter the flower-month, floral; in the use of the word, &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1503; is related to &#1504;&#1509; and &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492;, probably as little flower is to flower. In ha&#780;zza&#772;mi&#772;r the idea of the song of birds (Arab. gharad) appears, and this is not to be given up. The lxx, Aquila, Symm., Targ., Jerome, and the Venet. translate tempus putationis: the time of the pruning of vines, which indeed corresponds to the usus loq. (cf. &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;, to prune the vine, and &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, a pruning-knife), and to similar names, such as &#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; ingathering of fruit, but supplies no reason for her being invited out into the open fields, and is on this account improbable, because the poet further on speaks for the first time of vines. &#1494;&#1502;&#1512; (&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;) is an onomatopoeia, which for the most part denotes song and music; why should &#1494;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512; thus not be able to denote singing, like &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, - but not, at least not in this passage, the singing of men (Hengst.), for they are not silent in winter; but the singing of birds, which is truly a sign of the spring, and as a characteristic feature, is added <p>(Note: It is true that besides in this passage za&#772;ma&#780;r, of the singing of birds, is not demonstrable, the Arab. zamar is only used of the shrill cry of the ostrich, and particularly the female ostrich.)<p>to this lovely picture of spring? Thus there is also suitably added the mention of the turtle-dove, which is a bird of passage (vid., <a href="/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>), and therefore a messenger of spring. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is 3rd:pret.: it makes itself heard.<p>The description of spring is finished by a reference to the fig-tree and the vine, the standing attributes of a prosperous and peaceful homestead, <a href="/1_kings/5-5.htm">1 Kings 5:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-31.htm">2 Kings 18:31</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1490; (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;, and thus named, not from their hardness, but their delicacy) are the little fruits of the fig-tree which now, when the harvest-rains are over, and the spring commences with the equinox of Nisan, already begin to assume a red colour; the verb &#1495;&#1504;&#1496; does not mean "to grow into a bulb," as Bttch. imagines; it has only the two meanings, condire (condiri, post-bibl. syn. of &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;) and rubescere. From its colour, wheat has the name &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1504;&#1496;&#1492;; and here also the idea of colour has the preference, for becoming fragrant does not occur in spring-in the history of the cursing of the fig-tree at the time of the Passover, Mark (<a href="/mark/11-13.htm">Mark 11:13</a>) says, "for the time of figs was not yet." In fig-trees, by this time the green of the fruit-formation changes its colour, and the vines are &#1505;&#1502;&#1491;&#1512;, blossom, i.e., are in a state of bloom (lxx &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; cf. Sol 7:13, &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;) - it is a clause such as <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31</a>, and to which "they diffuse fragrance" (Sol 2:13) is parallel. This word &#1505;&#1502;&#1491;&#1512; is usually regarded as a compound word, consisting of &#1505;&#1501;, scent, and &#1505;&#1502;&#1491;&#1512;, brightness  equals  blossom (vid., Gesen. Thes.); it is undeniable that there are such compound formations, e.g., &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1503;; &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, from (Arab.) h&#803;ams, to be hard, and hals, to be dark-brown.<p>(Note: In like manner as (Arab.) karbsh, corrugare, is formed of karb, to string, and karsh, to wrinkle, combined; and another extension of karsh is kurnash, wrinkles, and mukarnash, wrinkled. "One day," said Wetstein to me, "I asked an Arab the origin of the word karnasa, to wrinkle, and he replied that it was derived from a sheep's stomach that had lain over night, i.e., the stomach of a slaughtered sheep that had lain over night, by which its smooth surface shrinks together and becomes wrinkled. In fact, we say of a wrinkled countenance that it is mathal alkarash albayt." With right Wetstein gathers from this curious fact how difficult it is to ascertain by purely etymological considerations the view which guided the Semites in this or that designation. Samdor is also a strange word; on the one side it is connected with sadr, of the veiling of the eyes, as the effect of terror; and on the other with samd, of stretching oneself straight out. E. Meier takes &#1505;&#1502;&#1491;&#1512; as the name of the vine-blossom, as changed from &#1505;&#1502;&#1505;&#1512;, bristling. Just as unlikely as that &#1505;&#1502;&#1491; is cogn. to &#1495;&#1502;&#1491;, Jesurun, p. 221.)<p>But the traditional reading &#1505;&#1502;&#1491;&#1512; (not &#1505;&#1502;&#1491;&#1512;) is unfavourable to this view; the middle a&#772; accordingly, as in &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;, presents itself as an ante-tone vowel (Ewald, 154a), and the stem-word appears as a quadril. which may be the expansion of &#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;, to range, put in order in the sense of placing asunder, unfolding. Symm. renders the word by &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, and the Talm. idiom shows that not only the green five-leaved blossoms of the vine were so named, but also the fruit-buds and the first shoots of the grapes. Here, as the words "they diffuse fragrance" (as at 7:14 of the mandrakes) show, the vine-blossom is meant which fills the vineyard with an incomparably delicate fragrance. At the close of the invitation to enjoy the spring, the call "Rise up," etc., with which it began, is repeated. The Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1500;&#1499;&#1497;, if not an error in writing, justly set aside by the Ker&#305;&#770;, is to be read &#1500;&#1499;&#1497; (cf. Syr. bechi, in thee, levotechi, to thee, but with occult i) - a North Palestinism for &#1500;&#1498;, like <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-2.htm">2 Kings 4:2</a>, where the Ker&#305;&#770; has substituted the usual form (vid., under <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a> introd.) for this very dialectic form, which is there undoubtedly original. </body></html>
