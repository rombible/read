A poor soul shall come up, at last, under the conduct of the Comforter; like a cloud of incense ascending from the altar, or the smoke of the burnt-offerings. This signifies pious and devout affections, and the mounting of the soul heaven-ward. The believer is filled with the graces of God's Spirit; his devotions now are very lively. These graces and comforts are from the heavenly Canaan. He, who is the Peace of his people, the King of the heavenly Zion, has provided for the safe conveyance of his redeemed through the wilderness of this world. The bed, or palanquin, was contrived for rest and easy conveyance, but its beauty and magnificence showed the quality of its owner. The church is well guarded; more are with her than are against her: believers, when they repose in Christ, and with him, though they have their fears in the night, are yet safe. The chariot here denotes the covenant of redemption, the way of our salvation. This is that work of Christ, which makes him loved and admired in the eyes of believers. It is framed and contrived, both for the glory of Christ, and for the comfort of believers; it is well ordered in all things and sure. The blood of the covenant, that rich purple, is the cover of this chariot, by which believers are sheltered from the wind and storms of Divine wrath, and the troubles of this world; but the midst of it is that love of Christ which passes knowledge, this is for believers to repose upon. Christ, in his gospel, manifests himself. Take special notice of his crown. Applying this to Christ, it speaks the honour put upon him, and his power and dominion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A stately bed hath king Solomon made for himself of woods (or trees) of the Lebanon.

The truths and doctrines of the Gospel are the "pillars" of it; which, like pillars, are solid and substantial, and continue firm and immovable, and are of great use to support the children of God under the several trials and exercises they are attended with; and, for their utility, value, and duration, are said to be of "silver", and are as carefully to be sought for and into as that is, and even to be preferred to it, being of more worth than "thousands of gold and silver"; the ministers of the Gospel are sometimes compared to pillars, and the church itself is said to be the pillar and ground of truth, <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <p>the bottom thereof of gold; Christ, the golden bottom of the Gospel, the sum and substance of it, the principal subject in it to be insisted on; he is laid in it as the bottom, ground, and foundation of faith and hope, and of everlasting life and salvation; and for its richness, firmness, and duration, may be said to be of gold, as the street of the New Jerusalem, <a href="/revelation/21-21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>; or its "pavement" (b), as the word here signifies. The Septuagint render it, a "reclining" (c) place, to sit and rest, or lean upon; such is Christ; <p>the covering of it of purple; or the top of it; the word signifies a chariot itself: it may respect such doctrines of the Gospel which relate to redemption, pardon of sin, and justification through the blood of Christ; and all under the purple covering of the blood of Christ are secure from wrath to come, and go safe to heaven; <p>the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem; the carpet wrought with lovely figures or with love stories: the doctrines and ordinances of the Gospel are full of love, of God in Christ, in providing Christ as a Saviour, and sending him to be one; and of the love of Christ in assuming human nature, and suffering and dying in it for sinners, even for Jerusalem sinners; the Gospel sets forth the heart of Christ as "inflamed" (d), as the word here used signifies, with love to the daughters of Jerusalem, his dear children, which moved him to do all he did and suffered for them; and could his heart be looked into, the very images of these persons would be seen upon it: the ordinances of the Gospel are designed both to set forth, in the most striking manner, the love of Christ to his sons and daughters, for whose sake he became man and suffered death, and to draw forth their love to him; so the words may be rendered, "paved with love by the daughters of Jerusalem" (e), or "with the love of them" (f) how delightful must it be to ride in such a chariot, or sit under such a ministry, where there is nothing but love! moreover, the whole description of the "bride chamber", which some choose to render the word for "chariot" by, well agrees with the New Jerusalem state, as given in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, where the church being as a bride prepared for her husband, will be introduced, the nuptial feast will be kept, and Christ will be seen by the daughters of Zion in all his regal glory, with the royal diadem on his head, as he is described in Sol 3:11. <p>(b) "pavimentum ejus", Vatablus, Grotius.

It is to be distinguished from the violet or cerulean purple which is <span class="ital">těkhçleth</span>. Both words are found in Assyrian inscriptions as <span class="ital">argamannu</span> and <span class="ital">takiltu</span>. Attempts to derive <span class="ital">argâmân</span> from a Heb. root are practically abandoned, and Benary’s suggestion that it is the Sanscrit <span class="ital">râgaman</span> = ‘red,’ an adj. derived from <span class="ital">râga</span>, ‘red colour,’ with the formative syllable <span class="ital">mat</span> or <span class="ital">vat</span> (cp. Addit. Ges. <span class="ital">Thes</span>. p. 90), is probable; more especially as the Aramaic form of the word, <span class="ital">argěwân</span>, can be explained by another adj. form of the same word, viz. <span class="ital">râgavan</span>, which is identical in meaning with <span class="ital">râgaman</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the midst thereof being paved</span> with <span class="ital">love, for the daughters of Jerusalem</span>] This is a very difficult phrase to understand, and it has been very variously interpreted. The A.V. can hardly be right in rendering ‘love <span class="ital">for</span> the daughters of Jerusalem,’ for the preposition is <span class="ital">min</span> which cannot mean <span class="ital">for</span>. The R.V. has, more correctly, <span class="bld">from</span> <span class="ital">the daughters of Jerusalem</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">paved</span> with <span class="ital">love</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">paved as to love</span>, the word being an adv. accus. The translation is grammatically correct. (Cp. Davidson, <span class="ital">Synt</span>. § 78, R. 2.) But what does ‘paved with love from the daughters of Jerusalem’ mean? Gesenius in his <span class="ital">Thes</span>. translates, “paved in a lovely manner by the daughters of Jerusalem,” but besides that the prep. <span class="ital">min</span> cannot be used for the <span class="ital">causa efficiens</span> with the passive, the word ‘love’ is not found elsewhere in such a sense. Del. translates, <span class="ital">made up as a bed, from love on the part of the daughters of Jerusalem</span>, and explains it to mean that they, from love to the king, have procured a costly tapestry which they have spread over the purple cushion. Oettli, following the LXX, takes <span class="ital">love</span> to mean, ‘a mark of love,’ and translates, “the middle of it adorned as a mosaic, a love-gift on the part of the daughters of Jerusalem.” Budde would change the order of the words, and reading <span class="ital">hôbhânîm</span> = ‘ebony’ for <span class="ital">ahăbhâh</span> = ‘love,’ would translate, “its seat is inlaid with ebony, its centre purple.” If the text is corrupt this may perhaps have been its original form. But of the text as it stands Delitzsch’s rendering seems to be the best, except that <span class="ital">wrought as a mosaic</span> would be better than <span class="ital">made up as a bed</span>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>4 Scarcely had I passed from them,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I found him whom my soul loveth.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I seized him, and did not let him go<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Until I brought him into the house of my mother,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And into the chamber of her that gave me birth.<p>&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496;  equals  paululum, here standing for a sentence: it was as a little that I passed, etc. Without &#1513;&#1473;, it would be paululum transii; with it, paululum fuit quod transii, without any other distinction than that in the latter case the paululum is more emphatic.

In <a href="/genesis/32-27.htm">Genesis 32:27</a> [26], we read the cogn. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, which signifies, to let go ("let me go"), as &#1492;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, to let loose, to let free. It is all the same whether we translate, with the subjective colouring, donec introduxerim, or, with the objective, donec introduxi; in either case the meaning is that she held him fast till she brought him, by gentle violence, into her mother's house. With &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; there is the more definite parallel &#1495;&#1491;&#1512; lellar, which properly signifies (vid., under Sol 1:4), recessus, penetrale; with &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, the seldom occurring (only, besides, at <a href="/hosea/2-7.htm">Hosea 2:7</a>) &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, part.f.
