A poor soul shall come up, at last, under the conduct of the Comforter; like a cloud of incense ascending from the altar, or the smoke of the burnt-offerings. This signifies pious and devout affections, and the mounting of the soul heaven-ward. The believer is filled with the graces of God's Spirit; his devotions now are very lively. These graces and comforts are from the heavenly Canaan. He, who is the Peace of his people, the King of the heavenly Zion, has provided for the safe conveyance of his redeemed through the wilderness of this world. The bed, or palanquin, was contrived for rest and easy conveyance, but its beauty and magnificence showed the quality of its owner. The church is well guarded; more are with her than are against her: believers, when they repose in Christ, and with him, though they have their fears in the night, are yet safe. The chariot here denotes the covenant of redemption, the way of our salvation. This is that work of Christ, which makes him loved and admired in the eyes of believers. It is framed and contrived, both for the glory of Christ, and for the comfort of believers; it is well ordered in all things and sure. The blood of the covenant, that rich purple, is the cover of this chariot, by which believers are sheltered from the wind and storms of Divine wrath, and the troubles of this world; but the midst of it is that love of Christ which passes knowledge, this is for believers to repose upon. Christ, in his gospel, manifests himself. Take special notice of his crown.

Not Solomon the son of David, and penman of this song, but a greater than he, the antitype of him; so it is interpreted of the Messiah by many Jewish writers (q): they were both sons of David and sons of God, and kings and preachers in Jerusalem. Solomon was a type of Christ in his wisdom and wealth, in the largeness and peaceableness of his kingdom; in his marriage with Pharaoh's daughter, and in building the temple, a figure of the church: and by his bed is meant the place where saints meet together for religious worship, his church visible, which is his resting and dwelling place; where souls are begotten and born again, and have fellowship with Christ; and which he has a property in by gift and purchase: and a behold is prefixed to it as a note of attention, directing the daughters of Jerusalem to turn off the discourse from her, and from commendation of her, to consider the greatness of Christ her beloved; who might conclude, that if his bed was so stately as after described, bow great must he himself be; and as a note of admiration, to show how much she was affected with the greatness of his grace to her, and the privileges she enjoyed of having nearness to him, and fellowship with him; <p>threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel; ministers of the Gospel, such as are Israelites indeed, faithful and upright; and who are valiant, and heartily concerned for the good and welfare of Christ's people, and are careful that nothing hurt them, nor disturb their rest and repose. In the number of them, the allusion may be to the guard about Solomon's bed; which might consist of so many, partly for the security of his royal person, and partly for grandeur and majesty: and were just double the number of his father's worthies, he excelling him in greatness and glory; though it may be a certain number is put for an uncertain; and this is a competent and sufficient one. <p>(q) Targum, Aben Ezra, Jarchi, Kimchi, Ben Melech, and Abendana. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/songs/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold his <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> bed, which <i>is</i> Solomon's; sixty valiant men <i>are</i> about it, of the valiant of Israel.</span><p>(f) By the bed is meant the temple which Solomon made.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/songs/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Behold his bed, which is Solomon’s</span>] This is an answer to the question of the last verse, “Who or what is this which cometh up,” &c. It should be, <span class="bld">Behold, it is Solomon’s palanquin</span>, and it is spoken either by the same person who asks the question, or by another bystander. The word <span class="ital">miṭṭâh</span>, translated ‘bed’ by the A.V., has that meaning, but it is used also of couches at table, <a href="/esther/1-6.htm" title="Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.">Esther 1:6</a> (R.V.), of sofas, <a href="/amos/3-12.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; As the shepherd takes out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.">Amos 3:12</a>, and of biers, <a href="/2_samuel/3-31.htm" title="And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.">2 Samuel 3:31</a>. Here it means <span class="ital">a litter</span> or <span class="ital">palanquin</span>. The A.V. rendering, <span class="ital">his bed, which is Solomon’s</span>, is simply a literal translation of a pleonastic way of expressing the genitive which is constant in Aramaic, and which may have been common in the popular speech of Northern Israel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">threescore valiant</span> men are <span class="ital">about it, of the valiant of Israel</span>] <span class="ital">Gibbôr</span>, the word translated <span class="ital">valiant man</span>, is the intensive of <span class="ital">geber</span> = ‘a man,’ and denotes a strong, bold man, hence a hero in war. Solomon’s litter is surrounded by his bodyguard.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, it is the litter of Solomon; three score mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel</span>. The litter, or palanquin, is easily recognized. The word is <span class="accented">mittah</span>, which is literally "bed," or "litter," but in the ninth verse we have another word, <span class="accented">appiryon</span>, which is a more stately word. "the royal car." It is the bringing home of the bride which is described. In the forty-fifth psalm the idea seems to be that the bridegroom betook himself to the house of the parents and fetched his bride, or that she was brought to him in festal procession, and he went forth to meet her (see 1 Macc. 9:39). That was the prevailing custom, as we see in the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>). In this case, however, there is a vast difference in rank between the bride and bridegroom, and she is brought to him. The long journey through the wilderness is implied in the mention of the bodyguard (cf. <a href="/isaiah/4-6.htm">Isaiah 4:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>). The intention evidently is to show how dear the bride was to Solomon. His mighty men were chosen to defend her. So the Church is surrounded with armies of guardian attendants. Her Lord is the Lord of hosts. The description reminds us of the exquisite lines in Shakespeare's 'Antony and Cleopatra,' in which he describes the lovely Egyptian in her barge "like a burnished throne," lying "in her pavilion (cloth of gold, of tissue)," with the smiling cupids on each side, while <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"... from the barge,<br />A strange invisible perfume hits the sense<br />Of the adjacent wharfs."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc"><a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, sc. 2</span>) The word <span class="accented">mittah</span>, "a bed, or litter," comes from a root "to stretch out," and is also used of a bier (see <a href="/2_samuel/3-21.htm">2 Samuel 3:21</a>). The idea is that of a portable bed, or sitting cushion, hung round with curtains, after the manner of the Indian palanquin, such as is still found in the Turkish caiques or the Venetian gondolas. It was, of course, royal, belonging to Solomon, not to any nobleman or private person; hence its magnificence. The bearers are not named. The bodyguard, consisting of sixty chosen men, forming an escort, were one tenth part of the whole royal guard, as we see from <a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-9.htm">1 Samuel 30:9</a>. Delitzsch suggests that in the mention of the number there may be a reference to the twelve tribes of Israel - 60 being a multiple of 12. The term, "mighty men," is explained in the next verse as warriors, that is, men "held fast by the sword" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to Hebrew idiom, men practised in the use of the sword; so it is explained by some; but others take it as meaning that they "handle the sword;" hence our Revised Version. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>1 On my bed in the nights<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I sought him whom my soul loveth:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I sought him, and found him not.<p>She does not mean to say that she sought him beside herself on her couch; for how could that be of the modest one, whose home-bringing is first described in the next act - she could and might miss him there neither waking nor sleeping. The commencement is like <a href="/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15</a>. She was at night on her couch, when a painful longing seized her: the beloved of her soul appeared to have forsaken her, to have withdrawn from her; she had lost the feeling of his nearness, and was not able to recover it. &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is neither here nor at Sol 3:8 necessarily the categ. plur. The meaning may also be, that this pain, arising from a sense of being forgotten, always returned upon her for several nights through: she became distrustful of his fidelity; but the more she apprehended that she was no longer loved, the more ardent became her longing, and she arose to seek for him who had disappeared. </body></html>
