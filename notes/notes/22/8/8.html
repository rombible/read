If the beginning of this work were likened to a wall built upon Him the precious Foundation and Corner-stone, then the Gentile church would become as a palace for the great King, built of solid silver. If the first preaching of the gospel were as the making a door through the wall of partition, that door should be lasting, as cased with boards of durable cedar. She shall be carefully and effectually protected, enclosed so as to receive no damage. The church is full of care for those yet uncalled.

Which seems to be the Gentile church, so called by the Jewish church; for as the church catholic, or universal, with respect to its parts, is called a mother, as often in this Song; so these parts, with respect to each other, as the Jewish and Gentile churches, may be called sisters; and the rather, as they belong to the same Father and family, are partakers of the same grace, and are of the same faith and religion as to the substance of them; and the object and nature of their worship the same, though as to circumstances different: and it may be observed that the Gentile church is not only sister to the Jewish church, but to Christ, and therefore she says, not I, but we, have such a sister; of which relation, see Sol 4:9; also that she stood in this relation to Christ and to the Jewish church before the coming of Christ, and before the Gospel was preached to her, and she was called and separated from the world; as elect Gentiles are also called the sheep of Christ, and children of God, before that time, <a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>. This church is described as a "little sister", younger in age than the Jewish church, and in some respects less honourable, <a href="/romans/3-1.htm">Romans 3:1</a>; the same with the younger son and brother, in the parable of the prodigal; little in esteem among men, especially the Jews, <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>; little in stature, light, knowledge, and faith, at first conversion; and but few in number, particularly at first, and in comparison of the world: and so the church of Christ, consisting both of Jews and Gentiles, is called a little flock, <a href="/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>. As a further description of her, it is added, <p>and she hath no breasts: is not arrived to years of ripeness, nor marriageable; see <a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>; the time of her open espousal to Christ was not yet come: at this time she had no ministers nor ordinances, from whence she could have the sincere milk of the word, or share it with others; and it was some time after the Gospel came among the Gentiles before they had a settled ministry; <p>what shall we defer our sister? or, "what shall be done for her?" being moved with pity to her, in her forlorn and helpless condition, like a little infant, <a href="/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a>; and willing to do anything for her that lay in her power, though seeming at a loss to know what to do for her: the believing Jews were very assisting to the Gentiles, in carrying the Gospel among them at first; and in supplying them with ministers, and with money too, to carry on the interest of Christ among them. The Jewish church here is not forgetful of the chief and principal agent, Christ, and therefore says, what shall we do? she was willing to do what she could; but she knew all would be insignificant without Christ, his agency and blessing. The time she was concerned what should be done for her in is, <p>in the day when she shall be spoken for, or "with", or "unto" (y): when she should be wooed or treated with for marriage, by the ministers of the word, at the first preaching of the Gospel to her; or be spoken to by her enemies, by fair words, or severe menaces, to desert the faith. Or, "be spoken of" (z); the fame of her be spread abroad, far and near, for her light, knowledge, and faith; for her profession, and her sufferings for it; and the concern is, how she should behave under all the noise and talk about her: or, "be spoken against" (a); as she would be by unbelieving Jews, and by ignorant Heathens, for embracing the Christian religion, for receiving the Gospel of Christ, submitting to his ordinances, and professing his name, <a href="/acts/28-22.htm">Acts 28:22</a>. Now the old church might be concerned, that she might stand firm to her faith and the profession of it, notwithstanding the reproaches and persecutions of men. <p>(y)  "alloquenda est", V. L.

This conversation too does not fit in well with Budde’s view, for it clearly implies some special story told of particular persons. How it could appear in a collection of songs for use at weddings in general it is difficult to see. The anger of the brothers mentioned in ch. <a href="/songs/1-6.htm" title="Look not on me, because I am black, because the sun has looked on me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but my own vineyard have I not kept.">Song of Solomon 1:6</a>, and the sending of their sister into the vineyards, together with their over-anxiety here, can hardly be circumstances which regularly occurred and were regularly introduced in the songs at weddings. Budde says indeed that we have nothing here but an Oriental version of what is found in popular songs in Europe where the mother is informed very plainly that the daughter is grown up and seeks marriage. But that is by no means a parallel case. It is not the general fact of growing up unnoticed from childhood to womanhood that is dealt with here. It is such circumstances as can be accounted for only by events which were related in some well-known story.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8, 9</span>.

Reminiscences and Triumphs<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This section is one of those which weigh heavily on the side of the view that the Song is a series of dramatic lyrics rather than a connected drama. For as Oettli admits, it is very difficult to find place for such a scene as this in a drama. But taken as a dramatic lyric it has an almost exact analogy in Tennyson’s <span class="ital">Maud</span>, which he calls a melodrama, and which is made up of separate but connected poems. There we have in Part VII a song of four verses, referring to a conversation remembered by the hero of the poem as having taken place between his father and Maud’s, regarding his future marriage, if the child of the latter, at that time only expected, should prove to be a daughter. It is introduced quite abruptly as this song is here, and the circumstances have to be gathered from the words:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Men were drinking together,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Drinking and talking of me,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Well, if it prove a girl, the boy<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Will have plenty, so let it be’ ”;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and so on. Following that analogy, we have to imagine the bride now returned to her home and recalling what she had heard her brothers (<a href="/songs/1-6.htm" title="Look not on me, because I am black, because the sun has looked on me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but my own vineyard have I not kept.">Song of Solomon 1:6</a>) say of her in the past (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/songs/8-8.htm" title="We have a little sister, and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?...">Song of Solomon 8:8-9</a></span>). For the little sister is the Shulammite herself, as the choice of the figure of a wall for herself in <span class="ital"><a href="/songs/8-10.htm" title="I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.">Song of Solomon 8:10</a></span> shews.

"She hath no breasts" is equivalent to saying she is not yet mature, of marriageable age (see <a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>). The question which the bride asks of King Solomon refers to the promise which he is supposed to have made, and which he is virtually pledging himself to fulfil by this visit to the country home of his queen. "What shall be done for the advantage of my little sister? Let us consult together" (cf. <a href="/genesis/27-37.htm">Genesis 27:37</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>). "The day when she shall be spoken for" is the day when she shall attract the attention of a suitor. It must necessarily be difficult to find satisfactory interpretations forevery detail in such a poem of human love as this. It might be sufficient to see in this reference to the younger sister the general idea of love's expansion. Those who are themselves the objects of it, being full of exquisite happiness, desire to call others into the same joy. This is true both of the individual and of the Church. <span class="accented">What shall be done for others?</span> That is the question which is awakened in every heart where true love is at work. There is no need to explain the language further. But the allegorists have been very ingenious in attempting to find meanings forevery allusion of the poem. Who is the little sister? What is her virginity? What  is the day in which she shall be spoken for? Some have said that the little sister represents the firstfruits of the Jews and Gentiles received into the Christian Church immediately after the time of our Lord's ascension, as Beza and others. Some, again, take it to mean the whole body of Jews and Gentiles yet to be converted. Others would see in it those that are weak in faith, the beginners in Christian life. And, again, it has been regarded as pointing to the "daughter of Zion" at the time of the first beginnings of her conversion to the heavenly Solomon, which is the view of Hengstenberg and others. There is no end to such fancies. The broad general meaning is all that we can rest upon. The bride naturally thinks of her sister. It is a lovely incident in a perfectly idyllic poem. The visit to the home is quite in harmony with the fresh, pure, and simple life which reveals itself in all the utterances of the bride, and is honoured by the devoted attention of the splendid monarch. It is a real touch of nature when the young bride, in her family life once more, asks what shall become of her sister. It is an exquisite type of that sisterly solicitude with which all true Christians will care for the souls around them. Delitzsch thinks that the question which is asked by the bride is answered by her brothers, as they were the actual guardians of the little sister (see <a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21</a>:50, 55; 34:6-8). But there is no necessity to introduce any new interlocutors at this point. The words are certainly addressed to Solomon. It is quite natural that he should reply to them in a royal style, with the <span class="accented">pluralis majestatis</span> which suits the corresponding position of the bride as a suppliant for her sister. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If Solomon now complies with her request, yields to her invitation, then she will again see her parental home, where, in the days of her first love, she laid up for him that which was most precious, that she might thereby give him joy. Since she thus places herself with her whole soul back again in her home and amid its associations, the wish expressed in these words that follow rises up within her in the childlike purity of her love:<p>1 O that thou wert like a brother to me,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Who sucked my mother's breasts!<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If I found thee without, I would kiss thee;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; They also could not despise me.<p>2 I would lead thee, bring thee into my mother's house;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wouldest instruct me - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would give thee to drink spiced wine,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The must of my pomegranates.<p>Solomon is not her brother, who, with her, hung upon the same mother's breast; but she wishes, carried away in her dream into the reality of that she wished for, that she had him as her brother, or rather, since she says, not &#1488;&#1495;, but &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495; (with &#1499;&#1468;, which here has not, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a>, the meaning of tanquam, but of instar, as at <a href="/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a>), that she had in him what a brother is to a sister. In that case, if she found him without, she would kiss him (hypoth. fut. in the protasis, and fut. without Vav in the apodosis, as at <a href="/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>; <a href="/hosea/8-12.htm">Hosea 8:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-18.htm">Psalm 139:18</a>) - she could do this without putting any restraint on herself for the sake of propriety (cf. the kiss of the wanton harlot, <a href="/proverbs/7-13.htm">Proverbs 7:13</a>), and also (&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;) without needing to fear that they who saw it would treat it scornfully (&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, as in the reminiscence, <a href="/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>). The close union which lies in the sisterly relationship thus appeared to her to be higher than the near connection established by the marriage relationship, and her childlike feeling deceived her not: the sisterly relationship is certainly purer, firmer, more enduring than that of marriage, so far as this does not deepen itself into an equality with the sisterly, and attain to friendship, yea, brotherhood (<a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>), within. That Shulamith thus feels herself happy in the thought that Solomon was to her as a brother, shows, in a characteristic manner, that "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life," were foreign to her. If he were her brother, she would take him by the hand, <p>(Note: Ben-Asher punctuates &#1488;&#1504;&#1492;&#1490;&#1498;. Thus also P. rightly. Ben-Naphtali, on the contrary, punctuates &#1488;&#1504;&#1492;&#1490;&#1498;. Cf. Genesis (1869), p. 85, note 3.)<p>and bring him into her mother's house, and he would then, under the eye of their common mother, become her teacher, and she would become his scholar. The lxx adds, after the words "into my mother's house," the phrase, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;, cf. Sol 3:4. In the same manner also the Syr., which has not read the words &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5; following, which are found in some Codd. of the lxx. Regarding the word telammede&#772;ne (thou wouldest instruct me) as incongruous, Hitzig asks: What should he then teach her? He refers it to her mother: "who would teach me," namely, from her own earlier experience, how I might do everything rightly for him. "Were the meaning," he adds, "he should do it, then also it is she who ought to be represented as led home by him into his house, the bride by the bridegroom." But, correctly, Jerome, the Venet., and Luther: "Thou wouldest (shouldest) instruct me;" also the Targ.: "I would conduct thee, O King Messiah, and bring Thee into the house of my sanctuary; and Thou wouldest teach me (&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507; &#1497;&#1514;&#1497;) to fear God and to walk in His ways." Not her mother, but Solomon, is in possession of the wisdom which she covets; and if he were her brother, as she wishes, then she would constrain him to devote himself to her as her teacher. The view, favoured by Leo Hebraeus (Dialog. de amore, c. III), John Pordage (Metaphysik, III 617 ff.), and Rosenmller, and which commends itself, after the analogy of the Gtagovinda, Boethius, and Dante, and appears also to show itself in the Syr. title of the book, "Wisdom of the Wise," that Shulamith is wisdom personified (cf. also Sol 8:2 with <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2</a>, and <a href="/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a> with <a href="/proverbs/4-8.htm">Proverbs 4:8</a>), shatters itself against this &#1514;&#1500;&#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;; the fact is rather the reverse: Solomon is wisdom in person, and Shulamith is the wisdom-loving soul, <p>(Note: Cf. my Das Hohelied unter. u. ausg. (1851), pp. 65-73.)<p> - for Shulamith wishes to participate in Solomon's wisdom. What a deep view the "Thou wouldest teach me" affords into Shulamith's heart! She knew how much she yet came short of being to him all that a wife should be. But in Jerusalem the bustle of court life and the burden of his regal duties did not permit him to devote himself to her; but in her mother's house, if he were once there, he would instruct her, and she would requite him with her spiced wine and with the juice of the pomegranates.<p>continued...</body></html>
