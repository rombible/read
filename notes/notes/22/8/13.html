He first addresses her as dwelling in the gardens, the assemblies and ordinances of his saints. He exhorts her to be constant and frequent in prayers, supplications, and praises, in which he delights. She replies, craving his speedy return to take her to be wholly with Him. The heavens, those high mountains of sweet spices, must contain Christ, till the times come, when every eye shall see him, in all the glory of the better world. True believers as they are looking for, so they are hastening to the coming of that day of the Lord. Let every Christian endeavour to perform the duties of his station, that men may see his good works, and glorify his heavenly Father. Continuing earnest in prayer for what we want, our thanksgivings will abound, and our joy will be full; our souls will be enriched, and our labours prospered. We shall be enabled to look forward to death and judgment without fear.

She no longer thinks of the possibility of separation. The "Mountains of Bether" (division) of Sol 2:17, are now "Mountains of Besamim" (spices).

(Ac 15:25, 26), under her (So 8:11, 12); these ought to obey her when she obeys Jesus Christ.

These are the words of Christ to the church, describing her by her habitation, and may be rendered, "O thou, inhabitress of the gardens" (i); the word used being in the feminine gender, which determines the sense of it, as belonging to the church: but the Septuagint version renders it by a word in the masculine gender; and so Ambrose (k), who interprets the words as spoken by the church to Christ; though he observes that Symmachus and Aquila interpret them as the words of Christ to the church. By the "gardens" are meant particular congregations, the dwelling places of the church, and where she has work to do by her ministers, to plant, water, prune, and dress the gardens; and of particular believers, whose business it is to attend on the ministry of the word, and other ordinances; and dwelling here may denote diligence and constant attendance here, and which is approved of by Christ, and well pleasing to him: and it is honourable, as well as profitable and delightful, to have a place in these gardens, and especially an abiding one; and indeed those, to whom Christ gives a place and a name here, are in no danger of being turned or driven out, as Adam was from Eden; <p>the companions hearken to thy voice; meaning either the divine Persons, the Father and the Holy Ghost, as Piscator; the companions of Christ, of the same nature, perfections, and glory with him; who listen to what the church and true believers say to them and to one another, <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>; or the angels, as Jarchi and Aben Ezra, the friends of Christ and his people, who hearken to the conversation of believers, in private and public; and especially to the Gospel, preached in the assembly of the saints, <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>; or rather the daughters of Jerusalem, who all along attend the bride in this Song, and are the virgins her companions, <a href="/psalms/45-14.htm">Psalm 45:14</a>; and it is a title that belongs to all truly gracious souls, <a href="/psalms/122-8.htm">Psalm 122:8</a>; who hearken to the voice of the church, to the Gospel, preached by her ministers; which is a joyful sound, and gives great delight and pleasure; <p>cause me to hear it; that is, her voice; so sweet and charming to him, as in Sol 2:14; her voice in prayer and praise; in speaking of him, his person, offices, and grace, to others, and confessing his name before men. Some render the words, "preach me" (l); and then the sense is, seeing the companions flock unto thee, and listen with great attention and pleasure to thy voice, take the opportunity of preaching me unto them; let my person, righteousness, and grace, be the subject of thy ministry: and which was done in the first times of the Gospel, by the apostles; has been, more or less, ever since, by faithful ministers; and will be continued until the second coming of Christ, prayed for in Sol 8:14. <p>(i) "quae habitas", V.

There cannot be much doubt that these are the words of the bridegroom. They are addressed to the bride. She is the dweller in the gardens; that is, one who is at home in the gardens, whose beauty blends with the rural loveliness around her. The king wishes his bride to understand that she is only acceptable in his sight, and that all that she asks shall be granted. It is delightful to him to hear her voice, as it is delightful to those who have been accustomed to that voice from her childhood. "Dear country girl, sing to me, and let me revel in the sweetness of thy music. 'Thy companions hearken for it' - thy former associates, the playmates of thy youth. And while they gather round us, and you and I rejoice in one another, let the sound of thy voice mingle with the peaceful beauty of this earthly paradise." There is an exquisite tenderness in this conclusion of the poem. The curtain falls, as it were, upon a scene of mutual confidence and affection, the simplicity of the bride's early home being lifted up into the royal splendour of the king's presence, the companions beholding and praising, while, in the midst of all that sunny bliss and peaceful content, the voice of the Bride is heard singing one of the old, familiar strains of love with which she poured out her heart in the days when her beloved came to find her in her home. It is impossible to conceive a more perfect conclusion. It leads up our thoughts to the laud of light and song, where "the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall be the Shepherd" of those who shall "hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun strike upon them, nor any heat;" "and he shall guide them unto fountains of waters of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes" (<a href="/revelation/7-16.htm">Revelation 7:16, 17</a>). It is sad to think that Solomon himself fell from such an ideal of human affection, and was unfaithful to such a bride. But there is no need to trouble the clear, transparent beauty of this typical poem by any reference to the incidents of the writer's own history. He placed it on the altar of God, no doubt, at a time when it represented sincere feelings in his heart, and because he was inspired to see that it would be profitable to the people of God as a mirror in which they could behold the reflection of the highest truth. But though he himself fell away from his high place as a prophet of God, the words which he left behind him were still a precious gift to the Church. It is otherwise with him who is typified by the earthly monarch. He who is the heavenly Bridegroom has himself to lift up the weakness and fickleness of his bride by fellowship with her, until she is above the reach of temptation, and partaker of his own glory. And he does so, as this exquisite poem reminds us, by the power of his love. It is the personal influence of the Lord Jesus Christ which must glorify the Church and restore it to its original simplicity and spirituality. The scene into which we are led in this story of bridal affection typifies a state of the Church when the artificiality of court life shall be abandoned, the magnificence of mere external pomp and ritual shall be left behind, and the bride shall simply delight herself in the Bridegroom among the pure and peaceful surroundings of a country home. The Church will realize the greatness of her power when she is delivered from that which hides her Saviour, when she is simply human and yet entirely spiritual; then the Lord of her life, the second Adam, the perfect Man, who is from heaven and in heaven, but still on earth, changing earth to heaven by his love, will fulfil his promise. "He not merely concludes the marriage covenant with mankind, but likewise preserves, confirms, refines, and conducts it step by step to its ideal consummation, which is at the same time the palingenesia and perfection of humanity." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After Solomon has thus called to remembrance the commencement of their love-relation, which receives again a special consecration by the reference to Shulamith's parental home, and to her mother, Shulamith answers with a request to preserve for her this love.<p>6 Place me as a signet-ring on thy heart,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As a signet-ring on thine arm!<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For strong as death is love;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Inexorable as hell is jealousy:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Its flames are flames of fire,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A flame of Jah.<p>7 Mighty waters are unable to quench such love,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And rivers cannot overflow it.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If a man would give<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; All the wealth of his house for love, - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; He would only be contemned.<p>The signet-ring, which is called &#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; (&#1495;&#1514;&#1501;, to impress), was carried either by a string on the breast, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/38-18.htm">Genesis 38:18</a>, or also, as that which is called &#1496;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; denotes (from &#1496;&#1489;&#1506;, to sink into), on the hand, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>, cf. <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a>, but not on the arm, like a bracelet, <a href="/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a>; and since it is certainly permissible to say "hand" for "finger," but not "arm" for "hand," so we may not refer "on thine arm" to the figure if the signet-ring, as if Shulamith had said, as the poet might also introduce her as saying: Make me like a signet-ring (&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;) on thy breast; make me like a signet-ring "on thy hand," or "on thy right hand." The words, "set me on thy heart," and "(set me) on thine arm," must thus also, without regard to "as a signet-ring," express independent thoughts, although &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497; is chosen (vid., <a href="/haggai/2-23.htm">Haggai 2:23</a>) instead of &#1511;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;, in view of the comparison.<p>(Note: Of the copy of the Tra, which was to be the king's vade-mecum, it is said, Sanhedrin 21b: &#1506;&#1493;&#1513;&#1492; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492; &#1499;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506; &#1493;&#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;, but also there the amulet is thought of not as fastened to the finger, but as wound round the arm.)<p>continued...</body></html>
