The Christian church was raised from a low, desolate condition, by the grace of Christ relied on. Believers, by the power of grace, are brought up from the wilderness. A sinful state is a wilderness in which there is no true comfort; it is a wandering, wanting state: There is no coming out of this wilderness, but leaning on Christ as our Beloved, by faith; not leaning to our own understanding, nor trusting in any righteousness of our own; but in the strength of him, who is the Lord our Righteousness. The words of the church to Christ which follow, entreat an abiding place in his love, and protection by his power. Set me as a seal upon thine heart; let me always have a place in thine heart; let me have an impression of love upon thine heart. Of this the soul would be assured, and without a sense thereof no rest is to be found. Those who truly love Christ, are jealous of every thing that would draw them from him; especially of themselves, lest they should do any thing to provoke him to withdraw from them. If we love Christ, the fear of coming short of his love, or the temptations to forsake him, will be most painful to us. No waters can quench Christ's love to us, nor any floods drown it. Let nothing abate our love to him. Nor will life, and all its comforts, entice a believer from loving Christ. Love of Christ, will enable us to repel and triumph over temptations from the smiles of the world, as well as from its frowns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/songs/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The bride says this as she clings to his arm and rests her head upon his bosom.

The love of the church to Christ, which is inextinguishable and insuperable, by the many waters and floods of wicked and ungodly men; neither by their flattery and fair promises; nor by their cruel edicts, force and persecution; by neither can they withdraw the love of the saints from Christ, nor tempt them to desert his interest: nor by all the afflictions God is pleased to bring upon them; rather their love is increased thereby, which they consider as effects of the love, wisdom, and faithfulness of God, as designed for their good: nor even by their sins and corruptions; for though, through the aboundings of these, their love may wax cold, yet it never becomes extinct; it may be left, but not lost; its fervency may be abated, but that itself remains: nor by Satan's temptations, who sometimes comes in like a flood, threatening to carry all before him; but the Spirit lifts up a standard against him, and maintains his own work of faith and love, <a href="/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>; nor by the terrors of the law, and the apprehensions of divine wrath, they are sometimes pressed with, signified by waves and floods, <a href="/psalms/88-6.htm">Psalm 88:6</a>; nor by all the hardships and difficulties, scoffs and reproaches, which attend believers in their Christian race; which are so far from alienating their affections from Christ, that they rather endear him the more unto them, and make heaven, and the enjoyment of him there, the more desirable; <p>if a man would give, all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned; it is true of the love of Christ to his people, as also what is said before; but is rather to be understood of the love of the church to Christ; which is a grace so valuable, as not to be purchased with money: if this, or any other grace, is to be bought, it is to be bought without money and without price; it is to be had freely of Christ; and, where possessed, will not be parted with for anything that may be offered; if a rich man's whole estate was offered for it, to a lover of Christ; yea, the riches of the Indies, or the vast treasures of the whole globe, on condition of his parting with him, and deserting his cause and interest, and dropping or neglecting his love to him, it would be treated by him with the, almost disdain and contempt; see <a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>. Now all this is used by the church as an argument to gain her request, "set me as a seal", &amp;c. Sol 8:6; since my soul is all in flames of love to thee, which cannot be quenched by all I suffer on thy account; nor will be parted with for all that the world can give me.

All this she has felt, and she beseeches her lover never to let her go, since otherwise she would be utterly forlorn and given up to the fury of unrelenting jealousy.

Even Budde says <span class="ital"><a href="/context/songs/8-6.htm" title="Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which has a most vehement flame....">Song of Solomon 8:6-7</a></span> undoubtedly contain the deepest thing said of love in the book. The sensuous aspect of love falls entirely into the background, the whole nature is irresistibly seized and indissolubly bound to the beloved one. But that is not enough. It is towards this declaration that the author has been making from the first. Consequently this ethical conception of love should be regarded as underlying all that goes before, and the book thought of as a unity. The writer of these words must have had an ideal of love, with which the coarseness, inevitably found even in the most simple and deeply felt descriptions of natural scenery by those who regard the book as a collection of professional laudations of the more sensuous side of marriage, is totally incompatible. And this ideal must have been an elevating influence of very great importance for the moral life of a people among whom marriage was a mere matter of contract, and the price given for the bride a subject of pride, as it still is among Orientals. Immediately and inevitably this statement of the nature of love leads on to a condemnation of the common point of view in an arrow-like phrase, which having first transfixed the gorgeous and voluptuous Solomon, goes straight to the heart of the ordinary practice of the time.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned</span>] Better, <span class="bld">he would be utterly despised</span>. Literally, the words are â€˜men would utterly despise him,â€™ or, â€˜it.â€™ In this Budde sees only an ordinary commonplace of popular poetry. But surely its connexion with the previous verses raises it far above that level. It is the practical application of the deepest thing said in the book. But in any case it could not have been a commonplace at marriages such as have been described. To sing words like these at an ordinary Oriental wedding would have been little short of unseemly.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If Solomon now complies with her request, yields to her invitation, then she will again see her parental home, where, in the days of her first love, she laid up for him that which was most precious, that she might thereby give him joy. Since she thus places herself with her whole soul back again in her home and amid its associations, the wish expressed in these words that follow rises up within her in the childlike purity of her love:<p>1 O that thou wert like a brother to me,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Who sucked my mother's breasts!<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If I found thee without, I would kiss thee;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; They also could not despise me.<p>2 I would lead thee, bring thee into my mother's house;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wouldest instruct me - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would give thee to drink spiced wine,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The must of my pomegranates.<p>Solomon is not her brother, who, with her, hung upon the same mother's breast; but she wishes, carried away in her dream into the reality of that she wished for, that she had him as her brother, or rather, since she says, not &#1488;&#1495;, but &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495; (with &#1499;&#1468;, which here has not, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a>, the meaning of tanquam, but of instar, as at <a href="/job/24-14.htm">Job 24:14</a>), that she had in him what a brother is to a sister. In that case, if she found him without, she would kiss him (hypoth. fut. in the protasis, and fut. without Vav in the apodosis, as at <a href="/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>; <a href="/hosea/8-12.htm">Hosea 8:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-18.htm">Psalm 139:18</a>) - she could do this without putting any restraint on herself for the sake of propriety (cf. the kiss of the wanton harlot, <a href="/proverbs/7-13.htm">Proverbs 7:13</a>), and also (&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;) without needing to fear that they who saw it would treat it scornfully (&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, as in the reminiscence, <a href="/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>). The close union which lies in the sisterly relationship thus appeared to her to be higher than the near connection established by the marriage relationship, and her childlike feeling deceived her not: the sisterly relationship is certainly purer, firmer, more enduring than that of marriage, so far as this does not deepen itself into an equality with the sisterly, and attain to friendship, yea, brotherhood (<a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>), within. That Shulamith thus feels herself happy in the thought that Solomon was to her as a brother, shows, in a characteristic manner, that "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life," were foreign to her. If he were her brother, she would take him by the hand, <p>(Note: Ben-Asher punctuates &#1488;&#1504;&#1492;&#1490;&#1498;. Thus also P. rightly. Ben-Naphtali, on the contrary, punctuates &#1488;&#1504;&#1492;&#1490;&#1498;. Cf. Genesis (1869), p. 85, note 3.)<p>and bring him into her mother's house, and he would then, under the eye of their common mother, become her teacher, and she would become his scholar. The lxx adds, after the words "into my mother's house," the phrase, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;, cf. Sol 3:4. In the same manner also the Syr., which has not read the words &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5; following, which are found in some Codd. of the lxx. Regarding the word telammede&#772;ne (thou wouldest instruct me) as incongruous, Hitzig asks: What should he then teach her? He refers it to her mother: "who would teach me," namely, from her own earlier experience, how I might do everything rightly for him. "Were the meaning," he adds, "he should do it, then also it is she who ought to be represented as led home by him into his house, the bride by the bridegroom." But, correctly, Jerome, the Venet., and Luther: "Thou wouldest (shouldest) instruct me;" also the Targ.: "I would conduct thee, O King Messiah, and bring Thee into the house of my sanctuary; and Thou wouldest teach me (&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507; &#1497;&#1514;&#1497;) to fear God and to walk in His ways." Not her mother, but Solomon, is in possession of the wisdom which she covets; and if he were her brother, as she wishes, then she would constrain him to devote himself to her as her teacher. The view, favoured by Leo Hebraeus (Dialog. de amore, c. III), John Pordage (Metaphysik, III 617 ff.), and Rosenmller, and which commends itself, after the analogy of the Gtagovinda, Boethius, and Dante, and appears also to show itself in the Syr. title of the book, "Wisdom of the Wise," that Shulamith is wisdom personified (cf. also Sol 8:2 with <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2</a>, and <a href="/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a> with <a href="/proverbs/4-8.htm">Proverbs 4:8</a>), shatters itself against this &#1514;&#1500;&#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;; the fact is rather the reverse: Solomon is wisdom in person, and Shulamith is the wisdom-loving soul, <p>(Note: Cf. my Das Hohelied unter. u. ausg. (1851), pp. 65-73.)<p> - for Shulamith wishes to participate in Solomon's wisdom. What a deep view the "Thou wouldest teach me" affords into Shulamith's heart! She knew how much she yet came short of being to him all that a wife should be. But in Jerusalem the bustle of court life and the burden of his regal duties did not permit him to devote himself to her; but in her mother's house, if he were once there, he would instruct her, and she would requite him with her spiced wine and with the juice of the pomegranates.<p>continued...</body></html>
