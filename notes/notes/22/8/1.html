It refers to the time after His resurrection, when the previous outward intimacy with Him was no longer allowed, but it was implied it should be renewed at the second coming (Joh 20:17). For this the Church here prays; meanwhile she enjoys inward spiritual communion with Him. The last who ever "kissed" Jesus Christ on earth was the traitor Judas.

Or, "who will give thee as a brother to me?" (q) an usual form of wishing, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-29.htm">Deuteronomy 5:29</a>, <a href="/psalms/14-7.htm">Psalm 14:7</a>. The church here not only requests that Christ would be like a brother to her, but appear to be really one, and to act the part of one towards her; with whom she might as freely converse as brother and sister may. Several Jewish (r) writers own, that the King Messiah is intended here; and in such a relation Christ does stand to his church and people, by virtue of his incarnation, <a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>; hence many of the ancients take this to be a wish of the Jewish church, for the coming of Christ in the flesh; and also through their adoption, he and they having one Father, <a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; and by being of a like nature, disposition, and practice, <a href="/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>; as well as on the score of love and friendship, <a href="/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>; and this relation Christ fills up, by the intimacy and familiarity he uses them with; by his compassion on them, and sympathy with them, in all their afflictions; by the help, aid, and relief, he gives them; by his condescension to their weaknesses, and by his great love and affection for them. As a further description of him as a brother, it is added, <p>that sucked the breasts of my mother; which may denote the truth and reality of Christ's incarnation, being a sucking infant: and the near relation of Christ to his people, being a brother by the mother's side, reckoned the nearest, and their affection to each other the strongest: by her "mother" may be meant Jerusalem above, the mother of us all; and, by her "breasts", the ordinances, of which Christ, as man, partook when on earth, and now may be said to suck, as formed in the hearts of his people; <p>when I should find thee without; or, "in the street" (s); in public ordinances, where Christ is to be found; or outside of Judea, in the Gentile world, where, after his coming in the flesh, his Gospel was preached, the ordinances administered, and he was there to be found; or in the most public place and manner, where she should not be ashamed to own him, his truths and ordinances, before men; <p>I would kiss thee; not only with a kiss of approbation, <a href="/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>; but of love and affection, of faith and confidence, of homage and subjection, of worship and adoration; see <a href="/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>; this is an usage with relations and friends, brothers and sisters, at meeting; hence Heunischius refers this to the time when the saints shall meet Christ in the clouds, who will be admitted to the nearest embraces of him, with unspeakable pleasure, and enjoy him to all eternity; <p>yea, I should not be despised; for taking such freedom with Christ, her brother. Or, "they would not despise me" (t); neither men nor angels, for such an action, and still less God, the Father, Son, and Spirit; which she might conclude from the relation between them, it being no more unseemly than for a sister to use such freedom with an own brother, even in the street; and from the reception she had reason to believe she should meet with from Christ: who would not turn away his face from her, when she offered to kiss him, which would occasion shame and blushing. The whole expresses her boldness in professing Christ, without fear or shame, in the most public manner. <p>(q)  "quis det te?" Pagninus, Montanus, Marckius. (r) Targum in loc.

I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me; I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate. His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</span> The meaning seems to be this - Let our relation to one another be the highest and the purest and the most permanent possible. The sisterly relation is not merely one of affection, but one of blood. The bond between husband and wife may be broken by the caprice and weakness of human feeling, but nothing can destroy the bond of blood. "A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity" (<a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>); "There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother" (<a href="/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>). The brotherly bond represents the strength of the blood relationship. When to that is added personal affection, then the tie is perfect. Shulamith means that she would have their love freed from all the uncertainties of human fickleness. As symbolically interpreted, therefore, we take this whole passage to signify that the Church, when it is desiring the closest fellowship with the Saviour, would be lifted above all the temptations of earthly life, which so often lower the standard of Christian feeling and service. The words are specially impressive in the lips of the bride of Solomon. It is a testimony to the inspiration of the whole book that the voluptuous monarch, whose life fell so far below the ideal of a godly king, should yet, indirectly though still powerfully, condemn and rebuke his own departure from God, setting clearly before us the surpassing excellence of pure love and the sanctity of married life. In the Mug's address to his bride he called her "sister" and "sister-bride;" she now virtually returns his own sentiment and calls him "brother."' She shows that she has risen in her love far above the mere fleshly desires - "the lust of the fiesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life." She would blend her whole existence with that of her Lord. <span class="accented">I would</span> <span class="accented">kiss thee</span>; <span class="accented">yea, and none would despise me.</span> Nothing can more exquisitely and delicately express the fulness of affection. It is not merely a return for that which is given; it is free and spontaneous. So should our spiritual feelings be. They should be the natural outpouring of the soul towards the Saviour; not a worked up, artificial, spasmodic impulse, not a cold, dead formalism, not an unsympathetic service of conscience; but "doing the will of God from the heart." "Love is the fulfilling of the Law;" "Faith worketh by love." The second verse is differently rendered by some. Jerome, Venetian, and Luther take it as referring to the bride's dependence on her husband's superior wisdom - "Thou wouldest instruct me;" which, of course, is a very suitable sentiment as addressed to the wise King Solomon. The Targum expounds it thus: "I would conduct thee, O King Messiah, and bring thee into the house of my sanctuary; and thou wouldest teach me to fear God and to walk in his ways." Hitzig and our Revisers take the verb as in the third person feminine, and applied to the mother. "She would teach me as a mother teaches a young bride, from her own early experience." The old view that the bride is the personification of wisdom seems quite refuted by this speech of Shulamith's. She desires and waits for instruction. Solomon is wisdom. She is the soul of man, or the Church of God, delighting to sit at his feet and learn of him. Whichever rendering we choose, whether the mother or Solomon be regarded as teacher, the meaning is the same. It is, as Delitzsch has observed, a deep revelation of Shulamith's heart. "She knew how much she yet came short of being to the king all that a wife should be. But in Jerusalem the bustle of court life and the burden of his regal duties did not permit him to devote himself to her; in her mother's house, if he were once there, he would in. struct her, and she would requite him with her spiced wine and with the juice of the pomegranates." The "spiced wine," <span class="accented">vinum conditura</span>, aromatic wine, probably grape wine "mixed with fragrant and pungent  essences," as in the East. The juice, or pressed juice, of the pomegranate is a delicious drink. There is no allusion to any love symbol. The grains of the pomegranates were said by the Arabians to be from Paradise (cf. the <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, or "vinum de punicis quod roidem vocant" in Dioscorides and Pliny). Perhaps this reference to exchange of gifts may be taken as symbolizing the happy state of the Church when she pours out her treasures in response to the spiritual blessings which she is freely receiving. The meaning is something beautiful and precious. And that is the highest state of religious life when the service we render and the gifts we place on the altar are felt to be the grateful sacrifices of our hearts under a sense of Divine love. When the Church of Christ depends for its support on such fellowship between itself and the Saviour there will be no limits to its attainments, no achievements beyond its powers. "All that see" such a state of the Church "shall acknowledge" the glory of it, "that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed" (see the whole of the sixty-first chapter of Isaiah, which breathes the very spirit of Solomon's Song). The rejoicing bride then gives herself up to the thought of her husband's affection. In that beautiful simplicity and purity of her childhood's life she would realize the bliss of her new relation. Delitzsch describes her state of mind thus: "Resigning herself dreamily to the idea that Solomon is her brother, whom she may freely and openly kiss, and her teacher besides, with whom she may sit in confidential intercourse under her mother's eye, she feels herself as if closely embraced by him, and calls from a distance to the daughters of Jerusalem not to disturb this her happy enjoyment." Perhaps the sense of weakness and dependence is meant to be expressed. The bride is conscious that her lord is everything to her. In that identification which the highest love brings vividly into the soul, there is the joy of exultation. "All things are ours; and we are Christ's, and Christ is God's." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/songs/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Solomon now looks on the wife of his youth, she stands before him like a palm tree with its splendid leaf-branches, which the Arabians call ucht insn (the sisters of men); and like a vine which climbs up on the wall of the house, and therefore is an emblem of the housewife, <a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>.<p>7 Thy stature is like the palm tree;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy breasts clusters.<p>8 I:thought: I will climb the palm,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Grasp its branches;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy breasts shall be to me<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As clusters of the vine,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And the breath of thy nose like apples,<p>Shulamith stands before him.

But looking back, he can say that in view of this august attractive beauty the one thought filled him, to secure possession of her and of the enjoyment which she promised; as one climbs (&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; with &#1489;&#1468;, as <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>) a palm tree and seizes (&#1488;&#1495;&#1494;, fut. &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;, and &#1488;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494; with &#1489;&#1468;, as at <a href="/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a>) its branches (&#1505;&#1504;&#1505;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, so called, as it appears, <p>(Note: Also that &#1505;&#1504;&#1505;&#1503; is perhaps equivalent to &#1505;&#1500;&#1505;&#1500; (&#1494;&#1500;&#1494;&#1500;, &#1514;&#1500;&#1514;&#1500;), to wave hither and thither, comes here to view.)<p>after the feather-like pointed leaves proceeding from the mid-rib on both sides), in order to break off the fulness of the sweet fruit under its leaves. As the cypress (sarwat), so also the palm is with the Moslem poets the figure of a loved one, and with the mystics, of God; <p>(Note: Vid., Hfiz, ed. Brockhaus, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/46.htm">2 Peter 46</a>.)<p>and accordingly the idea of possession is here particularly intended. &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488; denotes what he then thought and aimed at. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;,   Sol 7:9, the punctuation &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; is undoubtedly to be preferred. The figure of the palm tree terminates with the words, "will grasp its branches." It was adequate in relation to stature, but less so in relation to the breasts; for dates are of a long oval form, and have a stony kernel. Therefore the figure departs from the date clusters to that of grape clusters, which are more appropriate, as they swell and become round and elastic the more they ripen. The breath of the nose, which is called &#1488;&#1507;, from breathing hard, is that of the air breathed, going in and out through it; for, as a rule, a man breathes through his nostrils with closed mouth. Apples present themselves the more naturally for comparison, that the apple has the name &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (from &#1504;&#1508;&#1495;, after the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;), from the fragrance which it exhales. </body></html>
