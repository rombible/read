That of Heman names twenty ancestors for the same period of time. This is one more illustration of the common usage of overleaping names in these genealogies.<p>(39) <span class= "bld">His brother Asaph.</span>—Asaph was Heman’s brother (1) as a Levite; (2) as a choir-master.<p>The striking agreement of the line of Heman with that of the Kohathites, detailed in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-22.htm" title="The sons of Kohath; Amminadab his son, Korah his son, Assir his son,">1Chronicles 6:22-28</a> above, has led critics to look for a like coincidence between the line of Asaph as given here, and that of the Gershonites in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-20.htm" title="Of Gershom; Libni his son, Jahath his son, Zimmah his son,">1Chronicles 6:20-21</a>.

Still we observe that in the former passage the three names, Jahath, Zimmah, and Zerah appear in <span class= "ital">the same order of lineal descent</span> from Gershon as in the present list; while the Adaiah of <a href="/1_chronicles/6-41.htm" title="The son of Ethni, the son of Zerah, the son of Adaiah,">1Chronicles 6:41</a> obviously answers to the Iddo of <a href="/1_chronicles/6-21.htm" title="Joah his son, Iddo his son, Zerah his son, Jeaterai his son.">1Chronicles 6:21</a>, and Ethni (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-41.htm" title="The son of Ethni, the son of Zerah, the son of Adaiah,">1Chronicles 6:41</a>) is in Hebrew writing not unlike Jeaterai; and we are already familiar with the fact that genealogies sometimes recur in abbreviated forms.

Heman is named first as being the head of the choir of singers who stood in the centre, while Asaph and his choir stood on his right hand, and on the left Ethan and his choir, so that when they sang in concert the conducting of the whole fell to Heman.
