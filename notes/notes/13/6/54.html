In Joshua the number of cities taken from each group of tribes and given to its respective division of the Levites is first stated, no city being named; and next the names of the cities are given under each division of the Levites and under the name of the tribe from which the cities were taken. In Chron. the cities given to the Aaronites are first mentioned by name and reckoned to be thirteen In number (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-55.htm" title="And they gave them Hebron in the land of Judah, and the suburbs thereof round about it....">1 Chronicles 6:55-60</a>); next the cities given to each remaining division of the Levites are reckoned shortly by number only (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-61.htm" title="And to the sons of Kohath, which were left of the family of that tribe, were cities given out of the half tribe, namely, out of the half tribe of Manasseh, by lot, ten cities....">1 Chronicles 6:61-63</a>); lastly, these cities are separately reckoned at length by name only (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-66.htm" title="And the residue of the families of the sons of Kohath had cities of their coasts out of the tribe of Ephraim....">1 Chronicles 6:66-81</a>). This rearrangement is not happy; perhaps the Chronicler originally intended to give the Aaronite cities only by name as well as number, and so <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-66.htm" title="And the residue of the families of the sons of Kohath had cities of their coasts out of the tribe of Ephraim....">1 Chronicles 6:66-81</a> (containing the names of the non-Aaronite cities) may be a supplement to the original text. Notice that no names of cities taken from Simeon are given; cp. <a href="/1_chronicles/6-65.htm" title="And they gave by lot out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, and out of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, these cities, which are called by their names.">1 Chronicles 6:65</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-9.htm" title="And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name.">Joshua 21:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(Critical Note on 54–81.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The text of the passage has suffered in transcription.

But the omission and the alteration of individual names of places occasion some delay. Our ver. 55 is given somewhat more fully in <a href="/joshua/21-11.htm">Joshua 21:11</a>; our ver. 56 is identical with <a href="/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12</a>; and our vers. 57-60 correspond substantially with <a href="/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13-19</a>, but from this latter source we are glad to supply the two names Juttah and Gibeon, without which we cannot add up correctly the <span class="cmt_word">thirteen cities</span> of ver. 60. Also in Joshua, our <span class="cmt_word">Hilen, Ashan</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Alemsth</span> appear as <span class="accented">Holon</span>, <span class="accented">Ain</span>, and <span class="accented">Almon</span> respectively, although in regard to the intermediate name of these three the places cannot be accepted as identical, for they are mentioned side by side in <a href="/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a> and in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-32.htm">1 Chronicles 4:32</a>, but we must admit an error involved. Ver. 56 (see <a href="/joshua/14-14.htm">Joshua 14:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12</a>). Ver. 61 seems to be an anticipation of vers. 66-70, with which verses, if we incorporate it, we shall obtain substantially the same results as are found in <a href="/joshua/21-5.htm">Joshua 21:5, 20-26</a>; but again we are glad of the latter source to supply for us the two places, Eltekeh and Gibbethon, necessary to enable us to count up the <span class="cmt_word">ten cities</span> of our ver. 61, while our <span class="cmt_word">Jokmeam, Aner</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Bileam</span> appear as probably the corrected readings of <span class="accented">Kibzaim</span>, <span class="accented">Tanach</span>, and <span class="accented">Gath-rimmon</span> respectively in Joshua. The sons of Kohath.., left (ver. 61), the residue (Authorized Version, ver. 66), the remnant (ver. 70), point (as above) to the non-priestly descendants in the Kohath line. Summing up, we see that the Kohathite <span class="accented">priests</span> had thirteen cities from the allotments of Judah and Simeon and Benjamin, and the Ko-hathite non-priests had ten, from Ephraim, Dan, and West Manasseh. One might detect in all this some germ of the more modern parochial system, so far at least as regards the distributed residence of a clerical and ministerial order, though not with sacred buildings similarly distributed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33-34</a>).
