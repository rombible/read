The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The genealogy of the high priestly stem to the captivity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

According to Josephus (e), and other Jewish writers (f), in the times of Uzzi, <a href="/1_chronicles/6-6.htm">1 Chronicles 6:6</a> the priesthood was translated into the family of Ithamar, of which Eli was the first high priest; where it continued to the times of Solomon, when it was restored to Zadok, of the line of Eleazar. It is particularly observed of Azariah, <a href="/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a> that he it was that executed the priest's office in the temple built by Solomon; not that he was the first that officiated in it, that was Zadok; but this seems to be Azariah, who was the high priest in the times of Uzziah, who opposed him when he would have offered incense in the temple, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17</a>, which may be the reason why he is so particularly taken notice of here; though some think this is to be understood of Johanan, the father of Azariah, supposed to the same with Jehoiada, who, in the times of Athaliah, was the instrument of preserving both church and state, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>, the temple in which he ministered is described as built by Solomon, because at the time of the writing of this there was another temple built, or building, by Zerubbabel. <p>(e) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 11. sect. 5.

The sons of Manasseh are not the subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, but the Reubenites and Manassites, as is clear from <a href="/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>. These fell away faithlessly from the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God had destroyed before them, i.e., the Amorites or Canaanites. "And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of the Assyrian kings Pul and Tiglath-pilneser, and he (this latter) led them away captives to Halah and Habor," etc. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, Lavater has rightly rendered, "in mentem illis dedit, movit eos, ut expeditionem facerent contra illos;" cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>. Pul is mentioned as being the first Assyrian king who attacked the land of Israel, cf. <a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>. The deportation began, however, only with Tiglath-pileser, who led the East-Jordan tribes into exile, <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>. To him &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500;&#1501; sing. refers. The suffix is defined by the following acc., &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;; &#1500; is, according to the later usage, nota acc.; cf. Ew. 277, e. So also before the name &#1495;&#1500;&#1495;, "to Halah," i.e., probably the district &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; (in Strabo) on the east side of the Tigris near Adiabene, to the north of Nineveh, on the frontier of Armenia (cf. on <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). In the second book of Kings (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-29.htm">1 Chronicles 15:29</a>) the district to which the two and a half tribes were sent as exiles is not accurately determined, being only called in general Asshur (Assyria). The names in our verse are there (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>) the names of the districts to which Shalmaneser sent the remainder of the ten tribes after the destruction of the kingdom of Israel. It is therefore questionable whether the author of the Chronicle took his account from an authority used by him, or if he names these districts only according to general recollection, in which the times of Shalmaneser and of Tiglath-pileser are not very accurately distinguished (Berth.). We consider the first supposition the more probable, not merely because he inverts the order of the names, but mainly because he gives the name &#1492;&#1512;&#1488; instead of "the cities of Media," as it is in Kings, and that name he could only have obtained from his authorities. &#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; is not the river Chaboras in Mesopotamia, which falls into the Euphrates near Circesium, for that river is called in Ezekiel &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, but is a district in northern Assyria, where Jakut mentions that there is both a mountain &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; on the frontier of Assyria and Media (Ptolem. vi. 1), and a river Khabur Chasaniae, which still bears the old name Khbur, rising in the neighbourhood of the upper Zab, near Amadijeh, and falling into the Tigris below Jezirah. This Khbur is the river of Gozan (vide on <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). The word &#1492;&#1512;&#1488; appears to be the Aramaic form of the Hebrew &#1492;&#1512;, mountains, and the vernacular designation usual in the mouths of the people of the mountain land of Media, which is called also in Arabic el Jebl (the mountains). This name can therefore only have been handed down from the exiles who dwelt there. </body></html>
