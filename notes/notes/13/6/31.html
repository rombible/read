It was given to David to settle the ark after its travels through the wilderness, its sojourn in various places since then, doubtless always within the care of some Levitical family (except when taken by enemies, <a href="/1_samuel/4-11.htm">1 Samuel 4:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5, 6</a>.), and in especial its prolonged twenty years' sojourn at Kirjath-jearim (<a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1, 2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-19</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-3.htm">1 Chronicles 13:3-14</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-1.htm">1 Chronicles 15:1-3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/17-5.htm">1 Chronicles 17:5</a>). It now had rest, though its place of rest was only within "curtains" (<a href="/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/17-1.htm">1 Chronicles 17:1</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a special separate tent prepared for it by David, which tent was probably the suggestion, and as it were the nucleus, of the coming grand temple itself - the house of God. The event was naturally one of great joy and thanksgiving, of which David himself was the chief leader (<a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17-21</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-1.htm">1 Chronicles 16:1-3</a>); but it appears also that it furnished the occasion of appointing fixed choir conductors, leaders of the service of song" (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-4.htm">1 Chronicles 16:4-7, 37, 41, 42</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1-7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10-15</a>). "And the sons of Elkanah, Amasai and Ahimoth." As it is clear that with &#1488;&#1500;&#1511; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500; a new list begins, and that the preceding enumeration is that of the descendants of Abiasaph, it is at once suggested that this Elkanah was the brother of the Abiasaph mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-15.htm">1 Chronicles 6:15</a>. If, however, we compare the genealogy of Heman, we find there (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-36.htm">1 Chronicles 6:36</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/6-35.htm">1 Chronicles 6:35</a>) a list of the descendants of Joel in an ascending line, thus, - Elkanah, Amasai, Mahath, Elkanah, Zuph; from which it would seem to follow that our Elkanah is the son of Moel mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-36.htm">1 Chronicles 6:36</a>, for Ahimoth may be without difficulty considered to be another form of the name Mahath. This conclusion would be assured if only the beginning of <a href="/1_chronicles/6-26.htm">1 Chronicles 6:26</a> were in harmony with it. In this verse, indeed, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; &#1488;&#1500;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, as we read in the Kethibh, may be without difficulty taken to mean that Elkanah was the son of Ahimoth, just as in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-20.htm">1 Chronicles 6:20</a> Elkanah is introduced as son of Mahath. But in this way no meaning can be assigned to the &#1488;&#1500;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; which follows &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;, and Bertheau accordingly is of opinion that this &#1488;&#1500;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; has come into the text by an error. The Masoretes also felt the difficulty, and have substituted for the Kethibh &#1489;&#1504;&#1493; the Keri &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, but then nothing can be made of the first &#1488;&#1500;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-26.htm">1 Chronicles 6:26</a>. Beyond doubt the traditional text is here corrupt, and from a comparison of <a href="/1_chronicles/6-35.htm">1 Chronicles 6:35</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/6-34.htm">1 Chronicles 6:34</a> the only conclusion we can draw with any certainty is that the list from &#1510;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497; onwards contains the names of descendants of Elkanah the son of Mahath, which is so far favourable to the Keri &#1488;&#1500;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;. The name Elkanah, on the contrary, which immediately precedes &#1489;&#1504;&#1493;, seems to point to a hiatus in the text, and gives room for the conjecture that in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a> the sons of Elkanah, the brother of Abiasaph and Assir, were named, and that there followed thereupon an enumeration of the sons or descendants of the Elkanah whom we meet with in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-36.htm">1 Chronicles 6:36</a> as son of Joel, after which came the names Elkanah &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;, Zophai &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;, etc. &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; and &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;&#1489; we consider to be other forms of &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1495; and &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-34.htm">1 Chronicles 6:34</a>, and &#1510;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497; is only another form of &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;. The succeeding names, Jeroham and Elkanah (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-27.htm">1 Chronicles 6:27</a>), agree with those in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-34.htm">1 Chronicles 6:34</a>; but between the clauses "Elkanah his son" (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-27.htm">1 Chronicles 6:27</a>), and "and the sons of Samuel" (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-28.htm">1 Chronicles 6:28</a>), the connecting link &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>, is again wanting, as is also, before or after &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512; (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-28.htm">1 Chronicles 6:28</a>), the name of the first-born, viz., Joel; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a> with <a href="/1_samuel/8-2.htm">1 Samuel 8:2</a>. Now, although the two last-mentioned omissions can be supplied, they yet show that the enumeration in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-22.htm">1 Chronicles 6:22</a> is not a continuous list of one Kohathite family, but contains only fragments of several Kohathite genealogies. - In <a href="/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-30.htm">1 Chronicles 6:30</a>, descendants of Merari follow; sons of Mahli in six generations, who are not mentioned elsewhere. Bertheau compares this list of names, Mahli, Libni, Shimei, Uzza, Shimea, Haggiah, and Asaiah, with the list contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44</a>, Mushi, Mahli, Shamer, Bani, Amzi, Hilkiah, and Amaziah, and attempts to maintain, notwithstanding the great difference in the names, that the two lists were originally identical, in order to find support for the hypothesis "that the three lists in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-20.htm">1 Chronicles 6:20</a> have not found a place in the Chronicle from their own intrinsic value, or, in other words, have not been introduced there in order to give a register of the ancestors of Jeaterai, the sons of Samuel and Asaiah, but have been received only because they bring us to Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-34.htm">1 Chronicles 6:34</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-39.htm">1 Chronicles 6:39</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44</a>, in another fashion than the lists of names in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>." But this hypothesis is shown to be false, apart altogether from the other objections which might be raised against it, by the single fact of the total discrepancy between the names of the Merarites in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/6-30.htm">1 Chronicles 6:30</a> and those found in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44-47</a>. Of all the six names only Mahli is found in both cases, and he is carefully distinguished in both - in the genealogy of Ethan as the son of Mushi and grandson of Merari; in our list as the son of Merari. When we remember that Merari had two sons, Mahli and Mushi, after whom the father's-houses into which his descendants divided themselves were named (<a href="/numbers/3-20.htm">Numbers 3:20</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-58.htm">Numbers 26:58</a>), and that the same names very frequently occur in different families, it would never suggest itself to any reader of our register to identify the line of Mushi with the line of Mahli, seeing that, except the name of Mahli the son of Mushi, which is the same as that of his uncle, all the other names are different. <a href="/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/6-30.htm">1 Chronicles 6:30</a> contain a register of the family of Mahli, while the ancestors of Ethan, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44-47</a>, belonged to the family of Mushi. Our list then absolutely cannot be intended to form a transition to Ethan or Ethan's ancestors. The same may be said of the two other lists <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-20.htm">1 Chronicles 6:20-22</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-23.htm">1 Chronicles 6:23-28</a>, and this transition hypothesis is consequently a mere airspun fancy. The three lists are certainly not embodied in the Chronicle on account of the persons with whose names they end-Jeaterai, the sons of Samuel, and Asaiah; but the author of the Chronicle has thought them worthy of being received into his work as registers of ancient families of the three sons of Levi which had been transmitted from ancient times. </body></html>
