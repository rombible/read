Zophai might mean the Zophite. The LXX. has (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-25.htm" title="And the sons of Elkanah; Amasai, and Ahimoth.">1Chronicles 6:25</a>) “And sons of Elkanah, Amessi and Ahimoth;” (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-26.htm" title="As for Elkanah: the sons of Elkanah; Zophai his son, and Nahath his son,">1Chronicles 6:26</a>) “Elkanah his son, Souphi his son,” &c. So the Syriac. That this is correct appears from comparison of Heman’s pedigree (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-35.htm" title="The son of Zuph, the son of Elkanah, the son of Mahath, the son of Amasai,">1Chronicles 6:35</a>). The second Elkanah in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-26.htm" title="As for Elkanah: the sons of Elkanah; Zophai his son, and Nahath his son,">1Chronicles 6:26</a> is therefore an intrusion, due perhaps to some scribe who remembered <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm" title="Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:">1Samuel 1:1</a>, where Zophim occurs just before Elkanah. In <a href="/1_chronicles/6-35.htm" title="The son of Zuph, the son of Elkanah, the son of Mahath, the son of Amasai,">1Chronicles 6:35</a> Elkanah is son of Mahath, son of Amasai.

Zophai is to Zuph (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-35.htm" title="The son of Zuph, the son of Elkanah, the son of Mahath, the son of Amasai,">1Chronicles 6:35</a>) as Chelubai (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-9.htm" title="The sons also of Hezron, that were born to him; Jerahmeel, and Ram, and Chelubai.">1Chronicles 2:9</a>) to Chelub (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-11.htm" title="And Chelub the brother of Shuah begat Mehir, which was the father of Eshton.">1Chronicles 4:11</a>). Nahath looks like a transformation of Toah (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-34.htm" title="The son of Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Eliel, the son of Toah,">1Chronicles 6:34</a>), and Eliab (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-27.htm" title="Eliab his son, Jeroham his son, Elkanah his son.">1Chronicles 6:27</a>)—“<span class= "ital">El</span> is father”—may be a by-form of Eliel (<span class= "ital">ibid.</span>) “<span class= "ital">El</span> is el.” Jeroham and Elkanah go back to Eliel in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-34.htm" title="The son of Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Eliel, the son of Toah,">1Chronicles 6:34</a>, just as they spring from Eliab here.

The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of Gershom - The names in this list are curiously different from those in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-41.htm">1 Chronicles 6:41-43</a>, which yet appear to represent the same line reversed.
