The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto the sons of Kohath which were left - i. e. to such of them as were not priests.<p>Out of the half tribe ... ten cities - The half tribe furnished two cities only (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-70.htm">1 Chronicles 6:70</a>, and compare <a href="/joshua/21-25.htm">Joshua 21:25</a>).
