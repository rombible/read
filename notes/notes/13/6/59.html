The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve their descent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spirit of God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to the families they came from; and then, as now, though believers and ministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great High Priest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but through his atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The writer evidently had before him <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21</a>, which he followed, as to its matter, closely. In some cases he perhaps modernised the ancient names (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-58.htm">1 Chronicles 6:58</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-60.htm">1 Chronicles 6:60</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-72.htm">1 Chronicles 6:72</a>, etc.); in a few he substituted for the old an entirely new name, the modern apellation, probably, of the ancient site <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-70.htm">1 Chronicles 6:70</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/6-77.htm">1 Chronicles 6:77</a>. At one time, it would seem, his intention was to give the cities of the priests only, and to content himself with stating the mere number of the rest. His account of the matter was then brought to a conclusion, and summed up, in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-64.htm">1 Chronicles 6:64</a>. But, afterward, either he or a later writer thought it best to add to the list of the priestly cities the information contained in Judges as to those which were not priestly, but merely Levitical. The passage <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-65.htm">1 Chronicles 6:65-81</a> was then added.<p>The entire account has suffered much from corruption. In the first list two names, those of Juttah and Gideon, have dropped out. It is necessary to restore them in order to complete the number of thirteen cities <a href="/1_chronicles/6-60.htm">1 Chronicles 6:60</a>. In the second list <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-67.htm">1 Chronicles 6:67-70</a> there is likewise an omission of two cities, Eltekeh and Gibbethon, which are wanted to make up the number ten <a href="/1_chronicles/6-61.htm">1 Chronicles 6:61</a>. The third list is complete, though some of the names are very different from these of Joshua. In the fourth, two names are again wanting, those of Jokneam and Kartah.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 6:49-81.

The Jews say (h), the cities of the suburbs (those here mentioned) ceased from the time the first temple was destroyed; and yet Ezra, who lived after the captivity, and the building the second temple, here gives a very particular account of them; the suburbs belonging to every city, which he particularly mentions, were 2000 cubits, both to the cities of refuge, and the rest, <a href="/numbers/35-5.htm">Numbers 35:5</a> Hebron, the first city mentioned in the next verse, was a city of refuge, and had suburbs of such a space; and it is remarkable, that some of the temples with the Heathens, which were asylums, or places of refuge, had the space of 2000 paces assigned them for the same sanctity and privilege (i). <p>(h) T.
