Mere childhood in a prince is not always a misfortune to a nation, as there are instances of the government being wisely administered during a minority. Solomon himself is a most illustrious proof that a young prince may prove a great blessing; for when he was but a mere child, with respect to his age, no nation was happier. His father, however, made this address before Solomon was endowed with the divine gift of wisdom, and David's reference to his son's extreme youth, in connection with the great national undertaking he had been divinely appointed to execute, was to apologize to this assembly of the estates&#8212;or, rather, to assign the reason of his elaborate preparations for the work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Stones to be set; </span> diamonds, or emeralds, or rubies, or any of those precious stones which are usually set in rings or such things. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God,....
