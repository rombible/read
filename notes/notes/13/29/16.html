But the unsearchable riches of Christ exceed the splendour of the temple, infinitely more than that surpassed the meanest cottage on earth. Instead of boasting of these large oblations, David gave solemn thanks to the Lord. All they gave for the Lord's temple was his own; if they attempted to keep it, death would soon have removed them from it.

Omitting the brass and iron, and precious stones, which, though specified partly (1Ch 29:7), are represented in other portions as "without weight" (1Ch 22:3, 14), we shall give in this table only the amount of gold and silver; and taking the talent of gold as worth &pound;5475 (the talent being 125 pounds in weight), the value of the gold will be about 73s. per ounce. The talent of silver is given at &pound;342 3s. 9d., or 4s. 4&frac12;d. per ounce. The total amount of the contributions will be:<p>Sum accumulated, and in public treasury (1Ch 22:14):       Gold &pound;547,500,000       Silver 342,187,500 Contributed by David from his private resources [1Ch 29:4]:       Gold 16,425,000       Silver 2,395,312 Contributed by the assembled rulers [1Ch 29:7]:       Gold 28,000,000       Silver 3,421,875 A grand total of approximately &pound;939,929,687<p>Though it has been the common practice of Eastern monarchs to hoard vast sums for the accomplishment of any contemplated project, this amount so far exceeds not only every Oriental collection on record, but even the bounds of probability, that it is very generally allowed that either there is a corruption of the text in 1Ch 22:14, or that the reckoning of the historian was by the Babylonian, which was only a half, or the Syrian, which was only a fifth part, of the Hebrew talent.

Since according to the divine decree, not he, the man of war, but his son, the peace-king Solomon, was to build a temple to the Lord, David had taken it upon himself to prepare as far as possible for the carrying out of the work. He had also found the princes and chiefs of the people willing to further it, and to assist his son Solomon in it. In this the pious and grey-haired servant of the Lord saw a special proof of the divine favour, for which he must thank God the Lord before the whole congregation. He praises Jahve, "the God of Israel our father," <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-10.htm">1 Chronicles 29:10</a>, or, as it is in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-18.htm">1 Chronicles 29:18</a>, "the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, our fathers." Jahve had clearly revealed himself to David and his people as the God of Israel and of the patriarchs, by fulfilling in so glorious a manner to the people of Israel, by David, the promises made to the patriarchs. God the Lord had not only by David made His people great and powerful, and secured to them the peaceful possession of the good land, by humbling all their enemies round about, but He had also awakened in the heart of the people such love to and trust in their God, that the assembled dignitaries of the kingdom showed themselves perfectly willing to assist in furthering the building of the house of God. In this God had revealed His greatness, power, glory, etc., as David (in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/29-12.htm">1 Chronicles 29:12</a>) acknowledges with praise: "Thine, Jahve, is the greatness," etc. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1510;&#1495;, according to the Aramaic usage, gloria, splendour, honour. &#1499;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, yea all, still dependent on &#1500;&#1498; at the commencement of the sentence, so that we do not need to supply &#1500;&#1498; after &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. "Thine is the dominion, and the raising of oneself to be head over all." In His &#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; God reveals His greatness, might, glory, etc. &#1502;&#1502;&#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; is not a participle requiring &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, "thou art," to be supplied (Berth.), but an appellative, an Aramaic infinitive, - the raising oneself (Ew. 160, e). </body></html>
