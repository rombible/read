David Causes the Princes and People to Offer for the House of God.<p>1, 2. Solomon &#8230; is yet young and tender&#8212;Though Solomon was very young when he was raised to the sovereign power, his kingdom escaped the woe pronounced (Ec 10:16). Mere childhood in a prince is not always a misfortune to a nation, as there are instances of the government being wisely administered during a minority. Solomon himself is a most illustrious proof that a young prince may prove a great blessing; for when he was but a mere child, with respect to his age, no nation was happier. His father, however, made this address before Solomon was endowed with the divine gift of wisdom, and David's reference to his son's extreme youth, in connection with the great national undertaking he had been divinely appointed to execute, was to apologize to this assembly of the estates&#8212;or, rather, to assign the reason of his elaborate preparations for the work.David, by his example and entreaty, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_chronicles/29-1.htm" title="Furthermore David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God....">1 Chronicles 29:1-5</a></span>, causes the princes and people to offer willingly, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_chronicles/27-6.htm" title="This is that Benaiah, who was mighty among the thirty, and above the thirty: and in his course was Ammizabad his son....">1 Chronicles 27:6-9</a></span>.

The additional expression here is to be noticed, <span class="cmt_word">whom alone God hath chosen</span>. By this plea, full of truth as it was, we may suppose that David would shelter himself from any possible blame or reflection on the part of the people, from the charge of partiality on the part of his elder children, and any unjust slight to them, and also from any <span class="accented">self-reproach</span>, in that he was devolving such a responsible task on so <span class="cmt_word">young and tender</span> a man. <span class="cmt_word">Palace</span>. This word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), by which the temple is designated here and in ver. 19, seems to be very probably a word of Persian derivation. It is found in <a href="/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1</a>; in <a href="/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>; but very frequently in Esther, where it is used not only of "Shushan the palace" (<a href="/esther/1-2.htm">Esther 1:2</a>; <a href="/esther/2-3.htm">Esther 2:3</a>; <a href="/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>), as the royal abode, but also of the special part of the city adjoining the palace proper (<a href="/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5</a>; <a href="/esther/2-5.htm">Esther 2:5</a>; <a href="/esther/8-14.htm">Esther 8:14</a>; <a href="/esther/9-6.htm">Esther 9:6</a>). The word is found also in <a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>; but there it carries the signification of the fortress of the temple. There may be some special appropriateness in its use here, in consideration of the circumstance of the fortifications and wall, which flanked the temple. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1492;&#1498; &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; (continuation of &#1500;&#1488;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;), "and for the divisions of the priests and Levites, and for all the work of the service, and for all vessels," - for for all these purposes, viz., for the sojourn of the priests and Levites in the service, as well as for the performance of the necessary works, e.g., preparation of the shew-bread, cooking of the sacrificial flesh, holding of the sacrificial meals, and for the storing of the vessels necessary for these purposes, the cells and building of the courts were set apart. - With <a href="/1_chronicles/28-14.htm">1 Chronicles 28:14</a> begins the enumeration of the vessels. &#1500;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489; is co-ordinate with &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;...&#1500;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a> : he gave him the description of that which he had in mind "with regard to the golden (i.e., to the golden vessels, cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>), according to the weight of the golden, for all vessels of every service," in regard to all silver vessels according to the weight. - With <a href="/1_chronicles/28-15.htm">1 Chronicles 28:15</a> the construction hitherto employed is dropped. According to the usual supposition, the verb &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is to be supplied from <a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a> after &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;: "and gave him the weight for the golden candlesticks and their golden lamps," &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; being in a state of free subordination to the word &#1493;&#1504;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (J. H. Mich., Berth., and others). But apart from the fact that no analogous case can be found for such a subordination (for in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15</a>, which Berth. cites as such, there is no subordination, for there the first &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is the accusative of the material dependent upon &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;), the supplying of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; gives no suitable sense; for David here does not give Solomon the metal for the vessels, but, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>, only a &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, pattern or model for them. If &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; be supplied, &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; must be "he appointed," and so have a different sense here from that which it has in <a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>. This appears very questionable, and it is simpler to take &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500; without the article, as an accusative of nearer definition, and to connect the verse thus: "and (what he had in mind) as weight for the golden candlesticks and their lamps, in gold, according to the weight of each candlestick and its lamps, and for the silver candlesticks, in weight - &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1514;, according to the service of each candlestick" (as it corresponded to the service of each). - In <a href="/1_chronicles/28-16.htm">1 Chronicles 28:16</a> the enumeration is continued in very loose connection: "And as to the gold (&#1488;&#1514;, quoad; cf. Ew. 277, d) by weight (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;, acc. of free subordination) for the tables of the spreading out, i.e., of the shew-bread (&#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;  equals  &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;,   <a href="/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>); see on <a href="/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>), for each table, and silver for the silver tables." Silver tables, i.e., tables overlaid with silver-lamin, and silver candlesticks (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-15.htm">1 Chronicles 28:15</a>), are not elsewhere expressly mentioned among the temple vessels, since the whole of the vessels are nowhere individually registered even in the description of the building of the temple. Yet, when the temple was repaired under Joash, <a href="/2_kings/12-14.htm">2 Kings 12:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-14.htm">2 Chronicles 24:14</a>, and when it was destroyed by the Chaldeans, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>, vessels of gold and silver are spoken of. The silver candlesticks were probably, as Kimchi has conjectured, intended for the priests engaged in the service, and the tables for reception of the sacrificial flesh after it had been prepared for burning upon the altar.</body></html>
