The meaning is, that whoever would contribute voluntarily, as he had done, would be offering a freewill offering to the Lord. It was a sacrifice which every one of them could make, and in presenting which the offerer himself would be the priest. David, in asking freewill offerings for the temple, imitated the conduct of Moses in reference to the tabernacle (Ex 25:1-8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To consecrate his service, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">to fill his hand</span>, i.e. to offer an offering, as <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/32-29.htm" title="For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man on his son, and on his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day.">Exodus 32:29</a> <a href="/leviticus/8-33.htm" title="And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.">Leviticus 8:33</a></span>, as I have done. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The gold for things of gold, the silver for things of silver,....
