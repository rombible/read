But the unsearchable riches of Christ exceed the splendour of the temple, infinitely more than that surpassed the meanest cottage on earth. Instead of boasting of these large oblations, David gave solemn thanks to the Lord. All they gave for the Lord's temple was his own; if they attempted to keep it, death would soon have removed them from it. They only use they could make of it to their real advantage, was, to consecrate it to the service of Him who gave it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The people rejoiced for that they offered willingly - i. e., the munificence of the princes and officers <a href="/1_chronicles/29-6.htm">1 Chronicles 29:6</a> caused general joy among the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 29:10-25.

"Our historian uses the words used in his time to designate the current gold coins, without intending to assume that there were darics in use in the time of David, to state in a way intelligible to his readers the amount of the sum contributed by the princes" (Bertheau). This perfectly correct remark does not, however, explain why the author of the Chronicle has stated the contribution in gold and that in silver in different values, in talents and in darics, since the second cannot be an explanation of the first, the two sums being different. Probably the sum in darics is the amount which they contributed in gold pieces received as coins; the talents, on the other hand, probably represent the weight of the vessels and other articles of gold which they brought as offerings for the building. The amount contributed in silver is not large when compared with that in gold: 10,000 talents  equals  3,500,000, or one half that amount. The contribution in copper also, 18,000 talents, is not very large. Besides these, those who had stones, i.e., precious stones, also brought them. &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, that was found with him, for: that which he (each one) had of stones they gave. The sing. &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; is to be taken distributively, and is consequently carried on in the plural, &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;; cf.
