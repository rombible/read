Others calculate the value of the gold to reach thirty millions, and of the silver three millions of our money (see Conder's 'Bible Handbook,' 2nd edit., pp. 63-65, 81). The situation of Ophir is still considered undetermined. The other occasions on which it is mentioned are as follows: - <a href="/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a> (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-23.htm">1 Chronicles 1:23</a>); <a href="/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-49.htm">1 Kings 22:49</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/8-18.htm">2 Chronicles 8:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-10.htm">2 Chronicles 9:10</a>; <a href="/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>; <a href="/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-10.htm">Psalm 45:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a>. It must be understood also that it is to it that allusion is made in <a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>, where we read that silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks, beside the gold, were imported into Judaea from it. The "almug" tree is also said to have been brought in the same ships which brought the gold of Ophir. The Septuagint always translates by some form of the word <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> (except in <a href="/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>), which word comes very near the Coptic name for India. There is also a place in India, mentioned by Ptolemy, Ammianus, and Abulfeda, the site of the present <span class="accented">emporium</span> of Goa, called <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, and which would explain Both the Hebrew and the Septuagint words. An Indian site for Ophir would also well suit the mention of the ivory and the particular wood which the ships brought. On the other hand, the first occasion of this name Ophir finds it placed among the tribes of <span class="accented">Joktan's</span> descendants, who occupied South Arabia. It is there (<a href="/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-23.htm">1 Chronicles 1:23</a>) placed between Sheba and Havilah, beth abounding in gold. There are other considerations that favour Arabia. Many other places have been suggested, and some of them supported by respectable authorities, such as Eastern Africa, South America and Peru, Phrygia, etc. If there be a real question about it, to the prejudice of Arabia, it would be to India we must look. That some of the commodities brought belonged more especially to India, though even in that case the majority belonged undoubtedly to Arabia, is very true. This circumstance throws great probability into the suggestion that whether Ophir were in Arabia or India, it was a great <span class="accented">emporium</span>, and not simply an exporter of its own particular produce (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>; Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). The last sentence of this verse certainly says that the destined use of the <span class="cmt_word">refined silver</span>, as well as of the <span class="cmt_word">gold of Ophir, was to overlay the walls of the houses</span>. We know that gold was used for this purpose (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-5.htm">2 Chronicles 3:5-10</a>). But we do not read of the silver being used for <span class="accented">overlaying</span> purposes. We also read that none of the drinking-vessels of Solomon were of <span class="accented">silver</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> "it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon" (<a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20</a>). It is possible, the order of the-sentences notwithstanding, that the mention of the <span class="accented">refined silver</span> is only to pro-pare the way for the contents of ver. 5, and that it mast not be applied to the last sentence of our present verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In giving over to Solomon the model of all the parts and vessels of the temple enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11-18</a>, David said: "All this, viz., all the works of the pattern, has He taught by writing from the hand of Jahve which came upon me." &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; is more closely defined by the apposition &#1492;&#1514; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; . That the verse contains words of David is clear from &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;. The subject of &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; is Jahve, which is easily supplied from &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;. It is, however, a question with what we should connect &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;. Its position before the verb, and the circumstance that &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; construed with &#1506;&#1500; pers. does not elsewhere, occur, are against its being taken with &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;; and there remains, therefore, only the choice between connecting it with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491; and with &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;. In favour of the last, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, prescribed to me, may be compared; and according to that, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; can only mean, "what is prescribed to me;" cf. for the use of &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; for written prescription, the command in <a href="/2_chronicles/35-4.htm">2 Chronicles 35:4</a>. Bertheau accordingly translates &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;, "by a writing given to me for a rule from Jahve's hand," and understands the law of Moses to be meant, because the description of the holy things in <a href="/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1</a>. is manifestly the basis of that in our verses. But had David wished to say nothing further than that he had taken the law in the Scriptures for the basis of his pattern for the holy things, the expression which he employs would be exceedingly forced and wilfully obscure. And, moreover, the position of the words would scarcely allow us to connect &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489; with &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, for in that case we should rather have expected &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;. We must there take &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; along with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;: "writing from the hand of Jahve came upon me," i.e., according to the analogy of the phrase &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;   (<a href="/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>, etc.), a writing coming by divine revelation, or a writing composed in consequence of divine revelation, and founded upon divine inspiration. David therefore says that he had been instructed by a writing resting upon divine inspiration as to all the works of the pattern of the temple. This need not, however, be understood to mean that David had received exemplar vel ideam templi et vasorum sacrorum immediately from Jahve, either by a prophet or by vision, as the model of the tabernacle was shown to Moses on the mount (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="/exodus/27-8.htm">Exodus 27:8</a>); for it signifies only that he had not himself invented the pattern which he had committed to writings, i.e., the sketches and descriptions of the temple and its furniture and vessels, but had drawn them up under the influence of divine inspiration. </body></html>
