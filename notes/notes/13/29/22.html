As that appointment was hurried and, comparatively speaking, private, David now thought it best formally to invest Solomon a second time with the sovereignty, in the face of all Israel. For a similar reason a second and public appointment of Zadok alone to the high priest's office took place. Abiathar was not as yet absolutely thrust out; but it may be doubtful whether he was ever allowed to perform high priestly functions after his rebellion <a href="/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-27.htm">1 Kings 2:27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. before the Lord&#8212;either in the immediate vicinity of the ark, or, perhaps, rather in a religious and devout spirit, as partaking of a sacrificial meal.<p>made Solomon &#8230; king the second time&#8212;in reference to the first time, which was done precipitately on Adonijah's conspiracy (1Ki 1:35).<p>they &#8230; anointed &#8230; Zadok&#8212;The statement implies that his appointment met the popular approval.

And so this was done after David’s death, and not upon that day, when this feasting and solemnity lasted, as the words at first view seem to insinuate, this being related in the same verse, and immediately after the relation of the feast. But there are examples of things done at distant times put together in one verse, as <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/7-15.htm" title="So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,">Acts 7:15</a></span>, <span class="ital">So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers</span>, i.e. first <span class="ital">he</span>, and afterwards <span class="ital">our fathers</span>. So here, <span class="ital">They did eat on that day with great gladness</span>, and afterward <span class="ital">they made Solomon king the second time</span>. And this opinion seems to be confirmed by the following passages, in which it is related, that at this same time <span class="ital">they anointed Zadok to be priest</span> and that <span class="ital">Solomon was king instead of David</span>, and that <span class="ital">all Israel</span>, and <span class="ital">all David’s sons, submitted to him</span>; all which was not done till after David’s death, as may be gathered by comparing this with <span class="bld">1 Kings 1 1Ki 2</span>. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. In <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/23-1.htm" title="So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.">1 Chronicles 23:1</a></span>, where it is said that <span class="ital">David made Solomon his son king over Israel</span>, i.e. he declared him his successor. And so this second time was during David’s life. And what David had more privately declared, <span class="bld">1 Chronicles 23</span>, he now more solemnly owns in this great and general assembly, in which, by David’s order, and the consent of all that assembly, Solomon was anointed king, i.e. to be king after his father’s death. And this opinion the text seems most to favour. For it is said, <span class="ital">And they made Solomon king</span>, &c.: <span class="ital">they</span>; who? That must be fetched out of the foregoing words and verses, <span class="ital">they who did eat and drink before the Lord on that day with great gladness</span>, as it is here said; and then immediately it follows, and that with a copulative conjunction, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and they made Solomon king, </span>& c., which without violence cannot be pulled away from the foregoing words. And therefore they must be David and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">all the congregation, </span> who were then present, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/29-20.htm" title="And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.">1 Chronicles 29:20</a></span>, of whom it is said, <span class="ital">they sacrificed</span>, &c., <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/29-21.htm" title="And they sacrificed sacrifices to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings to the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:">1 Chronicles 29:21</a></span>, and they did eat, &c., and they made Solomon, &c. The great objection against this opinion is, that <span class="ital">they anointed Zadok to be priest</span> at this time, which was not done till after David’s death; for till then Abiathar was not thrust out from being priest, &c., <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm" title="And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.">1 Kings 2:26</a>,27</span>. This indeed is a difficulty, but not insoluble. It must be remembered that the high priest had his vicegerent who might officiate in his stead, when he was hindered by sickness or other indispensable occasion; and that there seems to be something more than ordinary in Zadok’s case; for although Abiathar was properly the high priest, yet Zadok seems after a sort to be joined in commission with him, as we see <span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/15-29.htm" title="Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.">2 Samuel 15:29</a> 19:11</span>; and it is expressly said, <span class="ital">Zadok and Abiathar were priests</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm" title="And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:">2 Samuel 20:25</a> <a href="/1_kings/4-4.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:">1 Kings 4:4</a></span>. And it may be further considered, that this anointing of Zadok might be occasioned by some miscarriage of Abiathar not recorded in Scripture. Possibly he was unsatisfied with this design of translating the crown to Solomon, and did now secretly favour Adonijah’s person and right, which afterward he did more openly defend; which being known to David by information, might induce him and the princes who favoured Solomon to take this course; which they might the more willingly do, in consideration of that Divine threatening, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.">1 Samuel 2:31</a></span>, &c., of translating the priesthood from Ithamar’s and Eli’s house, of which Abiathar was, to Eleazar’s line, to which it had been promised to perpetuity, <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/25-13.htm" title="And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.">Numbers 25:13</a></span>, of which line Zadok was. And they might judge this a fit season, or might be directed by God at this time, to execute that threatening to the one, and promise to the other family. And yet this action of theirs in anointing Zadok did not, as I suppose, actually constitute him high priest, but only settled the reversion of it upon him and his line after Abiathar’s death. Even as David’s making Solomon king, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/23-1.htm" title="So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.">1 Chronicles 23:1</a></span>, and their anointing <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Solomon to be the chief governor here, </span> did not put him into actual possession of the kingdom, but only gave him a right to it in reversion after the present king’s death, as Samuel’s anointing of David, <span class="bld">1 Samuel 16</span>, had done to David before him. Hence, notwithstanding this anointing, Abiathar continued to exercise his office till Solomon thrust him out, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/2-27.htm" title="So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.">1 Kings 2:27</a></span>; and even after he was removed from the execution of his office, yet he was reputed the priest till he died, being so called <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/4-4.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:">1 Kings 4:4</a></span>. And this I hope may in some sort resolve that difficulty. For the other arguments, they seem not considerable. For as for what follows, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_chronicles/29-23.htm" title="Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him....">1 Chronicles 29:23-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then Solomon sat on the throne</span>, &c., that indeed seems to belong to the time after David’s death, being sufficiently separated from <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/29-22.htm" title="And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness.
