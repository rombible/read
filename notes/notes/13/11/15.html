David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink &#8230; of the well of Beth-lehem&#8212;(See on [365]2Sa 23:15). This chivalrous act evinces the enthusiastic devotion of David's men, that they were ready to gratify his smallest wish at the risk of their lives. It is probable that, when uttering the wish, David had no recollection of the military posted at Beth-lehem. It is generally taken for granted that those who fought a way to the well of Beth-lehem were the three champions just mentioned [see on [366]1Ch 11:13]. But this is far from being clear. On the contrary, it would seem that three different heroes are referred to, for Abishai (1Ch 11:20) was one of them. The camp of the Philistines was in the valley of Rephaim (1Ch 11:15), which lay on the west of Jerusalem, but an outpost was stationed at Beth-lehem (1Ch 11:16), and through this garrison they had to force a passage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And inquired not of the Lord,....

Adullam, evidently a place of great antiquity (<a href="/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>:l, 12, 20), is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>; it was the seat then of a Canaanite king. It afterwards lay in Judah, in that lowland (called often the Shephelah) that ran from Joppa to Gaza, near the Mediterranean Sea. It kept name and fame to the last (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>). The "rock" marks the limestone cliffs of the region (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 254-259, edit. 1866). We read of it, as David's refuge (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1, 2</a>). From our present passage, and its parallel we should have concluded that it could not have been far from Bethlehem. In this sense Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 606, 607) refers to the tradition that fixes the cave at a spot now called <span class="accented">Khureitun</span>, between Bethlehem and the Dead Sea, and says, "Leaving our horses in charge of wild Arabs, and taking one Arab for a guide, we started for the cave, having a fearful gorge below, gigantic cliffs above, and the path winding along a shelf of the rock, narrow enough to make the nervous among us shudder. At length from a great rock, hanging on the edge of this shelf, we sprang by a long leap into a low window, which opened into the perpendicular face of the cliff. We were then within the hold of David, and creeping half-doubled through a narrow crevice for a few rods, we stood beneath the dark vault of the first grand chamber of this mysterious and oppressive cavern. Our whole collection of lights did little more than make the damp darkness visible. After groping about as long as we had Lime to spare, we returned to the light of day, fully convinced that, with David and his lion-hearted followers inside, all the strength of Israel under Saul could not have forced an entrance, and would not even have attempted it." <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">host</span>. For this word "host" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>) the parallel (<a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13</a>) has the "life of the Philistines" (but the Authorized Version, the "troop of"), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the beasts and cattle of the Philistines. So also the Syriac Version translates, The Septuagint shows in this place <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, and in Samuel <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">valley of Rephaim</span>. The situation of this notable valley is not certain. Yet there can be little doubt, in spite of Furst ('Handwortbuch,' 2:383), who supposes a situation north-west of Jerusalem, that it must be near Bethlehem, and therefore south-west of the city. The word employed Here for "valley" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> should mark an <span class="accented">enclosed</span> one. <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> means "giants."
