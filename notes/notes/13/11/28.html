The writer of Chronicles distinctly states that he gives the list as it stood at the time of David's becoming king over all Israel <a href="/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10</a>. The writer of Samuel does not assign his list to any definite period of David's reign, but probably delivers it to us as it was constituted at a later date. It is quite possible therefore that the names which occur only in Chronicles are those of persons who had died or quitted the army before the other list was made out, and that the new names in Samuel are the names of those who had taken their places.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23.htm">2 Samuel 23</a> thirty-two names are mentioned, which, with the above-mentioned three and two of the first and second classes, amount in all to thirty-seven men, as is expressly remarked in <a href="/2_samuel/23-39.htm">2 Samuel 23:39</a> at the conclusion. In the text of the Chronicle no number is mentioned, and the register is increased by sixteen names (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-41.htm">1 Chronicles 11:41-47</a>), which have been added in the course of time to the earlier number. The words &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-26.htm">1 Chronicles 11:26</a>, are to be regarded as a superscription: And valiant heroes were, etc.; equivalent to, But besides there, there remain still the following valiant heroes. The words &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; are not synonymous with &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, leaders of the host, <a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>, (Berth.), but signify heroes in warlike strength, i.e., heroic warriors, like &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;   (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-5.htm">1 Chronicles 7:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-7.htm">1 Chronicles 7:7</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-11.htm">1 Chronicles 7:11</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/7-40.htm">1 Chronicles 7:40</a>). That &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; has here the article, while it is not found in the passages quoted from the seventh chapter, does not make any difference in the meaning of the words. The article is used, here, as with &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, because the heroes of David are spoken of, and &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1497;&#1491; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is to be mentally supplied from <a href="/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10</a>. As to the names in vv. 26-41, which are also found in the register in the book of Samuel, see the commentary to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-24.htm">2 Samuel 23:24-39</a>. This list, which is common to both books, begins with Asahel, a brother of Joab, who was slain by Abner in the war which he waged against David (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-19.htm">2 Samuel 2:19-23</a>), and concludes in the book of Samuel with Uriah the Hittite, so well known from <a href="/2_samuel/11-3.htm">2 Samuel 11:3</a>. (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-41.htm">1 Chronicles 11:41</a>), with whose wife David committed adultery. But to the continuation of the register which is found in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-41.htm">1 Chronicles 11:41-47</a> of our text, there is no parallel in the other writings of the Old Testament by which we might form an idea as to the correctness of the names. The individual names are indeed to be met with, for the most part, in other parts of the Old Testament, but denote other men of an earlier or later time. The names &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-45.htm">1 Chronicles 11:45</a>, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, <a href="/1_chronicles/11-46.htm">1 Chronicles 11:46</a>., are found also in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-20.htm">1 Chronicles 12:20</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-11.htm">1 Chronicles 12:11</a>, among those of the valiant men who before Saul's death went over to David, but we cannot with any certainty ascertain whether the persons meant were the same. The expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-42.htm">1 Chronicles 11:42</a>) is also obscure, - "and to him in addition," i.e., together with him, thirty, - since the thought that with Adina the chief of the Reubenites, or besides him, there were thirty (men), has no meaning in this register. The lxx and the Vulgate read &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, while the Syriac, on the contrary, makes use of the periphrasis, "And even he was a ruler over thirty heroes;" and Bertheau accordingly recommends the emendation &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;, and thence concludes that the tribe of Reuben had thirty leaders in its army-a conjecture as bold as it is improbable. Were &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; to be read, we could not but refer the words to the thirty heroes of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, and hold Adina to be their leader, which could not be easily reconciled with <a href="/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>. See on <a href="/1_chronicles/12-4.htm">1 Chronicles 12:4</a>. </body></html>
