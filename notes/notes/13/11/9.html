(Comp. <a href="/genesis/8-5.htm" title="And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.">Genesis 8:5</a>, and the use of the term <span class= "ital">andante,</span> “walking,” in music.)<p><span class= "bld">Lord of hosts was with him.</span>—The Lord of Hosts is doubtless a contracted form of the fuller expression, Lord God of Hosts, as it appears in Samuel. The Lord (or God) of Hosts is <span class= "bld">a</span> title derived from God’s supremacy over the host of heaven, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the stars, worshipped as deities by the races environing Israel, insomuch that the very word for <span class= "ital">God</span> in the old Babylonian is represented by a star (*); and in the later Assyrian character <span class= "ital">star</span> was represented by the symbol for <span class= "ital">God</span> thrice repeated. Assur, the supreme deity of the Assyrian Pantheon, is called in the inscriptions “king of the legions of heaven and earth,” or “of the great gods.” Similar titles were given to the Babylonian Nebo and Merodach. The Hebrew phrase is therefore, in one sense, equivalent to a concise assertion of the statement, “Jehovah your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords” (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm" title="For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regards not persons, nor takes reward:">Deuteronomy 10:17</a> : comp. also <a href="/psalms/95-3.htm" title="For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.">Psalm 95:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/97-7.htm" title="Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all you gods.">Psalm 97:7</a>). That the hosts in question are the stars appears from <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm" title="By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.">Psalm 33:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm" title="Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.">Isaiah 40:26</a>; <a href="/judges/5-20.htm" title="They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.">Judges 5:20</a>.<p>Very anciently the stars were conceived of as the army of heaven, marshalled in orderly array. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm" title="Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.">Isaiah 40:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.">Isaiah 24:21</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/14-12.htm" title="How are you fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how are you cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!">Isaiah 14:12-13</a>.) The Lord of the hosts of heaven is <span class= "ital">à fortiori</span> Lord of all earthly hosts; hence the fitness of the phrase in passages like the present. Lastly, we may observe that it is a grand idea of revealed religion that He who guides the stars in their courses guides also the destinies of individual men, elevating one and abasing another, according to the eternal principles of goodness and truth (<a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm" title="For thus said the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.">Isaiah 57:15</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-9 David was brought to possess the throne of Israel after he had reigned seven years in Hebron, over Judah only.

But Abner, the captain of Saul's host, led Ishbosheth, Saul's son, with the remainder of the defeated army of the Israelites, to Mahanaim in Gilead, and there made him king over Gilead, and gradually also, as he reconquered it from the Philistines, over the land of Israel, over Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all (the remainder of) Israel, with the exception of the tribal domain of Judah. Ishbosheth's kingship did not last longer than two years, while David reigned over Judah in Hebron for seven years and a half (<a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>). When Abner advanced with Ishbosheth's army from Mahanaim against Gibeon, he was defeated by Joab, David's captain, so that he was obliged again to withdraw beyond Jordan (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12-32</a>); and although the struggle between the house of Saul and the house of David still continued, yet the house of Saul waxed ever weaker, while David's power increased. At length, when Ishbosheth reproached the powerful Abner because of a concubine of his father's, he threatened that he would transfer the crown of Israel to David, and carried his threat into execution without delay. He imparted his design to the elders of Israel and Benjamin; and when they had given their consent, he made his way to Hebron, and announced to David the submission of all Israel to his sway (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1-21</a>). Abner, indeed, did not fully carry out the undertaking; for on his return journey he was assassinated by Joab, without David's knowledge, and against his will. Immediately afterwards, Ishbosheth, who had become powerless and spiritless through terror at Abner's death, was murdered in his own house by two of the leaders of his army. There now remained of Saul's family only Jonathan's son Mephibosheth (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-1.htm">2 Samuel 4:1-12</a>), then not more than twelve years old, and lame in both his feet, and all the tribes of Israel determined to anoint David to be their king. The carrying out of this resolution is narrated in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-1.htm">1 Chronicles 11:1-3</a>, in complete agreement as to the facts with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>, where the matter has been already commented upon. In ch. 12 23-40 there follows a more detailed account of the assembly of the tribes of Israel in Hebron. The last words in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-3.htm">1 Chronicles 11:3</a>, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, are a didactic addition of the author of the Chronicle, which has been derived from <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4-5</a>, in accordance with the custom of the author of the books of Samuel and Kings to state the age and duration of the reign of each of the kings immediately after the announcement of their entry upon their office, there follows after the preceding a statement of the duration of David's reign; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>., <a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>, etc. This remark is to be found in the Chronicle only at the close of David's reign; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>, which shows that Thenius' opinion that this verse has been omitted from the Chronicle by a mistake is not tenable. </body></html>
