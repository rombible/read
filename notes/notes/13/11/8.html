According to the chronicler David started from that point, and brought his line of defences round to it again.

There is great uncertainty as to the derivation and the meaning of this word. It is probably not really of Hebrew extraction, but of the oldest Canaanitish origin. In the Hebrew it is always used with the article, and would presumably come from the Hebrew root "to fill." Josephus seems to use, as synonymous expression for "<span class="accented">David's wall round Millo</span>," this, viz. "buildings round about the lower city" ('Jud. Ant.,' 3:2, compared with 5; 'Wars,' 6:1, where he identifies those "buildings," etc., with <span class="accented">Acra</span>). As the name of a family, it is mentioned in connection with Shechem, known specially as a place of the Canaanites (<a href="/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>). The Septuagint represents it by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. In the remarkable passage, <a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>, the word "Silla" is even a greater enigma, which, however, may designate the "steps from the city of David" (<a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>), or "the <span class="accented">causeway of going up"</span> to the west of the temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-16.htm">1 Chronicles 22:16</a>). The likeliest view of Mille is that it was a very strong point of fortification in the surrounding defences of the hill of Zion (<a href="/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>). In <a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a> the otherwise unvarying translation (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Septuagint is superseded by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, a word itself of doubtful signification. For while some would render it by the word "foundation," Schleusner translates it "height." Grove (in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:367) puts it in "the neighbourhood of the Tyropaean valley at the foot of Zion." Some clue may lie in the word "inward," applied to the building by David. Does it imply a covering by edifices of the space, or some portion of it, that lay between Zion and the rest of the city? (See also Keil on Kings, vol. 2:163.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The anointing of David to be king over the whole of Israel in Hebron; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>. - After Saul's death, in obedience to a divine intimation, David left Ziklag, whither he had withdrawn himself before the decisive battle between the Philistines and the Israelites, and betook himself with his wives and his warriors to Hebron, and was there anointed by the men of Judah to be king over their tribe (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>). But Abner, the captain of Saul's host, led Ishbosheth, Saul's son, with the remainder of the defeated army of the Israelites, to Mahanaim in Gilead, and there made him king over Gilead, and gradually also, as he reconquered it from the Philistines, over the land of Israel, over Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all (the remainder of) Israel, with the exception of the tribal domain of Judah. Ishbosheth's kingship did not last longer than two years, while David reigned over Judah in Hebron for seven years and a half (<a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>). When Abner advanced with Ishbosheth's army from Mahanaim against Gibeon, he was defeated by Joab, David's captain, so that he was obliged again to withdraw beyond Jordan (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12-32</a>); and although the struggle between the house of Saul and the house of David still continued, yet the house of Saul waxed ever weaker, while David's power increased. At length, when Ishbosheth reproached the powerful Abner because of a concubine of his father's, he threatened that he would transfer the crown of Israel to David, and carried his threat into execution without delay. He imparted his design to the elders of Israel and Benjamin; and when they had given their consent, he made his way to Hebron, and announced to David the submission of all Israel to his sway (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1-21</a>). Abner, indeed, did not fully carry out the undertaking; for on his return journey he was assassinated by Joab, without David's knowledge, and against his will. Immediately afterwards, Ishbosheth, who had become powerless and spiritless through terror at Abner's death, was murdered in his own house by two of the leaders of his army. There now remained of Saul's family only Jonathan's son Mephibosheth (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-1.htm">2 Samuel 4:1-12</a>), then not more than twelve years old, and lame in both his feet, and all the tribes of Israel determined to anoint David to be their king. The carrying out of this resolution is narrated in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-1.htm">1 Chronicles 11:1-3</a>, in complete agreement as to the facts with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>, where the matter has been already commented upon. In ch. 12 23-40 there follows a more detailed account of the assembly of the tribes of Israel in Hebron. The last words in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-3.htm">1 Chronicles 11:3</a>, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, are a didactic addition of the author of the Chronicle, which has been derived from <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4-5</a>, in accordance with the custom of the author of the books of Samuel and Kings to state the age and duration of the reign of each of the kings immediately after the announcement of their entry upon their office, there follows after the preceding a statement of the duration of David's reign; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>., <a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>, etc. This remark is to be found in the Chronicle only at the close of David's reign; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>, which shows that Thenius' opinion that this verse has been omitted from the Chronicle by a mistake is not tenable. </body></html>
