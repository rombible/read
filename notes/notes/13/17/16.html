See what is there said upon it. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, for thy word's sake, is here said to be, "for thy servant's sake," ver. 19. Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My son - The minatory clause which occurs after this in Samuel is here omitted, because the writer is not about to record the sins of Solomon, or the sufferings <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-9.htm">1 Kings 11:9-40</a> which he thereby brought upon himself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

His appreciation of the contents of that promise is expressed in a manner which would seem to indicate that he was not altogether untaught, even then, by the Spirit of some of the deeper significance of the far-reaching promise. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sat before the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before the ark. It has surprised many that it should be said that David sat before the Lord, in the act of prayer or devotion. But this was not altogether unusual (<a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>) in the first place; and then, secondly, it is not quite clear that this <span class="accented">is</span> said. Possibly he sat awaiting first some such token as he might know how to construe into the presence of Jehovah, and into his gracious vouchsafing to give him audience, and thereupon he may have altered his attitude. Confessedly, however, the other is the morn natural reading. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-10.htm">1 Chronicles 17:10</a>, &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, like &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a>), is to be connected with the preceding     &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; in this sense: "As in the beginning (i.e., during the sojourn in Egypt), and onward from the days when I appointed judges," i.e., during the time of the judges. &#1500;&#1502;&#1503; is only a more emphatic expression for &#1502;&#1503;, to mark off the time from the beginning as it were (cf.
