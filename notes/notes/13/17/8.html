See what is there said upon it. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, for thy word's sake, is here said to be, "for thy servant's sake," ver. 19. Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare throughout <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a> and the notes found there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

The meaning is, I elevated you to the throne from a humble condition solely by an act of divine grace, and not from any antecedent merits of your own (see on [383]1Sa 16:11), and I enabled you to acquire renown, equal or superior to any other monarch.

Our account of this design of David's, with its results for him and for his kingdom, is in all essential points identical with the parallel account, so that we may refer to the commentary on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a> for any necessary explanation of the matter. The difference between the two narratives are in great part of a merely formal kind; the author of the Chronicle having sought to make the narrative more intelligible to his contemporaries, partly by using later phrases current in his own time, such as &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; for &#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492;, partly by simplifying and explaining the bolder and more obscure expressions. Very seldom do we find divergences in the subject-matter which alter the meaning or make it appear to be different. To supplement and complete the commentary already given in 2nd Samuel, we will now shortly treat of these divergences. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-1.htm">1 Chronicles 17:1</a>, the statement that David communicated his purpose to build a temple to the Lord to the prophet Nathan, "when Jahve had given him rest from all his enemies round about," is wanting. This clause, which fixes the time, has been omitted by the chronicler to avoid the apparent contradiction which would have arisen in case the narrative were taken chronologically, seeing that the greatest of David's wars, those against the Philistines, Syrians, and Ammonites, are narrated only in the succeeding chapter. As to this, cf. the discussion on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1-3</a>. </body></html>
