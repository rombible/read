Jether the Ishmaelite&#8212;(compare 2Sa 17:25). In that passage he is called Ithra an Israelite; and there seems no reason why, in the early days of David, anyone should be specially distinguished as an Israelite. The presumption is in favor of the reading followed by the Septuagint, which calls him "Jetra the Jezreelite." The circumstance of his settling in another tribe, or of a woman marrying out of her own tribe, was sufficiently rare and singular to call for the statement that Abigail was married to a man of Jezreel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Ishmeelite, </span> by birth or habitation, but by profession an Israelite, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/17-25.htm" title="And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.">2 Samuel 17:25</a></span>, <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/2_samuel/17-25.htm" title="And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.">2 Samuel 17:25</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Abigail bare Amasa,....

Nahshon was a prince of Judah at the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt (<a href="/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>). Now between him, a contemporary of Moses, and Pharez, who at the immigration of Jacob into Egypt was about fifteen years old, lies a period of 430 years, during which the Israelites remained in Egypt. For that time only three names - Hezron, Ram, and Amminidab - are mentioned, from which it is clear that several links must have been passed over. So also, from Nahshon to David, for a period of over 400 years, four generations - Salma, Boaz, Obed, and Jesse - are too few; and consequently here also the less famous ancestors of David are omitted. &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488; is called in <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/4-20.htm">Ruth 4:20-21</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;.

According to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>, Jesse had eight sons. This account, which agrees with that in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-8.htm">1 Samuel 16:8-12</a>, may be reconciled with the enumeration in our verse, on the supposition that one of the sons died without posterity.
