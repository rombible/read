Machir is distinguished from other men of the same name (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/9-4.htm">2 Samuel 9:4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>) by the addition, father of Gilead.

After Moses' victory over Og king of Bashan, Jair's family conquered the district of Argob in Bashan, i.e., in the plain of Jaulan and Hauran; and to the conquered cities, when they were bestowed upon him for a possession by Moses, the name Havvoth-jair, i.e., Jair's-life, was given. Cf. <a href="/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>, where this name is explained. These are the twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead, i.e., Pera.</body></html>
