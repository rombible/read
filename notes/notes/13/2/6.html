Further, many MSS. of Chronicles, as well as the Svriac and Arabic versions and the Targum, actually have Darda. The Yatic. LXX. reads Darad. There is thus a virtual repetition of these four names in the passage of Kings, and it is difficult to suppose that the persons intended are not the same there and here. Ethan is called an Ezrahite in Kings, but Ezrah and Zerah are equivalent forms in Hebrew; and the Yatic. LXX. actually calls Ethan a Zarhite—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a descendant of Zerah (<a href="/numbers/26-13.htm" title="Of Zerah, the family of the Zarhites: of Shaul, the family of the Shaulites.">Numbers 26:13</a>). The designation of the four as “sons of Mahol” presents no difficulty. <span class= "ital">Mahol</span> is a usual word for the sacred dance (<a href="/psalms/149-3.htm" title="Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises to him with the tambourine and harp.">Psalm 149:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/150-4.htm" title="Praise him with the tambourine and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.">Psalm 150:4</a>), and the four Zarhites are thus described as “sons of dancing”—that is, sacred musicians. It is likely, therefore, that these famous minstrels of Judah were adopted into the Levitical clans in which sacred music was the hereditary profession. (See Psalms 88, 89., titles.)

They are there called sons of “Mahol” who may have been either a nearer or remoter ancestor than Zerah. Ethan however is there called the Ezrahite (= probably “son of Zerah”).

Here the heading is, "and the Allufim of Edom were," and the subscription, "these are the Allufim of Edom," from which it would be the natural conclusion that the eleven names given are proper names of the phylarchs. But the occurrence of two female names, Timna and Aholibamah, as also of names which are unquestionably those of races, e.g., Aliah, Pinon, Teman, and Mibzar, is irreconcilable with this interpretation. If we compare the heading and subscription of the register in Genesis, we find that the former speaks of the names "of the Allufim of Edom according to their habitations, <p>(Note: So it is given by the author, "nach ihren Wohnsitzen;" but this must be a mistake, for the word is &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;  equals  their families, not &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1501;, as it is in the subscription. - Tr.)<p>according to their places in their names," and the latter of "the Allufim of Edom according to their habitations in the land of their possession." It is there unambiguously declared that the names enumerated are not the names of persons, but the names of the dwelling-places of the Allufim, after whom they were wont to be named. We must therefore translate, "the Alluf of Timna, the Alluf of Aliah," etc., when of course the female names need not cause any surprise, as places can just as well receive their names from women as their possessors as from men. Nor is there any greater difficulty in this, that only eleven dwelling-places are mentioned, while, on the contrary, the thirteen sons and grandsons of Esau are called Allufim. For in the course of time the number of phylarchs might have decreased, or in the larger districts two phylarchs may have dwelt together. Since the author of the Chronicle has taken this register also from Genesis, as the identity of the names clearly shows he did, he might safely assume that the matter was already known from that book, and so might allow himself to abridge the heading without fearing any misunderstanding; seeing, too, that he does not enumerate &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; of Esau, but &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;, and Edom had become the name of a country and a people. </body></html>
