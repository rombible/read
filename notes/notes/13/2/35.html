Elishama, the last name (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-41.htm" title="And Shallum begat Jekamiah, and Jekamiah begat Elishama.">1Chronicles 2:41</a>), is the twenty-fourth generation specified from Judah. The list thus extends over a period of at least 720 years; and if we reckon from the Exodus (circ. 1330 B.C.), we get B.C. 610 as an approximate date for Elishama. Now an Elishama was living about that time, who is mentioned (<a href="/jeremiah/36-12.htm" title="Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, see, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.">Jeremiah 36:12</a>) as one of the princes of Jehoiakim, king of Judah; <a href="/jeremiah/41-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.">Jeremiah 41:1</a> perhaps mentions the same person again, calling him “of the seed of the kingdom.” It is at least a coincidence that several of the names recur in the house of David: Nathan (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-36.htm" title="And Attai begat Nathan, and Nathan begat Zabad,">1Chronicles 2:36</a>) in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm" title="And these were born to him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:">1Chronicles 3:5</a>; Obed, as David’s grandfather in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-12.htm" title="And Boaz begat Obed, and Obed begat Jesse,">1Chronicles 2:12</a>; Azariah, as a byname of King Uzziah, in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-12.htm" title="Amaziah his son, Azariah his son, Jotham his son,">1Chronicles 3:12</a>; Shallum, as a son of Josiah, in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="And the sons of Josiah were, the firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.">1Chronicles 3:15</a>; Jekamiah, as a brother of Salathiel (Shealtiel), in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-18.htm" title="Malchiram also, and Pedaiah, and Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah.">1Chronicles 3:18</a>; and Elishama, as a son of David, in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-8.htm" title="And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet, nine.">1Chronicles 3:8</a>—a coincidence of six out of thirteen names. The passage Deut. Xxiii. 7, 8 rules that in the third generation persons of Egyptian blood are to be treated as full Israelites. This whole section proves that an Egyptian element was recognised in Judah. (Compare <a href="/exodus/12-38.htm" title="And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.">Exodus 12:38</a>; <a href="/numbers/11-4.htm" title="And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?">Numbers 11:4</a>.)

But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvation who come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith in him, their love and devotedness to him.

Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife&#8212;The adoption and marriage of a foreign slave in the family where he is serving, is far from being a rare or extraordinary occurrence in Eastern countries. It is thought, however, by some to have been a connection not sanctioned by the law of Moses [Michaelis]. But this is not a well-founded objection, as the history of the Jews furnishes not a few examples of foreign proselytes in the same manner obtaining an inheritance in Israel; and doubtless Jarha had previously embraced the Jewish faith in place of the grovelling idolatries of his native Egypt. In such a case, therefore, there could be no legal difficulty. Being a foreign slave, he had no inheritance in a different tribe to injure by this connection; while his marriage with Sheshan's daughter led to his adoption into the tribe of Judah, as well as his becoming heir of the family property.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife,....
