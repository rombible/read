Thus (<a href="/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>) he is styled son of Manasseh, and hence also the explanation of the last clause of ver. 23, <span class="accented">infra</span>, all these belonged to <span class="cmt_word">the sons of Machir the father of Gilead</span>. Some of the cities alluded to are the Havoth-Jair (<a href="/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a>), Englished as the "groups of <span class="accented">dwellings</span> of Jair," on which see interesting note in Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine' (edit. 1866), vocabulary, pp. 526, 527. They lay in the trans-Jordanic district Trachonitis, the modern El-leyah and Jebel-Hauran. It is not possible to harmonize exactly the numbers of the cities given here with those in passages quoted above; nor is the translation of ver. 23, Authorized Version, very certainly the correct one. E. Bertheau, in his 'Die Bucher der Chronik erklart; 15. Kurzgef. exegetisches Handbuch. z. A.T.,' translates, "And Geshur and Aram took the Havvoth-Jair from them with Kenath and her daughter-towns, sixty cities." "Took" is supposed to mean here "retook," or "recovered." Though this suits the Hebrew syntax better, it does not suit so well our immediate context; nor have we any other information of such re, covering of them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The family of Ram (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-10.htm">1 Chronicles 2:10-12</a>), traced down through six members of Jesse. - This genealogy is also to be found in <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/1.htm">Ruth 1</a> Chronicles <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/4-19.htm">Ruth 4:19-21</a>; but only here is Nahshon made more prominent than the others, by the addition, "prince of the sons of Judah."

Now between him, a contemporary of Moses, and Pharez, who at the immigration of Jacob into Egypt was about fifteen years old, lies a period of 430 years, during which the Israelites remained in Egypt. For that time only three names - Hezron, Ram, and Amminidab - are mentioned, from which it is clear that several links must have been passed over. So also, from Nahshon to David, for a period of over 400 years, four generations - Salma, Boaz, Obed, and Jesse - are too few; and consequently here also the less famous ancestors of David are omitted. &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488; is called in <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/4-20.htm">Ruth 4:20-21</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;.
