THE LINE OF JUDAH, TO HIS THREE GREAT-GRANDSONS. The line of Judah is, with a well-known object, the first to be taken up, although Judah stands fourth of Israel's sons. Judah has five sons: three, <span class="cmt_word">Er, Onan, Shelah</span>, by a Canaanitess, the daughter of <span class="cmt_word">Shad</span>; and two, <span class="cmt_word">Pharez</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Zerah</span>, by <span class="cmt_word">Tamar</span>, his own daughter-in-law, under the circumstances described (<a href="/genesis/38-6.htm">Genesis 38:6-30</a>). There all these names are found in exact accord in the Authorized Version, in the Hebrew text, and in the Septuagint. The Septuagint Version, however (<a href="/genesis/38-2.htm">Genesis 38:2</a>), by an evident inaccuracy of translation, gives Shua as the name, not of the father, but of the daughter, <span class="greek">&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;</span>. Parallel passages are also found (<a href="/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-19.htm">Numbers 26:19-22</a>). Er and Onan died without issue, and the descendants of <span class="accented">Shelah</span> are not mentioned till we reach <a href="/1_chronicles/4-21.htm">1 Chronicles 4:21-23</a>. The line is now carried on by the twin sons of <span class="accented">Tamar</span> (vers. 5, 6). <span class="accented">Pharez</span>, with two sons, <span class="cmt_word">Hezron</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Hamul</span> (<a href="/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18</a>), and <span class="cmt_word">Zerah</span>, with five sons, <span class="cmt_word">Zimri</span> (or Zabdi, <a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a>), <span class="cmt_word">Ethan, Heman, Calcol, Dara</span> (or with many manuscripts, followed by the Targum, Syriac, and Arabic versions, Darda). If these last four names are not identical with those in <a href="/1_kings/4-31.htm">1 Kings 4:31</a>, they are not to be found in any available connection elsewhere, and the last two not at all. Upon this supposition, it is held by some that this very passage proves that the compiler drew on resources not possessed by us. The weight of evidence seems, however, largely in favour of the persons being the same. (See Gilbert Barrington's 'Old Testament Genealogies,' 1:206-208, well summarized in art. "Darda," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' for as competent a discussion of the question as the present data will allow.) It needs to be constantly remembered that an enumeration like the above, of five so-called <span class="accented">sons</span>, does not necessarily involve their being five <span class="accented">brothers</span>, although in this case it looks the more as though they were so, as it is said <span class="cmt_word">five of them in all</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The princes of Edom. - The names correspond to those in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/36-40.htm">Genesis 36:40-43</a>, but the heading and the subscription in Genesis are quite different from those in the Chronicle. Here the heading is, "and the Allufim of Edom were," and the subscription, "these are the Allufim of Edom," from which it would be the natural conclusion that the eleven names given are proper names of the phylarchs. But the occurrence of two female names, Timna and Aholibamah, as also of names which are unquestionably those of races, e.g., Aliah, Pinon, Teman, and Mibzar, is irreconcilable with this interpretation. If we compare the heading and subscription of the register in Genesis, we find that the former speaks of the names "of the Allufim of Edom according to their habitations, <p>(Note: So it is given by the author, "nach ihren Wohnsitzen;" but this must be a mistake, for the word is &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;  equals  their families, not &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1501;, as it is in the subscription. - Tr.)<p>according to their places in their names," and the latter of "the Allufim of Edom according to their habitations in the land of their possession." It is there unambiguously declared that the names enumerated are not the names of persons, but the names of the dwelling-places of the Allufim, after whom they were wont to be named. We must therefore translate, "the Alluf of Timna, the Alluf of Aliah," etc., when of course the female names need not cause any surprise, as places can just as well receive their names from women as their possessors as from men. Nor is there any greater difficulty in this, that only eleven dwelling-places are mentioned, while, on the contrary, the thirteen sons and grandsons of Esau are called Allufim. For in the course of time the number of phylarchs might have decreased, or in the larger districts two phylarchs may have dwelt together. Since the author of the Chronicle has taken this register also from Genesis, as the identity of the names clearly shows he did, he might safely assume that the matter was already known from that book, and so might allow himself to abridge the heading without fearing any misunderstanding; seeing, too, that he does not enumerate &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; of Esau, but &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;, and Edom had become the name of a country and a people. </body></html>
