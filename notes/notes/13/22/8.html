Because God named him. Nothing is more powerful to engage us in any service for God, than to know that we are appointed thereto. Because he would have leisure and opportunity to do it. He should have peace and quietness. Where God gives rest, he expects work. Because God had promised to establish his kingdom. God's gracious promises should quicken and strengthen our religious service. David delivered to Solomon an account of the vast preparations he had made for this building; not from pride and vain-glory, but to encourage Solomon to engage cheerfully in the great work. He must not think, by building the temple, to purchase a dispensation to sin; on the contrary, his doing that would not be accepted, if he did not take heed to fulfil the statutes of the Lord.

He unfolded his great and long cherished plan, enjoined the building of God's house as a sacred duty on him as his son and successor, and described the resources that were at command for carrying on the work. The vast amount of personal property he had accumulated in the precious metals [1Ch 22:14] must have been spoil taken from the people he had conquered, and the cities he had sacked.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth; </span> not that wars either now are or then were simply unlawful, or that David sinned in shedding the blood of war; for it is manifest that David’s wars were undertaken by God’s command, or with his leave, and were attended with his blessing; but partly because David’s military employments did for a good while fill his head and hands, and gave him no leisure for temple work; and principally for mystical signification, to teach us that the church (whereof the temple was a manifest and illustrious type) should be built by Christ, <span class="ital">the Prince of peace</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a></span>; and that it should be gathered and built up, <span class="ital">not by might or power</span>, or by force of arms, but <span class="ital">by</span> God’s Spirit, <span class="bld"><a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm" title="Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.">Zechariah 4:6</a></span>, and by the preaching the gospel of peace. <span class="ital">In my sight</span>; which I have taken particular notice of.

This is repeated very distinctly below (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3</a>), and appears there again as acknowledged by the lip of David himself. It seems remarkable that no previous statement of this objection, nor even allusion to it, is found. Further, there seems no very opportune place for it in either our <a href="/1_chronicles/17-1.htm">1 Chronicles 17:1-15</a> or in <a href="/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1-17</a>.
