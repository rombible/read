Because God named him. Nothing is more powerful to engage us in any service for God, than to know that we are appointed thereto. Because he would have leisure and opportunity to do it. He should have peace and quietness. Where God gives rest, he expects work. Because God had promised to establish his kingdom. God's gracious promises should quicken and strengthen our religious service. David delivered to Solomon an account of the vast preparations he had made for this building; not from pride and vain-glory, but to encourage Solomon to engage cheerfully in the great work. He must not think, by building the temple, to purchase a dispensation to sin; on the contrary, his doing that would not be accepted, if he did not take heed to fulfil the statutes of the Lord.

He unfolded his great and long cherished plan, enjoined the building of God's house as a sacred duty on him as his son and successor, and described the resources that were at command for carrying on the work. The vast amount of personal property he had accumulated in the precious metals [1Ch 22:14] must have been spoil taken from the people he had conquered, and the cities he had sacked.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Prosper thou; </span> go on prosperously in carrying on this work; or, the Lord give thee that rest and prosperity which is necessary for it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now, my son, the Lord be with thee, &amp;c.
