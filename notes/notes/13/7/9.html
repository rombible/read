In an earlier period seven great families of Benjamin are mentioned (Nu 26:38), five of them being headed by these five sons of Benjamin, and two descended from Bela. Here five families of Bela are specified, whence we are led to conclude that time or the ravages of war had greatly changed the condition of Benjamin, or that the five families of Bela were subordinate to the other great divisions that sprang directly from the five sons of the patriarch.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the number of them,....

From the fact that Izrahiah is introduced as grandson of Tola, Bertheau would infer that <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-3.htm">1 Chronicles 7:3</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/7-4.htm">1 Chronicles 7:4</a> refer to times later than David. But this is an erroneous inference, for Tola's sons did not live in David's time at all, and consequently it is not necessary that his grandson should be assigned to a later time. The only assertion made is, that the descendants of Tola's sons had increased to the number mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-2.htm">1 Chronicles 7:2</a> in the time of David. By that time the descendants of his grandson Izrahiah might have increased to the number given in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-4.htm">1 Chronicles 7:4</a>. That the number, 36,000, of the descendants of the grandson Izrahiah was greater than the number of those descended from the sons of Tola (22,600), is explained in the clause, "for they had many wives and sons." That the two numbers (in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-2.htm">1 Chronicles 7:2</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/7-4.htm">1 Chronicles 7:4</a>) refer to the same time, i.e., to the days of David, is manifest from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-5.htm">1 Chronicles 7:5</a>, "and their brethren of all the families of Issachar, valiant heroes; 87,000 their register, as regards everything," i.e., the sum of those registered of all the families of Issachar. Whence we gather that in the 87,000 both the 22,600 (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-2.htm">1 Chronicles 7:2</a>) and the 36,000 (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-4.htm">1 Chronicles 7:4</a>) are included, and their brethren consequently must have amounted to 28,400 (22,600 + 36,000 + 28,400  equals  87,000). In the time of Moses, Issachar numbered, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1-29.htm">Numbers 1:29</a>, 54,400; and at a later time, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-25.htm">Numbers 26:25</a>, already numbered 64,300 men. </body></html>
