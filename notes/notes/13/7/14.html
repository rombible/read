The text, as it stands, is so confused and complicated that it is exceedingly difficult to trace the genealogical thread, and a great variety of conjectures have been made with a view to clear away the obscurity. The passage [1Ch 7:14, 15] should probably be rendered thus: "The sons of Manasseh were Ashriel, whom his Syrian concubine bare to him, and Machir, the father of Gilead (whom his wife bare to him).

The tribe of Manasseh has been partly treated of in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23-26</a>, viz. those of the tribe who inhabited Gilead and Bashan. Here those who inhabited this side Jordan are treated cf. And it is very difficult to give any coherent account of the differences of this passage when compared with <a href="/numbers/26-28.htm">Numbers 26:28-34</a> and <a href="/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1-4</a>. In these places six families, or heads of families, are noted to only two, or at most three here, viz. Askriel, Shemida, and perhaps Abiezer (<span class="accented">iq.</span> Jeezer, <a href="/numbers/26-30.htm">Numbers 26:30</a>; comp. with <a href="/joshua/17-2.htm">Joshua 17:2</a>). The opening clause of this verse also is unmanageable as it stands. One way of reducing it to coherence would be to Supply the words "his wife" between whom and bars, the similarity of the Hebrew letters of which to those of the Hebrew for "whom" might possibly account for the loss of it. The parenthesis about the concubine would then read with emphasis. But there is not the slightest reason to suppose there was such a wife. Another way would be to read the concubine as the mother of Ashriel, and prefix a conjunction, and, to the second "bare;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and she bare, or, she bare also Machir." But it seems pretty plain from Numbers and Joshua that Ashriel was not strictly a son, but only descendant of Manasseh; and, further, the irresistible impression is that Machir was the only son, strictly speaking (see especially <a href="/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>). The position of Ashriel in our present passage, first, is also very unsatisfactory in face of <a href="/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a> and the other references already given. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Becher's descendants. Of these nine names there are two, &#1506;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1514;, which occur elsewhere as names of cities (cf. for &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1514; in the form &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;,   <a href="/1_chronicles/6-45.htm">1 Chronicles 6:45</a>; and for &#1506;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). We may, without doubt, accept the supposition that in these cases the cities received their names from the heads of the families which inhabited them. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-9.htm">1 Chronicles 7:9</a>, &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; stands in apposition to, and is explanatory of, &#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;: "And their register, according to their generations," viz., according to the generations, that is, the birth-lists, "of the heads of their fathers'-houses, is (amounts to) in valiant heroes 20,200 men." </body></html>
