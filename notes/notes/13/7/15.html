It is tempting to make Zeiophehad the other wife, who had only daughters, whereas Maachah bore a son (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-16.htm" title="And Maachah the wife of Machir bore a son, and she called his name Peresh; and the name of his brother was Sheresh; and his sons were Ulam and Rakem.">1Chronicles 7:16</a>); but Numbers, <span class= "ital">l.c.,</span> and Josh., <span class= "ital">l.c.,</span> make Zelophehad a man. We must, therefore, suppose a <span class= "ital">lacuna</span> of some few words, which gave the name of Machir’s second wife, and the descent of Zelophehad from her. The expression “of Huppim and of Shuppim” is literally “to Huppim and to Shuppim,” that is, belonging to. So “of Tola,” (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-2.htm" title="And the sons of Tola; Uzzi, and Rephaiah, and Jeriel, and Jahmai, and Jibsam, and Shemuel, heads of their father's house, to wit, of Tola: they were valiant men of might in their generations; whose number was in the days of David two and twenty thousand and six hundred.">1Chronicles 7:2</a>).<p>We have no means of further elucidating the import of this curious tribal record. That it relates to West Manasseh is inferred from its position here, as well from the fact that <a href="/context/1_chronicles/5-23.htm" title="And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelled in the land: they increased from Bashan to Baalhermon and Senir, and to mount Hermon.">1Chronicles 5:23-24</a> treated of East Manasseh.

The name of Gilead, however, points to the transjordanic half of the tribe. The whole passage seems to assert an Aramean and a Benjamite element in the population of Western Manasseh.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-40 Genealogies. - Here is no account either of Zebulun or Dan.

The text, as it stands, is so confused and complicated that it is exceedingly difficult to trace the genealogical thread, and a great variety of conjectures have been made with a view to clear away the obscurity. The passage [1Ch 7:14, 15] should probably be rendered thus: "The sons of Manasseh were Ashriel, whom his Syrian concubine bare to him, and Machir, the father of Gilead (whom his wife bare to him).
