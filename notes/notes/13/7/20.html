It is perhaps best to consider Ezer and Elead <a href="/1_chronicles/7-21.htm">1 Chronicles 7:21</a> as not sons of Zabad and brothers of the second Shuthelah, but natural sons of Ephraim. The passage would then run thusly:<p>"And the sons of Ephraim, Shuthelah (and Bered was his son, and Tahath his son and Eladah his son, and Tahath his son, and Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son) and Ezer and Elead, whom the men of Gath slew" (i. e. the settled inhabitants, as contrasted with the nomadic Hebrews, Amalekites, etc.). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 7:14-40.

The text, as it stands, is so confused and complicated that it is exceedingly difficult to trace the genealogical thread, and a great variety of conjectures have been made with a view to clear away the obscurity. The passage [1Ch 7:14, 15] should probably be rendered thus: "The sons of Manasseh were Ashriel, whom his Syrian concubine bare to him, and Machir, the father of Gilead (whom his wife bare to him). Machir took for a wife Maachah, sister to Huppim and Shuppim."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Bered his son; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Vers. 20, 21, purport to contain the line of descent from Ephraim through his son Shu-thelah to the seventh generation, viz. to another Shuthelah. The remaining two names, Ezer and Elead, may perhaps be two brothers of the first Shuthelah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> own sons of Ephraim. If it be so, these two must not be supposed to correspond with Becher and Tahan, called "sons of Ephraim" in <a href="/numbers/26-35.htm">Numbers 26:35</a>; for it is evident that they were generations <span class="accented">succeeding</span> Shuthelah. Now, Ephraim was born in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/46-20.htm">Genesis 46:20</a>), so that, on the above showing, the actual sons of Ephraim must have made some incursion from Egypt into the territories of the settled or possibly aboriginal inhabitants of Gath, and met the fate over which Ephraim so mourned. Such excursions on the part of the Israelites out of Egypt have very little collateral evidence. But there would seem to be no impossibility in the matter, considering <a href="/genesis/50-13.htm">Genesis 50:13-23</a>. Next, vers. 23-27 seem to say that in his sorrow Ephraim has another son, whom he names Beriah, and of whose line in the ninth descent comes Joshua, the son of Nun. This also is very doubtful. It may very possibly be that the parenthesis continues to the end of ver. 23 or 24, and that vers. 25-27 carry on the generations from ver. 21. Meantime welcome light breaks in at the stage (ver. 26) at which Ammihud and Elishama are mentioned. For we find these immediate ancestors of the great Joshua repeatedly mentioned at the period of the Exodus (<a href="/numbers/1-10.htm">Numbers 1:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/2-18.htm">Numbers 2:18</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-48.htm">Numbers 7:48</a>, etc.); yet none of these places assist us to say that he did or did not come through Beriah. It is impossible to solve with any certainty the involved question of chronology and genealogy presented by this section. The passage is evidently mutilated and corrupt, though vindicating a high antiquity. Avery original presentation of the whole section, as ingenious as it is conjectural, by Lord A.C. Hervey, may be found in the art. "Shuthclah," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1305. It is well worthy of attention that a great point is made in bringing Joshua to the place of the eighth generation from Joseph, in near analogy with the numbers in so many other known cases, of the generations that intervened from the descent into Egypt to the entrance into Canaan. There also may be found the most and best that can be said against the literal reading of what is here written respecting the men of Gath and the cattle. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Families of the half-tribe of Manasseh. - The families of Manasseh which dwelt in Gilead and Bashan have already been mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/5-14.htm">1 Chronicles 5:14</a>. Our verses deal with the families of this tribe which received their inheritance in Canaan, on this side Jordan. These were, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-30.htm">Numbers 26:30</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-34.htm">Numbers 26:34</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/17-2.htm">Joshua 17:2</a>, six families, of which, however, only two are here spoken of - Ashriel, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14</a>, and Shemidah, <a href="/1_chronicles/7-19.htm">1 Chronicles 7:19</a>; or perhaps three, if Abiezer, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-18.htm">1 Chronicles 7:18</a>, be the same person as Jeezer (<a href="/numbers/26-30.htm">Numbers 26:30</a>), who is called Abiezer in <a href="/joshua/17-2.htm">Joshua 17:2</a>. The statements of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a> are very obscure. At the head of the register of the Manassites stands Ashriel, who, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-31.htm">Numbers 26:31</a>, belonged to the sons of Gilead the son of Manasseh and the grandson of Joseph (cf. <a href="/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>), and founded one of the six families of the cis-Jordanic Manassites. But the words which follow are obscure; the words are &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1500;&#1512;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "whom his Aramaic concubine bore; she bore Machir the father of Gilead." But since Ashriel, according to this, was the great-grandson of Manasseh, while Machir was his son, the relative clause can refer only to Manasseh, to whom his concubine bore Machir. Movers and Berth. would therefore erase &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, as a gloss arising out of a doubling of the following &#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1512;. By this expedient the difficultly as to the connection of the relative clause is certainly got rid of, but the obscurities of the following verse (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a>) are not thereby removed. The analogy of the other registers in our chapter requires, rather, that immediately after &#1502;&#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; there should stand the name of a descendant, - a fact which speaks strongly in favour of the authenticity of &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;. It is therefore a much more probable suggestion, that after the name &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, some additional clause, such as &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1502;&#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;, has been dropped, or regarded as superfluous by a copyist, and so omitted. To such an omitted &#1502;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1489;&#1503;, the relative sentence, which gives more details as to the descent of Ashriel, would be attacked in a simple and natural manner, since it was known from <a href="/numbers/26-30.htm">Numbers 26:30</a>. that Ashriel was descended from Manasseh through Gilead.</body></html>
