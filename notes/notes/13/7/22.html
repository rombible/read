It is perhaps best to consider Ezer and Elead <a href="/1_chronicles/7-21.htm">1 Chronicles 7:21</a> as not sons of Zabad and brothers of the second Shuthelah, but natural sons of Ephraim. The passage would then run thusly:<p>"And the sons of Ephraim, Shuthelah (and Bered was his son, and Tahath his son and Eladah his son, and Tahath his son, and Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son) and Ezer and Elead, whom the men of Gath slew" (i. e. the settled inhabitants, as contrasted with the nomadic Hebrews, Amalekites, etc.). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. whom the men of Gath &#8230; slew, &c.&#8212;This interesting little episode gives us a glimpse of the state of Hebrew society in Egypt; for the occurrence narrated seems to have taken place before the Israelites left that country. The patriarch Ephraim was then alive, though he must have arrived at a very advanced age; and the Hebrew people, at all events those of them who were his descendants, still retained their pastoral character. It was in perfect consistency with the ideas and habits of Oriental shepherds that they should have made a raid on the neighboring tribe of the Philistines for the purpose of plundering their flocks. For nothing is more common among them than hostile incursions on the inhabitants of towns, or on other nomad tribes with whom they have no league of amity. But a different view of the incident is brought out, if, instead of "because," we render the Hebrew particle "when" they came down to take their cattle, for the tenor of the context leads rather to the conclusion that "the men of Gath" were the aggressors, who, making a sudden foray on the Ephraimite flocks, killed the shepherds including several of the sons of Ephraim. The calamity spread a deep gloom around the tent of their aged father, and was the occasion of his receiving visits of condolence from his distant relatives, according to the custom of the East, which is remarkably exemplified in the history of Job (Job 2:11; compare Joh 11:19).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ephraim their father; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

But that to many seems hard, especially if these several sons, named <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/7-20.htm" title="And the sons of Ephraim; Shuthelah, and Bered his son, and Tahath his son, and Eladah his son, and Tahath his son,">1 Chronicles 7:20</a>,21</span>, be understood successively, so as each man be the son of him who is named next and immediately before him, which seems most probable; for so here are seven successive generations of Ephraim, which it is not likely that Ephraim lived to see; for then he must have been near two hundred years old. Although it is not necessary that the persons here said to be slain should be that generation which was last mentioned; but the particle <span class="ital">whom</span> may belong to the other sons of Ephraim of the fourth, or fifth, or sixth generation. Nor is the word <span class="ital">whom</span> in the Hebrew text, which runs thus, <span class="ital">and the men of Gath slew them</span>, i.e. the sons of Ephraim in the general, as they are expressed in the beginning of <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/7-20.htm" title="And the sons of Ephraim; Shuthelah, and Bered his son, and Tahath his son, and Eladah his son, and Tahath his son,">1 Chronicles 7:20</a></span>, without respect to this or that particular generation. And the relative particle <span class="ital">them</span> may be referred not unto the persons last named, but unto some of the other and more remote persons; this being a common observation of Hebricians, that the relative oft belongs to the remoter antecedent. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Zabad the father of the three persons and families last named, who might possibly have two names, and be called both Zabad and Ephraim. Or rather, the name of Ephraim may be put patronymically (as the learned speak) for the son and successor of Ephraim; who being now in Ephraim’s stead the head of the tribe, as old Ephraim was in his time, might well be called by the same name. Thus Isaac is put for his son Jacob or Israel, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/amos/7-9.htm" title="And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.">Amos 7:9</a></span>, and Moses for the sons of Moses, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm" title="Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.">Psalm 90:1</a></span>, and David for his son Rehoboam, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm" title="So when all Israel saw that the king listened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David.

And these words, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">their father, </span> seem to be added by way of distinction, to show that he meant not this of the old Ephraim, but of another, who was father to the three persons said to be slain, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/7-21.htm" title="And Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son, and Ezer, and Elead, whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew, because they came down to take away their cattle.">1 Chronicles 7:21</a></span>.

According to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-16.htm">1 Chronicles 7:16</a>, on the contrary, Maachah is the wife of Machir, and we should consequently expect to find in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a> only the simple statement, "And Machir took a wife whose name was Maachah." From the words &#1502;&#1506;&#1499;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;&#1493; &#1502;&#1506;&#1499;&#1492; sdrow eh &#1493;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1495;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; no meaning which harmonizes with the context can be obtained. Since &#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; signifies "to take a wife for one" (cf. <a href="/judges/14-2.htm">Judges 14:2</a>), we can only suppose that by the names Huppim and Shuppim Machir's sons are meant, to whom he, as their father, gave wives. But we cannot suppose that the sons of Machir are referred to, for the birth of the sons is first mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-16.htm">1 Chronicles 7:16</a>. But we have found the names &#1495;&#1508;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1501; spoken of as descendants of Benjamin; and Bertheau consequently conjectures that these names have been brought thence into our verse by some gloss, and that the beginning of our verse originally stood thus: &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1499;&#1501; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; &#1493;&#1502;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "And Machir took a wife whose name is Maachah, and the name of his sister if Hammoleketh" (the last according to <a href="/1_chronicles/7-18.htm">1 Chronicles 7:18</a>). By this means we certainly bring some meaning into the words; but we cannot venture to maintain that this conjecture corresponds to the original text, but rather incline to doubt it. For, in the first place, the following words, "And the name of the second (is) Zelophehad," do not suit the proposed reading. Berth. must here alter &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; into &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493; (the name of his brother). But even after this alteration, the mention of the brother of Machir is not suitable to the context; and moreover Zelophehad was not a true brother, but only a nephew of Machir, the son of his brother Hepher; cf. <a href="/numbers/26-33.htm">Numbers 26:33</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a>. And besides this, according to the concluding formula, "These are the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh" (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-17.htm">1 Chronicles 7:17</a>), we should expect to find in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-16.htm">1 Chronicles 7:16</a>, not merely sons or descendants of Machir, but rather descendants of Gilead. We therefore hold the statement of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a>, "And the name of the second if Zelophehad, and Zelophehad had (only) daughters," to be correct and beyond criticism, and the first part of <a href="/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a> to be corrupt and defective; and conjecture that a son of Gilead's was mentioned in it, to whose name the words, "And the name of the second," etc., belonged. This son who was mentioned in the text, which has been handed down to us only in a defective state, was probably the Ashriel mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14</a>, a son of Gilead, whose descent from Machir was given more in detail in the corrupt and consequently meaningless first half of <a href="/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-17.htm">1 Chronicles 7:17</a>, other descendants of Machir by his wife Maachah are enumerated, which favours the probable conjecture that the wife whom Machir took, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a>, was different from Maachah, that Machir had two wives, and that in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-15.htm">1 Chronicles 7:15</a> originally the sons of the first were enumerated, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-16.htm">1 Chronicles 7:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-17.htm">1 Chronicles 7:17</a>, the sons of the second. Peresh and Shelesh are mentioned only here. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, "his sons" (that is, the sons of the last-named, Shelesh), were Ulam and Rakem, names which are also met with only here. The name &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1503; is found in our Masoretic text, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-11.htm">1 Samuel 12:11</a>, as the name of a judge, but probably &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511; should be read instead.</body></html>
