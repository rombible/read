After the words “he smote Moab,” we read there of a partial massacre of the conquered. The emission is scarcely due to any unfair bias on the part of the chronicler. Indeed, as a Jew, possessed with all the national exclusiveness and hatred of the aliens who always misunderstood and sometimes cruelly oppressed his people, he was not likely to regard the slaughter of captive Moabites from a modern point of view.

This appears to mean that he put to death two parts of them, and kept the third part alive. The reason of this deliberate and severe punishment is not stated. Once David and the Moabites had been on very different terms (<a href="/1_samuel/22-3.htm">1 Samuel 22:3, 4</a>; but see also <a href="/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The combining of &#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; with &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1500;&#1498; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; as one sentence, "to make Thee a name with great and fearful deeds," is made clearer in 2nd Samuel by the interpolation of &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; &#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, "and for you doing great and fearful things." This explanation, however, does not justify us in supposing that &#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; has been dropped out of the Chronicle. The words &#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; are either to be subordinated in a loose connection to the clause, to define the way in which God has made Himself a name (cf. Ew. 283), or connected with &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; in a pregnant sense: "to make Thee a name, (doing) great and fearful things." But, on the other hand, the converse expression in Samuel, "fearful things for Thy land, before Thy people which Thou redeemedst to Thee from Egypt (from) the nations and their gods," is explained in Chronicles by the interpolation of &#1500;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;: "fearful things, to drive out before Thy people, which ... nations." The divergences cannot be explained by the hypothesis that both texts are mutilated, as is sufficiently shown by the contradictions into which Thenius and Bertheau have fallen in their attempts so to explain them.<p>All the remaining divergences of one text from the other are only variations of the expression, such as involuntarily arise in the endeavour to give a clear and intelligible narrative, without making a literal copy of the authority made use of. Among these we include even &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, "Thy servant hath found to pray" (1 Chr. , as compared with &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, "Thy servant hath found his heart," i.e., found courage, to pray (<a href="/2_samuel/7-28.htm">2 Samuel 7:28</a>); where it is impossible to decide whether the author of the books of Samuel has added &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; as an explanation, or the author of the Chronicle has omitted it because the phrase "to find his heart" occurs only in this single passage of the Old Testament. &#1500;&#1492;&#1514; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; signifies, Thy servant has reached the point of directing this prayer to Thee. </body></html>
