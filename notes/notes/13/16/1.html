So ch. 15:1 distinctly states that David had "pitched a tent" for the ark, and evidently to be ready for its arrival. On the other hand, there is no mention of any such tent having been got in readiness in ch. 13. or in <a href="/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-11</a>, which give the account of the attempt that disastrously failed. The expressions which are there used would rather lead to the conclusion that David's intention was to take the sacred structure into his own home (<a href="/2_samuel/6-9.htm">2 Samuel 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-12.htm">1 Chronicles 13:12, 13</a>), for a while, at all events. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> (tent) of the original designates, when Intended strictly, a haircloth covering, resting on poles or planks (<a href="/exodus/26-7.htm">Exodus 26:7, 11</a>; <a href="/exodus/36-14.htm">Exodus 36:14, 19</a>). The first occasion of the use of the word is found in <a href="/genesis/4-20.htm">Genesis 4:20</a>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> (booth) was made of leaves and branches interwoven (<a href="/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34, 40, 42</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>). The <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (tabernacle) was the dwelling-place or pavilion, which owned to the ten inner curtains as well as the outer covering and the framework (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1, 12-15</a>, etc.; Exodus 39:32; 40:2, 29). The first occurrence of this word is in the first of these last-quoted references. <span class="cmt_word">Burnt sacrifices and peace offerings</span>. The identical words of <a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17, 18</a>, where the Authorized Version translates "burnt offerings and peace offerings." These were the two great sacrifices - the former speaking of atonement (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>, etc.), the latter of <span class="accented">reconciliation effected</span> and the enjoyment of peace (<a href="/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1-5</a>, etc.).

Since Chenaniah does not occur among the six princes of the Levites in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-5.htm">1 Chronicles 15:5-10</a>, and is called in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-27.htm">1 Chronicles 15:27</a> &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, we must here also join &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; (as most editions punctuate the first &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, while according to Norzi &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; is the right reading even in the first case) closely with &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, with the meaning that Chenaniah was captain of the Levites who had charge of the bearing of the ark, a chief of the Levites who bore it. The word &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; is,however, very variously interpreted. The lxx have &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#787;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, and the Vulgate, prophetiae praeerat ad praecinendam melodiam; whence Luther translates: the master in song to teach them to sing. This translation cannot, however, be linguistically upheld; the word &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; means only the bearing of the burden (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-19.htm">Numbers 4:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-27.htm">Numbers 4:27</a>, etc.; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-3.htm">2 Chronicles 35:3</a>), and a prophetical utterance of an oppressive or threatening character (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>, etc.). But from this second signification neither the general meaning prophetia, nor, if we wish to go back upon the &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, to raise the voice, the signification master of song, supremus musicus (Lavat.), or qui principatum tenebat in cantu illo sublimiore (Vatabl.), can be derived. The meaning prophetia, moreover, does not suit the context, and we must consequently, with Bertheau and others, hold fast the signification of bearing. We are determined in favour of this, (1) by the context, which here treats of the bearing of the ark, for which &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; is the usual word; and (2) by the circumstance that in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-29.htm">1 Chronicles 26:29</a> Chenaniah is mentioned as the chief of the Levites for the external business, which goes to show, if the persons are identical, that he here had the oversight of the external business of the transport. &#1497;&#1505;&#1512; is not the inf. absol., which cannot stand directly for the verb. finit.; nor is it the imperf. of &#1505;&#1512;&#1512; in the signification of &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1512; (Bertheau and others), but a nominal formation from &#1497;&#1505;&#1512; (cf. on this formation as the most proper designation of the actor, Ew. 152, b), in the signification teacher, which is shown by <a href="/isaiah/28-26.htm">Isaiah 28:26</a> certainly to belong to &#1497;&#1505;&#1512;. The clause &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; &#1497;&#1505;&#1512; gives the explanation of the preceding &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, or it specifies what Chenaniah had to do in the procession. He had to take the lead in the bearing because he was &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; in it, i.e., was instructed in that which was to be observed in it. - In <a href="/1_chronicles/15-23.htm">1 Chronicles 15:23</a> two doorkeepers for the ark are named; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>, at the end of the enumeration of the Levites who were busied about the transport, two additional names are mentioned as those of men who had the same duty. The business of these doorkeepers was, as Seb. Schmidt has already remarked on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a>, non tam introitum aperire arcae, quam custodire, ne ad eam irrumperetur. Between these two pairs of doorkeepers in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>, the priests, seven in number, who blew the trumpets, are named. The Kethibh &#1502;&#1495;&#1510;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is to be read &#1502;&#1495;&#1510;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, a denom. from &#1495;&#1510;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;; the Keri &#1502;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is Hiph. of &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;, as in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-6.htm">2 Chronicles 7:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-14.htm">2 Chronicles 13:14</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/29-28.htm">2 Chronicles 29:28</a>. In <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>, on the contrary, &#1502;&#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is partic. Pi. The blowing of the silver trumpets by the priests in this solemn procession rests on the prescription in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-1.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>, which see. The place assigned to these trumpet-blowing priests was either immediately before the ark, like the priestly trumpeters in the march round Jericho (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4</a>, <a href="/joshua/6-6.htm">Joshua 6:6</a>), or immediately after it. For, that these priests entered in the immediate vicinity of the ark, may be inferred from the fact that before and behind them were doorkeepers of the ark. The procession, then, was probably arranged in this way: (1) the singers and players in front, in three division; (2) Chenaniah, the captain of the bearers; (3) two doorkeepers; (4) the priests with the trumpets immediately before or after the ark; (5) two doorkeepers; (6) the king with the elders and captains of thousands (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-25.htm">1 Chronicles 15:25</a>). The two doorkeepers Obededom and Jehiah (&#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;), Rashi, Berth.,and others consider to be the same persons as the singers Obededom and Jeiel (&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;), supposing that the latter name is wrongly written in one of the passages. This, however, is incorrect, for the identity of the name Obededom is no sufficient ground for supposing the persons to be the same, since in <a href="/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a> the singer Obededom and the doorkeeper Obededom the son of Jeduthun seem to be distinguished. And besides that, Obededom and his colleagues could not possibly at the same time as porters precede, and as singers come after, the priests and the ark, and there is consequently no reason to doubt that the name &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is correct. </body></html>
