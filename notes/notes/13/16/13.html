His Psalm of Thanksgiving.<p>7. Then on that day David delivered first this psalm&#8212;Among the other preparations for this solemn inauguration, the royal bard had composed a special hymn for the occasion. Doubtless it had been previously in the hands of Asaph and his assistants, but it was now publicly committed to them as they entered for the first time on the performance of their sacred duties. It occupies the greater part of this chapter (1Ch 16:8-36), and seems to have been compiled from other psalms of David, previously known to the Israelites, as the whole of it will be found, with very slight variations, in Ps 96:1-13; 105:1-15; 106:47, 48. In the form, however, in which it is given by the sacred historian, it seems to have been the first psalm given for use in the tabernacle service. Abounding, as it does, with the liveliest ascriptions of praise to God for the revelation of His glorious character and the display of His marvellous works and containing, as it does, so many pointed allusions to the origin, privileges, and peculiar destiny of the chosen people, it was admirably calculated to animate the devotions and call forth the gratitude of the assembled multitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then on that day,.... The ark was brought to Zion, and the above persons appointed to minister before it: <p>David delivered first this psalm to thank the Lord into the hand of Asaph and his brethren to be sung by them now, and on every proper occasion; and this seems to be the first that was delivered to them; afterwards there were many more, as the titles of the psalms show; the following is composed of part of two others, as they now stand in the book of Psalms.

It is not expressly said that this song was composed by David for this purpose; but if Asaph with his singers was to perform the service committed to him, he must have been provided with the songs of praise (psalms) which were necessary for this purpose; and if David were in any way the founder of the liturgical psalmody, he, as a richly endowed psalm-singer, would doubtless compose the necessary liturgical psalms. These considerations render it very probable that the following psalm was a hymn composed by David for the liturgical song in the public worship. The psalm is as follows: - <p>  8  Give thanks unto Jahve; preach His name;<p>Make known His deeds among the peoples:<p>  9  Sing to Him, play to Him;<p>Meditate upon all His wondrous works.<p>10  Glory ye in His holy name:<p>Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.<p>11  Seek ye the Lord, and His strength;<p>Seek His face continually.<p>12  Remember His wonders which He has done;<p>His wondrous works, and the judgments of His mouth;<p>13  O seed of Israel, His servants,<p>Sons of Jacob, His chosen.<p>14  He, Jahve, is our God;<p>continued...</body></html>
