Then on that day David delivered first this psalm&#8212;Among the other preparations for this solemn inauguration, the royal bard had composed a special hymn for the occasion. Doubtless it had been previously in the hands of Asaph and his assistants, but it was now publicly committed to them as they entered for the first time on the performance of their sacred duties. It occupies the greater part of this chapter (1Ch 16:8-36), and seems to have been compiled from other psalms of David, previously known to the Israelites, as the whole of it will be found, with very slight variations, in Ps 96:1-13; 105:1-15; 106:47, 48. In the form, however, in which it is given by the sacred historian, it seems to have been the first psalm given for use in the tabernacle service. Abounding, as it does, with the liveliest ascriptions of praise to God for the revelation of His glorious character and the display of His marvellous works and containing, as it does, so many pointed allusions to the origin, privileges, and peculiar destiny of the chosen people, it was admirably calculated to animate the devotions and call forth the gratitude of the assembled multitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then on that day,....

David makes selections from four psalms already known; for it cannot be supposed that the verses we have here were the original, and that they were afterwards supplemented. The first fifteen verses (viz. 8-22) are from <a href="/psalms/105-1.htm">Psalm 105:1-15</a>. The next eleven verses (23-33) are from <a href="/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1-13</a>; but a small portion of the first and last of these verses is omitted. Our thirty-fourth verse is identical with <a href="/psalms/107-1.htm">Psalm 107:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-1.htm">Psalm 118:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/136-1.htm">Psalm 136:1</a>; and forms the larger part of <a href="/psalms/106-1.htm">Psalm 106:1</a>. It is, in fact, a doxology. And our thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth verses consist of a short responsive ("and say ye") invocation, followed by another doxology. These are taken from <a href="/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47, 48</a>. Hereupon "all the people" are directed to find the final outburst of praise to Jehovah, and "Amen." In the first of these selections (vers. 8-23) there is no material variation from the language of the psalm itself. Yet the original psalm has <span class="accented">Abraham</span>, where our own thirteenth verse reads <span class="accented">Israel.</span> And the original psalm uses the third person, where our fifteenth and nineteenth verses have the second person. In the second selection it is worthy of note that our ver. 29, "Come before him," probably preserves the ante-temple reading, while <a href="/psalms/96-8.htm">Psalm 96:8</a> was afterwards, to fit temple times, altered into, "<span class="accented">Come</span> <span class="accented">into his courts."</span> The arrangement of all the succeeding clauses does not exactly agree with the arrangement of them found in the psalm, as for instance in the latter half of our ver. 30 and in ver. 31, compared with the clauses of vers. 10,11 of the psalm. Again, one clause of the tenth verse of the psalm, "He shall judge the people righteously," is not found in either alternative position open to it through the inversion of clauses, in our vers. 80, 81. The rhythm and metre of the psalm are, however, equally unexceptionable. The whole of the twenty-nine verses of this Psalm of praise (vers. 8-36 inclusive) are divided into portions of three verses each, except the portion vers. 23-27 inclusive which consists of five verses. As regards the matter of it, it may be remarked on as breaking into two parts, in the first of which (vers. 8-22) the people are reminded of their past history and of the marvellous providence which had governed their career from Abraham to the time they were settled in Canaan, but in the second (vers. 23-36) their thought is enlarged, their sympathies immensely widened, so as to include all the world, and their view is borne on to the momentous reality of <span class="accented">judgment.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - These verses are an animated invocation to thanks and praise. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The religious festival, and the arrangement of the sacred service before the ark of the covenant in the city of David. - This section is not found in 2nd Samuel, where the Conclusion of this whole description (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-43.htm">1 Chronicles 16:43</a>, Chron.) follows immediately upon the feasting of the people by the king, <a href="/1_chronicles/16-19.htm">1 Chronicles 16:19</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/16-20.htm">1 Chronicles 16:20</a>. </body></html>
