From the remark in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-17.htm">1 Chronicles 23:17</a>, that Eliezer had no other sons than Rehabiah, while Rehabiah had very many, we may conclude that Gershon had other sons besides Shebuel, who are not mentioned because their descendants were numbered with Shebuel's father's-house.</body></html>
