When more work is to be done, it is pity but there should be more workmen. A new heart, a spiritual mind, which delights greatly in God's commandments, and can find a refreshing feast in his ordinances, forms the great distinction between the true Christian and all other men in the world. To the spiritual man every service will yield satisfaction. He will be ever abounding in the work of the Lord; being never so happy as when employed for such a good Master, in so pleasant a service. He will not regard whether he is called to take the lead, or to keep the charge of others who are placed over him. May we seek and serve the Lord uprightly, and leave all the rest to his disposal, by faith in his word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the age of twenty years - The Levites had hitherto not entered upon their regular functions until the age of thirty <a href="/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a>. Certain lighter duties were by the Law imposed on them at the age of twenty-five <a href="/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>; but it was not until they were five years older that they became liable to the full service of the sanctuary. David appears now to have made a change. By his "last words" <a href="/1_chronicles/23-27.htm">1 Chronicles 23:27</a> the time for the Levites to enter on the full duties of their office was advanced from thirty to twenty years. This change was based upon the lighter character of the labors imposed on them now that the ark had ceased to be carried from place to place and obtained a permanent habitation <a href="/1_chronicles/23-26.htm">1 Chronicles 23:26</a>. The limit of age continued in after times where David had fixed it (see <a href="/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 23:24-32. Office of the Levites.<p>24-27. These were the sons of Levi &#8230; that did the work &#8230; from the age of twenty years and upward&#8212;The enumeration of the Levites was made by David (1Ch 23:3) on the same rule as that followed by Moses (Nu 4:3), namely, from thirty years. But he saw afterwards that this rule might be beneficially relaxed, and that the enrolment of Levites for their proper duties might be made from twenty years of age. The ark and tabernacle being now stationary at Jerusalem, the labor of the Levites was greatly diminished, as they were no longer obliged to transport its heavy furniture from place to place. The number of thirty-eight thousand Levites, exclusive of priests, was doubtless more than sufficient for the ordinary service of the tabernacle. But this pious king thought that it would contribute to the glory of the Lord to employ as many officers in his divine service as possible. These first rules, however, which David instituted, were temporary, as very different arrangements were made after the ark had been deposited in the tabernacle of Zion.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For David said,.... As a reason why he ordered a new account to be taken: <p>the Lord God of Israel hath given rest unto his people: from all their enemies round about, and settled rest in the land, so that there was no danger of being carried captive, as they were time after time in the days of the Judges, and whereby they became more numerous: <p>that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever; where the temple would always continue, and not be removed, as the ark and tabernacle had been, and where all Israel would appear three times in the year continually. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">that they may dwell</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">and he dwelleth</span>.

The "for" of this clause cannot be supposed to account exclusively for the inclusion in the census of Levites beginning from the age of twenty years; it accounts no doubt for the whole proceeding. Since there would be no more journeyings for people, for buildings, or for sacred vessels, it was nosy fully time to organize religious duty and "the service of the house of God" in a manner adapted to permanent institutions. In order to this, the first step was to know and to arrange the number of those who were answerable for sacred duties. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Amram's next brother Hebron had four sons, and the youngest brother Uzziel two, who founded fathers'-houses; so that, besides the priests, nine Levitical fathers'-houses are descended from Kohath, and their chiefs who served in the sanctuary are enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-20.htm">1 Chronicles 24:20-25</a>.</body></html>
