This is made clear, not only by the remaining clause of this verse, which says, "These were the chief of the fathers of Landau," and again by the enumeration in ver. 10 of sons of that Shimei who is coupled with Landau in ver. 7, but also by a comparison of <a href="/1_chronicles/24-22.htm">1 Chronicles 24:22</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/26-21.htm">1 Chronicles 26:21-26</a>. It is, of course, possible that the name stands here in error for some other name, but the supposition is gratuitous. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upwards. This statement agrees with that in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-23.htm">Numbers 4:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-30.htm">Numbers 4:30</a>, <a href="/numbers/4-39.htm">Numbers 4:39</a>., where Moses caused those from thirty to fifty years of age to be numbered, and appointed them for service about the tabernacle during the journey through the wilderness. But Moses himself, at a later time, determined that their period of service should be from twenty-five to fifty; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/8-23.htm">Numbers 8:23-26</a>. It is consequently not probable that David confined the numbering to those of thirty and upwards. But besides that, we have a distinct statement in <a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a> that they were numbered from twenty years of age, the change being grounded by David upon the nature of their service; and that this was the proper age is confirmed by <a href="/2_chronicles/31-17.htm">2 Chronicles 31:17</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>, according to which the Levites under Hezekiah, and afterwards, had to take part in the service from their twentieth year. We must therefore regard &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/ezra/3-3.htm">Ezra 3:3</a> as having crept into the text through the error of copyists, who were thinking of the Mosaic census in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4.htm">Numbers 4</a>, and must read &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; instead of it. The various attempts of commentators to get rid of the discrepancy between <a href="/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a> are mere makeshifts; and the hypothesis that David took two censuses is as little supported by the text, as that other, that our chapter contains divergent accounts drawn from two different sources; see on <a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a>. The number amounted to 38,000, according to their heads in men. &#1500;&#1490;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; serves for a nearer definition of &#1500;&#1490;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1501;, and explains that only men were numbered, women not being included.</body></html>
