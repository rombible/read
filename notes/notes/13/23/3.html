There was now a practical and a legitimate object for doing it. This consideration helps to determine what it was that "displeased the Lord" in the former general census of David. In connection with this clause, <a href="/1_chronicles/27-23.htm">1 Chronicles 27:23</a> should be noted, where we read, "But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens." The period from the age of thirty years up to fifty (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3, 23, 35, 39</a>) was fixed under Moses, for those "that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation" (<a href="/numbers/4-47.htm">Numbers 4:47</a>). It is not certain, however, that this census did not inquire, in point of fact, respecting some below this limit of age. For we may note ver. 24 in the first place, and this is partly explained by <a href="/numbers/8-23.htm">Numbers 8:23-25</a>. The number "thirty and eight thousand" of our present verse may be compared with the "eight thousand and five hundred and four score" of <a href="/numbers/4-47.htm">Numbers 4:47, 48</a>. It is to be observed how promptly the national council did on this occasion commence with the arrangement of the ministers of religion, "the Levites." As we read (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>) of "thirty years" of age as the appointed age for the commencement of their ministry, and (<a href="/numbers/7-3.htm">Numbers 7:3</a>) of the present or "offering" of "six covered waggons and twelve oxen," which the twelve "princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, princes of the tribes," offered "before the Lord," which greatly lessened the laborious work of the Levites; so we find the commencing age reduced from time to time, to "twenty-five" years (<a href="/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>), and to "twenty years" of age, as in our present chapter (vers. 24-28). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David then turns to the workmen, the carpenters and stone-cutters, whom he had appointed (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>) for the building. &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, properly hewers, in <a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a> limited to stone-hewers, is here, with the addition &#1493;&#1506;&#1509; &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, used of the workers in stone and wood, stonemasons and carpenters. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, all manner of understanding persons in each work, in contradistinction to &#1502;&#1500;&#1506;&#1499;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, includes the idea of thorough mastery and skill in the kind of labour. These workmen, whom David had levied for the building of the temple, are mentioned by Solomon, <a href="/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>. - In <a href="/1_chronicles/22-16.htm">1 Chronicles 22:16</a> all the metals, as being the main thing, are again grouped together, in order that the exhortation to proceed with the erection of the building may be introduced. The &#1500; before each word serves to bring the thing once more into prominence; cf. Ew. 310, a. "As for the gold, it cannot be numbered." "Arise and be doing! and Jahve be with thee" (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-17.htm">1 Chronicles 22:17-19</a>). </body></html>
