These were the sons of Levi &#8230; that did the work &#8230; from the age of twenty years and upward&#8212;The enumeration of the Levites was made by David (1Ch 23:3) on the same rule as that followed by Moses (Nu 4:3), namely, from thirty years. But he saw afterwards that this rule might be beneficially relaxed, and that the enrolment of Levites for their proper duties might be made from twenty years of age. The ark and tabernacle being now stationary at Jerusalem, the labor of the Levites was greatly diminished, as they were no longer obliged to transport its heavy furniture from place to place. The number of thirty-eight thousand Levites, exclusive of priests, was doubtless more than sufficient for the ordinary service of the tabernacle. But this pious king thought that it would contribute to the glory of the Lord to employ as many officers in his divine service as possible. These first rules, however, which David instituted, were temporary, as very different arrangements were made after the ark had been deposited in the tabernacle of Zion.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is to be understood either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

If we compare the enumeration of the Merarites in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-26.htm">1 Chronicles 24:26-30</a>, we find there in <a href="/1_chronicles/24-30.htm">1 Chronicles 24:30</a> Eleazar and Kish called sons of Mahli, with the remark that Eleazar had no sons. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-26.htm">1 Chronicles 24:26</a>, however, of the same passage we read, "sons of Merari (were) Mahli and Mushi, sons of Jaaziah his son;" and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-27.htm">1 Chronicles 24:27</a>, "sons of Merari by Jaaziah his son; and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri." From this Bertheau concludes that Merari had really three sons, and that the name of the third has been dropped out of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23.htm">1 Chronicles 23</a>; but in this he is incorrect, for <a href="/1_chronicles/23-26.htm">1 Chronicles 23:26</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/23-27.htm">1 Chronicles 23:27</a> of the 24th chapter are at once, from their whole character, recognisable as arbitrary interpolations. Not only is it strange that &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; &#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; should follow the before-mentioned sons of Merari in this unconnected way (Vav being omitted before &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;), but the form of the expression also is peculiar. If &#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; be a third son of Merari, or the founder of a third family of Merarites, coordinate with the families of Mahli and Mushi, as we must conclude from the additional word &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;, we should expect, after the preceding, simply the name with the conjunction, i.e., &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;. The &#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is all the more surprising that the names of the sons of Jaaziah follow in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-27.htm">1 Chronicles 24:27</a>, and there the name of the first son &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1501; is introduced by the Vav copulative. This misled the older commentators, so that they took &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; for a proper name. The repetition of &#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, too, at the beginning of the second verse is strange, and without parallel in the preceding enumeration of the fathers'-houses founded by Amram's sons (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-20.htm">1 Chronicles 24:20-25</a>). We must, then, as the result of all this, since the Pentateuch knows only two descendants of Merari who founded families of fathers'-houses, <p>(Note: Bertheau, on the contrary, proceeding on the hypothesis that we may presume the list of Merari's descendants which is given in our verses to have been originally in perfect agreement with that in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-26.htm">1 Chronicles 24:26-31</a>, would emend our text according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-21.htm">1 Chronicles 23:21</a>, for it cannot be doubted that in our passage also Jaaziah and his three sons were named. But since elsewhere only the two sons Mahli and Mushi occur, one can easily see why the third son Jaaziah came to be omitted from our passage, while we cannot conceive any motive which would account for the later and arbitrary interpolation of the names in <a href="/1_chronicles/24-26.htm">1 Chronicles 24:26</a>. This argumentation is weak to a degree, since it quite overlooks the main difficulty connected with this hypothesis. Had we no further accounts of the descendants of Merari than those in the two passages of the Chronicle (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-11.htm">1 Chronicles 23:11</a>. and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-26.htm">1 Chronicles 24:26-29</a>), it would be natural to suppose that in <a href="/1_chronicles/23-21.htm">1 Chronicles 23:21</a>. the additional names which we find in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a> had been dropped out. But in the genealogical lists in the Pentateuch also (<a href="/exodus/6-19.htm">Exodus 6:19</a> and <a href="/numbers/3-33.htm">Numbers 3:33</a>), only two sons of Merari are named; and according to them, the Merarites, when Moses' census of the Levites was taken, formed only two families. Had Merari had yet a third son besides the two - Mahli and Mushi, who alone were known in the time of Moses - who left descendants, forming three fathers'-houses in David's time, the omission of this third son in the family register in the Pentateuch would be quite incomprehensible. Or are we to suppose that in <a href="/exodus/6-19.htm">Exodus 6:19</a> also the name Jaaziah had been dropped out, and that in consequence of that the family descended from him has been omitted from <a href="/numbers/3-33.htm">Numbers 3:33</a>? Supported by the Pentateuch, the text of our verses is presumably entire, and this presumption of its integrity is confirmed by the character of the additions in 24:26, 27, as above exhibited.)<p>regard the additions in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-26.htm">1 Chronicles 24:26-27</a> as later glosses, although we are not in a position to explain the origin or the meaning of the interpolation. This inability arises from the fact that, of the names Jaaziah, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri, only Zaccur again occurs among the Asaphites (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-2.htm">1 Chronicles 25:2</a>), and elsewhere of other persons, while the others are nowhere else to be met with. The three families of Levi numbered therefore 9 + 9 + 4  equals  22 fathers'-houses, exclusive of the priests. </body></html>
