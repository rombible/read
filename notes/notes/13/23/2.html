Organisation of the Levites (first account)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Two accounts are given of David’s organisation of the Levites. According to the first the Levites were admitted to service at thirty years of age; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-3.htm" title="Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.">1 Chronicles 23:3</a>; cp. <a href="/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-23.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shall you number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-30.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old shall you number them, every one that enters into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:30</a>, where the period from thirty to fifty is fixed as the period for service. According to the second account (<a href="/numbers/4-24.htm" title="This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and for burdens:">Numbers 4:24</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-47.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:47</a>) the Levites were taken from twenty years old and upwards; this was apparently the later custom; cp. <a href="/2_chronicles/31-17.htm" title="Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;">2 Chronicles 31:17</a>; <a href="/ezra/3-8.htm" title="Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.">Ezra 3:8</a>. The discrepancy probably arises from an actual variation in practice. The original age of admission for Levites was probably thirty, but owing to the scarcity of their numbers it seems to have been necessary to reduce the limit of age to twenty. On the <span class="ital">Levites</span> see Ryle (<span class="ital">Ezra and Nehemiah</span> p. liii. ff.). See also on <a href="/1_chronicles/23-27.htm" title="For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:">1 Chronicles 23:27</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</span> As on an occasion of supreme importance, David, in view of his own death and of his son's succession at the present time, calls together the full council, and the highest possible representative council of the nation. So <a href="/1_chronicles/22-17.htm">1 Chronicles 22:17</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/24-6.htm">1 Chronicles 24:6</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>; in which last passage the word "captains" should have have been rendered "princes" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>). The arrangement of the Levites, and the distribution of their functions in the presence of the princes, as here described, and as it is even more strongly put (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>), "by" them, simply points to the fact that the ultimate outer authority, as between Church and state, lay with the state. The Church was made for it, not it for the Church. And it was the duty of the state to defend the Church. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David then turns to the workmen, the carpenters and stone-cutters, whom he had appointed (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>) for the building. &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, properly hewers, in <a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a> limited to stone-hewers, is here, with the addition &#1493;&#1506;&#1509; &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, used of the workers in stone and wood, stonemasons and carpenters. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, all manner of understanding persons in each work, in contradistinction to &#1502;&#1500;&#1506;&#1499;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, includes the idea of thorough mastery and skill in the kind of labour.

The &#1500; before each word serves to bring the thing once more into prominence; cf. Ew. 310, a. "As for the gold, it cannot be numbered." "Arise and be doing! and Jahve be with thee" (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-17.htm">1 Chronicles 22:17-19</a>). </body></html>
