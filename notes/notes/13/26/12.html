The statement of this verse makes it evident that the names in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-2.htm" title="And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,">1Chronicles 26:2-11</a> represent the courses of the porters or warders. As the twenty-four sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun represented the twenty-four courses of musicians in 1 Chronicles 25, a similar classification might naturally be expected here. Accordingly, we actually find seven sons of Meshelemiah (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-2.htm" title="And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,">1Chronicles 26:2-3</a>), eight sons of Obed-edom (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-4.htm" title="Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth.">1Chronicles 26:4-5</a>), and four sons of Hosah (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-10.htm" title="Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)">1Chronicles 26:10-11</a>), which together make nineteen heads and classes. It remains to add the “sons” of Shemaiah son of Obed-edom. As the text stands, these appear to be six in number, which would give a total of twenty-five (7 + 8 + 4 + 6). But the connection of the Hebrew in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-7.htm" title="The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brothers were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.">1Chronicles 26:7</a> is so unusual as to suggest at once that something is wrong: and if we assume Obed-Elzabad to represent one original composite name, like Obed-edom, we get five “sons of Shemaiah,” and so a total of twenty-four classes or courses of warders. (From this verse to the end of chapter 27 the Syriac and Arabic versions fail us.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_chronicles/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/26-12.htm" title="Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD.">1 Chronicles 26:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wards — </span>Hebrew, having <span class="ital">wards answerably to their brethren </span>the other Levites, who were divided into twenty-four courses, as the priests also, and the porters were.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:1-32 The offices of the Levites. - The porters and treasurers of the temple, had occasion for strength and valour to oppose those who wrongly attempted to enter the sanctuary, and to guard the sacred treasures. Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This verse is obscure, but its probable meaning is the following: "To these divisions of the porters, principal men, (were assigned) the watches, together with their brethren, for service in the house of the Lord;" i. e., the "chief men" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1-11</a>, amounting to no more than 93, kept the watch and ward of the house, together with a further number of their brethren (4,000, <a href="/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>), who assisted them from time to time. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

These before named were the principal men of the porters, among which was a division or distribution of them into classes or courses, in which they served weekly in turn: <p>having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the Lord; meaning either to watch in, as on the north against the south, and the east against the west, and "vice versa". The Jews say (t), the priests kept ward in three places in the house of the sanctuary; in the house of Abtines, in the house of Nitzotz, and in the house of Moked; and the Levites in twenty one places, five at the five gates of the mountain of the house, four at the four corners of it within, five at the five gates of the court, four at the four corners of it without, one at the chamber of the offering, one at the chamber of the vail, and another behind the house of atonement, the holy of holies; but rather the sense is, that they had wards or courses answerable to those of the priests, and the other Levites, the singers, and were distributed into twenty four classes or courses as they, which are thus reckoned by Kimchi; at the east six, at the north four, at the south four, at Asuppim two and two, which were four, at the west four, and at Parbar two; lo, twenty four; see <a href="/1_chronicles/26-17.htm">1 Chronicles 26:17</a>. <p>(t) Misn.

And if at any time of the history it were the case that these ninety-three were the leaders of groups among the total of "four thousand porters," it would put exactly forty-two under each of these ninety-three, leaving but one over. This number ninety-three, meantime, does not agree with the <span class="accented">two hundred and twelve</span> of <a href="/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>.

At the same time, no little light may be thrown on this subject by noticing that the porters numbered in Zerubbabel's time one <span class="accented">hundred and thirty-nine</span> (<a href="/ezra/2-42.htm">Ezra 2:42</a>); and that the number one <span class="accented">hundred and seventy-two</span> is given for them by Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/11-19.htm">Nehemiah 11:19</a>). The conclusion may well be that the numbers varied in David's time and the other times severally;and that the date in question (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>) was not the same with the date of David in our present chapter, but was a subsequent date nearer the time of the Captivity. There is, therefore, no special ground for doubting the accuracy of the numbers given in this chapter. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Obed-edom's family. Obed-edom has been already mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a> as doorkeeper; see the commentary on the passage. From our passage we learn that Obed-edom belonged to the Kohathite family of the Korahites. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-19.htm">1 Chronicles 26:19</a>, the doorkeepers were Korahites and Merarites. The Merarites, however, are only treated of from <a href="/1_chronicles/26-10.htm">1 Chronicles 26:10</a> and onwards. &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491; (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-4.htm">1 Chronicles 26:4</a>) corresponds to &#1493;&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-2.htm">1 Chronicles 26:2</a>), and is consequently thereby brought under &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1</a>). Here, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-4.htm">1 Chronicles 26:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-5.htm">1 Chronicles 26:5</a>, eight sons with whom God had blessed him (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/13-14.htm">1 Chronicles 13:14</a>), and in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-6.htm">1 Chronicles 26:6</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/26-7.htm">1 Chronicles 26:7</a> his grandchildren, are enumerated. The verb &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; is used in the singular, with a subject following in the plural, as frequently (cf. Ew. 316, a). The grandchildren of Obed-edom by his first-born son Shemaiah are characterized as &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, the dominions, i.e., the lords (rulers) of the house of their fathers (&#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, the abstract dominion, for the concrete &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;; cf. Ew. 160, b), because they were &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, valiant heroes, and so qualified for the office of doorkeepers. In the enumeration in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-7.htm">1 Chronicles 26:7</a>, the omission of the &#1493; cop. with &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1500;&#1494;&#1489;&#1491; is strange; probably we must supply &#1493; before both words, and take them thus: And Elzabad and his brethren, valiant men, (viz.) Elihu and Semachiah. For the conjecture that the names of the &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; are not given (Berth.) is not a very probable one. </body></html>
