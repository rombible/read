Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Obed-edom and Hosah <a href="/1_chronicles/26-10.htm">1 Chronicles 26:10</a> had been "porters," or door - keepers, from the time of the bringing up of the ark into Jerusalem <a href="/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. mighty men of valour&#8212;The circumstance of physical strength is prominently noticed in this chapter, as the office of the porters required them not only to act as sentinels of the sacred edifice and its precious furniture against attacks of plunderers or popular insurrection&#8212;to be, in fact, a military guard&#8212;but, after the temple was built, to open and shut the gates, which were extraordinarily large and ponderous.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The sons of Shemaiah,....
