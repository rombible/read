Much was expended daily upon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps; quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestments and utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. These treasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house, enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchable riches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from his fulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of our abilities and substance according to his will. We have an account of those employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinance of God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and must not be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the service of the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned in this outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man. Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy of mind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rulers - This term is somewhat too strong.

The number of chief fathers mentioned in this verse leads Keil to point out very justly that here at least the designation cannot mean anything beyond the fathers of individual families - cannot mean the heads of those groups which are composed of all the branches or relations of one house. They must have been heads of households (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), not heads of <span class="accented">fathers</span> <span class="accented">houses</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>).

Adding the numbers of vers. 30 and 32, we find a total of Hebronite "officers and judges" amounting to four thousand four hundred. The remaining sixteen hundred to complete the" six thousand" were drawn from the Gershon, Amram, and Izhar families. Some of the Uzzielites probably helped the Hebronites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This Shelomoth (a descendant of Eliezer, and so to be distinguished both from the Jisharite Shelomith <a href="/1_chronicles/23-18.htm">1 Chronicles 23:18</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-22.htm">1 Chronicles 24:22</a>, and the Gershonite of the same name <a href="/1_chronicles/23-9.htm">1 Chronicles 23:9</a>), and his brethren were over the treasures of the consecrated things which David the king had consecrated, and the heads of the fathers'-houses, etc. Instead of &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; we must read &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;, according to <a href="/1_chronicles/29-6.htm">1 Chronicles 29:6</a>. The princes over the thousands and hundreds are the war captains, and the &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; are the commanders-in-chief, e.g., Abner, Joab, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-34.htm">1 Chronicles 27:34</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-15.htm">1 Chronicles 18:15</a>. - The 27th verse is an explanatory parenthesis: "from the wars and from the booty," i.e., from the booty taken in war had they consecrated. &#1500;&#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;, to make strong, i.e., to preserve in strength and good condition the house of Jahve. &#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511; elsewhere of the renovation of old buildings, <a href="/2_kings/12-8.htm">2 Kings 12:8</a>., <a href="/nehemiah/3-2.htm">Nehemiah 3:2</a>., here in a somewhat general signification. - In <a href="/1_chronicles/26-28.htm">1 Chronicles 26:28</a> the enumeration of those who had consecrated, thus interrupted, is resumed, but in the form of a new sentence, which concludes with a predicate of its own. In &#1492;&#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; the article represents &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as in <a href="/1_chronicles/29-17.htm">1 Chronicles 29:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-36.htm">2 Chronicles 29:36</a>, and elsewhere; cf.

But in what relation does the statement in v. 24, that Shebuel, the descendant of Moses through Gershon, was &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, stand to this? Bertheau thinks "that three kinds of treasures are distinguished, the guarding of which was committed to different officials: (1) The sons of Jehieli, Zetham and Joel, had the oversight of the treasures of the house of God, which, as we may conclude from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-8.htm">1 Chronicles 29:8</a>, had been collected by voluntary gifts: (2) Shebuel was prince over the treasures, perhaps over the sums which resulted from regular assessment for the temple (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>), from redemption-money, e.g., for the first-born (<a href="/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>.), or for vows (Lev); consequently over a part of the sums which are designated in <a href="/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a> by the name &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1505;&#1507;: (3) Shelomith and his brothers had the oversight of all the &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., of the consecrated gifts which are called in <a href="/2_kings/12-19.htm">2 Kings 12:19</a> &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501;, and distinguished from the &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1505;&#1507; in <a href="/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a>." But this view has no support in the text. Both in the superscription (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-20.htm">1 Chronicles 26:20</a>) and in the enumeration (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-22.htm">1 Chronicles 26:22</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/26-26.htm">1 Chronicles 26:26</a>) only two kinds of treasures-treasures of the house of God (of Jahve), and treasures of the &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; - are mentioned. Neither by the facts nor by the language used are we justified in supposing that there was a third kind of treasures, viz., the sums resulting from the regular assessment for the holy place. For it is thoroughly arbitrary to confine the treasures of the house of God to the voluntary contributions and the consecrated gifts given from the war-booty; and it is still more arbitrary to limit the treasures over which Shebuel was prince to the sums flowing into the temple treasures from the regular assessment; for the reference to <a href="/2_kings/12-19.htm">2 Kings 12:19</a> and <a href="/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a> is no proof of this, because, though two kinds of &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are there distinguished, yet both are further defined. The quite general expression &#1492;&#1488;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, the treasures, can naturally be referred only to the two different kinds of treasures distinguished in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-22.htm">1 Chronicles 26:22</a>. This reference is also demanded by the words &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;...&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-24.htm">1 Chronicles 26:24</a>). Heads of fathers'-houses, with their brethren (&#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;), are mentioned as guardians of the two kinds of treasures spoken of in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-20.htm">1 Chronicles 26:20</a>; while here, on the contrary, we have Shebuel alone, without assistants. Further, the other guardians are not called &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, as Shebuel is. The word &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; denotes not an overseer or steward, but only princes of kingdoms (kings), princes of tribes (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-27.htm">1 Chronicles 12:27</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-1.htm">1 Chronicles 13:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-21.htm">2 Chronicles 32:21</a>), ministers of the palace and the temple, and commanders-in-chief (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-11.htm">2 Chronicles 11:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-7.htm">2 Chronicles 28:7</a>), and is consequently used in our section neither of Zetham and Joel, nor of Shelomoth. The calling of Shebuel &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; consequently shows that he was the chief guardian of the sacred treasures, under whose oversight the guardians of the two different kinds of treasures were placed. This is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-23.htm">1 Chronicles 26:23</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/26-24.htm">1 Chronicles 26:24</a>; and the statement would not have been misunderstood if it had been placed at the beginning or the end of the enumeration; and its position in the middle between the Gershonites and the Kohathites is explained by the fact that this prince was, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-16.htm">1 Chronicles 23:16</a>, the head of the four Levite families descended from Kohath. </body></html>
