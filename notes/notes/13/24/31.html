In the mystical body of Christ, every member has its use, for the good of the whole. Christ is High Priest over the house of God, to whom all believers, being made priests, are to be in subjection. In Christ, no difference is made between bond and free, elder and younger. The younger brethren, if faithful and sincere, shall be no less acceptable to Christ than the fathers.

As there were 24 courses of the priests, so we must suppose that there were 24 of the Levites, though the number of the families as given in the text <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-7.htm">1 Chronicles 23:7-23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-20.htm">1 Chronicles 24:20-30</a> is 25. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. one principal household&#8212;The marginal reading is preferable, "one house of the father." The lot was cast in a deliberate and solemn manner in presence of the king, the princes, the two high priests, and the chiefs of the priestly and Levitical families. The heads of families belonging to Eleazar and Ithamar were alternately brought forward to draw, and the name of each individual, as called, registered by an attendant secretary. To accommodate the casting of the lots to the inequality of the number, there being sixteen fathers' houses of Eleazar, and only eight of Ithamar, it was arranged that every house of Ithamar should be followed by two of Eleazar, or, what is the same thing, that every two houses of Eleazar should be followed by one of Ithamar. If, then, we suppose a commencement to have been made by Eleazar, the order would be as follows: one and two, Eleazar; three, Ithamar; four and five, Eleazar; six, Ithamar; seven and eight, Eleazar; nine, Ithamar; and so forth [Bertheau]. The lot determined also the order of the priests' service. That of the Levites was afterwards distributed by the same arrangement (1Ch 24:31).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Over against their brethren the sons of Aaron, </span> i.e. answerable for number and order to those of the priests, so as there should be a several course of the Levites for each course of the priests.

In any case, the names of the heads of the classes formed by the Hebronites are wanting; but it is impossible to ascertain whether they have been dropped out only by a later copyist, or were not contained in the authority made use of by our historian, for even the lxx had our text.</body></html>
