The lot was cast in a deliberate and solemn manner in presence of the king, the princes, the two high priests, and the chiefs of the priestly and Levitical families. The heads of families belonging to Eleazar and Ithamar were alternately brought forward to draw, and the name of each individual, as called, registered by an attendant secretary. To accommodate the casting of the lots to the inequality of the number, there being sixteen fathers' houses of Eleazar, and only eight of Ithamar, it was arranged that every house of Ithamar should be followed by two of Eleazar, or, what is the same thing, that every two houses of Eleazar should be followed by one of Ithamar. If, then, we suppose a commencement to have been made by Eleazar, the order would be as follows: one and two, Eleazar; three, Ithamar; four and five, Eleazar; six, Ithamar; seven and eight, Eleazar; nine, Ithamar; and so forth [Bertheau]. The lot determined also the order of the priests' service.

Each course served a week from the seventh day to the seventh (<a href="/2_kings/11-9.htm">2 Kings 11:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-8.htm">2 Chronicles 23:8</a>). An interesting allusion to this order of courses is tacitly made in <a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16-18</a>, where the twenty-fifth idolater may be supposed to be the high priest. Some have, on very insufficient grounds, supposed that this "ordering" of courses was not really the institution of David, but attributed to him after the Exile for the sake of the authority of his name. In <a href="/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-7</a>, moreover, the names do not appear as even twenty-four, but twenty-two - deficient by two! - a thing most easily to be accounted for. In addition to the direct scriptural witness on this subject, Josephus's ('Ant.,' 7:14) testimony confirms the account of our present chapter, while Movers (in 'Chronik.,' 279) and Dehler (in Herzog's 'R.E.,' 12:185) effectively combat the positions of De Wette and Gramberg, and of Herzberg, in his 'History of the People of Israel.' <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"He set them down," viz., the classes, as the lot had determined them. &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, of the tribe of Levi. &#1493;&#1500; &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; belongs to &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, heads of the fathers'-houses of the priests and of the Levites. The second hemistich of <a href="/1_chronicles/24-6.htm">1 Chronicles 24:6</a> gives a more detailed account of the drawing of the lots: "One father's-house was drawn for Eleazar, and drawn for Ithamar." The last words are obscure. &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, to lay hold of, to draw forth (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/31-30.htm">Numbers 31:30</a>, <a href="/numbers/31-47.htm">Numbers 31:47</a>), here used of drawing lots, signifies plucked forth or drawn from the urn. The father's-house was plucked forth from the urn, the lot bearing its name being drawn. &#1494;&#1488;&#1494; &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1494;, which is the only well-attested reading, only some few MSS containing the reading &#1488;&#1492;&#1494; &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, is very difficult. Although this various reading is a mere conjecture, yet Gesen. (Thes. p. 68), with Cappell and Grotius, prefers it. The repetition of the same word expresses sometimes totality, multitude, sometimes a distributive division; and here can only be taken in this last signification: one father's-house drawn for Eleazar, and then always drawn (or always one drawn) for Ithamar. So much at least is clear, that the lots of the two priestly families were not placed in one urn, but were kept apart in different urns, so that the lots might be drawn alternately for Eleazar and Ithamar. Had the lot for Eleazar been first drawn, and thereafter that for Ithamar, since Eleazar's family was the more numerous, they would have had an advantage over the Ithamarites. But it was not to be allowed that one family should have an advantage over the other, and the lots were consequently drawn alternately, one for the one, and another for the other. But as the Eleazarites were divided into sixteen fathers'-houses, and the Ithamarites into eight, Bertheau thinks that it was settled, in order to bring about an equality in the numbers sixteen and eight, in so far as the drawing of the lots was concerned, that each house of Ithamar should represent two lots, or, which is the same thing, that after every two houses of Eleazarites one house of Ithamarites should follow, and that the order of succession of the single houses was fixed according to this arrangement. To this or some similar conception of the manner of settling the order of succession we are brought, he says, by the relation of the number eight to sixteen, and by the words &#1488;&#1492;&#1494; and &#1488;&#1492;&#1494; &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1494;. But even though this conception be readily suggested by the relation of the number sixteen to eight, yet we cannot see how the words &#1488;&#1492;&#1494; and &#1488;&#1492;&#1494; &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1494; indicate it. These words would much rather suggest that a lot for Eleazar alternated with the drawing of one for Ithamar, until the eight heads of Ithamar's family had been drawn, when, of course, the remaining eight lots of Eleazar must be drawn one after the other. We cannot, however, come to any certain judgment on the matter, for the words are so obscure as to be unintelligible even to the old translators. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-7.htm">1 Chronicles 24:7-18</a> we have the names of the fathers'-houses in the order of succession which had been determined by the lot. &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, of the lot coming forth from the urn, as in <a href="/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1</a>. The names Jehoiarib and Jedaiah occur together also in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-10.htm">1 Chronicles 9:10</a>; and Jedaiah is met with, besides, in <a href="/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/7-39.htm">Nehemiah 7:39</a>. The priest Mattathias, 1 Macc. 2:1, came of the class of Jehoiarib. Of the succeeding names, &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-8.htm">1 Chronicles 24:8</a>), &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1488;&#1489; (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-13.htm">1 Chronicles 24:13</a>), and &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1509; (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-15.htm">1 Chronicles 24:15</a>) do not elsewhere occur; others, such as &#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-13.htm">1 Chronicles 24:13</a>), &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-17.htm">1 Chronicles 24:17</a>), do not recur among the names of priests. The sixteenth class, Immer, on the contrary, and the twenty-first, Jachin, are often mentioned; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-10.htm">1 Chronicles 9:10</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/9-12.htm">1 Chronicles 9:12</a>. Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, belonged to the eighth, Abiah (<a href="/luke/1-5.htm">Luke 1:5</a>). </body></html>
