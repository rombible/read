Solomon says, the lot causes contention to cease. It is evident from the Scriptures, that it was a very ancient custom to refer matters of a doubtful nature to the decision of the lot; and, in particular, persons were often chosen in this way to sacred offices. But, as it is an appeal to God, it ought to be managed with a proper reverence and sincerity. Thus Matthias was chosen to the apostleship by lot with solemn prayer. “And I know not,” says Henry, “but it might still be used, in faith, in parallel cases, as an instituted ordinance.” <span class="ital">One sort with another — </span>Both the sons of Eleazar and those of Ithamar were thus chosen, who should wait together. <span class="ital">Governors of the house of God — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">governors of God; </span>that is, the judges, says Houbigant.
