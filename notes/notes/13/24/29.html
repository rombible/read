In the mystical body of Christ, every member has its use, for the good of the whole. Christ is High Priest over the house of God, to whom all believers, being made priests, are to be in subjection. In Christ, no difference is made between bond and free, elder and younger. The younger brethren, if faithful and sincere, shall be no less acceptable to Christ than the fathers.

The lot was cast in a deliberate and solemn manner in presence of the king, the princes, the two high priests, and the chiefs of the priestly and Levitical families. The heads of families belonging to Eleazar and Ithamar were alternately brought forward to draw, and the name of each individual, as called, registered by an attendant secretary. To accommodate the casting of the lots to the inequality of the number, there being sixteen fathers' houses of Eleazar, and only eight of Ithamar, it was arranged that every house of Ithamar should be followed by two of Eleazar, or, what is the same thing, that every two houses of Eleazar should be followed by one of Ithamar. If, then, we suppose a commencement to have been made by Eleazar, the order would be as follows: one and two, Eleazar; three, Ithamar; four and five, Eleazar; six, Ithamar; seven and eight, Eleazar; nine, Ithamar; and so forth [Bertheau]. The lot determined also the order of the priests' service. That of the Levites was afterwards distributed by the same arrangement (1Ch 24:31).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Kish; </span> another of Mahli’s sons, as appears from <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/23-21.htm" title="The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi.

Instead of enumerating the names of the chiefs of the classes into which David divided the four fathers'-houses into which Hebron's descendants fell for the temple service, we find only the four names of the heads of the fathers'-houses repeated, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-19.htm">1 Chronicles 23:19</a>, - introduced, too, by &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; as sons of...Bertheau would therefore interpolate the name &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; after &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; (according to <a href="/1_chronicles/23-19.htm">1 Chronicles 23:19</a>). This interpolation is probably correct, but is not quite beyond doubt, for possibly only the &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; of the four sons of Hebron named could be mentioned as being busied about the service of the sanctuary according to their divisions. In any case, the names of the heads of the classes formed by the Hebronites are wanting; but it is impossible to ascertain whether they have been dropped out only by a later copyist, or were not contained in the authority made use of by our historian, for even the lxx had our text.</body></html>
