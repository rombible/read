Here is an account of the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on the return from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8. Blessed be His name, believers there shall, not in turn, but all together, without interruption, praise him night and day: may the Lord make each of us fit for the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, "For the four chief porters, who were themselves Levites, were in trust, who also had the charge of the chambers, etc." A contrast seems intended between the four chief porters, whose charge was constant, and the remainder, who kept watch by turns. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. the king's gate&#8212;The king had a gate from his palace into the temple (2Ki 16:18), which doubtless was kept constantly closed except for the monarch's use; and although there was no king in Israel on the return from the captivity, yet the old ceremonial was kept up, probably in the hope that the scepter would, ere long, be restored to the house of David. It is an honor by which Eastern kings are distinguished, to have a gate exclusively devoted to their own special use, and which is kept constantly closed, except when he goes out or returns (Eze 44:2). There being no king then in Israel, this gate would be always shut.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They lodged round about the house of God; </span> therefore they were obliged to constant residence in the place; and were not permitted to dwell in the villages, as their brethren were. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they lodged round about the house of God,....

The reference is to the four “chief porters” (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-26.htm" title="For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.">1 Chronicles 9:26</a>).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/1_chronicles/9-21.htm">1 Chronicles 9:21</a> is quite unconnected with the preceding context, the conjunction w being omitted, and its contents also present considerable difficulties. Zechariah, the son of Meshelemiah, can only be the Zechariah who is mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-2.htm">1 Chronicles 26:2</a> as the first-born of Meshelemiah, and who lived in the time of David; for at the time when David divided the porters into classes, there fell to him the lot towards midnight, i.e., the duty of waiting at the door on the north side of the holy place (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-14.htm">1 Chronicles 26:14</a>). With this, indeed, the general statement of our verse, "he was porter of the door (or the entrance) of the tent of the covenant," is not inconsistent. But what purpose does this general statement serve? With what design is Zechariah, and he alone, mentioned? We have no means of giving a definite answer to this question; but he may perhaps be named as being the person who, before David's division of the Levites into classes was carried out, had charge of the porters' service in the tabernacle. But even if this conjecture be accepted as well grounded, the abrupt way in which it is mentioned still remains enigmatical.</body></html>
