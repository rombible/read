Here is an account of the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on the return from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praising God, Re 4:8. Blessed be His name, believers there shall, not in turn, but all together, without interruption, praise him night and day: may the Lord make each of us fit for the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The porters, like the singers <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-29.htm">Nehemiah 12:29</a>, dwelt for the most part in the villages round Jerusalem. They were the descendants of those originally selected for the work by David. David's arrangements are here regarded as having had the sanction of Samuel - which would imply that he planned them in the lifetime of Saul, while he was still a fugitive and an outlaw. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. the king's gate&#8212;The king had a gate from his palace into the temple (2Ki 16:18), which doubtless was kept constantly closed except for the monarch's use; and although there was no king in Israel on the return from the captivity, yet the old ceremonial was kept up, probably in the hope that the scepter would, ere long, be restored to the house of David. It is an honor by which Eastern kings are distinguished, to have a gate exclusively devoted to their own special use, and which is kept constantly closed, except when he goes out or returns (Eze 44:2). There being no king then in Israel, this gate would be always shut.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The porters, </span> i.e. the chief porters, as this is explained, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/9-26.htm" title="For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.">1 Chronicles 9:26</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>In four quarters were the porters,....

The first half of this verse, "And until now (is he) in the king's gate eastward," must be referred to Shallum (Berth.). To imagine a reference to all the doorkeepers, "until now are they," does not suit <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-24.htm">1 Chronicles 9:24-26</a>, according to which the doorkeepers kept guard upon all the four sides. The eastern gate of the temple was called the king's gate, because by this gate the king went in and out to the temple; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1-2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/41-3.htm">Ezekiel 41:3</a>. The remark, "until now is Shallum watcher," etc., presupposes the existence of the temple at the time of the preparation of this register, and points to the pre-exilic time. Against this Bertheau has raised the objection that the name king's gate may have been retained even in the post-exilic times for the eastern gate. This must of course be in general admitted, but could only be accepted if it were proved that Shallum lived after the exile. This proof Bertheau obtains by taking the words, "until now is Shallum in the king's gate," to mean, "that, according to the ancient arrangement, Shallum, the chief of all the doorkeepers, had still to guard the eastern entrance; according to which Shallum would be the collective designation of the whole series of the chiefs of the doorkeepers who lived from David's time till after the exile;" but the words cannot be thus interpreted. Such an interpretation cannot be made plausible by identifying the name Shallum with Meshelemiah or Shelemiah, to whose lot it fell in the time of David to be doorkeeper to the eastward (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/26-14.htm">1 Chronicles 26:14</a>); for in doing so, we would overlook the fact that in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-21.htm">1 Chronicles 9:21</a> of our chapter also he bears the name Meshelemiah. The circumstance that both Shallum and Meshelemiah are called Ben-Kore, of the sons of Abiasaph, by no means justifies the identification of these two quite different names; for it is neither necessary nor probable that &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; should here be taken in its narrower sense, and Kore regarded as the immediate father of both. The name &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; is repeated in the family of the east doorkeepers, as we learn from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-14.htm">2 Chronicles 31:14</a>, where it is stated that this office was held by a Kore ben Jimna. "These (who are named in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a>) are the doorkeepers for the camp of the sons of Levi" (of the Levites), - an antiquated expression, bringing to remembrance the time of Moses, when the Levites, on the journey through the wilderness, were encamped about the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/3-21.htm">Numbers 3:21</a>.).</body></html>
