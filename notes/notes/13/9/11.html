Almost all the names recur in Nehemiah (Ne 11:1-36), although there are differences which will be explained there. The same division of the people into four classes was continued after, as before the captivity; namely, the priests, Levites, natives, who now were called by the common name of Israelites, and the Nethinims (Jos 9:27; Ezr 2:43; 8:20). When the historian speaks of "the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions," he implies that there were others who afterwards returned and settled in possessions not occupied by the first. Accordingly, we read of a great number returning successively under Ezra, Nehemiah, and at a later period. And some of those who returned to the ancient inheritance of their fathers, had lived before the time of the captivity (Ezr 3:12; Hag 2:4, 10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Azariah; </span> the same called <span class="ital">Seraiah</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/nehemiah/11-11.htm" title="Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler of the house of God.">Nehemiah 11:11</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hilkiah</span>; either of him in Josiah’s time, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm" title="And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.

The ins and outs of the lists of these verses confirm the supposition that the way in which differences in the other lists occur are easily to be accounted for, in one compiler having selected some of the names of the whole line of genealogy, and another others, though in each several case according to reasons often unknown by us. Thus, between <span class="cmt_word">Jeroham</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Pashur</span> the table of Nehemiah supplies three additional links in the names Pelaliah, Amzi, Zechariah; while in our very next verse, for the three between <span class="cmt_word">Maasiai</span> (Amashai) and <span class="cmt_word">Meshillemith</span>, Nehemiah has only two names, and neither of those two (Azareel, Ahasai) the same as found here. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of the family of Shelah, Asaiah the first-born, and his other) sons. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, after &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512;, can only be understood of the other sons or descendants. But the epithet give to Asaiah, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;, is surprising, for it is a formation from &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1503;, and appears to denote a native of Shiloh, a well-known city of Ephraim. This derivation, however, is not suitable, since here the sons (descendants) of Judah are enumerated; and no connection between the inhabitants of Judah and the Ephraimite city Shiloh can either be proved or is at all likely. The older commentators, therefore, have suggested the reading &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-20.htm">Numbers 26:20</a>, where the family of Shelah, the third sons of Judah, is so called. This suggestion is doubtless correct, and the erroneous punctuation &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; has probably arisen only from the scriptio plena of the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;. This supposition is confirmed by the fact that the form &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; is found in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-5.htm">Nehemiah 11:5</a>, although it also is pointed &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;. In Neh. loc. cit., instead of Asaiah, Maaseiah is introduced as &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; in the seventh generation, while no ancestors whatever of our Asaiah are mentioned. The name &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1492;, moreover, is not unfrequent, and occurs in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-36.htm">1 Chronicles 4:36</a> among the Simeonites; in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-15.htm">1 Chronicles 6:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>, among the Levites; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-12.htm">2 Kings 22:12</a>, <a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-20.htm">2 Chronicles 34:20</a>, as &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; of the King Josiah. &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492; is the name of many persons, e.g., in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-20.htm">1 Chronicles 15:20</a>, and likewise in <a href="/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-21.htm">Jeremiah 29:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>; and elsewhere it is used of men of other tribes: so that even should Maaseiah have been written instead of Asaiah merely by an error of transcription, we are not warranted in identifying our Asaiah with the Maaseiah of Nehemiah.</body></html>
