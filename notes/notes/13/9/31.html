Work is likely to be done well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes a business of it. God is the God of order.

It is an honor by which Eastern kings are distinguished, to have a gate exclusively devoted to their own special use, and which is kept constantly closed, except when he goes out or returns (Eze 44:2).

The infinitive &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; with &#1500; expresses duty, as in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>. The seventh day is the Sabbath of the week, on which each class in order had to take charge of the services. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1501; are the chiefs mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a> who dwelt in Jerusalem, and of whom it is said in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26</a>, "for they are on their fidelity, the four mighty of the doorkeepers." In explanation of the &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, Bertheau very fittingly compares &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, <a href="/luke/22-52.htm">Luke 22:52</a>. The words &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1501;, which may be translated, "they are the Levites," or "they (viz., the Levites)," are somewhat surprising. The Masoretic punctuation demands the latter translation, when the words would be an emphatic elucidation of the preceding &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;. Were they a subscription, we should expect &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; instead of &#1492;&#1501;; while, on the other hand, the circumstance noticed by Bertheau, that in the following verses the duties not merely of the doorkeepers, but of the Levites in general, are enumerated, would seem to favour that sense. Even in the second half of the <a href="/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a> it is not the doorkeepers who are spoken of, but the Levites in general. May we not suppose that the text originally stood &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503; (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/9-14.htm">1 Chronicles 9:14</a>) instead of &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1492;&#1501;, and that the reading of our present text, having originated in a transcriber's error, found acceptance from the circumstance that <a href="/1_chronicles/9-27.htm">1 Chronicles 9:27</a> apparently still treats of, or returns to, the service of the doorkeepers? So much is certain, that from <a href="/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26</a> onward the duties of the Levites in general, no longer those of the doorkeepers, are spoken of, and that consequently we must regard the Levites (&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;), and not the before-mentioned four doorkeepers, as the subject of &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;: "and the Levites were over the cells of the storehouses of the house of God." The cells in the outbuildings of the temple served as treasure-chambers and storehouses for the temple furniture. &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; with the article in the stat. constr.
