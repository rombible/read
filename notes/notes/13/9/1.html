Original Registers of Israel and Judah's Genealogies.<p>1. all Israel were reckoned by genealogies&#8212;From the beginning of the Hebrew nation, public records were kept, containing a registration of the name of every individual, as well as the tribe and family to which he belonged. "The book of the kings of Israel and Judah" does not refer to the two canonical books that are known in Scripture by that name, but to authenticated copies of those registers, placed under the official care of the sovereigns; and as a great number of the Israelites (1Ch 9:3) took refuge in Judah during the invasion of Shalmaneser, they carried the public records along with them. The genealogies given in the preceding chapters were drawn from the public records in the archives both of Israel and Judah; and those given in this chapter relate to the period subsequent to the restoration; whence it appears (compare 1Ch 3:17-24) that the genealogical registers were kept during the captivity in Babylon. These genealogical tables, then, are of the highest authority for truth and correctness, the earlier portion being extracted from the authenticated records of the nation; and as to those which belong to the time of the captivity, they were drawn up by a contemporary writer, who, besides enjoying the best sources of information, and being of the strictest integrity, was guided and preserved from all error by divine inspiration.The chief of the tribe of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh, who returned from captivity, and dwelt at Jerusalem, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/1_chronicles/9-1.htm" title="So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression....">1 Chronicles 9:1-9</a></span>.

His son is called here and in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-40.htm">1 Chronicles 9:40</a> Meribbaal, while in <a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/9-6.htm">2 Samuel 9:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-25.htm">2 Samuel 19:25</a>, he is called Mephibosheth, because the name "striver with Baal" has been changed into &#1502;&#1508;&#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, exterminans idolum. This Meribbaal, who was lame in his feet (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), had a son Micha (&#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492;, in <a href="/2_samuel/9-12.htm">2 Samuel 9:12</a> written &#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1488;), of whom came a numerous race. He had four sons (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-35.htm">1 Chronicles 8:35</a>), and the family of the last-named of these (Ahaz) is traced down, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-36.htm">1 Chronicles 8:36-40</a>, through ten generations to the great-grandson of Eshek. First it is traced from Ahaz to Alemeth (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-36.htm">1 Chronicles 8:36</a>); then through Zimri, brother of this latter, to Binea, by &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;; then further by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; (hisson) to Azel, of whom in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-38.htm">1 Chronicles 8:38</a> six sons are enumerated; and finally, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-39.htm">1 Chronicles 8:39</a>, the sons of his brother Eshek are named, and the sons and grandsons of the first-born of this latter are then enumerated. The last two verses are wanting after <a href="/1_chronicles/9-44.htm">1 Chronicles 9:44</a>. The names in the two registers correspond, except at one point, where we cannot get rid of the discrepancy that for &#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-36.htm">1 Chronicles 8:36</a>) there stands in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-42.htm">1 Chronicles 9:42</a> &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; both times, probably through an error of transcription, by which out of the shortened form &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; there arose &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, &#1491; and &#1512; being interchanged. Besides this, instead of the &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1506; of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-35.htm">1 Chronicles 8:35</a>, we have in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-41.htm">1 Chronicles 9:41</a>, according to the harder pronunciation of the gutturals, &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1506;; and for &#1512;&#1508;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-37.htm">1 Chronicles 8:37</a>, we have in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-41.htm">1 Chronicles 9:41</a> the longer original form &#1512;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492;. Now since Ahaz, whose posterity is traced down to the tenth generation, was descended from Jonathan in the third generation, and his grandfather Mephibosheth was a boy of five years of age at the death of Saul and Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), the grandsons of Ulam, mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>, will be the thirteenth generation of Jonathan's descendants. Now Jonathan fell along with Saul in the year 1055 b.c., and consequently this thirteenth generation of Jonathan's descendants lived probably about 700 b.c., i.e., about 100 years before the Babylonian exile; for, according to the analogy of the royal race of David, we cannot reckon more than twenty-five years on an average for each generation.<p>(Note: Bertheau holds a contrary opinion to that given in the text, and thinks that by the numerous sons and grandsons of Ulam the son of Eshek we are brought down to post-exilic times, seeing that if Saul lived about 1080 b.c., and thirty years are reckoned to each one of the thirteen generations (Eshek being a descendant of Saul in the thirteenth generation), Azel and Eshek must have lived about 690 b.c. But this estimate is too high, for we cannot reckon sixty years to Saul and Jonathan from 1080 onwards, since Jonathan fell along with Saul in 1055, and his son Meribbaal was then hardly five years old, and must consequently have been born in 1060. For the following generations, moreover, not more than twenty-five years on an average should be reckoned. That being the case, the children's children of Ulam's sons, who were the twelfth generation of Micha's descendants, may have lived from 760 b.c. onwards, and during this period, from 760 to 700, may have increased to the troop of blooming grandchildren of Ulam mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>. But even supposing that thirty years should be reckoned for each generation, the last-named generation of 150 grandsons and great-grandsons of Ulam would have lived in the period from 660 to 600, i.e., before the exile, or at least before the first great deportation of the people with Jehoiakim in the year 599 b.c.) </body></html>
