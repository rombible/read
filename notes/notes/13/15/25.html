The awkwardness of the whole sentence arises from the fact that the Chronicler has filled out the briefer statement of <a href="/2_samuel/6-13.htm" title="And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatted calves.">2 Samuel 6:13</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These singers formed three choirs, according to the instruments they played.

These three Hebrew words plainly denote different keys in singing, but are, owing to our small acquaintance with the music of the Hebrews, obscure, and cannot be interpreted with certainty. &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;, going over from the fundamental signification glitter, shine, into the idea of outshining and superior capacity, overwhelming ability, might also, as a musical term, denote the conducting of the playing and singing as well as the leading of them. The signification to direct is here, however, excluded by the context, for the conductors were without doubt the three chief musicians or bandmasters (Capellenmeister), Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, with the cymbals, not the psaltery and lute players belonging to the second rank. The conducting must therefore be expressed by &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;, and this word must mean "in order to give a clear tone," i.e., to regulate the tune and the tone of the singing, while &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495; signifies "to take the lead in playing;" cf. Del. on <a href="/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1</a>. This word, moreover, is probably not to be restricted to the singers with the lutes, the third choir, but must be held to refer also to the second choir. The meaning then will be, that Heman, Asaph, and Ethan had cymbals to direct the song, while the other singers had partly psalteries, partly lutes, in order to play the accompaniment to the singing. The song of these two choirs is moreover distinguished and defined by &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500;. These words specify the kind of voices; &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500; after the manner of virgins, i.e., in the soprano; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500;, after the octave, i.e., in bass - al ottava bassa.
