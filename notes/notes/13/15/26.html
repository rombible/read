God had been adverse to those who conducted the Ark on the former occasion (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-9.htm" title="And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.">1Chronicles 13:9</a>), as was inferred from the sudden death of Uzza. Now, when the Levites had undertaken the work in due order, and no harm had befallen, it was understood that the Divine goodwill was with the enterprise. That they had borne the holy Ark six paces without any sign of wrath was enough to call forth the grateful offerings of hearts relieved from a dread which only ceased to haunt them when the event proved it to be groundless. Our text, more exact than Samuel, gives the number and kind of the victims then sacrificed. Others refer the two accounts to different sacrifices, taking Samuel to mean that at every six paces a bullock and a fat sheep were slain by priests stationed all along the course, while they suppose our text to refer to a final sacrifice, offered when the Ark had reached its destination. This solution of the difficulty appears incredible, especially as regards the supposition of priests not mentioned in the narrative. Another view understands our text in this sense, but makes the offering in Samuel an initial sacrifice of consecration. But it is not likely that the two sacrifices are really different: (1) because the narrative here is generally parallel with Samuel; and (2) the chronicler may have intentionally paraphrased the older text for the sake of explanation.

These three Hebrew words plainly denote different keys in singing, but are, owing to our small acquaintance with the music of the Hebrews, obscure, and cannot be interpreted with certainty. &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;, going over from the fundamental signification glitter, shine, into the idea of outshining and superior capacity, overwhelming ability, might also, as a musical term, denote the conducting of the playing and singing as well as the leading of them. The signification to direct is here, however, excluded by the context, for the conductors were without doubt the three chief musicians or bandmasters (Capellenmeister), Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, with the cymbals, not the psaltery and lute players belonging to the second rank. The conducting must therefore be expressed by &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;, and this word must mean "in order to give a clear tone," i.e., to regulate the tune and the tone of the singing, while &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495; signifies "to take the lead in playing;" cf. Del. on <a href="/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1</a>. This word, moreover, is probably not to be restricted to the singers with the lutes, the third choir, but must be held to refer also to the second choir. The meaning then will be, that Heman, Asaph, and Ethan had cymbals to direct the song, while the other singers had partly psalteries, partly lutes, in order to play the accompaniment to the singing. The song of these two choirs is moreover distinguished and defined by &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500;. These words specify the kind of voices; &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500; after the manner of virgins, i.e., in the soprano; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500;, after the octave, i.e., in bass - al ottava bassa.
