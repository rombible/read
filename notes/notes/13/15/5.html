With regard to the sons of David, see on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5-8</a>.<p>In the account of the victories over the Philistines, the statement (<a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17</a>) that David went down to the mountain-hold, which has no important connection with the main fact, and would have been for the readers of the Chronicle somewhat obscure, is exchanged in <a href="/1_chronicles/14-8.htm">1 Chronicles 14:8</a> for the more general expression &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;, "he went forth against them." In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-14.htm">1 Chronicles 14:14</a>, the divine answer to David's question, whether he should march against the Philistines, runs thus: &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1492;&#1505;&#1489; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, Thou shalt not go up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the baca-bushes; - while in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-23.htm">2 Samuel 5:23</a>, on the contrary, we read: &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1492;&#1505;&#1489; &#1514;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1492;&#1505;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488; &#1500;&#1506;, Thou shalt not go up (i.e., advance against the enemy to attack them in front); turn thee behind them (i.e., to their rear), and come upon them over against the baca-bushes. Bertheau endeavours to get rid of the discrepancy, by supposing that into both texts corruptions have crept through transcribers' errors. He conjectures that the text of Samuel was originally &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, while in the Chronicle a transposition of the words &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; was occasioned by a copyist's error, which in turn resulted in the alteration of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; into &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;. This supposition, however, stands or falls with the presumption that by &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; (Sam.) an attack is forbidden; but for that presumption no tenable grounds exist: it would rather involve a contradiction between the first part of the divine answer and the second. The last clause, "Come upon them from over against the baca-bushes," shows that the attack was not forbidden; all that was forbidden was the making of the attack by advancing straight forward: instead of that, they were to try to fall upon them in the rear, by making a circuit. The chronicler consequently gives us an explanation of the ambiguous words of 2 Samuel, which might easily be misunderstood. As David's question was doubtless expressed as it is in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-10.htm">1 Chronicles 14:10</a>, &#1492;&#1508;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, the answer &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; might be understood to mean, "Go not up against them, attack them not, but go away behind them;" but with that the following &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514;, "Come upon them from the baca-bushes," did not seem to harmonize. The chronicler consequently explains the first clauses of the answer thus: "Go not up straight behind them," i.e., advance not against them so as to attack them openly, "but turn thyself away from them," i.e., strike off in such a direction as to turn their flank, and come upon them from the front of the baca-bushes. In this way the apparently contradictory texts are reconciled without the alteration of a word. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-17.htm">1 Chronicles 14:17</a>, which is wanting in Samuel, the author concludes the account of these victories by the remark that they tended greatly to exalt the name of David among the nations.
