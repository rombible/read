In <a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a> three kinds of these are named: &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, nablia, &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, which Luther has translated by psalter, corresponds to the Arabic santir, which is an oblong box with a broad bottom and a somewhat convex sounding-board, over which strings of wire are stretched; an instrument something like the cithara. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, harps, more properly lutes, as this instrument more resembled our lute than the harp, and corresponded to the Arabic catgut instrument el &#8219;u&#770;d (l-cu&#770;d); cf. Wetzstein in Delitzsch, Isaiah, S. 702, der 2 Aufl., where, however, the statement that the santir is essentially the same as the old German cymbal, vulgo Hackebrett, is incorrect, and calculated to bring confusion into the matter, for the cymbal was an instrument provided with a small bell. &#1502;&#1510;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the later word for &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, cymbals, castanets; see on <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; does not belong to the three before-mentioned instruments (Berth.), but, as is clear from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-28.htm">1 Chronicles 15:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-42.htm">1 Chronicles 16:42</a>, undoubtedly only to &#1502;&#1510;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (Bttcher, Neue krit.
