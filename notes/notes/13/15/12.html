The word here employed for "bring" is not the same with the "carry" of vers 1 and 2. But the following verses (13-15) seem to intimate that, whatever the exact reason for which Uzzah had been peremptorily cut off, the Levites had also been to blame in not sanctifying themselves to <span class="accented">carry</span> the ark by its staves in the way originally appointed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From among assembled Israel David then specially gathered together the heads of the priests and Levites, to determine upon the details of this solemn procession. "The sons of Aaron" are the high priests Zadok and Abiathar, <a href="/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>; and the "Levites" are the six princes named in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-5.htm">1 Chronicles 15:5-10</a>, with their brethren, viz., (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-5.htm">1 Chronicles 15:5-7</a>) the three heads of the families into which the tribe of Levi was divided, and which corresponded to the three sons of Levi, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, respectively (<a href="/exodus/6-16.htm">Exodus 6:16</a>): Uriel head of the Kohathites, Asaiah of the Merarites, and Joel head of the Gershonites, with their brethren. Kohath is first enumerated, because Aaron the chief of the priests was descended from Kohath, and because to the Kohathites there fell, on account of their nearer relationship to the priests, the duty of serving in that which is most holy, the bearing of the holiest vessels of the tabernacle. See <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>, <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-9.htm">Numbers 7:9</a>; as to Uriel, see on <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24</a>; for Asaiah, see 6:30; and as to Joel, see <a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>. Then in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-8.htm">1 Chronicles 15:8</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/15-9.htm">1 Chronicles 15:9</a> we have the heads of three other Kohathite families: Shemaiah, chief of the sons of Elizaphan, i.e., Elizaphan son of the Kohathite Uzziel (<a href="/exodus/6-22.htm">Exodus 6:22</a>); Eliel, chief of the sons of Hebron the Kohathite (<a href="/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18</a>); and Amminadab, chief of the sons of Uzziel. The sons of Uzziel, consequently, were divided into two fathers'-houses: the one founded by Uzziel's son Elizaphan, and named after him (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-8.htm">1 Chronicles 15:8</a>); the other founded by his other sons, and called by his name. Of the fathers'-houses here enumerated, four belong to Kohath, and one each to Merari and Gershon; and the Kohathites were called to take part in the solemn act in greater numbers than the Merarites and Gershonites, since the transport of the ark was the Kohathites' special duty. </body></html>
