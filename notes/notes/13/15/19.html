"Ben" (1Ch 15:18) is omitted (1Ch 15:20).

Yet their connection in a series of four divisions of musical duty does throw some light upon them. These four verses manifestly purport to describe a special part to be performed by those of whom they respectively speak. Gesenius explains <span class="accented">psalteries on Alamoth</span> to mean such instruments as savoured of virgin tone or pitch, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> high as compared with the lower pitch of men's voices.
