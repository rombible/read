These trumpets were of solid silver, of one piece, were straight and narrow, and had an expanded mouth. They are found on the arch of Titus, and are described by Josephus. On the other hand, the trumpet, more correctly rendered "cornet" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, as distinguished from our <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, which was used for proclaiming the jubilee, for announcing the new year for sentinel and other special signals, and for war, was shaped like a ram's horn, and probably made of the same. The particular appropriateness of the use of the former on this occasion is manifest, in addition to the fact that they were the appointed trumpets for the journeying of the camp and <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> of the ark itself at a time so essentially religious as the present.

The</span> original number of the silver trumpets was two only, and they were to be sounded strictly by the anointed priests, sons of Aaron, at all events when their employment was within the sanctuary. Their employment, however, grew far more general, and we find (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>) that their number had risen to a hundred and twenty (so too <a href="/2_chronicles/13-12.htm">2 Chronicles 13:12</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35</a>).

In <a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a> three kinds of these are named: &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, nablia, &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, which Luther has translated by psalter, corresponds to the Arabic santir, which is an oblong box with a broad bottom and a somewhat convex sounding-board, over which strings of wire are stretched; an instrument something like the cithara. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, harps, more properly lutes, as this instrument more resembled our lute than the harp, and corresponded to the Arabic catgut instrument el &#8219;u&#770;d (l-cu&#770;d); cf. Wetzstein in Delitzsch, Isaiah, S. 702, der 2 Aufl., where, however, the statement that the santir is essentially the same as the old German cymbal, vulgo Hackebrett, is incorrect, and calculated to bring confusion into the matter, for the cymbal was an instrument provided with a small bell. &#1502;&#1510;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the later word for &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, cymbals, castanets; see on <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; does not belong to the three before-mentioned instruments (Berth.), but, as is clear from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-28.htm">1 Chronicles 15:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-42.htm">1 Chronicles 16:42</a>, undoubtedly only to &#1502;&#1510;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (Bttcher, Neue krit.
