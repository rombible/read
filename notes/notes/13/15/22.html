There is considerable diversity of opinion as to the meaning of this word.

Its exact position here seems not unfavourable to such interpretation. On the other hand, its position in ver. 27 seems conclusively to point to the translation of the Septuagint and of our Authorized Version in this place as the correct one. Dr. Murphy, however, to escape this, thinks "with the singers" in ver. 27 to be a "copyist's inadvertent repetition." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David gave the princes of the Levites a further charge to appoint singers with musical instruments for the solemn procession, which they accordingly did. &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, instruments to accompany the song. In <a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a> three kinds of these are named: &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, nablia, &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, which Luther has translated by psalter, corresponds to the Arabic santir, which is an oblong box with a broad bottom and a somewhat convex sounding-board, over which strings of wire are stretched; an instrument something like the cithara. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, harps, more properly lutes, as this instrument more resembled our lute than the harp, and corresponded to the Arabic catgut instrument el &#8219;u&#770;d (l-cu&#770;d); cf. Wetzstein in Delitzsch, Isaiah, S. 702, der 2 Aufl., where, however, the statement that the santir is essentially the same as the old German cymbal, vulgo Hackebrett, is incorrect, and calculated to bring confusion into the matter, for the cymbal was an instrument provided with a small bell. &#1502;&#1510;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the later word for &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, cymbals, castanets; see on <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; does not belong to the three before-mentioned instruments (Berth.), but, as is clear from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-28.htm">1 Chronicles 15:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-42.htm">1 Chronicles 16:42</a>, undoubtedly only to &#1502;&#1510;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (Bttcher, Neue krit.

The infinitive clause &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; belongs to the preceding sentence: "in order to heighten the sound (both of the song and of the instrumental music) to joy," i.e., to the expression of joy. &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1495;&#1492; is frequently used to express festive joy: cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-25.htm">1 Chronicles 15:25</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/23-18.htm">2 Chronicles 23:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-30.htm">2 Chronicles 29:30</a>; but also as early as in <a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-23.htm">Judges 16:23</a>, etc. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18</a> the names of the singers and players are introduced; then in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19-21</a> they are named in connection with the instruments they played; and finally, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-22.htm">1 Chronicles 15:22-24</a>, the other Levites and priests who took part in the celebration are mentioned.
