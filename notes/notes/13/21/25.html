We have no means of calculating what would have been a fair price, for we know neither the extent of the purchase nor the value of the sums mentioned. But comparing <a href="/genesis/23-16.htm" title="And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.">Genesis 23:16</a>, where four hundred shekels of silver are paid for the field and cave of Machpelah, fifty shekels of silver would seem to be too little. On the other hand, six hundred shekels of gold appears to be far too high a price for the threshingfloor. Perhaps for “gold” we should read “silver.” It has, indeed, been suggested that “the authors were writing of two different things,” and that Samuel assigns only the price of the threshingfloor and oxen; whereas the chronicler, when he speaks of “the place,” means the entire Mount of the Temple (Moriah), on which the floor was situate. But a comparison of the two narratives seems to identify the things purchased—“the place” (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-25.htm" title="So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.">1Chronicles 21:25</a>) is “the place of the threshingfloor” (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-22.htm" title="Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar therein to the LORD: you shall grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.">1Chronicles 21:22</a>); and in both cases Samuel has “the threshingfloor.” Tradition may have varied on the subject; and as “there is no positive mention of the use of gold money among the Hebrews” apart from this passage (<span class= "ital">Madden</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> ours is probably the later form of the story. However this may be, the chronicler has doubtless preserved for us what he found in his original. It is interesting to compare with this sale some of those the records of which are preserved in the Babylonian Contract Tablets. One of these relates how <span class= "ital">Dān-sum-iddin</span> sold a house and grounds in Borsippa for eleven and a-half minæ of silver, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> 690 shekels.

But David's sin, in numbering the people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there was notice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command to David to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. Thus Christ was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but a reconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinances in which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth.

David gave &#8230; for the place six hundred shekels of gold&#8212;At first he bought only the cattle and the threshing instruments, for which he paid fifty shekels of silver (2Sa 24:24); afterwards he purchased the whole property, Mount Moriah, on which the future temple stood. High in the center of the mountain platform rises a remarkable rock, now covered by the dome of "the Sakrah." It is irregular in its form, and measures about sixty feet in one direction and fifty feet in the other. It is the natural surface of Mount Moriah and is thought by many to be the rock of the threshing-floor of Araunah, selected by David, and continued by Solomon and Zerubbabel as "the unhewn stone" on which to build the altar [BARTLETT, Walks about Jerusalem; Stanley].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Chapter Introduction <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So David gave to Ornan for the place <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span><p>(m) Read 2Sa 24:24.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">gave … for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight</span>] In <a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm" title="And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy it of you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing.

The former seems to say that 600 shekels were paid for the threshing floor alone, the latter that only 50 shekels were paid for the floor and oxen taken together. But the text of 2 Sam. is probably corrupt and should perhaps run, <span class="ital">bought the threshing floor for money, even six hundred shekels, and the oxen for money, even fifty shekels</span>. The “threshing floor” seems to have included the Temple Mount (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-1.htm" title="Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.">1 Chronicles 22:1</a>), and we may compare the 600 shekels paid for it with the 400 paid by Abraham for the cave and field of Machpelah (<a href="/context/genesis/23-15.htm" title="My lord, listen to me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that between me and you? bury therefore your dead....">Genesis 23:15-17</a>). In describing the 600 shekels as shekels <span class="ital">of gold</span> the Chronicler perhaps goes beyond his authority, for the sum then becomes improbably large.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Six hundred shekels of gold by weight</span>. The only way to reconcile this statement with that of the parallel place, which (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>)speaks of "fifty shekels of silver" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> taking the shekel at 2s. 8d., equal to about &pound;6 13s. 4d.) as the price of "the <span class="accented">threshing-floor and the oxen</span>," is to suppose that the fifty shekels speak of the purchase money of the oxen indeed, but not of the floor itself, which was valuable, not only for size and situation, but also for its prepared construction; or again, keeping to the literal language of Samuel, that "the floor and the oxen" are intended, while our expression, "the place," may designate the whole hill. The value of gold as compared with silver was as sixteen to one. If this be the solution, we should have again an instance of the compiler of this book seizing for perpetuation the point of greatest and most permanent interest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the purchase of the <span class="accented">whole</span> place. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The account of David's repentant beseeching of the Lord to turn away the primitive judgment, and the word of the Lord proclaimed to him by the prophet, commanding him to build an altar to the Lord in the place where the destroying angel visibly appeared, together with the carrying out of this divine command by the purchase of Araunah's threshing-floor, the erection of an altar, and the offering of burnt-offering, is given more at length in the Chronicle than in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17-25</a>, where only David's negotiation with Araunah is more circumstantially narrated than in the Chronicle. In substance both accounts perfectly correspond, except that in the Chronicle several subordinate circumstances are preserved, which, as being minor points, are passed over in Samuel. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a>, the description of the angel's appearance, that he had a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, and the statement that David and the elders, clad in sackcloth (garments indicating repentance), fell down before the Lord; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-20.htm">1 Chronicles 21:20</a>, the mention of Ornan's (Araunah's) sons, who hid themselves on beholding the angel, and of the fact that Ornan was engaged in threshing wheat when David came to him; and the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>, that fire came down from heaven upon the altar-are examples of such minor points. We have already commented on this section in our remarks on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17-25</a>, and the account in the Chronicle is throughout correct and easily understood. Notwithstanding this, however, Bertheau, following Thenius and Bttcher, conjectures that the text is in several verses corrupt, and wishes to correct them by 2nd Samuel. But these critics are misled by the erroneous presumption with which they entered upon the interpretation of the Chronicle, that the author of it used as his authority, and revised, our Masoretic text of the second book of Samuel. Under the influence of this prejudice, emendations are proposed which are stamped with their own unlikelihood, and rest in part even on misunderstandings of the narrative in the book of Samuel. Of this one or two illustrations will be sufficient. Any one who compares <a href="/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a> (Sam.) with <a href="/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/21-17.htm">1 Chronicles 21:17</a> of the Chronicle, without any pre-formed opinions, will see that what is there (Sam.) concisely expressed is more clearly narrated in the Chronicle. The beginning of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-17.htm">1 Chronicles 21:17</a>, "And David spake unto Jahve," is entirely without connection, as the thought which forms the transition from <a href="/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a> to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-17.htm">1 Chronicles 21:17</a>, viz., that David was moved by the sight of the destroying angel to pray to God that the destruction might be turned away, is only brought in afterwards in the subordinate clause, "on seeing the angel." This abrupt form of expression is got rid of in the Chronicle by the clause: "And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel ... and fell ... upon his face; and David spake to God." That which in Samuel is crushed away into an infinitive clause subordinate to the principle sentence, precedes in the Chronicle, and is circumstantially narrated. Under these circumstances, of course, the author of the Chronicle could not afterwards in <a href="/1_chronicles/21-17.htm">1 Chronicles 21:17</a> make use of the clause, "on seeing the angel who smote the people," without tautology. Berth., on the contrary, maintains that <a href="/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a> is an interpolation of the chronicler, and proposes then to cull out from the words and letters &#1489;&#1506;&#1501; &#1492;&#1502;&#1499;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1488;&#1514; &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493; (Sam.), the words &#1489;&#1506;&#1501; &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493; (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-17.htm">1 Chronicles 21:17</a>), great use being made in the process of the ever ready auxiliaries, mistakes, and a text which has become obscure. This is one example out of many. <a href="/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a> of the Chronicle is not an addition which the Chronicle has interpolated between <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16-17</a> of Samuel, but a more detailed representation of the historical course of things. No mention is made in 2nd Samuel of the drawn sword in the angel's hand, because there the whole story is very concisely narrated. This detail need not have been borrowed from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/22-23.htm">Numbers 22:23</a>, for the drawn sword is a sensible sign that the angle's mission is punitive; and the angel, who is said to have visibly appeared in 2nd Samuel also, could be recognised as the bearer of the judicial pestilence only by this emblem, such recognition being plainly the object of his appearance. The mention of the elders along with David as falling on their faces in prayer, clad in sackcloth, will not surprise any reader or critic who considers that in the case of so fearful a pestilence the king would not be alone in praying God to turn away the judgment. Besides, from the mention of the &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; of the king who went with David to Ornan (<a href="/2_samuel/24-20.htm">2 Samuel 24:20</a>), we learn that the king did not by himself take steps to turn away the plague, but did so along with his servants. In the narrative in 2nd Samuel, which confines itself to the main point, the elders are not mentioned, because only of David was it recorded that his confession of sin brought about the removal of the plague. Just as little can we be surprised that David calls his command to number the people the delictum by which he had brought the judgment of the plague upon himself. - To alter &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-19.htm">1 Chronicles 21:19</a>, into &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, as Berth. wishes, would show little intelligence. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, at Gad's word David went up, is proved by <a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a> to be good Hebrew, and is perfectly suitable. </body></html>
