The omission of any introductory formula, such as “And David said,” is dramatic. (Comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/16-8.htm" title="Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name, make known his deeds among the people.">1Chronicles 16:8</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/23-4.htm" title="Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:">1Chronicles 23:4-5</a>.) Literally rendered, after the Hebrew punctuation, the verse runs:—“The whole in a writing from the hand of Jehovah, to me he made clear; all the works of the model.” With the expression “a writing from the hand of Jehovah” (comp. <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>), David affirms his “pattern” of the sanctuary and its vessels to have been conceived, and described in writing, under that Divine guidance which he sought and followed in all the great enterprises of his life. Whether “the writing” was a communication “by the hand of” one of David’s seers, or merely the description of the Mosaic sanctuary (Exodus 25 <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> is not clear. The verb “he taught” (<span class= "ital">hiskîl</span>) requires an object, such as is supplied in the Authorised version: “made me understand.” It takes a dative (<a href="/proverbs/21-11.htm" title="When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.">Proverbs 21:11</a>), and probably the word rendered “upon me” is really a later equivalent of the same construction. Else we might compare <a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm" title="And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God on me.">Nehemiah 2:8</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm" title="The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.">Ezekiel 1:3</a>, and render: “The whole, in a writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, he taught,” implying that David himself sketched out the whole design under Divine inspiration.

Christ is the true temple, the church is the gospel temple, and heaven the everlasting temple; all are framed according to the Divine counsels, and the plan laid in the Divine wisdom, ordained before the world, for God's glory and our good. David gave this pattern to Solomon, that he might go by rule. Materials were provided for the most costly utensils of the temple. Directions were given which way to look for help in this great undertaking. Be not dismayed; God will help thee, and thou must look up to him in the first place. We may be sure that God, who owned our fathers, and carried them through the services of their day, will, in like manner, never leave us, while he has any work to do in us, or by us. Good work is likely to go on, when all concerned are hearty in furthering it. Let us hope in God's mercy; if we seek him, he will be found of us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chariot of the cherubims - The cherubim are themselves the chariot upon which Yahweh rides <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18, 19. the chariot of the cherubim&#8212;The expanded wings of the cherubim formed what was figuratively styled the throne of God, and as they were emblematical of rapid motion, the throne or seat was spoken of as a chariot (Ps 18:10; 99:1). It is quite clear that in all these directions David was not guided by his own taste, or by a desire for taking any existing model of architecture, but solely by a regard to the express revelation of the divine will. In a vision, or trance, the whole edifice, with its appurtenances, had been placed before his eyes so vividly and permanently, that he had been able to take a sketch of them in the models delivered to Solomon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The meaning is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

According to the usual supposition, the verb &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is to be supplied from <a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a> after &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;: "and gave him the weight for the golden candlesticks and their golden lamps," &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; being in a state of free subordination to the word &#1493;&#1504;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (J. H. Mich., Berth., and others). But apart from the fact that no analogous case can be found for such a subordination (for in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15</a>, which Berth. cites as such, there is no subordination, for there the first &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is the accusative of the material dependent upon &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;), the supplying of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; gives no suitable sense; for David here does not give Solomon the metal for the vessels, but, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>, only a &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, pattern or model for them. If &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; be supplied, &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; must be "he appointed," and so have a different sense here from that which it has in <a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>. This appears very questionable, and it is simpler to take &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500; without the article, as an accusative of nearer definition, and to connect the verse thus: "and (what he had in mind) as weight for the golden candlesticks and their lamps, in gold, according to the weight of each candlestick and its lamps, and for the silver candlesticks, in weight - &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1514;, according to the service of each candlestick" (as it corresponded to the service of each). - In <a href="/1_chronicles/28-16.htm">1 Chronicles 28:16</a> the enumeration is continued in very loose connection: "And as to the gold (&#1488;&#1514;, quoad; cf. Ew. 277, d) by weight (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;, acc. of free subordination) for the tables of the spreading out, i.e., of the shew-bread (&#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;  equals  &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;,   <a href="/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>); see on <a href="/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>), for each table, and silver for the silver tables." Silver tables, i.e., tables overlaid with silver-lamin, and silver candlesticks (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-15.htm">1 Chronicles 28:15</a>), are not elsewhere expressly mentioned among the temple vessels, since the whole of the vessels are nowhere individually registered even in the description of the building of the temple. Yet, when the temple was repaired under Joash, <a href="/2_kings/12-14.htm">2 Kings 12:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-14.htm">2 Chronicles 24:14</a>, and when it was destroyed by the Chaldeans, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>, vessels of gold and silver are spoken of. The silver candlesticks were probably, as Kimchi has conjectured, intended for the priests engaged in the service, and the tables for reception of the sacrificial flesh after it had been prepared for burning upon the altar.</body></html>
