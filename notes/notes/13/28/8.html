Finding himself able, David spoke of his purpose to build a temple for God, and of God's disallowing that purpose. He opened to them God's gracious purposes concerning Solomon. David charged them to cleave stedfastly to God and their duty. We cannot do our work as we should, unless we put on resolution, and fetch in strength from Divine grace. Religion or piety has two distinct parts. The first is knowledge of God, the second is worship of God. David says, Know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. God is made known by his works and word. Revelation alone shows the whole character of God, in his providence, his holy law, his condemnation of sinners, his blessed gospel, and the ministration of the Spirit to all true believers. The natural man cannot receive this knowledge of God. But thus we learn the value of the Saviour's atonement, and of the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, and are influenced to walk in all his commandments. It brings a sinner to his proper place at the foot of the cross, as a poor, guilty, helpless worm, deserving wrath, yet expecting every thing needful from the free mercy and grace of God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Having been forgiven much, the pardoned sinner learns to love much.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If he be constant - The conditional character of the promise made to David, as to the continuance of his posterity on the Jewish throne (marginal reference; <a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>), is now clearly declared. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

(1) continued holding of the land by passing it from father to son (cp. <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Exodus 20:12</a>), (2) completion of the work of conquest left unfinished by Joshua (cp. <a href="/genesis/24-60.htm" title="And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, You are our sister, be you the mother of thousands of millions, and let your seed possess the gate of those which hate them.">Genesis 24:60</a>), (3) enjoyment of the fruits of the land (cp. <a href="/psalms/25-13.htm" title="His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.">Psalm 25:13</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - The double charge of these verses, first to the people and then to Solomon, is full of force and majesty.

The. expression, <span class="cmt_word">Know thou the God of thy father</span>, for a practical knowledge and fear of God, is analogous with the expression, "Hear thou," for the matter of practical <span class="accented">obedience</span>; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "If they <span class="accented">hear</span> not Moses and the prophets" (Luke 16:32). Although there are not very many instances of this use of the word "know," its antiquity and classical character may be considered guaranteed by such passages as <a href="/job/18-21.htm">Job 18:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/5-4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>. The expression, "the God of thy father," evidently intended to be touching, is more fully given in ver. 20, "God, even my God, will be with thee," which in its turn reminds us of Paul's language, "But my God shall supply all your need" (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>). The urgent entreaty on the part of David breathes in every sentence of it, thought, and a mode of presentation of it, feeling, and depth of conviction, with which we are familiar in his psalms. He speaks from his own varied, remarkable, and rich experience of the Divine care and jealous love, and from much personal experience of the deceitfulness of the heart, to Solomon, into whom, were it possible, he would pour the advantage of all he had learned, and from whom he would hide nothing of his intense and anxious solicitude. To the same strain he returns in ver. 20, but there with more exclusive reference to the undertaking of the building of "the house of the Lord," or the <span class="cmt_word">house for the sanctuary</span>. One thing only fails, perhaps, to be made quite apparent from the language of David, viz. why he deemed it necessary to urge so strenuously on Solomon the enterprise of building the temple and of carrying it to completion. With abundance of means and preparations so large already made, one might have supposed a young king and a young man would have needed little pressure and little exhortation. Nevertheless, in the manifest presence of David's words, it is very far from impossible to suppose the dangers and temptations of Solomon's position as constituting a serious risk. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king rose to his feet, in order to speak to the assembly standing; till then he had, on account of his age and feebleness, sat, not lain in bed, as Kimchi and others infer from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1</a>.</body></html>
