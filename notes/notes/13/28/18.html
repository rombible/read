Christ is the true temple, the church is the gospel temple, and heaven the everlasting temple; all are framed according to the Divine counsels, and the plan laid in the Divine wisdom, ordained before the world, for God's glory and our good. David gave this pattern to Solomon, that he might go by rule. Materials were provided for the most costly utensils of the temple. Directions were given which way to look for help in this great undertaking. Be not dismayed; God will help thee, and thou must look up to him in the first place. We may be sure that God, who owned our fathers, and carried them through the services of their day, will, in like manner, never leave us, while he has any work to do in us, or by us. Good work is likely to go on, when all concerned are hearty in furthering it. Let us hope in God's mercy; if we seek him, he will be found of us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chariot of the cherubims - The cherubim are themselves the chariot upon which Yahweh rides <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18, 19. the chariot of the cherubim&#8212;The expanded wings of the cherubim formed what was figuratively styled the throne of God, and as they were emblematical of rapid motion, the throne or seat was spoken of as a chariot (Ps 18:10; 99:1). It is quite clear that in all these directions David was not guided by his own taste, or by a desire for taking any existing model of architecture, but solely by a regard to the express revelation of the divine will. In a vision, or trance, the whole edifice, with its appurtenances, had been placed before his eyes so vividly and permanently, that he had been able to take a sketch of them in the models delivered to Solomon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of the chariot of the cherubims, </span> i.e. of the cherubims, which Solomon was to make, of which see <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/6-23.htm" title="And within the oracle he made two cherubim of olive tree, each ten cubits high.">1 Kings 6:23</a></span>, (for those which were fastened to the mercy-seat were made by Moses long before,) which he fitly compares to a <span class="ital">chariot</span>, because within them God is oft said to sit and to dwell, as <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/19-5.htm" title="So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.">2 Kings 19:5</a> <a href="/psalms/80-1.htm" title="Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.">Psalm 80:1</a> 99:1</span>; and sometimes he is said <span class="ital">to ride upon a cherub</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/18-10.htm" title="And he rode on a cherub, and did fly: yes, he did fly on the wings of the wind.">Psalm 18:10</a></span>. And because a chariot is made to carry a person from place to place, this expression may be used to intimate that God was not so fixed to them by the building of his temple, but that he both could and would remove from them if they forsook him.
