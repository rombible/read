No difficulties or dangers should keep the sinner from coming to the Savior, nor drive the believer from the path of duty.

From the words of Amasai we may learn how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act.

Ismaiah the Gibeonite&#8212;It appears that not only the Canaanites who were admitted into the congregation (Jos 9:1-27), but people of the tribe of Benjamin, were among the inhabitants of Gibeon. The mention of "the Gederathite," probably from Gederah (Jos 15:36), in the lowlands of Judah; of the Korhites (1Ch 12:6), from Korah (1Ch 2:43), and of Gedor (1Ch 12:7), a town in Judah, to the southwest of Beth-lehem (compare 1Ch 4:4), shows that this first list contains men of Judah as well as Benjamin [Bertheau].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Over the thirty, </span> i.e. who came attended with thirty valiant Benjamites, and was their leader and commander. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty,....
