(2) Are the statements of numbers contained in it trustworthy?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In answer to the first question it may be confidently said that the list as it stands is the composition of the Chronicler himself, for the syntax and vocabulary of the passage are his. Its statements may, however, be based on those of some ancient document. As to the second question it must be confessed that the numbers given to the Northern tribes, especially the trans-Jordanic tribes, are surprisingly large, especially when compared with those of the Southern; thus while the totals of Judah, Simeon, Levi, and Benjamin taken together amount to 25,200 warriors, those of Zebulun, Naphtali, Dan, and Asher amount to 155,600. Yet compare the numbers given in <a href="/2_samuel/24-9.htm" title="And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.">2 Samuel 24:9</a> (800,000 men in Israel who drew sword).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24, 25.</span> - David had already found friends and adherents in these two southern tribes of Judah and Simeon. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then came the Spirit upon Amasai, so that he proclaimed himself enthusiastic for David and his cause.
