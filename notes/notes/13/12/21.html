This, which is the only correct interpretation, is that received by Bertheau and the older Jewish commentators. The Vulgate, on the contrary, translates, novissimus centum militibus praeerat et maximus mille, which is inadmissible, for in that case &#1506;&#1500; must have been used instead of &#1500;. The &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; belongs to both the clauses which it precedes, to &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; and to &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;, and is placed immediately before &#1500;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492; to emphasize the contrast between one and a hundred. In <a href="/1_chronicles/12-15.htm">1 Chronicles 12:15</a> we have a proof of their valour, in an account of a bold exploit performed by them. In the first month of the year, that is, in spring, when the Jordan overflows all its banks, they crossed the river and put to flight all the dwellers in the valleys towards the east and towards the west. This happened, probably, when they separated themselves from their brethren and went over to David, when they must have had to cut their way through the adherents of Saul (Berth.). The Piel &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; with &#1506;&#1500; denotes to make full, to make to run over, in the signification to overflow. The Kethibh &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; comes from &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492; elsewhere only the plural &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, so also here in the Keri. In the dry summer season the Jordan may be crossed by wading at various points (fords); while in spring, on the contrary, when it is so swollen by the melting snows of Lebanon, that in some parts it overflows its banks, it is very dangerous to attempt to cross. See on <a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>. &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, "the valleys," for the inhabitants of the valleys. </body></html>
