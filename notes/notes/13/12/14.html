No difficulties or dangers should keep the sinner from coming to the Savior, nor drive the believer from the path of duty. Those who break through, and overcome in these attempts, will find abundant recompence. From the words of Amasai we may learn how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act.

If we compare the account in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22-24</a>, we learn that David at that time did not hide himself in one single definite mountain-fortress, but sought and found resting-places, now here, now there, in the wilderness, on the summits of the hills (cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;,   <a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/24-1.htm">1 Samuel 24:1</a>); so that &#1502;&#1510;&#1491; here is to be understood, as &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;,   <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-3.htm">1 Samuel 24:3</a>, also is, generally of the fastnesses in the mountains of Judah. At that time there gathered round David a great company of discontented and oppressed men, to the number of about 400, - men dissatisfied with Saul's rule, whose leader he became, and who soon amounted to 600 men (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13</a>). To these belong the Gadites, and the men out of Benjamin and Judah, whose adhesion to David is noticed in our verses. &#1504;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, they separated themselves from the other Gadites who were on Saul's side, "strong heroes," as in <a href="/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>; cf. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, <a href="/1_chronicles/5-24.htm">1 Chronicles 5:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-2.htm">1 Chronicles 7:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-9.htm">1 Chronicles 7:9</a>, etc. &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, men for service in the host for the war, i.e., combatants practised in war. &#1493;&#1512;&#1502;&#1495; &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;, preparing shield and spear, i.e., wielding shield and spear, practised in their use: the preparing of these weapons includes the handling of them.

Lions' faces their faces, i.e., lion-like in appearance, thoroughly warlike figures; cf. <a href="/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>. "As roes running swiftly on the mountains;" cf. <a href="/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>. This description of the strength and swiftness of these warriors recalls, as Bertheau remarks, the similar expressions used in the historical books concerning heroes of David's time. It has manifestly been drawn from the original documents, not added by the chronicler.
