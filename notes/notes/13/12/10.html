No difficulties or dangers should keep the sinner from coming to the Savior, nor drive the believer from the path of duty. Those who break through, and overcome in these attempts, will find abundant recompence. From the words of Amasai we may learn how to testify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must be throughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act. If we are under the influence of the Spirit, we shall desire to have our lot among them, and to declare ourselves on their side; if in faith and love we embrace the cause of Christ, he will receive, employ, and advance us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Into the hold to the wilderness - Rather, "into the hold toward the wilderness."

In <a href="/1_chronicles/12-4.htm">1 Chronicles 12:4</a> the Gibeonite Ismaiah is called "hero among the thirty, and over the thirty," - words which can hardly have any other sense than that Ismaiah belonged also to David's corps of thirty heroes (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11.htm">1 Chronicles 11</a>), and was (temporarily) their leader, although his name does not occur in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11.htm">1 Chronicles 11</a>.

S. 166), was probably identical with the village Ghedera, which lies to the left of the road Tel-es-Safieh to Akir, about an hour to the south-west of Jabne. In any case, it corresponds well with the statements of the Onom. As to Gedrus, or Gaedur, see on <a href="/joshua/15-36.htm">Joshua 15:36</a>. Immediately afterwards in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-7.htm">1 Chronicles 12:7</a> Gedor is mentioned, a city in the mountains of Judah, to the westward of the road which leads from Hebron to Jerusalem (see on <a href="/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a>); and from that fact Bertheau imagines we must conclude that the men of Judah are enumerated as well as the Benjamites. But this conclusion is not valid; for from the very beginning, when the domains and cities were assigned to the individual tribes under Joshua, they were not the exclusive possession of the individual tribes, and at a later period they were still less so. In course of time the respective tribal domains underwent (in consequence of wars and other events) many alterations, not only in extent, but also in regard to their inhabitants, so that in Saul's time single Benjamite families may quite well have had their home in the cities of Judah.</body></html>
