The most remarkable person in this chapter is Jabez. We are not told upon what account Jabez was more honourable than his brethren; but we find that he was a praying man. The way to be truly great, is to seek to do God's will, and to pray earnestly. Here is the prayer he made. Jabez prayed to the living and true God, who alone can hear and answer prayer; and, in prayer he regarded him as a God in covenant with his people. He does not express his promise, but leaves it to be understood; he was afraid to promise in his own strength, and resolved to devote himself entirely to God. Lord, if thou wilt bless me and keep me, do what thou wilt with me; I will be at thy command and disposal for ever. As the text reads it, this was the language of a most ardent and affectionate desire, Oh that thou wouldest bless me! Four things Jabez prayed for. 1. That God would bless him indeed. Spiritual blessings are the best blessings: God's blessings are real things, and produce real effects. 2. That He would enlarge his coast. That God would enlarge our hearts, and so enlarge our portion in himself, and in the heavenly Canaan, ought to be our desire and prayer. 3. That God's hand might be with him. God's hand with us, to lead us, protect us, strengthen us, and to work all our works in us and for us, is a hand all-sufficient for us. 4. That he would keep him from evil, the evil of sin, the evil of trouble, all the evil designs of his enemies, that they might not hurt, nor make him a Jabez indeed, a man of sorrow. God granted that which he requested. God is ever ready to hear prayer: his ear is not now heavy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gedor - Rather read, "Gerar" (Septuagint) a fertile district <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/26-6.htm">Genesis 26:6-12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14-15</a> in Philistine country. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38, 39. increased greatly, and they went to the entrance of Gedor&#8212;Simeon having only a part of the land of Judah, they were forced to seek accommodation elsewhere; but their establishment in the new and fertile pastures of Gederah was soon broken up; for, being attacked by a band of nomad plunderers, they were driven from place to place till some of them effected by force a settlement on Mount Seir.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To the entrance of Gedor, </span> to that country that belongs to Gedor, or borders upon it; either that Gedor, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/15-58.htm" title="Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,">Joshua 15:58</a></span>, or that called <span class="ital">Gederah</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/15-36.htm" title="And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages:">Joshua 15:36</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto the east side of the valley; </span> of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/1_samuel/17-2.htm" title="And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.">1 Samuel 17:2</a>,52"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they went to the entrance of Gedor,....

There is a town of the name situated in the mountainous district of Judah between Halhul and Beth-zur, to the north of Hebron (<a href="/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a>). It is evident that this cannot be the place we require here. There is another town of the name (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-7.htm">1 Chronicles 12:7</a>), probably belonging to Benjamin, and which as little admits of being fitted in here. Both the Alexandrine and the Vatican Codex of the Septuagint, however, evidently read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span>. Now, Gerar of the Philistines would suit well for position and description, and also (<a href="/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>) for the allusion found here (ver. 40) to the dwelling there "of old" of the people of Ham. The Hebrew word, however, generally applied to the valley of Gerar (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, wady) is not the word used here of Gedor (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span>, ravine). See Stanley's 'Syria and Palestine,' p. 159, and note. Not only are references frequent to the fertility of Gerar, but the significance of that in <a href="/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14</a> speaks for itself. This alteration of reading, however, with acceptance of the Septuagint manuscripts, cannot be regarded as altogether satisfactory, and Keil ('Comm.,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) offers some suggestions of weight against those of Ewald, Bertheau, and others. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Concerning the villages belonging to these cities, cf. on <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-8.htm">Joshua 19:8</a>, where for &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; we have the more accurate &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;, and Ramah of the south.
