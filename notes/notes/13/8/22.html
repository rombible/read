The recurrence of the same names in the five groups is noticeable. Thus, a Zichri appears among the sons of Shimei (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-19.htm" title="And Jakim, and Zichri, and Zabdi,">1Chronicles 8:19</a>), among the sons of Shashak (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-23.htm" title="And Abdon, and Zichri, and Hanan,">1Chronicles 8:23</a>), and among the sons of Jeroham (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-27.htm" title="And Jaresiah, and Eliah, and Zichri, the sons of Jeroham.">1Chronicles 8:27</a>). Of course the name may have been thus frequent among the Benjamite clans dwelling in Jerusalem. But it is possible to see in the fact an indication that, at the time when the present register was framed, some of these houses were no longer able to trace their pedigrees with certainty to one famous name rather than another.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-40 Genealogies. - Here is a larger list of Benjamin's tribe. We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance.

Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab&#8212;He had probably been driven to take refuge in that foreign land on the same calamitous occasion that forced Elimelech to emigrate thither (Ru 1:1). But, destitute of natural affection, he forsook or divorced his two wives, and in the land of his sojourn married a third, by whom he had several sons. But there is another explanation given of the conduct of this Benjamite polygamist. His children by Hushim are mentioned (1Ch 8:11), while his other wife is unnoticed. Hence it has been thought probable that it is Baara who is mentioned under the name of Hodesh, so called because her husband, after long desertion, returned and cohabited with her as before.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Ishpan, and Heber,....
