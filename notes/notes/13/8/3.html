We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance. The memory of the just is blessed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The reason of this return to the genealogy of the Benjamites seems to be the desire to connect the genealogical introduction with the historical body of the work. As the history is to begin with Saul, the genealogical portion is made to end with an account of the family of this Benjamite monarch. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 8<p>1Ch 8:1-32. Sons and Chief Men of Benjamin.<p>1. Now Benjamin begat, &c.&#8212;This chapter contains some supplementary particulars in addition to what has been already said regarding the tribe of Benjamin (see on [360]1Ch 7:6). The names of many of the persons mentioned are different from those given by Moses&#8212;a diversity which may be accounted for in part on grounds formerly stated, namely, either that the persons had more than one name, or that the word "sons" is used in a loose sense for grandsons or descendants. But there are other circumstances to be taken into account in considering the details of this chapter; namely, first, that the genealogies of the Benjamites were disordered or destroyed by the almost total extermination of this tribe (Jud 20:11-48); secondly, that a great number of Benjamites, born in Assyria, are mentioned here, who returned from the long captivity in Babylon, and established themselves&#8212;some in Jerusalem, others in different parts of Judea. There were more returned from Babylon of the families belonging to this tribe than to any other except Judah; and hence many strange names are here introduced; some of which will be found in the list of the restored exiles (compare Ezr 2:1-70).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The sons of Bela were Addar, and Gera, and Abihud.

Yet our <span class="cmt_word">Huram</span> may correspond with Hupham, and then the four pairs of names - Shephuphan and Huram, Shupham and Hupham, Shuppim and Huppim, and Muppim and Huppim - may be interpreted as designating one and the same couple of persons. The recurrence of the name <span class="cmt_word">Gera</span> in ver. 5, so close upon the same name in ver. 3, would of course be more remarkable, and point inevitably to the disordered state of the text, if it were necessary to suppose that these nine persons were really brothers, as well as called <span class="cmt_word">sons of Bela</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Descendants of Helem-in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-35.htm">1 Chronicles 7:35</a> sons, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-36.htm">1 Chronicles 7:36-38</a> grandsons.<p>As Helem is called &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, "his brother" (i.e., the brother of the Shemer mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-34.htm">1 Chronicles 7:34</a>), &#1492;&#1500;&#1501; would seem to be the third son of Heber, who is called in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-32.htm">1 Chronicles 7:32</a> &#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;.
