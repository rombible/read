We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance.

Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab&#8212;He had probably been driven to take refuge in that foreign land on the same calamitous occasion that forced Elimelech to emigrate thither (Ru 1:1). But, destitute of natural affection, he forsook or divorced his two wives, and in the land of his sojourn married a third, by whom he had several sons. But there is another explanation given of the conduct of this Benjamite polygamist. His children by Hushim are mentioned (1Ch 8:11), while his other wife is unnoticed. Hence it has been thought probable that it is Baara who is mentioned under the name of Hodesh, so called because her husband, after long desertion, returned and cohabited with her as before.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Zebadiah,....

He was the father of a considerable number of heads of fathers'-houses, whom his two or three wives bore to him. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-8.htm">1 Chronicles 8:8</a>, he begat "in the country of Moab after he had sent them, Hushim and Baara his wives, away; (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-9.htm">1 Chronicles 8:9</a>) there begat he with Hodesh his wife, Jobab," etc. When and how Shaharaim, a Benjamite, came into the country of Moab, is not known; all that can be gathered from our verse is that he must have lived there for a considerable time. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1493; is infin.

By this parenthesis, the beginning of the main sentence has been lost sight of, and the &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; is taken up again in &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;. As to &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; with &#1502;&#1503;, cf. the remark on <a href="/1_chronicles/2-8.htm">1 Chronicles 2:8</a>. &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; is the third wife, which he took instead of those he had sent away. The seven names in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-9.htm">1 Chronicles 8:9</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/8-10.htm">1 Chronicles 8:10</a> are grouped together as sons or descendants of the last-named wife, by the concluding remark, "These his sons are heads of fathers'-houses." Then, further, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-11.htm">1 Chronicles 8:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-12.htm">1 Chronicles 8:12</a>, the sons and grandsons of the first (divorced) wives, one of whom built the cities Ono and Lydda, are enumerated; but we have no means of determining whether the &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; refers to Shemer, the last mentioned, or to Elpaal the father of the three sons, Eber, and Misham, and Shemer. It would, however, naturally suggest itself, that the words referred to the first. &#1500;&#1491; (Lod) is without doubt the city Lydda, where Peter healed the paralytic (<a href="/acts/9-32.htm">Acts 9:32</a>.). It belonged in the Syrian age to Samaria, but it was added to Judea by the King Demetrius Soter, and given to Jonathan for a possession (1 Macc. 11:34, cf. with 10:30, 38). In the Jewish was it was destroyed by the Roman general Cestius (Joseph. de Bell. Jud. ii. 19. 1), but was rebuilt at a later time, and became the site of a toparchy of Judea. In still later times it was called Diospolis, but is now a considerable Mohammedan village, lying between Jafa and Jerusalem to the north of Ramleh, which bears the old name Ludd, by the Arabs pronounced also Lidd. See v. Raumer, Pal. S. 10; Robins. Pal. sub voce; and Tobler, Dritte Wanderung, S. 69f.
