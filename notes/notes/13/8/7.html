According to this interpretation the two verses (6-7) may be rendered: “And these are the sons of Ehud.

He begat Uzza and Ahihud.” That is to say, Uzza and Ahihud, two chiefs of clans settled at Geba (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-45.htm" title="The son of Hashabiah, the son of Amaziah, the son of Hilkiah,">1Chronicles 6:45</a>), were forcibly removed by three other Benjamite clans to Manahath (see <a href="/1_chronicles/2-52.htm" title="And Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim had sons; Haroeh, and half of the Manahethites.">1Chronicles 2:52</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/2-54.htm" title="The sons of Salma; Bethlehem, and the Netophathites, Ataroth, the house of Joab, and half of the Manahethites, the Zorites.">1Chronicles 2:54</a>). <span class= "ital">‘Al manahath</span> might perhaps be rendered “for the sake of peace,” referring to feuds between the clans of Geba.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-40 Genealogies. - Here is a larger list of Benjamin's tribe. We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance. The memory of the just is blessed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they removed them to Manahath - "They" has no antecedent; and it is difficult to supply one. Almost all commentators suppose that there has been some corruption here, from which, however, we may gather that the "sons of Ehud" (or, perhaps, of Ahoah, <a href="/1_chronicles/8-4.htm">1 Chronicles 8:4</a>) were originally settled at Geba (<a href="/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a> note), but afterward removed to a place called Manahath, probably a town in the vicinity. Gera <a href="/1_chronicles/8-7.htm">1 Chronicles 8:7</a> directed the movement. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. these are the sons of Ehud&#8212;most probably the judge of Israel (Jud 3:15). His descendants, who had at first been established in Geba in Benjamin, emigrated in a body under the direction of Gera (1Ch 8:7) to Manahath, where their increased numbers would find more ample accommodation.

In &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1495; we can easily recognise the &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501; of <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a>, whence the enumeration in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a>. harmonizes with the order in <a href="/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a>. It is therefore clear, that in our genealogy only those sons are mentioned who founded the families of Benjamin. The names &#1504;&#1493;&#1495;&#1492; and &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; are nowhere else met with among the sons of Benjamin; but we may conclude, partly from the agreement of the first three names with the heads of the families of Benjamin enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a>, and partly from the agreement as to the number, which is five in both passages, that &#1504;&#1493;&#1495;&#1492; and &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; are intended to correspond to the &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1501; and &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1501; of <a href="/numbers/26-39.htm">Numbers 26:39</a>. The only question which then remains is, whether the variation in the names arises from these two sons of Benjamin having had different names, or from the families which issued from Shephupham and Hupham having afterwards perhaps received new names from famous chiefs, instead of the original designations, so that Nohah and Rapha would be later descendants of Shephupham and Hupham. Even this second supposition seems possible, since &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; in such genealogical registers may denote mediate procreation. If, e.g., Nohah were a grandson or great-grandson of Shephupham the son of Benjamin, he might well be introduced in the genealogical lists of the families as begotten by Benjamin.</body></html>
