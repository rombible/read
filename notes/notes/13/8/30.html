Both of the missing names, however (viz. <span class="accented">Ner</span> after <span class="cmt_word">Baal</span>, and <span class="accented">Mikloth</span> after <span class="cmt_word">Zacher</span>), are introduced in verses immediately succeeding, where their sons are spoken cf. One name, <span class="accented">Zacher</span>, also is spelt as Zechariah in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-37.htm">1 Chronicles 9:37</a>. Both these passages agree in representing Net as the grandfather of Saul. Not so the two passages in Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-51.htm">1 Samuel 14:51</a>), the first of which writes <span class="accented">Abiel</span> in the place of the grandfather instead of great-grandfather, which, however, need occasion little difficulty; and the second of which would certainly <span class="accented">allow</span> Ner to be grandfather to Saul, but seems to call him uncle. Even then, if we accept what the passage allows, it is somewhat remarkable that in the next verse Ner should be signalized as father of Abner rather than of Kish - a difficulty, however, much less considerable if we accept the suggestion (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) to translate ver. 51 thus, by the substitution of the word "sons" for "son:" "And Kish the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner, were <span class="accented">sons</span> of Abiel." It must be remembered at the same time that this is not equivalent to saying that they were necessarily brothers, but only descendants of the <span class="accented">chief</span> of the family, of the Demarch or Phylarch under mention in the genealogy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Bertheau would identify three of the sons of Elpaal - Meshullam, Heber, and Ishmerai - with Misham, Eber, and Shemer, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-12.htm">1 Chronicles 8:12</a>, but without any sufficient reason; for it is questionable if even the Elpaal whose sons are named in our verses be the same person as the Elpaal mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-12.htm">1 Chronicles 8:12</a>. Of these descendants of Elpaal, also, nothing further is known, and the same may be said of the nine sons of Shimhi, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-19.htm">1 Chronicles 8:19-21</a>; of the eleven sons of Shashak, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-22.htm">1 Chronicles 8:22-25</a>; and of the six sons of Jeroham, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-26.htm">1 Chronicles 8:26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a>, although some of these names are met with elsewhere singly. The concluding remark, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-28.htm">1 Chronicles 8:28</a>, "These are heads of fathers'-houses," refers, without doubt, to all the names from <a href="/1_chronicles/8-15.htm">1 Chronicles 8:15</a> or <a href="/1_chronicles/8-14.htm">1 Chronicles 8:14</a> to <a href="/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a>. "According to their generations - heads" is in apposition to the preceding, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-24.htm">1 Chronicles 9:24</a>, but the meaning of the apposition is doubtful. The word &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; can hardly be repeated merely for emphasis, as the old commentators understood it, in harmony with the Vulgate principes inquam, for why should this word be so emphasized? Bertheau thinks that "according to their births - heads" is to be taken to mean that those who are enumerated by name are not the heads living at the time of the preparation of this register, but the individual families, with the name of their progenitor after whom they were named in the genealogical lists. But how this meaning can be found in the words in question, I at least cannot understand. Can the individual families be called &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, "heads of fathers'-houses"? The families are the fathers'-houses themselves, i.e., they are made up of the groups of related households comprehended under the name fathers'-houses. These groups of related households have, it is true, each of them either head, but cannot possibly be themselves called heads. The meaning seems rather to be that the persons named in the family registers, or registers of births, are introduced as heads (of fathers'-houses); and the reason why this is remarked would seem to be, to prevent those who are enumerated as the sons of this or that man from being regarded simply as members of fathers'-houses. The further remark, "these dwelt in Jerusalem," is manifestly not to be taken to mean that the heads alone dwelt there, while the households that were subordinated to them lived elsewhere; for it signifies that they dwelt in Jerusalem with the households which composed their respective fathers'-houses. That the households dwelt there also is not stated, merely because the register contains only the names of the heads. </body></html>
