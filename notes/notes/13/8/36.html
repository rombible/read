Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance.

But the order of the names here:<p>(1) Jonathan;<p>(2) Malchi-shua; and<p>(3) Abinadab - suggests another explanation, namely, that Ishui, the second son, died young, and that Abinadab was really the fourth son.<p>Esh-baal - Previous to the introduction of the Phoenician Baal-worship into Israel by Ahab, the word "Baal" &#1489;&#1506;&#1500;  ba&#8219;al had no bad sense in Hebrew, but was simply an equivalent of the more ordinary &#1488;&#1500;  'e&#770;l, "God" (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a> note). Hence, there is nothing strange in the use at this time of the names, "Esh-baal" ("man of God"), "Baal," "Beel-iada," "Merib-baal," etc. Later on such names became offensive to pious ears, and were changed for the better, or for the worse, "Beel-iada" becoming "El-iada" ("let God aid") - "Esh-baal," "Ish-bo-sheth" ("man of shame") - "Merib-baal," "Mephi-bosheth;" and the like. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36.

They dwelt mainly in Gibeon, but a branch of them were settled in Jerusalem, <a href="/1_chronicles/8-32.htm">1 Chronicles 8:32</a>.f. In Gibeon, now El Jib, two hours north-west from Jerusalem (see on <a href="/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3</a>), dwelt the father of Gibeon, with his wife and his sons. The plural &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is used because there dwelt there, besides the father of Gibeon, also his wife and his sons. The father, i.e., the lord and possessor of Gibeon, was called, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35</a>, Jehiel (&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, Keth. &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1488;&#1500;), and his wife Maachah, a not uncommon female name (see on <a href="/1_chronicles/2-48.htm">1 Chronicles 2:48</a>). The descent of Jehiel from Benjamin is not given. In <a href="/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">1 Chronicles 8:30</a> eight names are given as those of his sons, while in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-36.htm">1 Chronicles 9:36</a>. ten are mentioned, the latter statement being correct; for a comparison of the two passages shows that in our verse two names have been dropped out, - Ner between Baal and Nadab, and Mikloth at the end, which must have originally stood in our register also, - for in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-32.htm">1 Chronicles 8:32</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a> their descendants are mentioned. &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; is called in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-37.htm">1 Chronicles 9:37</a> &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;. These names are evidently those of actual sons of Jehiel who were progenitors of fathers'-houses (groups of related households), but in the case of only two is the race descended from these further noticed. In <a href="/1_chronicles/8-32.htm">1 Chronicles 8:32</a> we have that of the youngest Mikloth, who begat Shimeah, called in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-38.htm">1 Chronicles 9:38</a> Shimeam. These also (viz., Shimeah and his family) dwelt in Jerusalem &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, "before their brethren," i.e., over against them, and &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1506;&#1501;, "with their brethren." The brethren are the other Benjamites in the first clause, those dwelling outside of Jerusalem and inhabiting the neighbouring country as far as Gibeon (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">1 Chronicles 8:30</a>); in the second, those dwelling in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-28.htm">1 Chronicles 8:28</a>). From this it is clear that of the descendants of Abi-Gibeon only that branch which was descended from Mikloth went to Jerusalem.</body></html>
