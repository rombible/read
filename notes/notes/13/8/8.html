Expelled from Geba, Shaharaim found a refuge in Moab. (Comp.

This is supported by the LXX. The emigration of the clan Shaharaim, from its old home in Geba of Benjamin is called a divorce, in the figurative style of these genealogies; just as the amalgamation of clans is marriage. <span class= "ital">Hushim,</span> in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-12.htm" title="Shuppim also, and Huppim, the children of Ir, and Hushim, the sons of Aher.">1Chronicles 7:12</a>, is a Benjamite clan.

We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance.

Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab&#8212;He had probably been driven to take refuge in that foreign land on the same calamitous occasion that forced Elimelech to emigrate thither (Ru 1:1). But, destitute of natural affection, he forsook or divorced his two wives, and in the land of his sojourn married a third, by whom he had several sons. But there is another explanation given of the conduct of this Benjamite polygamist. His children by Hushim are mentioned (1Ch 8:11), while his other wife is unnoticed. Hence it has been thought probable that it is Baara who is mentioned under the name of Hodesh, so called because her husband, after long desertion, returned and cohabited with her as before.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the country of Moab; </span> whither he had removed himself, either at the same time when Elimelech did, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/ruth/1-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land.

And it seems the more probable that he divorced them, because we find him married to another wife, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/8-9.htm" title="And he begat of Hodesh his wife, Jobab, and Zibia, and Mesha, and Malcham,">1 Chronicles 8:9</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Shaharaim,....

Kimchi takes Shilhootham, we render "had sent them away", to be the name of his first wife, of whom he begat children in Moab; but it seems best to render and interpret the words in connection with what follows: he begat children in Moab: <p>after he had sent them away; even Hushim and Baara his wives; after he had divorced them, for some reasons he had, he begat children of another wife, later mentioned. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Shaharaim begat <i>children</i> in the country of Moab, after he had sent them <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> away; Hushim and Baara <i>were</i> his wives.</span><p>(d) After he had put away his two wives.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">sent them away; Hushim and Baara</span> were <span class="ital">his wives</span>] R.V. mg. <span class="bld">sent away Hushim and Baara his wives</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shaharaim</span>. It has been proposed, in the utter obscurity here, to add this name as a third to Uzza and Ahihud. This may be a way out, but if so, instead of repeating "and Shaharaim," it might be more natural to keep the former enigmatic nominative and object to <span class="cmt_word">begat</span>, whether Ehud or Gera. There can be little doubt that a copyist's error has given <span class="cmt_word">us them</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>) in place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>, in the latter part of this verse, before the names of the wives.

In &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1495; we can easily recognise the &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501; of <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a>, whence the enumeration in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a>. harmonizes with the order in <a href="/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a>. It is therefore clear, that in our genealogy only those sons are mentioned who founded the families of Benjamin. The names &#1504;&#1493;&#1495;&#1492; and &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; are nowhere else met with among the sons of Benjamin; but we may conclude, partly from the agreement of the first three names with the heads of the families of Benjamin enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a>, and partly from the agreement as to the number, which is five in both passages, that &#1504;&#1493;&#1495;&#1492; and &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; are intended to correspond to the &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1501; and &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1501; of <a href="/numbers/26-39.htm">Numbers 26:39</a>. The only question which then remains is, whether the variation in the names arises from these two sons of Benjamin having had different names, or from the families which issued from Shephupham and Hupham having afterwards perhaps received new names from famous chiefs, instead of the original designations, so that Nohah and Rapha would be later descendants of Shephupham and Hupham. Even this second supposition seems possible, since &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; in such genealogical registers may denote mediate procreation. If, e.g., Nohah were a grandson or great-grandson of Shephupham the son of Benjamin, he might well be introduced in the genealogical lists of the families as begotten by Benjamin.</body></html>
