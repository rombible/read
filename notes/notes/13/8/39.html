We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance.

But the order of the names here:<p>(1) Jonathan;<p>(2) Malchi-shua; and<p>(3) Abinadab - suggests another explanation, namely, that Ishui, the second son, died young, and that Abinadab was really the fourth son.<p>Esh-baal - Previous to the introduction of the Phoenician Baal-worship into Israel by Ahab, the word "Baal" &#1489;&#1506;&#1500;  ba&#8219;al had no bad sense in Hebrew, but was simply an equivalent of the more ordinary &#1488;&#1500;  'e&#770;l, "God" (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a> note). Hence, there is nothing strange in the use at this time of the names, "Esh-baal" ("man of God"), "Baal," "Beel-iada," "Merib-baal," etc. Later on such names became offensive to pious ears, and were changed for the better, or for the worse, "Beel-iada" becoming "El-iada" ("let God aid") - "Esh-baal," "Ish-bo-sheth" ("man of shame") - "Merib-baal," "Mephi-bosheth;" and the like. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36.

Ner begat Kish, and Kish Saul. According to <a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-51.htm">1 Samuel 14:51</a>, Kish was a son of Abiel. this statement, on account of which Bertheau proposes to make alterations in the text, may be reconciled with that in our verses, by the simple supposition that in our verse intermediate names mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>, and probably others besides, are passed over, and Ner the son of Abi-Gibeon is named only because he was the progenitor of the line by which Saul was descended from him. Saul (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;) is King Saul. Only three of his four sons, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-49.htm">1 Samuel 14:49</a>, are mentioned-those, namely, who fell with him in the battle against the Philistines, <a href="/1_samuel/31-2.htm">1 Samuel 31:2</a>. The second is called, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-49.htm">1 Samuel 14:49</a>, Ishui, but in <a href="/1_samuel/31-2.htm">1 Samuel 31:2</a> Abinadab, as in our register, whence we gather that Ishui is another name for Abinadab. The fourth, Eshbaal, is the same who is called in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>, and elsewhere, Ishbosheth, who was set up as king in opposition to David by Abner (see on <a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>).</body></html>
