We may suppose that many things in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered the intention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nations then were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose names are now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here kept in everlasting remembrance.

Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab&#8212;He had probably been driven to take refuge in that foreign land on the same calamitous occasion that forced Elimelech to emigrate thither (Ru 1:1). But, destitute of natural affection, he forsook or divorced his two wives, and in the land of his sojourn married a third, by whom he had several sons. But there is another explanation given of the conduct of this Benjamite polygamist. His children by Hushim are mentioned (1Ch 8:11), while his other wife is unnoticed. Hence it has been thought probable that it is Baara who is mentioned under the name of Hodesh, so called because her husband, after long desertion, returned and cohabited with her as before.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jakim,....

The names &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; might be taken fore a fuller enumeration of the sons of Elpaal (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-12.htm">1 Chronicles 8:12</a>), were it not that the names enumerated from <a href="/1_chronicles/8-14.htm">1 Chronicles 8:14</a> or 15 onwards, are at the end of <a href="/1_chronicles/8-16.htm">1 Chronicles 8:16</a> said to be those of sons of Beriah; whence we must conclude that with &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-13.htm">1 Chronicles 8:13</a>, a new list of heads of Benjamite fathers'-houses begins. This view is supported by the fact that the names from <a href="/1_chronicles/8-14.htm">1 Chronicles 8:14</a> or <a href="/1_chronicles/8-15.htm">1 Chronicles 8:15</a> to <a href="/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a> are divided into five groups of families: the sons of Beriah (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-16.htm">1 Chronicles 8:16</a>), of Elpaal (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-18.htm">1 Chronicles 8:18</a>), of Shimhi (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-21.htm">1 Chronicles 8:21</a>), of Shashak (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">1 Chronicles 8:25</a>), and of Jeroham (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a>). But as two of these, Beriah and Shashak, occur in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-13.htm">1 Chronicles 8:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-14.htm">1 Chronicles 8:14</a>, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497; is probably another form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, Bertheau conjectures that the last two names, Shashak and Jeroham, are represented by &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; dna &#1488; (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-14.htm">1 Chronicles 8:14</a>). &#1497;&#1512;&#1495;&#1501; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; may be explained by the supposition of a transcriber's error, or by one person having two names; but the word &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; is rendered by the lxx by &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; ( equals  &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;); and the view that &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; is a nom. prop. is opposed, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-31.htm">1 Chronicles 8:31</a>, by the fact that the &#1493; cop. is not found before the following &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, for here, throughout, the names are all connected with each other by the w cop. Bertheau therefore conjectures that the text originally ran thus, &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, and that the name Elpaal was dropped out; and that in consequence of that, &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; had been punctuated as a nom. prop. These conjectures seem satisfactory, especially as it may be adduced in their favour that &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493; has been added to the name Elpaal to connect the names in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-15.htm">1 Chronicles 8:15</a> with the enumeration (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-13.htm">1 Chronicles 8:13</a>) interrupted by the parenthetical remarks. No certainty, however, can be attained in a matter so obscure. If a new series of groups of families begins with <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-13.htm">1 Chronicles 8:13</a>, we should expect an introductory formula, as in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-6.htm">1 Chronicles 8:6</a>. Beriah and Shema are called heads of the fathers'-houses of the inhabitants of Aijalon, i.e., heads of the groups of related households inhabiting Aijalon, the present Jalo to the west of Gibeon (see on <a href="/joshua/19-42.htm">Joshua 19:42</a>). It is quite consistent with this that their sons or descendants dwelt in Jerusalem. Next a heroic deed of theirs is related, viz., that they (in some war or other) turned to flight the inhabitants of Gath (without doubt Philistines). This remark reminds us of the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-21.htm">1 Chronicles 7:21</a>, that sons of Ephraim were slain by those born in Gath, because they had gone down to drive away the herds of the inhabitants. But Bertheau draws an erroneous conclusion from this fact, when he says that because in both passages the name Beriah occurs, both refer to the same event, and thereafter attempts by various hypotheses to make the Benjamites mentioned in our verse into Ephraimites. For the name Beriah is not at all so rare as to allow of our inferring from that alone that the various persons so called are identical, for Jacob's son Asher also named one of his sons Beriah; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/7-30.htm">1 Chronicles 7:30</a> with <a href="/genesis/46-17.htm">Genesis 46:17</a>. The notion that the Benjamites Beriah and Shema defeated those inhabitants of Gath who had slain the sons of Ephraim (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-21.htm">1 Chronicles 7:21</a>) is quite unsupported, as the Philistines lived at war and in feud with the Israelites for hundreds of years. </body></html>
