Twelve Captains for Every Month.<p>1. came in and went out month by month&#8212;Here is an account of the standing military force of Israel. A militia formed, it would seem, at the beginning of David's reign (see 1Ch 27:7) was raised in the following order: Twelve legions, corresponding to the number of tribes, were enlisted in the king's service. Each legion comprised a body of twenty-four thousand men, whose term of service was a month in rotation, and who were stationed either at Jerusalem or in any other place where they might be required. There was thus always a force sufficient for the ordinary purposes of state, as well as for resisting sudden attacks or popular tumults; and when extraordinary emergencies demanded a larger force, the whole standing army could easily be called to arms, amounting to two hundred eighty-eight thousand, or to three hundred thousand, including the twelve thousand officers that naturally attended on the twelve princes (1Ch 27:16-24). Such a military establishment would be burdensome neither to the country nor to the royal treasury; for attendance on this duty being a mark of honor and distinction, the expense of maintenance would be borne probably by the militiaman himself, or furnished out of the common fund of his tribe. Nor would the brief period of actual service produce any derangement of the usual course of affairs; for, on the expiry of the term, every soldier returned to the pursuits and duties of private life during the other eleven months of the year. Whether the same individuals were always enrolled, cannot be determined. The probability is, that provided the requisite number was furnished, no stricter scrutiny would be made. A change of men might, to a certain degree, be encouraged, as it was a part of David's policy to train all his subjects to skill in arms; and to have made the enlistment fall always on the same individuals would have defeated that purpose. To have confined each month's levy rigidly within the limits of one tribe might have fallen hard upon those tribes which were weak and small. The rotation system being established, each division knew its own month, as well as the name of the commander under whom it was to serve. These commanders are styled, "the chief fathers," that is, the hereditary heads of tribes who, like chieftains of clans, possessed great power and influence.<p>captains of thousands and hundreds&#8212;The legions of twenty-four thousand were divided into regiments of one thousand, and these again into companies of a hundred men, under the direction of their respective subalterns, there being, of course, twenty-four captains of thousands, and two hundred forty centurions.<p>and their officers&#8212;the Shoterim, who in the army performed the duty of the commissariat, keeping the muster-roll, &c.The twelve captains for every several month, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_chronicles/27-1.htm" title="Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand....">1 Chronicles 27:1-15</a></span>.

Not the whole body of the people, but the militia of the nation; for after the account of the division of the priests and Levites into courses, follows an account of the militia of the nation, being divided also into monthly courses; which, though done in the beginning of David's reign, as Kimchi and Jarchi observe, yet is here related; and that it was so soon is clear from the instance of Asahel, who was killed while David was king in Hebron, <a href="/1_chronicles/27-7.htm">1 Chronicles 27:7</a> to wit: <p>the chief fathers; the chief men in the tribes, the princes of them, not the natural fathers of the soldiers in each course, as a learned man suggests (i): since it can never be thought that such a number sprung from those as made a course of 24,000; for they are distinct from the captains and officers after mentioned, under which the soldiers were; besides, why should they be called "chief fathers?" these, no doubt, were the general officers or princes, under which the captains and inferior officers were: <p>and captains of thousands and hundreds; in the several tribes: <p>and their officers; that were under them: <p>that served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month, throughout all the months of the year; by which it appears that the militia of the kingdom was divided into twelve courses, which served each month by turns; when one went out another came in; by which means the king was well supported and guarded, and had an army at once at command upon any insurrection or war that might arise; and each course serving but one month in a year, it was no great burden upon them, even if they maintained themselves, since they were at leisure, the other eleven months, to attend to their business; and especially if it was, as Jarchi observes, that not the poor but the rich were selected for this service: <p>of every course were twenty and four thousand; so that the twelve courses amounted to 288,000 men. <p>(i) Delaney's Life of King David, vol. 1. p. 319. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now the children of Israel after their number, <i>to wit</i>, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the courses, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.</span><p>(a) Who executed their charge and office, which is meant by coming in and going out.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="/context/1_chronicles/27-1.htm" title="Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand....">1 Chronicles 27:1-15</a>.

This, however, in fact, tallies with the clause "respecting their number" in the first verse, and may constitute the explanation of the apparent inconsistency in question. Milman ('Hist. of the Jews,' 1:251, edit. 1830) says on this military portion of David's preparations, that he "organized an immense disposable force; every month twenty-four thousand men, furnished in rotation by the tribes, appeared in arms, and were trained as the standing militia of the country. At the head of his army were officers of consummate experience and, what was more highly esteemed in the warfare of the time, extraordinary personal activity, strength, and valour.

But in what relation does the statement in v. 24, that Shebuel, the descendant of Moses through Gershon, was &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, stand to this? Bertheau thinks "that three kinds of treasures are distinguished, the guarding of which was committed to different officials: (1) The sons of Jehieli, Zetham and Joel, had the oversight of the treasures of the house of God, which, as we may conclude from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-8.htm">1 Chronicles 29:8</a>, had been collected by voluntary gifts: (2) Shebuel was prince over the treasures, perhaps over the sums which resulted from regular assessment for the temple (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>), from redemption-money, e.g., for the first-born (<a href="/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>.), or for vows (Lev); consequently over a part of the sums which are designated in <a href="/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a> by the name &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1505;&#1507;: (3) Shelomith and his brothers had the oversight of all the &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., of the consecrated gifts which are called in <a href="/2_kings/12-19.htm">2 Kings 12:19</a> &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501;, and distinguished from the &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1505;&#1507; in <a href="/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a>." But this view has no support in the text. Both in the superscription (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-20.htm">1 Chronicles 26:20</a>) and in the enumeration (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-22.htm">1 Chronicles 26:22</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/26-26.htm">1 Chronicles 26:26</a>) only two kinds of treasures-treasures of the house of God (of Jahve), and treasures of the &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; - are mentioned. Neither by the facts nor by the language used are we justified in supposing that there was a third kind of treasures, viz., the sums resulting from the regular assessment for the holy place. For it is thoroughly arbitrary to confine the treasures of the house of God to the voluntary contributions and the consecrated gifts given from the war-booty; and it is still more arbitrary to limit the treasures over which Shebuel was prince to the sums flowing into the temple treasures from the regular assessment; for the reference to <a href="/2_kings/12-19.htm">2 Kings 12:19</a> and <a href="/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a> is no proof of this, because, though two kinds of &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are there distinguished, yet both are further defined. The quite general expression &#1492;&#1488;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, the treasures, can naturally be referred only to the two different kinds of treasures distinguished in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-22.htm">1 Chronicles 26:22</a>. This reference is also demanded by the words &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;...&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-24.htm">1 Chronicles 26:24</a>). Heads of fathers'-houses, with their brethren (&#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;), are mentioned as guardians of the two kinds of treasures spoken of in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-20.htm">1 Chronicles 26:20</a>; while here, on the contrary, we have Shebuel alone, without assistants. Further, the other guardians are not called &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, as Shebuel is. The word &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; denotes not an overseer or steward, but only princes of kingdoms (kings), princes of tribes (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-27.htm">1 Chronicles 12:27</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-1.htm">1 Chronicles 13:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-21.htm">2 Chronicles 32:21</a>), ministers of the palace and the temple, and commanders-in-chief (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-11.htm">2 Chronicles 11:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-7.htm">2 Chronicles 28:7</a>), and is consequently used in our section neither of Zetham and Joel, nor of Shelomoth. The calling of Shebuel &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; consequently shows that he was the chief guardian of the sacred treasures, under whose oversight the guardians of the two different kinds of treasures were placed. This is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-23.htm">1 Chronicles 26:23</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/26-24.htm">1 Chronicles 26:24</a>; and the statement would not have been misunderstood if it had been placed at the beginning or the end of the enumeration; and its position in the middle between the Gershonites and the Kohathites is explained by the fact that this prince was, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-16.htm">1 Chronicles 23:16</a>, the head of the four Levite families descended from Kohath. </body></html>
