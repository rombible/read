The words, "and Zebadiah his son after him," point to his death, as they mention his son as his successor in the command of the fourth division of the army. When Asahel, therefore, is called commander of the fourth division of the host, it is done merely honoris caus, since the division over which his son was named, de patris defuncti nomine (Cler.).</body></html>
