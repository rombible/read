This appended note limits that statement to those who were above “twenty years old,” that is, to those who were of the military age. The reference is undoubtedly to the census, of which 1 Chronicles 21 gave the account; and it is evident that one of the main objects of that census was the military and political organisation here so scantily and obscurely described.<p><span class= "bld">Because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens.</span>—The reason why David restricted the census to those who were capable of bearing arms (see <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm" title="And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm" title="That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;">Genesis 22:17</a>).

Much of the wisdom of princes is seen in the choice of their ministry, and common persons show it in the choice of their advisers.

The limitation to a certain age was what had probably quieted David's conscience as to the lawfulness of the measure, while its expediency was strongly pressed upon his mind by the army arrangements he had in view.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The meaning is, David, when he desired to number the people, he designed to number only those who were from twenty years old and upward, or (which is the same thing) those <span class="ital">that drew sword</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/21-5.htm" title="And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David.
