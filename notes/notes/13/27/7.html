The lengthy superscription, "And the sons of Israel according to their number, the heads of the fathers'-houses, and the princes over the thousands and the hundreds, and their scribes, who swerved the king in regard to every matter of the divisions; which month for month of all months of the year went and came, one division 24,000 men," is towards the end so intimately interwoven with the divisions of the army, that it can only refer to this, i.e., only to the catalogue, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-2.htm">1 Chronicles 27:2-15</a>. Since, then, we find in this catalogue only the twelve classes, the number of the men belonging to each, and their leaders, and since for this the short superscription, "the Israelites according to their number, and the princes of the divisions which served the king," would be amply sufficient, Bertheau thinks that the superscription originally belonged to a more complete description of the classes and their different officers, of which only a short extract is here communicated. This hypothesis is indeed possible, but is not at all certain; for it is questionable whether, according to the above superscription, we have a right to expect an enumeration by name of the various officials who served the king in the classes of the army. The answer to this question depends upon our view of the relation of the words, "the heads of the fathers'-houses, and the princes," to the first clause, "the sons of Israel according to their number." Had these words been connected by the conjunction &#1493; (&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;) with this clause, and thereby made co-ordinate with it, we should be justified in having such an expectation. But the want of the conjunction shows that these words form an apposition, which as to signification is subordinate to the main idea. If we take this appositional explanation to mean something like this, "the sons of Israel, according to their number, with the heads of the fathers'-houses and the princes," the emphasis of the superscription falls upon &#1500;&#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, and the number of the sons of Israel, who with their heads and princes were divided into classes, is announced to be the important thing in the following catalogue. That this is the meaning and object of the words may be gathered from this, that in the second half of the verse, the number of the men fit for service, who from month to month came and went as one class, is stated &#1492;&#1488;&#1495;&#1514;, one at a time (distributive), as in <a href="/judges/8-18.htm">Judges 8:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-6.htm">Numbers 17:6</a>, etc.; cf. Ew. 313, a, note 1. &#1493;&#1510;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, used of entering upon and leaving the service (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/23-8.htm">2 Chronicles 23:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-5.htm">2 Kings 11:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a>,<a href="/2_kings/11-9.htm">2 Kings 11:9</a>). But the words are hardly to be understood to mean that the classes which were in service each month were ordered from various parts of the kingdom to the capital, and there remained under arms; but rather, as Clericus, that they paratae essent ducum imperiis parere, si quid contigisset, dum ceterae copiae, si necesse essent, convenirent.</body></html>
