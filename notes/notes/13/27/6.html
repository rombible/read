Between the words "Jeriah the head," <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-31.htm">1 Chronicles 26:31</a>, and &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-32.htm">1 Chronicles 26:32</a>, a parenthesis is inserted, which gives the reason why David made these Hebronites scribes and judges among the East-Jordan tribes. The parenthesis runs thus: "As to the Hebronites, according to their generations, according to fathers, they were sought out in the fortieth year of David's rule, and valiant heroes were found among them in Jazer of Gilead." Jazer was a Levite city in the tribal domain of Gad, assigned, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-39.htm">Joshua 21:39</a>, to the Merarites (see on <a href="/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81</a>). The number of these Hebronites was 2700 valiant men (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-32.htm">1 Chronicles 26:32</a>). The additional &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is obscure, for if we take &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; to be, as it often is in the genealogies, a contraction for &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; rof no, the number given does not suit; for a branch of the Hebronites cannot possibly have numbered 2700 fathers'-houses (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;, groups of related households): they must be only 2700 men (&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;), or heads of families, i.e., households. Not only the large number demands this signification, but also the comparison of this statement with that in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-30.htm">1 Chronicles 26:30</a>. The 1700 &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; of which the Hebronite branch, Hashabiah with his brethren, consisted, were not so many &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;, but only so many men of this &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;. In the same way, the Hebronite branch of which Jeriah was head, with his brethren, 2700 &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, were also not 2700 &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;, but only so many men, that is, fathers of families. It is thus placed beyond doubt that &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; cannot here denote the heads of fathers'-houses, but only heads of households. And accordingly we must not understand &#1500;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-31.htm">1 Chronicles 26:31</a>) of fathers'-houses, as the lxx and all commentators do, but only of heads of households. The use of the verb &#1504;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; also favours this view, for this verb is not elsewhere used of the legal census of the people, i.e., the numbering and entering of them in the public lists, according to the great families and fathers'-houses. There may therefore be in &#1504;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; a hint that it was not a genealogical census which was undertaken, but only a numbering of the heads of households, in order to ascertain the number of scribes and judges to be appointed. There yet remain in this section three things which are somewhat strange: 1. Only 1700 scribes and judges were set over the cis-Jordanic land, inhabited as it was by ten and a half tribes, while 2700 were set over the trans-Jordanic land with its two and a half tribes. 2. Both numbers taken together amount to only 4400 men, while David appointed 6000 Levites to be scribes and <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/3.htm">Judges 3</a>. The scribes and judges were taken only from two fathers'-houses of the Kohathites, while most of the other Levitical offices were filled by men of all the families of the tribe of Levi. On all these grounds, it is probable that our catalogue of the Levites appointed to be scribes and judges, i.e., for the external business, is imperfect. </body></html>
