Asahel the brother of Joab was over the course for the fourth month, Tammuz, or June, and who being slain by Abner, his son Zebadiah succeeded him: Shamhuth, the same with Shammah, <a href="/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a> and Shammoth, <a href="/1_chronicles/11-27.htm">1 Chronicles 11:27</a> was captain for the fifth month, Ab, or July: Ira the son of Ikkesh, the Tekoite, was over the course of the sixth month, Elul, or August, see <a href="/1_chronicles/11-28.htm">1 Chronicles 11:28</a>. Helez the Pelonite was captain for the seventh month, Tisri, or September, see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-27.htm">1 Chronicles 11:27</a>, the captain for the eighth month, Marchesvan, sometimes called Bul, or October, was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zarbites, of the posterity of Zerah, a son of Judah in the line of Hushah, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>, the captain of the course for the ninth month, Cisleu, or November was Abiezer, of Anethoth, in the tribe of Benjamin, see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-28.htm">1 Chronicles 11:28</a>, Maharai, of Netophah, in the tribe of Judah, and of the posterity of Zerah, was over the course for the tenth month, Tebet, or December, see <a href="/1_chronicles/11-30.htm">1 Chronicles 11:30</a> and the captain for the eleventh month, Sheber, or January, was Benaiah, of Pirathon, in the tribe of Ephraim, see <a href="/1_chronicles/11-31.htm">1 Chronicles 11:31</a> and over the course for the twelfth month, Adar, or February, was Heldai the Netophathite, the same with Heled, <a href="/1_chronicles/11-30.htm">1 Chronicles 11:30</a> and who was of the posterity of Othniel, the first judge in Israel, <a href="/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">Shamhuth the Izrahite</span>] Perhaps to be identified with “Shammoth the Harorite” of <a href="/1_chronicles/11-27.htm" title="Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,">1 Chronicles 11:27</a>; see note there.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shamhuth</span>.
