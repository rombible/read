Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed.

But we are neither informed here, nor can we ascertain from any information elsewhere given in the Old Testament, from which of the four sons Joel was descended. For although many of the names in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-4.htm">1 Chronicles 5:4-6</a> frequently occur, yet they are nowhere met with in connection with the family whose members are here registered.

This is expressed by &#1500; being used instead of the stat. constr.; cf. Ew. 292, a. In reference to the leading away of the trans-Jordanic tribes into captivity by Tiglath-pilneser, cf. on <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>. The name of this king as it appears in the Chronicles is always Tiglath-pilneser, but its meaning has not yet been certainly ascertained.
