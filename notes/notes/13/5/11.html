Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed.

Gad was born seventh in order of all the sons of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/30-9.htm">Genesis 30:9-12</a>), and first of the children of Leah's maid Zilpah. The compiler seems to pass easily on to Gad, from the mere circumstance of the name of the tribe being so constantly linked with that preceding, in the matter of local settlement on the east of Jordan, after the journeyings of the wilderness (<a href="/joshua/13-7.htm">Joshua 13:7, 8</a>). The geography in vers. 11 and 16 offers very little difficulty. Compared with the time of the first settling of the Gadites (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10-13</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25, 30</a>), it is evident that they had pushed their borders further to the north, trenching somewhat upon the lot of the half-tribe Manasseh, as <span class="accented">they</span> also in turn extended their limits northward to Hermon (ver. 23). This reconciles <a href="/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a> with the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Salcah</span>, or (Authorized Version) Salchah (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-11.htm">Joshua 13:11</a>), is probably to be identified as the modern <span class="accented">Sulkhad</span>, at the extreme eastern point of the plain <span class="accented">Hauran</span>, which is bordered by the desert. "In Gilead in Bashan" may be read, with some, as two coordinate places, separating them by a stop; or may point to a time when Bashan included the upper half of Gilead. Sharon, which Keil, quoting Reland, 'Pal. Ill.,' 370, would make the well-known Sharon of Carmel and the Mediterranean, is, though unmentioned elsewhere, probably distinguished sufficiently from it by the absence of the article, which is invariably prefixed to the other. Stanley's suggestion ('Sinai and Palestine,' edit. 1866, pp. 484, 485, 260) would seem exceedingly apt, that it is one in fact, as one in derivation and meaning, with the <span class="accented">Mishor</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "level ]ands," "table-land") of Gilead and Bashan. With this explanation, however, the term "suburbs" does not so well agree. Upon the other side, distant as the well-known Sharon is, a link of connection might be found with it, in that the other Manasseh half-tribe stretched into its plains; and in that case the last word of the verse, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, might mean (<a href="/joshua/17-9.htm">Joshua 17:9</a>) "the outgoings" of the land or regions in question to the "sea"-coast. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From one of these sons descended Joel, whose family is traced down through seven generations, to the time of the Assyrian deportation of the Israelites. But we are neither informed here, nor can we ascertain from any information elsewhere given in the Old Testament, from which of the four sons Joel was descended. For although many of the names in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-4.htm">1 Chronicles 5:4-6</a> frequently occur, yet they are nowhere met with in connection with the family whose members are here registered. The last-named, Beerah, was &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;, a prince of the Reubenites, not a prince of the tribe of Reuben, but a prince of a family of the Reubenites. This is expressed by &#1500; being used instead of the stat. constr.; cf. Ew. 292, a. In reference to the leading away of the trans-Jordanic tribes into captivity by Tiglath-pilneser, cf. on <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>.

According to Oppert's interpretation, it  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;&#1470;&#1505;&#1495;&#1512;, i.e., "worship of the son of the Zodiac" (i.e., the Assyrian Hercules); vid., Delitzsch on Isaiah, Introd. </body></html>
