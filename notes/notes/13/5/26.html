In <a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm" title="And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.">2Kings 15:19</a> we read that, “Pul king of Assyria came against the land,” in the reign of Menahem, who recognised the Assyrian monarch as his suzerain, and paid a tribute of 1,000 talents of silver. Now Tiglath-pileser II. actually claims to have received tribute of Menahem (<span class= "ital">Menahimmu</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Pûl appears to have been the original name of Tiglath-pileser, which, upon his accession to the throne of Assyria (745 B.C.), he discarded for that of the great king who had ruled the country four centuries before his time. The name Pûl has been identified by Dr. Schrader with the Porus of Ptolemy’s Canon, <span class= "ital">Pôr</span> being the Persian pronunciation of Pûl. The Syriac here omits “Pûl king of Assyria.” The LXX. (Vat.) has <span class= "greekheb">Χαλαχ</span>, and the Arabic <span class= "ital">Bãlaq.</span> Perhaps the chronicler meant to indicate the identity of Pûl and Tiglath: “The spirit of Pul <span class= "ital">and </span>(<span class= "ital">=</span> that is) the spirit of Tiglath, and <span class= "ital">he</span> carried them away.”<p><span class= "bld">And he carried them away.</span>—Tiglath-pileser is meant.

Tiglath-pileser received the homage of Ahaz (Yahu-haçi, Jeho-ahaz), king of Judah, slew Rezin (Raçunni) of Damascus, and reduced Pekah (Paqahú), king of Samaria, to vassalage. This supplements the Biblical account. Gilead, in <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>, represents the trans-Jordanic tribes.

The transportation of entire populations was a common practice with the Assyrian kings.

There is nothing unlikely in the statement of either text.

These two were chosen ministers of God's will, if not ministers of himself. We can identify the date of this punishment which befell the transgressing Israelites east of the Jordan. The visit of the former, in the reign of Menahem (<a href="/2_kings/15-15.htm">2 Kings 15:15-20</a>), may be interpreted and might have operated as a lesson and a warning. He was bought off with a thousand talents of silver. It seems to be said with significance," So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land." It was in the reign of Pekah, the usurping successor of Menahem's son Pekahiah, that the completer punishment fell, and Tilgath-pilneser effected the captivity spoken of here and in <a href="/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27-29</a>.

"Pul," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). <span class="accented">Tilqath-pilneser</span> (see notes on ver. 6) was probably the founder of the lower dynasty of Assyria, and first king of the new empire. His first invasion was one chiefly of Israel and Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). His second was of a much more significant character. Called in to aid Judah under Ahaz against Pekah of Israel and Rezin of Syria in alliance, he both conquered these latter and brought into vassalage Judah itself (<a href="/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9, 10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6-8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Halah; Habor Hara; Gozan</span>. This enumeration exceeds that of <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a> by the addition of <span class="accented">Hara</span>, important as helping with consistent witness to the antiquity of the region described. <span class="accented">Halah</span> (<span class="accented">not</span> the "Calah" of <a href="/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a>) is believed to be identifiable with <span class="accented">Chalcitis</span>, its verbal resemblance to which comes out a little more evidently in its Hebrew form (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>).

Habor</span> of this passage, an important tributary of the Euphrates, and not the "Chebar" of Ezekiel. This name <span class="accented">Khabour</span> is found in an Assyrian inscription dating upwards of eight centuries before Christ. The mention of Habor in <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a> and 2 Kings 18:11 is, in the Authorized Version, made to convey the impression of a place "by" the "river of Gozan," instead of being, what the Hebrew says, "the river of Gozan." Here, on the other hand, <span class="accented">Gozan</span> is, in the Authorized Version, incorrectly translated as a river itself, instead of the region of a river. It is, according to the testimony of Layard ('Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 270-312), a remarkably fertile tract, being the <span class="accented">Gauzanitis</span> of Ptolemy, and substantially the Mygdonia of Polybius and Strabo. <span class="accented">Hara</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, with little doubt, the same as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">Haran</span>, or <span class="accented">Charran</span> (<a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>), the ancient adopted home of Abraham, in Padan-aram, in Mesopotamia, on the Belik, a small tributary of the Euphrates. It is the Greek <span class="accented">Carrhae</span> of Strabo and Polybius. These four names purport to give us, probably in brief, the information that those of the Captivity here alluded to were divided - some to settle at Halab on one river, some in Hara on another, and the rest in the district called <span class="accented">Gauzanitis.</span> The region called Halah and that called Gau-zanitis, however, were both watered by the Khabour, and therefore the insertion of the name Haran where it is inserted occasions some difficulty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Israelites, with God's help, gained the victory. &#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, "it was helped to them," i.e., by God "against them" - the Hagarites and their allies. &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; contracted from &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. &#1504;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is not an uncommon form of the perf. Niph., which would not be suitable in a continuous sentence, but the inf. absol. Niph. used instead of the third pers. perf. (cf. Gesen. Heb. Gramm. 131, 4): "and (God) was entreated of them, because they trusted in Him." From these words we may conclude that the war was a very serious one, in which the possession of the land was at stake. As the trans-Jordanic tribes lived mainly by cattle-breeding, and the Arabian tribes on the eastern frontier of their land were also a shepherd people, quarrels could easily arise as to the possession of the pasture grounds, which might lead to a war of extermination.</body></html>
