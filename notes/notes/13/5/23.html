Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity.

These, who were skilled in archery, were invaded in the time of Joshua by a confederate army of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh, who, probably incensed by the frequent raids of those marauding neighbors, took reprisals in men and cattle, dispossessed almost all of the original inhabitants, and colonized the district themselves.

Manasseh and his brother Ephraim stand in the place of Joseph, both the children of Joseph's Egyptian wife, Asenath, and born before the famine. Though Manasseh was the elder, Jacob gave the chief blessing (<a href="/genesis/48-10.htm">Genesis 48:10-22</a>) to Ephraim. The Manassites were descended from Manasseh through his son Machir, born of a Syrian concubine (Septuagint, <a href="/genesis/46-20.htm">Genesis 46:20</a>; <a href="/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-28.htm">Numbers 26:28-34</a>; <a href="/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1-3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14, 15</a>). Machir evidently was <span class="accented">spes gregis</span> (though apparently not the only son, for see <span class="accented">Asriel</span>, or <span class="accented">Ashriel</span>, in above references), and is repeatedly mentioned with his sou Gilead. It is probable that the division of the tribe was determined partly according to the energy of those who composed it at the time of division - the more warlike being more adapted to the east of Jordan. Nevertheless Machir is distinctly mentioned westward, as well as with Gilead eastward (comp. <a href="/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14-17</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29-31</a>). (For the further prosecution of this part of the subject, see Exposition, <a href="/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14-19</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Baal-hermon</span>, etc. These three names need scarcely be read as different names for exactly the same region, but as designating different sides or heights of what was essentially one and the same well-known mountain district, with which would agree Psalm 43:6, "Therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and <span class="accented">of the Hermonites</span>, from the hill Mizar.' So <a href="/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8-10</a> tells us that Hermon was called <span class="accented">Sirion</span> by the Sidonians; Shenir, <span class="accented">i.q. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Senir</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, exactly the same word in the Hebrew text in all the four places of its occurrence - <a href="/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>), by the Amorites. And the suggestion of Grove is likely enough, that <span class="accented">Baal-hermon</span> was the Phoenician cast of the name. If any point were to be gained by reading the names, however, as intended to cover exactly the same tract, it may be noted <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Hebrew conjunction will perfectly admit of being translated "even;" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the <span class="accented">order</span> of the names, going from the foreign to the native <span class="cmt_word">Hermon</span> itself, would so far favour it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And these (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, all the families of Gad, not merely those mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-13.htm">1 Chronicles 5:13</a>.) were registered in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel." These two kings did not reign contemporaneously, for Jotham ascended the throne in Judah twenty-five years after the death of Jeroboam of Israel. Here, therefore, two different registrations must be referred to, and that carried on under Jotham is mentioned first, because Judah had the legitimate kingship. That set on foot by Jeroboam was probably undertaken after that king had restored all the ancient boundaries of the kingdom of Israel, <a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>. King Jotham of Judah could prepare a register of the Gadites only if a part of the trans-Jordanic tribes had come temporarily under his dominion. As to any such event, indeed, we have no accurate information, but the thing in itself is not unlikely. For as the death of Jeroboam II was followed by complete anarchy in the kingdom of the ten tribes, and one ruler overthrew the other, until at last Pekah succeeded in holding the crown for ten years, while in Judah until Pekah ascended the throne of Israel Uzziah reigned, and raised his kingdom to greater power and prosperity, the southern part of the trans-Jordanic land might very well have come for a time under the sway of Judah. At such a time Jotham may have carried out an assessment and registration of the Gadites, until his contemporary Pekah succeeded, with the help of the Syrian king Rezin, in taking from the king of Judah the dominion over Gilead, and in humbling the kingdom of Judah in the reign of Ahaz. </body></html>
