Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity.

The people were “reckoned by genealogy” not so much to take a census of them, as to inquire into the purity of their Israelite descent. The ancient term “numbering” would probably be a more suitable description of a transaction belonging to the days of Jotham.

Although presumably it would be an object of closer interest with Israel than with Judah to effect the registration of the Gadite genealogy, yet it was most just that Judah should do so as well. This would both vindicate Judah's own right place and be a happy omen of the continued predominance of her position compared with that of Israel. Independently of the question of <span class="accented">effecting</span> the actual registration, however, it is quite possible that, so long as history ran by the side of history. Israel would gather and keep all it could of Judah, and Judah all it could of Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The families of the tribe of Gad, and their dwelling-places. - <a href="/1_chronicles/5-11.htm">1 Chronicles 5:11</a>. In connection with the preceding statement as to the dwelling-places of the Reubenites, the enumeration of the families of Gad begins with a statement as to their dwelling-places: "Over against them (the Reubenites) dwelt the Gadites in Bashan unto Salcah." Bashan is used here in its wider signification of the dominion of King Og, which embraced the northern half of Gilead, i.e., the part of that district which lay on the north side of the Jabbok, and the whole district of Bashan; cf. on <a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>.
