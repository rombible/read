They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed.

These, who were skilled in archery, were invaded in the time of Joshua by a confederate army of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh, who, probably incensed by the frequent raids of those marauding neighbors, took reprisals in men and cattle, dispossessed almost all of the original inhabitants, and colonized the district themselves.

It would be possible to consider them here as <span class="accented">in apposition</span> with the description, <span class="cmt_word">the Hagarites</span> (respecting whom see note on ver. 10); but they may more probably be regarded as favourite names, still repeated in the descendants of the tribe. The people of Nephish have not made their mark deep on the page of ethnographic history; but the people of Jetur have done so. Their stinted territory appears in the name Ituraea (<a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a>). Their people reappear also (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13. e. 11, &sect; 3; Strabo, 16:518, 520). Nor is it an unnoticeable contribution to the truth of our history here to put, side by side with the description of the qualities and of the arms and weapons of warfare of the Manassites and their helpers of Reuben and Gad (ver. 18), those of the Ituraeans, their antagonists (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 2:448; Cicero, 'Philippians,' 2:44; Luean, 'Pharsalia,' 7:230; see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:905). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sons of Gad (<a href="/genesis/46-16.htm">Genesis 46:16</a>) are not named here, because the enumeration of the families of Gad had been already introduced by <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-11.htm">1 Chronicles 5:11</a>, and the genealogical connection of the families enumerated in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-12.htm">1 Chronicles 5:12</a>., with the sons of the tribal ancestor, had not been handed down.

They are therefore heads of fathers'-houses, but the district in which they dwelt is not given; whence Bertheau concludes, but wrongly, that the place where they dwelt is not given in the text. The statement which is here omitted follows in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a> at a fitting place; for in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-14.htm">1 Chronicles 5:14</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/5-15.htm">1 Chronicles 5:15</a> their genealogy, which rightly goes before the mention of their dwelling-place, is given. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-14.htm">1 Chronicles 5:14</a>, is not to be referred, as Bertheau thinks, to the four Gadites mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-12.htm">1 Chronicles 5:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-13.htm">1 Chronicles 5:13</a>, but only to those mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-13.htm">1 Chronicles 5:13</a>. Nothing more was known of those four (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-12.htm">1 Chronicles 5:12</a>) but that they dwelt in Bashan, while the genealogy of the seven is traced up through eight generations to a certain Buz, of whom nothing further is known, as the name &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; occurs nowhere else, except in <a href="/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a> as that of a son of Nahor. The names of his ancestors also are not found elsewhere among the Gadites.</body></html>
