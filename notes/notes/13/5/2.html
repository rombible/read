The Line of Reuben.<p>1. Now the sons of Reuben&#8212;In proceeding to give this genealogy, the sacred historian states, in a parenthesis (1Ch 5:1, 2), the reason why it was not placed first, as Reuben was the oldest son of Jacob. The birthright, which by a foul crime he had forfeited, implied not only dominion, but a double portion (De 21:17); and both of these were transferred to Joseph, whose two sons having been adopted as the children of Jacob (Ge 48:5), received each an allotted portion, as forming two distinct tribes in Israel. Joseph then was entitled to the precedency; and yet, as his posterity was not mentioned first, the sacred historian judged it necessary to explain that "the genealogy was not to be reckoned after the birthright," but with a reference to a superior honor and privilege that had been conferred on Judah&#8212;not the man, but the tribe, whereby it was invested with the pre-eminence over all the other tribes, and out of it was to spring David with his royal lineage, and especially the great Messiah (Heb 7:14).

The locality itself, however, is to us at present unknown. So much is clear, that by Gedor, the Gedor mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a>, situated in the high lands of Judah, north of Hebron, cannot be intended, for in that district there is no open valley stretching out on either hand; and the Simeonites, moreover, could not have carried on a war of conquest in the territory of the tribe of Judah in the reign of Hezekiah. But where this Gedor is to be sought cannot be more accurately determined; for &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; is certainly not "the valley in which the Dead Sea lies, and the southern continuation of that valley," as Ewald and Berth. think: that valley has, in the Old Testament, always the name &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;. From the use of the article, "the valley," no further conclusion can be drawn, than that a definite valley in the neighbourhood of Gedor is meant.<p>(Note: The lxx have rendered &#1490;&#1491;&#1512; by &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;, whence Ewald and Bertheau conclude that &#1490;&#1491;&#1512; is a transcriber's error for &#1490;&#1512;&#1512;. But a slip of the pen which would make the Gerar so famed in the history of the patriarchs into Gedor is  priori not very probable; and the defective writing &#1490;&#1491;&#1512;, while Gedor in the high lands is written &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;, cannot be adduced, as Bertheau thinks, in support of the hypothesis, since Gedor even in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-18.htm">1 Chronicles 4:18</a> is written defectively. It is decisive against Gerar, that the dwelling-places of the Simeonites demonstrably did not extend till towards sunset (westward) from Gerar, for the cities assigned to them all lie to the east of Gerar.)<p>Even the further statements in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-30.htm">1 Chronicles 4:30</a>, with regard to the district, that they found there fat and good pasture, and that the land extended on both sides (i.e., was wide), and at rest and secure, because formerly the Hamites dwelt there, and the statement of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-41.htm">1 Chronicles 4:41</a>, that the Simeonites found the Meunim there, and smote them, give us no firm foothold for the ascertainment of the district referred to. The whole Negeb of Judah has been as yet too little travelled over and explored by modern travellers, to allow of our forming any probable conjecture as to Gedor and the wide valley stretching out on both sides. The description of the Hamite inhabitants, &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1514;, reminds us of the inhabitants of the ancient Laish (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>, <a href="/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27</a>). Those &#1510;&#1501; &#1502;&#1503; are people from Ham, i.e., Hamites, and they may have been Egyptians, Cushites, or even Canaanites (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-8.htm">1 Chronicles 1:8</a>). This only is certain, that they were a peaceful shepherd people, who dwelt in tents, and were therefore nomads. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, "formerly," before the Simeonites took possession of the land. </body></html>
