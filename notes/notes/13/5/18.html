It evidently rests upon some official census, of which the chronicler had the record or among his authorities.

As <span class= "ital">Nodab</span> is mentioned nowhere else, the word may be a corruption of Kedemah, or rather Kedem. The first two letters might have been mistaken for <span class= "ital">h,</span> the <span class= "ital">d</span> is common to both words, and <span class= "ital">b</span> and <span class= "ital">m</span> are often confused in Hebrew writing. Jetur is the original of the classical name Ituraea, the modern <span class= "ital">El-Jedur.</span><p>(20) <span class= "bld">And they were helped against them.</span>—The same word recurs in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-26.htm" title="And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.">1Chronicles 15:26</a> : “And when God helped the Levites that bare the Ark.” In both places strictly natural events are regarded as providential. Here the Divine hand is recognised as controlling the issues of an invasion; there as permitting the Ark to be successfully removed from its temporary resting place.<p><span class= "bld">For they cried to God in the battle.</span>—No doubt the Arab warriors also cried to their gods in the fierce struggle for life; and their faith, such as it was, gave them strength for the battle. (Comp. <a href="/context/psalms/18-3.htm" title="I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies.">Psalm 18:3-6</a> and <a href="/psalms/18-41.htm" title="They cried, but there was none to save them: even to the LORD, but he answered them not.">Psalm 18:41</a>.) The whole sentence to the end of the verse looks like a reason added to the narrative by the chronicler himself.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">And they took away their cattle.</span>—The numbers are large, but not at all incredible. Flocks and herds naturally constituted the chief wealth of these nomade tribes. Comp. the annual tribute in kind paid by Mesha, king of Moab, to Ahab of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/3-4.htm" title="And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep master, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.">2Kings 3:4</a>): “a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams in fleeces.”<p><span class= "bld">Sheep.</span>—The Heb. word denotes both sheep and goats; <span class= "ital">pecora.</span><p><span class= "bld">Of men an hundred thousand.</span>—<span class= "ital">And persons </span>(<span class= "ital">soul of man,</span> a collective expression) <span class= "ital">a hundred thousand.</span> In <a href="/context/numbers/31-32.htm" title="And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,">Numbers 31:32-35</a> the booty taken from Midian is far greater, but only 32,000 virgins were saved from the general slaughter of the vanquished. The number here may be corrupt, but we do not know enough about the numerical strength of the Arabian peoples to be able to decide. The captives would be valuable as slaves. Sennacherib boasts that he took 200,150 persons “small and great, male and female,” from the cities of Judah.<p>(22) <span class= "bld">There fell down many slain.</span>—Hence the richness of the plunder.

This accounts for the completeness of the <span class= "bld">Arabian</span> overthrow. It is a human instinct to see tokens of Divine activity in great national catastrophes, as well as in the more awful phenomena of nature.

Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed.

These, who were skilled in archery, were invaded in the time of Joshua by a confederate army of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh, who, probably incensed by the frequent raids of those marauding neighbors, took reprisals in men and cattle, dispossessed almost all of the original inhabitants, and colonized the district themselves.
