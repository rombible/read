They were made captives by the king of Assyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are here recorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory. Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist each other against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord, and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed.

These, who were skilled in archery, were invaded in the time of Joshua by a confederate army of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh, who, probably incensed by the frequent raids of those marauding neighbors, took reprisals in men and cattle, dispossessed almost all of the original inhabitants, and colonized the district themselves.

Bertheau regards its position here as a result of striving after a symmetrical distribution of the historical information. "In the case of Reuben," he says, "the historical information is in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-10.htm">1 Chronicles 5:10</a>; in the case of the half-tribe of Manasseh, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-25.htm">1 Chronicles 5:25</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>; as to Gad, we have our record in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18-22</a>, which, together with the account in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-25.htm">1 Chronicles 5:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>, refers to all the trans-Jordanic Israelites." But it is much more likely that the reason of it will be found in the character of the authorities which the author of the Chronicle made use of, in which, probably, the notes regarding this war were contained in the genealogical register of the Gadites.<p><a href="/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18</a><p>&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; belongs to the predicate of the sentence, "They were the sons of Valour," i.e., they belonged to the valiant warriors, "men bearing shield and sword (weapons of offence and defence), and those treading (or bending) the bow," i.e., skilful bowmen. &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, people practised in war; cf. the portrayal of the warlike valour of Gad and Manasseh, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/12-21.htm">1 Chronicles 12:21</a>. "The number 44,760 must be founded upon an accurate reckoning" (Berth.); but in comparison with the number of men capable of bearing arms in those tribes in the time of Moses, it is somewhat inconsiderable: for at the first numbering under him Reuben alone had 46,500 and Gad 45,650, and at the second numbering Reuben had 43,730 and Gad 40,500 men; see on <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1-4</a> (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2</a>, S. 192).</body></html>
