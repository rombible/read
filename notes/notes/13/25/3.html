This metaphorical application of the term "prophecy" most probably originated in the practice of the prophets, who endeavored to rouse their prophetic spirit by the animating influence of music (see on [403]2Ki 3:15). It is said that Asaph did this "according to David's order," because by royal appointment he officiated in the tabernacle on Zion (1Ch 16:37-41), while other leaders of the sacred music were stationed at Gibeon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The sons of Jeduthun, </span> or, <span class="ital">his sons</span>, (the construct form being used before the absolute, of which there are examples in Scripture,)<span class="ital"> Jeduthun</span>, called by his father’s name; otherwise they are not <span class="ital">six</span>, unless either Jeduthun their father be included in that number, or Shimei, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/25-17.htm" title="The tenth to Shimei, he, his sons, and his brothers, were twelve:">1 Chronicles 25:17</a></span>, be one of them, as many learned men think.

As Mahli's son Eleazar had no sons, only Jerahmeel from his second son Kish, as head of the class formed by Mahli's sons, is named. Of Mushi's sons only the names of the four fathers'-houses into which they fell are mentioned, the chiefs of the classes not being noticed. The heads mentioned in our section are fifteen in all; and supposing that in the cases of the fathers'-houses of the Hebronites and of the Merarite branch of the Mushes, where the heads of the classes are not named, each father's-house formed only one class, we would have only fifteen classes. It is, however, quite conceivable that many of the fathers'-houses of the Hebronites and Mushes were so numerous as to form more than one class; and so out of the Levite families mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-20.htm">1 Chronicles 24:20-29</a> twenty-four classes could be formed. The subscription, that they cast the lot like their brethren, makes this probable; and the analogy of the division of the musicians into twenty-four classes (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25</a>) turns the probability that the Levites who were appointed to perform service for the priests, were divided into the same number of classes, into a certainty, although we have no express statement to that effect, and in the whole Old Testament no information as to the order of succession of the Levites is anywhere to be found.</body></html>
