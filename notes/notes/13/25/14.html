To prophesy, in this place, means praising God with great earnestness and devout affections, under the influences of the Holy Spirit. In raising these affections, poetry and music were employed. If the Spirit of God do not put life and fervour into our devotions, they will, however ordered, be a lifeless, worthless form.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_chronicles/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As well the small as the great - Compare <a href="/1_chronicles/24-31.htm">1 Chronicles 24:31</a>. The lot was not applied indiscriminately to all the 24 courses, but was only used to settle which course of Asaph, which of Jeduthun, and which of Heman, should on each occasion be taken. Asaph was given the precedence over his brethren, and his four courses were assigned the first, and then each alternate place. Jeduthun took rank next, and received alternate places, first with Asaph, and then with Heman, until his courses were exhausted. After this, all the later places fell necessarily to Heman, whose courses continue without interruption from the 15th. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 25:8-31. Their Division by Lot into Four and Twenty Orders.<p>8. they cast lots, ward against ward&#8212;"Ward" is an old English word for "division" or "company." The lot was cast to determine the precedence of the classes or divisions over which the musical leaders presided; and, in order to secure an impartial arrangement of their order, the master and his assistants, the teacher and his scholars, in each class or company took part in this solemn casting of lots. In the first catalogue given in this chapter the courses are classed according to their employment as musicians. In the second, they are arranged in the order of their service.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph,....

As no name follows, R. Shel. and Kimchi would repeat the preceding &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;: one class as the other; and this is supported by <a href="/1_chronicles/26-16.htm">1 Chronicles 26:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-24.htm">Nehemiah 12:24</a>, and by the fact that in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-5.htm">1 Chronicles 17:5</a>, after &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, the words &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1500; have been dropped out. But according to the accentuation &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; belongs to &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, and so the proposed completion is at once disposed of. Besides this, however, the thought "class like class" does not appear quite suitable, as the classes were only formed by the lots, and so were not in existence so as to be able to cast lots. We therefore, with Ewald, 360, a, and Berth., hold the clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503; to be the genitive belonging to &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;, since &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514; is in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a> also connected with a clause: "in the manner of, as the small, so the great," i.e., the small and the great, the older as the younger. This is further defined by "the skilled as the scholars." From these words it is manifest that not merely the 288 cast lots, for these were &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-7.htm">1 Chronicles 25:7</a>), but also the other 3712 Levites appointed for the service of the singers; whence it further follows that only the 288 who were divided by lot into twenty-four classes, each numbering twelve persons, were thoroughly skilled in singing and playing, and the scholars were so distributed to them that each class received an equal number of them, whom they had to educate and train. These, then, were probably trained up for and employed in the temple music according to their progress in their education, so that the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; which had at any time charge of the service consisted not only of the twelve skilled musicians, but also of a number of scholars who assisted in singing and playing under their direction. </body></html>
