The lot was not applied indiscriminately to all the 24 courses, but was only used to settle which course of Asaph, which of Jeduthun, and which of Heman, should on each occasion be taken. Asaph was given the precedence over his brethren, and his four courses were assigned the first, and then each alternate place. Jeduthun took rank next, and received alternate places, first with Asaph, and then with Heman, until his courses were exhausted. After this, all the later places fell necessarily to Heman, whose courses continue without interruption from the 15th. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ch 25:8-31.

The lot was cast to determine the precedence of the classes or divisions over which the musical leaders presided; and, in order to secure an impartial arrangement of their order, the master and his assistants, the teacher and his scholars, in each class or company took part in this solemn casting of lots. In the first catalogue given in this chapter the courses are classed according to their employment as musicians.

It has been supposed that this is a mere omission of carelessness. But this can scarcely be asserted conclusively. It is observable, for instance, that the order of the formula in the same verse, on occasion of its very first occurrence, is not identical with the other twenty-two instances of it, the word "brethren" preceding "sons," and the pronoun "he" being expressed. The preposition (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>) is sometimes expressed and sometimes not expressed before both the proper names and the ordinal numerals of the list. Examination of the contents of these verses shows, either that it was due to the Divine direction of the lot (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>) that an issue resulted which looks so unlike mere chance, and the system of which is so methodical and traceable; or that the lot-taking was not one of families and sons, all thrown together from the first. This supposition would, of course, leave room for some such ingenious hypothesis as that of Berthean, too artificial by far to be defensible except as a theory that would indeed work out the result. He suggests that the <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> was by two urns, one for the first seven odd numbers, into which were put the names of Asaph's four sons and of the second, third, and fourth of Heman; the other for the first seven even numbers, into which were put the six sons of Jeduthun and the first of Heman. Turning from such a concocted theory to these verses, we find that the first cast brings to the surface the <span class="accented">second</span> son of Asaph, and the second cast brings up the eldest son of Jeduthun. At the end of the seventh all of Asaph's sons are exhausted, and what would have been his next place (the ninth) is occupied by the second son of Heman, whose eldest had just taken the sixth place so thrown out by the lot. At the end of the fourteenth throw Jeduthun's six sons are all used up, and all the remaining places belong to Heman's sons, but still in the order in which they are thrown out by the lot. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; the enumeration beings: "Of Asaph's sons were, or to Asaph's sons belonged, Zacchur," etc. Four are here named, but the number is not stated, while it is given in the case of the sons of Jeduthun and Heman, <a href="/1_chronicles/25-3.htm">1 Chronicles 25:3</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;, at the hand, alternates with &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-3.htm">1 Chronicles 25:3</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/25-6.htm">1 Chronicles 25:6</a>), and &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; &#1497;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500; does not of itself express a different relationship to Asaph than that expressed by &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500; with reference to the king. It signifies only "under (according to) the direction of;" and in <a href="/1_chronicles/25-6.htm">1 Chronicles 25:6</a> the king, Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman are co-ordinated, inasmuch as the musical part of the worship was arranged by David and the three chief musicians in common, although only the latter were concerned in its performance. In <a href="/1_chronicles/25-3.htm">1 Chronicles 25:3</a> &#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; is placed at the beginning, because the choir of singers led by him bore his name; and so also in the case of Heman, <a href="/1_chronicles/25-4.htm">1 Chronicles 25:4</a>. "As to Jeduthun, were sons of Jeduthun." The word sons in these catalogues denotes not merely actual sons, but those intellectually sons, i.e., scholars taught by the master. This is clear from the fact that the twenty-four classes, each of which numbered twelve men, consist of sons and brothers of the leaders. The names given as those of the sons of Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-2.htm">1 Chronicles 25:2-5</a>, do not represent the whole number of the scholars of these masters, but only the presidents of the twenty-four classes of Levites who were engaged under their leadership in performing the sacred music. Only five sons of Jeduthun are named in our text, while according to the number given there should be six. A comparison of the names in vv. 9-31 shows that in <a href="/1_chronicles/25-3.htm">1 Chronicles 25:3</a> the name &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497; (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-17.htm">1 Chronicles 25:17</a>) has been dropped out. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; belongs to &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;: under the direction of their father Jeduthun (the master), upon the kinnor (see on <a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>), who was inspired to sing praise, i.e., who played inspiredly to bring praise and honour to the Lord; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/16-4.htm">1 Chronicles 16:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-30.htm">1 Chronicles 23:30</a>, etc. </body></html>
