The ancients regarded musical utterance as an effect and proof of direct inspiration, and we still speak of the higher results of genius as inspired, however we may choose to explain the term away as a mere figure of speech. The power of moving sounds, whether of voice or instrument, is not to be gained by mere study or training; it is commonly spoken of as a “gift,” and its products are called “inspirations.” Whence come they, if not from the Divine source of life, and of all that makes life glad and beautiful?

The term “work” is popularly restricted to what is called productive labour, but it is not difficult to see that persons engaged, like these minstrels, in singing and playing to the praise of God are actually helping to produce one of the best of real results, viz., the conservation of the religious spirit: that is, of the right attitude of man towards the Power upon whom his entire welfare absolutely depends.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_chronicles/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/25-1.htm" title="Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:">1 Chronicles 25:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">And captains — </span>All the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites, whom David gathered together (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-2.htm" title="And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.">1 Chronicles 23:2</a>) for this very end, that, with their approbation and consent, all these things might be established, who are here fitly called <span class="ital">the captains of the host; </span>for the princes were, under David, the chief captains of the militia of the kingdom; and as the Levites are called a host, and the <span class="ital">Lord’s host, </span>because of their number and order in holy ministrations, so these priests and Levites were the captains and governors of the rest. <span class="ital">Separated — </span>Distributed them into their several ranks: which, though chiefly done by David as a prophet, and by divine direction, yet is imputed in part to the captains of the host, because it was done with their concurrence and approbation. <span class="ital">The service</span> — To the service of God, under the conduct of these persons. <span class="ital">Who should prophesy — </span>Praise God by singing the psalms of David, and other sacred songs made by themselves, who were prophets, or by other prophets or holy men of God. <span class="ital">The number of the workmen according to their service</span> — Although this sacred work of praising God is here termed <span class="ital">service, </span>and the persons employed in it <span class="ital">workmen, </span>yet it is the greatest liberty and pleasure to be engaged in it. But the expressions intimate that it is our duty to make a business of it, and stir up all that is within us to it; and that in our present state of corruption and infirmity, it will not be done, as it should be done, without labour and struggle. We must take pains with our hearts to bring and keep them to this work, and to engage all that is within us in it. It is probable, Heman, Asaph, and Jeduthun were bred up under Samuel, and had their education in the schools of the prophets, of which he was the founder and president. Then they were pupils, now they come to be masters. Those that would be eminent must begin early and take time to prepare themselves. This good work, of singing God’s praises, Samuel revived and set on foot, but lived not to see it brought to the perfection in which it appears here. Solomon perfects what David began. So David perfects what Samuel began. Let each in their day do what they can for God and his church, though they cannot carry it so far as they would; when they are gone, God can out of stones raise up others, who shall build upon their foundation, and bring forth the top-stone.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-31 The singers and musicians. - David put those in order who were appointed to be singers and musicians in the temple.

Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun belonged respectively to the Gershon, Kohath, and Merarite families (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-18.htm">1 Chronicles 6:18-32</a>). Thus these singers and musicians were drawn from each great branch of Levi; viz. from Gershon, four through Asaph; from Kohath, six through Jeduthun; and from Merari, fourteen through Heman; while the whole number of those trained to sing was two hundred and eighty-eight. <span class="cmt_word">Who should prophesy</span>.

As to Jaaziah and his sons, see the remarks on <a href="/1_chronicles/23-31.htm">1 Chronicles 23:31</a>. As Mahli's son Eleazar had no sons, only Jerahmeel from his second son Kish, as head of the class formed by Mahli's sons, is named. Of Mushi's sons only the names of the four fathers'-houses into which they fell are mentioned, the chiefs of the classes not being noticed. The heads mentioned in our section are fifteen in all; and supposing that in the cases of the fathers'-houses of the Hebronites and of the Merarite branch of the Mushes, where the heads of the classes are not named, each father's-house formed only one class, we would have only fifteen classes. It is, however, quite conceivable that many of the fathers'-houses of the Hebronites and Mushes were so numerous as to form more than one class; and so out of the Levite families mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-20.htm">1 Chronicles 24:20-29</a> twenty-four classes could be formed. The subscription, that they cast the lot like their brethren, makes this probable; and the analogy of the division of the musicians into twenty-four classes (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25</a>) turns the probability that the Levites who were appointed to perform service for the priests, were divided into the same number of classes, into a certainty, although we have no express statement to that effect, and in the whole Old Testament no information as to the order of succession of the Levites is anywhere to be found.</body></html>
