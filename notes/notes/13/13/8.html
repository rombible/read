The construction of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; with &#1506;&#1500; is accounted for by the fact that the sending thither includes the notion of commanding (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;). &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, all the provinces of the various tribal domains, is used for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19</a>, here, and <a href="/2_chronicles/11-23.htm">2 Chronicles 11:23</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/34-33.htm">2 Chronicles 34:33</a>; in all which places the idea of the division of the land into a number of territories is prominent.
