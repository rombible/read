David consulted &#8230; And let us bring again the ark of our God&#8212;Gratitude for the high and splendid dignity to which he had been elevated would naturally, at this period, impart a fresh animation and impulse to the habitually fervent piety of David; but, at the same time, he was animated by other motives. He fully understood his position as ruler under the theocracy, and, entering on his duties, he was resolved to fulfil his mission as a constitutional king of Israel. Accordingly, his first act as a sovereign related to the interests of religion. The ark being then the grand instrument and ornament of it, he takes the opportunity of the official representatives of the nation being with him, to consult them about the propriety of establishing it in a more public and accessible locality. The assembly at which he spoke of this consisted of the Sheloshim, princes of thousands (2Sa 6:1). During the reign of the late king, the ark had been left in culpable neglect. Consequently the people had, to a great extent, been careless about the ordinances of divine worship, or had contented themselves with offering sacrifices at Gibeon, without any thought of the ark, though it was the chief and most vital part of the tabernacle. The duty and advantages of this religious movement suggested by the king were apparent, and the proposal met with universal approval.David fetcheth the ark from Kirjath-jearim with great solemnity, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/1_chronicles/13-1.htm" title="And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader....">1 Chronicles 13:1-8</a></span>.

Advice being taken, the several officers went with their men to their respective countries, to meet again at a certain time and place to put the thing projected into execution; and between this and that time were Hiram's message to David on his accession to the throne, the taking of Jerusalem, and the two battles with the Philistines, as the same writer notes; most of which are recorded before this in the book of Samuel, and follow here. <p>(h) Works, vol. 1. p. 61, 62. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">David consulted with the captains</span> etc.] The Chronicler is fond of associating the people with the king in religious measures so as to minimise the appearance of arbitrary power which is suggested by the language of the books of Samuel and of Kings; cp. <a href="/1_chronicles/13-4.htm" title="And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.">1 Chronicles 13:4</a> (<span class="ital">the assembly said that they would do so</span>), also <a href="/2_chronicles/30-2.htm" title="For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.">2 Chronicles 30:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-4.htm" title="And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.">2 Chronicles 30:4</a>.
