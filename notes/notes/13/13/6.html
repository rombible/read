Our text appears more correct than that of Samuel, which has, “And David rose and went, and all the people that were with him, from BaalêJudah.” The Targum, LXX., and Syriac, translate that which the Authorised Version gives as a proper name, “The people that were with him of the cities lords men of Judah.” If this be right, perhaps “Baalah” has fallen out of the text of Samuel owing to its resemblance to the word <span class= "ital">baalê</span>. lords.

For though the chronology from the death of Eli, through the remainder of Samuel's career and of Saul's, seems almost hopelessly uncertain, yet it would appear certain that the interval exceeded twenty years, to the time that David now takes in hand to bring home, as it were, the ark. <span class="cmt_word">The ark of God, the Lord</span>.
