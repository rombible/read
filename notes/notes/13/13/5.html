There can surely be little doubt that it is the river Nile which is here spoken of, after comparison of the following passages: - <a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>.

Hamath was one of the great cities of the Orontes valley, in Upper Syria, which formed the boundary in especial of the empire of Solomon. This valley is watered by the Orontes, the river of Antioch, a river remarkable for its abundant spring (situate immediately north of the source of the Leontes), which won for it the name, among all the other springs of Syria, of "The Spring," and remarkable for "the length of its course, the volume of its waters, and the rich vegetation of its banks." It is <span class="accented">the</span> one of the four rivers which take their rise beneath the heights of the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon which becomes really worthy of the name of river, the other three, viz. the Jordan, the Leontes or modern <span class="accented">Litany</span> of Phoeicia, and the Abana or modern <span class="accented">Barada</span> of Damascus, more resembling the nature of the mountain stream. This river was to the ancient Romans "the representative of Syria, as the Timings might be said to be of England, and in later times the region formed the chief point of contact between this part of Asia and the West" (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 414, <span class="accented">e</span>,<span class="accented">f</span>, edit. 1866). The <span class="accented">kingdom</span> of Hamath comprised the tract of this valley of the Orontes, skirted by the hills separating the Leontes from the Orontes, and extending to the Pass of Daphne below Antioch. <span class="accented">Riblah</span> (<a href="/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>) lies on the east bank of the Orontes, thirty-five miles north-east of Baal-bek, or Baal-gad. The people of Hamath were of the race of Ham, of the descendants of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>), and are not to be reckoned as of Phoenician origin. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Those gathered together were there three days eating and drinking, holding festive meals (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/30-16.htm">1 Samuel 30:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-45.htm">1 Kings 1:45</a>, etc.), for their brethren had prepared them for them.
