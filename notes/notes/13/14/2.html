Supposing that any special connection subsists between this and the previous verse, it is not necessary to consider it remote. Then, as now, the building of a house for one's self, much more the building of a noble palace on the part of a king, is an indication of feeling settled and "confirmed." It was a partial indication of the "lifted-up kingdom" that the king should have a palace of unwonted magnificence. This must have weighed all the more in the case of a nation which, not for its sacred things, nor for its king, nor for its people, had ever had as yet any adequate and worthy housing, <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As the whole assembly approved of David's design (&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, it is to do so  equals  so much we do), David collected the whole of Israel to carry it out. "The whole of Israel," from the southern frontier of Canaan to the northern; but of course all are not said to have been present, but there were numerous representatives from every part, - according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1</a>, a chosen number of 30,000 men. The &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, which is named as the southern frontier, is not the Nile, although it also is called &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; (<a href="/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>), and the name "the black river" also suits it (see Del. on Isaiah, loc. cit.); but is the &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512; before, i.e., eastward from Egypt (&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;), i.e., the brook of Egypt, &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, the Rhinocorura, now el Arish, which in all accurate statements of the frontiers is spoken of as the southern, in contrast to the neighbourhood of Hamath, which was the northern boundary: see on <a href="/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>. For the designation of the northern frontier, &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;, see on <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>. Kirjath-jearim, the Canaanitish Baalah, was known among the Israelites by the name Baale Jehudah or Kirjath-baal, as distinguished from other cities named after Baal, and is now the still considerable village Kureyeh el Enab; see on <a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>. In this fact we find the explanation of &#1497; &#1488;&#1500; &#1511; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492;, <a href="/1_chronicles/13-6.htm">1 Chronicles 13:6</a> : to Baalah, to Kirjath-jearim of Judah. The ark had been brought thither when the Philistines sent it back to Beth-shemesh, and had been set down in the house of Abinadab, where it remained for about seventy years; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6.htm">1 Samuel 6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>, and the remarks on <a href="/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is not to be translated "which is named name," which gives no proper sense. Translating it so, Bertheau would alter &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, according to an arbitrary conjecture of Thenius on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>, "who there (by the ark) is invoked." But were &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; the true reading, it could not refer to the ark, but only to the preceding &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;, since in the whole Old Testament the idea that by or at the resting-place of the ark Jahve was invoked (which &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; would signify) nowhere occurs, since no one could venture to approach the ark. If &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; referred to &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;, it would signify that Jahve was invoked at Kirjath-baal, that there a place of worship had been erected by the ark; but of that the history says nothing, and it would, moreover, be contrary to the statement that the ark was not visited in the days of Saul. We must consequently reject the proposal to alter &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; as useless and unsuitable, and seek for another explanation: we must take &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; in the sense of &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2;, which it sometimes has; cf. Ew. 333, a.: "as he is called by name," where &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; does not refer only to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, but also to the additional clause &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, and the meaning is that Jahve is invoked as He who is enthroned above the cherubim; cf. <a href="/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>. - On the following <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-7.htm">1 Chronicles 13:7-14</a>, cf. the commentary on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3-11</a>.</body></html>
