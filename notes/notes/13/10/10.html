That the sin of sinners will certainly find them out, sooner or later; Saul died for his transgression. 2. That no man's greatness can exempt him from the judgments of God. 3.

The reading of Chron. is almost certainly a misreading of the text of Sam., yet the fact stated by the Chronicler is probably true. Saul’s body was fixed to the wall of Beth-shan (Sam.), but his head (lit. <span class="ital">his skull</span>) and his armour (Chron.; cp. <a href="/1_samuel/31-9.htm" title="And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.">1 Samuel 31:9</a>) were probably sent into Philistia to be distributed as trophies among the Philistine temples. Beth-shan is N.E. of Gilboa, about four miles distant from the Jordan, and about a day’s march (<a href="/1_samuel/31-12.htm" title="All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.">1 Samuel 31:12</a>) from Jabesh (<a href="/1_chronicles/10-11.htm" title="And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,">1 Chronicles 10:11</a>), which was situated on the other side of Jordan in Gilead.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house of their gods</span>. In place of this general designation, the parallel (<a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>) designates the house more exactly as "the house of Ashtaroth" (<a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; the Phoenician female deity, as Baal was their male deity. The Greek form of the name is Astarte. See also Cic., 'De. Nat. Deo.,' 3:23). <span class="cmt_word">And fastened his head in the temple of Dagon</span>. The parallel, as above, gives us, "And fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shah" (which account is corroborated in <a href="/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12-14</a>), and does not say what further was done with the head. It is no doubt remarkable that one historian puts on record the one fact and the other the other; and it is one of the clearer indications that both took from some common sources. It is perhaps something to be remarked also that, while the historian in Samuel says nothing further about the <span class="accented">head</span> (though allusion to it is probably included in the "body" and the "bones," the further account of which is given in vers. 12, 13, as well as in <a href="/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12-14</a>), the compiler of Chronicles does revert to mention of "the <span class="accented">body</span> of Saul," ver. 12, <span class="accented">infra</span>, though without any corresponding naming of Beth-shah. Bertheau finds little difficulty in the question, by simply supposing that the omission in Chronicles is another instance of the desire to compress; while others suppose corruption in our text, or, as Thenius and Ewald, the loss of a sentence to our text. After all said, the omission in Samuel of the fate of the head would seem to be fully as remarkable as the omission, so far as this verse is concerned, in Chronicles of the fate of the body. It is reasonable to suppose that the head and trunk of the body of Saul were brought together again, or it were likely some allusion to the contrary would have transpired in the following verses of this chapter or in <a href="/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12-14</a>. With regard to the act of the Philistines in dedicating the armour of Saul, and fixing his head in the temple of Dagon, as though trophies, the custom was both ancient and not uncommon (<a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21-30</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>). The house of Dagon (<a href="/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>) here spoken of was that at Ashdod (<a href="/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>), between Gaza and Joppa. Though belonging to Judah's lot, it was never subdued by Israel, and remained throughout their history one of their worst foes. It is the Azotus of <a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>. There was another Dagon temple at Gaza (<a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21-31</a>). Dagon's representation was the figure of a man, as to head, hands, and bust, but for the rest that of a fish, which was a symbol of fruitfulness. As Ashdod was situate on the extreme west of Palestine, so Beth-shah  - generally written Beth-shean, a city of Manasseh (ch. 7:29), though within the borders of Issachar (<a href="/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>), flora which the Canaanites were not expelled (<a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a>) - was on the extreme east near the Jordan. It was afterwards called Scythopolis. Considering the distance these were apart, and their contrary directions, we may suppose that some suggestion was intended by the fixing the head in the one place and the body in the other. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In 1 Sam his narrative forms the conclusion of Saul's last war with the Philistines. The battle was fought on the plain of Jezreel; and when the Israelites were compelled to retire, they fell back upon Mount Gilboa, but were hard pressed by the Philistines, so that many fell upon the mountain. The Philistines pressed furiously after Saul and his sons, and slew the latter (as to Saul's sons, see on <a href="/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>); and when the archers came upon Saul he trembled before them (&#1497;&#1495;&#1500; from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;), and ordered his armour-bearer to thrust him through. Between &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; the superfluous &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is introduced in Samuel, and in the last clause &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; is omitted; and instead of &#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; we have the unusual form &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/35-23.htm">2 Chronicles 35:23</a>). In Saul's request to his armour-bearer that he would thrust him through with the sword, &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a>) is omitted in the phrase which gives the reason for his request; and Bertheau thinks it did not originally stand in the text, and has been repeated merely by an oversight, since the only motive for the command, "Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith," was that the Philistines might not insult Saul when alive, and consequently the words, "that they may not thrust me through," cannot express the reason. But that is scarcely a conclusive reason for this belief; for although the Philistines might seek out Saul after he had been slain by his armour-bearer, and dishonour his dead body, yet the anxiety lest they should seek out his corpse to wreak their vengeance upon it could not press so heavily upon him as the fear that they would take vengeance upon him if he fell alive into their hands. It is therefore a more probable supposition that the author of the Chronicle has omitted the word &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; only as not being necessary to the sense of the passage, just as &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; is omitted at the end of <a href="/1_chronicles/10-5.htm">1 Chronicles 10:5</a>. In <a href="/1_chronicles/10-6.htm">1 Chronicles 10:6</a> we have &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; instead of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; of Samuel, and in <a href="/1_chronicles/10-7.htm">1 Chronicles 10:7</a> &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is omitted after the words &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (Samuel). From this Bertheau concludes that the author of the Chronicle has designedly avoided speaking of the men of Saul's army or of the Israelites who took part in the battle, because it was not his purpose to describe the whole course of the conflict, but only to narrate the death of Saul and of his sons, in order to point out how the supreme power came to David. Thenius, on the contrary, deduces the variation between the sixth verse of the Chronicles and the corresponding verse in Samuel from "a text which had become illegible." Both are incorrect; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; are not all the men of war who went with him into the battle (Then.), or all the Israelites who took part in the battle (Berth.), but only all those who were about the king, i.e., the whole of the king's attendants who had followed him to the war. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; is only another expression for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493;, in which the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; is included. The author of the Chronicle has merely abridged the account, confining himself to a statement of the main points, and has consequently both omitted &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-7.htm">1 Chronicles 10:7</a>, because he had already spoken of the flight of the warriors of Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-1.htm">1 Chronicles 10:1</a>, and it was here sufficient to mention only the flight and death of Saul and of his sons, and has also shortened the more exact statement as to the inhabitants of that district, "those on the other side of the valley and on the other side of Jordan" (Samuel), into &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1511; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. In this abridgement also Thenius scents a "defective text." As the inhabitants of the district around Gilboa abandoned their cities, they were taken possession of by the Philistines. </body></html>
