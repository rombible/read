The chronicler alone gives the number of the four and nine sons, assigning the former to “Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel,” and arranging the latter in three triads. <a href="/1_chronicles/3-9.htm" title="These were all the sons of David, beside the sons of the concubines, and Tamar their sister.">1Chronicles 3:9</a> also is wanting in Samuel.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-24 Genealogies. - Of all the families of Israel, none were so illustrious as the family of David: here we have a full account of it.

The mention of only one daughter of David, viz. <span class="cmt_word">Tamar</span>, follows the manifest ordinary rule, that daughters are not recorded at all, except for one of two reasons - either that through a daughter the line was saved, or that the daughter had from some special reason made a place for herself in history. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sons of David: (a) Those born in Hebron; (b) those born in Jerusalem. - <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1-4</a>. The six sons born in Hebron are enumerated also in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2-5</a>, with mention of their mother as here: but there the second is called &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1489;; here, on the contrary, &#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;, - a difference which cannot well have arisen through an error of a copyist, but is probably to be explained on the supposition that this son had two different names. In reference to the others, see on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3.htm">2 Samuel 3</a>. The sing. &#1500;&#1493; &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; after a preceding plural subject is to be explained as in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, without the article, for &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;,   <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>, or &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-12.htm">1 Chronicles 5:12</a>, is surprising, as all the other numbers have the article; but the enumeration, the first-born, a second, the third, etc., may be justified without any alteration of the text being necessary. But the difference between our text and that of 2 Sam.  regard to the second son, shows that the chronicler did not take the register from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3.htm">2 Samuel 3</a>. The preposition &#1500; before &#1488;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; seems to have come into the text only through a mistake occasioned by the preceding &#1500;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1500;, for no reason is apparent for any strong emphasis which might be implied in the &#1500; being placed on the name of Absalom. The addition of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; to &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492; (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-3.htm">1 Chronicles 3:3</a>) seems introduced only to conclude the enumeration in a fitting way, as the descent of Eglah had not been communicated; just as, for a similar reason, the additional clause "the wife of David" is inserted in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-5.htm">2 Samuel 3:5</a>, without Eglah being thereby distinguished above the other wives as the most honoured. The concluding formula, "six were born to him in Hebron" (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-4.htm">1 Chronicles 3:4</a>), is followed by a notice of how long David reigned in Hebron and in Jerusalem (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>), which is intended to form a fitting transition to the following list of the sons who were born to him in Jerusalem.</body></html>
