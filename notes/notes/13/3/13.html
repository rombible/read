Solomon's son was Rehoboam, &c.&#8212;David's line is here drawn down to the captivity, through a succession of good and bad, but still influential and celebrated, monarchs. It has rarely happened that a crown has been transmitted from father to son, in lineal descent, for seventeen reigns. But this was the promised reward of David's piety.

Some of the names are somewhat differently given in these passages, owing the differences of pronunciation and form: &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492; is in both places &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, between Ibhar and Eliphalet, is in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14.htm">1 Chronicles 14</a> more correctly written &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;.

Besides these, David had also sons by concubines, whose names, however, are nowhere met with. Of David's daughters only Tamar is mentioned as "their sister," i.e., sister of the before-mentioned sons, because she had become known in history through Amnon's crime (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13</a>). </body></html>
