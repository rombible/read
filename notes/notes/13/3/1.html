The oldest son, born after his father's accession to the sovereign authority, is according to Eastern notions, the proper heir to the throne.

To the seven years and six months (<a href="/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>) of David's reign at Hebron six sons belong, each of a different mother. To the thirty and throe years (<a href="/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>) of his reign at Jerusalem belong other thirteen sons, viz. four of one mother, <span class="cmt_word">Bethshua</span>, and nine of other mothers, whose names are not given. The list of the six Hebron sons, with their mothers, is nearly identical with that of <a href="/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2-5</a>, although the differences, slight as they are, would of the two indicate our list here rather as <span class="accented">not</span> copied than copied thence. The only noticeable difference, however, is in the name of the second son, announced here as <span class="cmt_word">Daniel</span>, instead of Chileab, while the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. This, together with the circumstance that one word would, as regards the Hebrew characters, comparatively easily convert into the other. renders it probable that it is merely a corrupt text or text obscure at this point which has occasioned the difference. The meaning of the name Daniel, put side by side with what we read in <a href="/1_samuel/24-15.htm">1 Samuel 24:15</a>, 25:39, suggests strongly that it is the right name of the two. It was a name likely to be given by David to his first child by <span class="cmt_word">Abigail</span>. Additional suspicion is thrown on the name Chileab through the three last letters of it, "<span class="accented">leab</span>," constituting also the three first of the very next word," <span class="accented">of Abigail"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>) which looks very much like the over-haste of the pen uncorrected. It is remarkable that the Syriac and Arabic versions translate "Caleb," both here and in the parallel passage. For the sons born in Jerusalem we have all three parallel lists at command, and the variations are rather greater. The other two lists are in <a href="/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14-16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/14-4.htm">1 Chronicles 14:4-7</a>. The first of these omits <span class="cmt_word">Eliphelet</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Nogah</span> (possibly they died young or without issue), and the latter calls Eliphelet <span class="accented">Elpalet</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>). Again, <span class="cmt_word">Shimeah</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Elishama</span> in our passage must yield, overruled by the consent of the other two, to Shammuah and Elishua. Again, it is to be noticed that the name <span class="cmt_word">Eliada</span> (God (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>) knoweth), on occasion of its <span class="accented">latest</span> occurence (<a href="/1_chronicles/14-7.htm">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>), appears as <span class="accented">Beel</span>iada (the Lord (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) knoweth), preserving therein probably its <span class="accented">earlier form</span>, viz. that used before a settled bad sense had come to be attached to the word Baal (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The families descended from Caleb through his son Hur. - <a href="/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50</a>. The superscription, "These are the sons (descendants) of Caleb," is more accurately defined by the addition, "the son of Hur, the first-born of Ephratah;" and by this definition the following lists of Caleb's descendants are limited to the families descended from his son Hur. That the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; are to be so understood, and not as apposition to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;, "Caleb the son of Hur," is shown by <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-19.htm">1 Chronicles 2:19</a>, according to which Hur is a son of Caleb and Ephrath. On that account, too, the relationship of Hur to Caleb is not given here; it is presupposed as known from <a href="/1_chronicles/2-19.htm">1 Chronicles 2:19</a>. A famous descendant of Hur has already been mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-20.htm">1 Chronicles 2:20</a>, viz., Bezaleel the son of Uri. Here, in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-51.htm">1 Chronicles 2:51</a>, three sons of Hur are named, Shobal, Salma, and Hareph, with the families descended from the first two. All information is wanting as to whether these sons of Hur were brothers of Uri, or his cousins in nearer or remoter degree, as indeed is every means of a more accurate determination of the degrees of relationship. Both &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; and &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; in genealogies mark only descent in a straight line, while intermediate members of a family are often omitted in the lists. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; might have been expected, as two sons are mentioned. The singular &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; shows that the words are not to be fused with the following into one sentence, but, as the Masoretic punctuation also shows, are meant for a superscription, after which the names to be enumerated are ranged without any more intimate logical connection. For the three names are not connected by the w copul. They stand thus: "sons of Hur, the first-born of Ephratah; Shobal...Salma...Hareph." Shobal is called father of Kirjath-jearim, now Kureyet el Enab (see on <a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>). Salma, father of Bethlehem, the birth-place of David and Christ. This Salma is, however, not the same person as Salma mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-11.htm">1 Chronicles 2:11</a> and <a href="/ruth/4-20.htm">Ruth 4:20</a> among the ancestors of David; for the latter belonged to the family of Ram, the former to the family of Caleb. Hareph is called the father of Beth-Geder, which is certainly not the same place as Gedera, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-36.htm">Joshua 15:36</a>, which lay in the Shephelah, but is probably identical with Gedor in the hill country, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a>, west of the road which leads from Hebron to Jerusalem (vide on <a href="/1_chronicles/12-4.htm">1 Chronicles 12:4</a>). Nothing further is told of Hareph, but in the following verses further descendants of both the other sons of Hur are enumerated. </body></html>
