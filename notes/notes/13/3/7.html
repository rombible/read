In "Bathshua," for "Bathsheba," a &#1493;  (v) replaces the &#1489;  (b) of the earlier writer, "w" and "b" having nearly the same sound. In "Ammiel," for "Eliam," the two elements which form the name are inverted, as in Jehoiachin  equals Jechoniah, and the like. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Elishama and Eliphelet&#8212;Two sons of the same name are twice mentioned (1Ch 3:8). They were the children of different mothers, and had probably some title or epithet appended by which the one was distinguished from the other.

The six sons born in Hebron are enumerated also in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2-5</a>, with mention of their mother as here: but there the second is called &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1489;; here, on the contrary, &#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;, - a difference which cannot well have arisen through an error of a copyist, but is probably to be explained on the supposition that this son had two different names. In reference to the others, see on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3.htm">2 Samuel 3</a>. The sing. &#1500;&#1493; &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; after a preceding plural subject is to be explained as in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, without the article, for &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;,   <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>, or &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-12.htm">1 Chronicles 5:12</a>, is surprising, as all the other numbers have the article; but the enumeration, the first-born, a second, the third, etc., may be justified without any alteration of the text being necessary. But the difference between our text and that of 2 Sam.  regard to the second son, shows that the chronicler did not take the register from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3.htm">2 Samuel 3</a>. The preposition &#1500; before &#1488;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; seems to have come into the text only through a mistake occasioned by the preceding &#1500;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1500;, for no reason is apparent for any strong emphasis which might be implied in the &#1500; being placed on the name of Absalom. The addition of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; to &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492; (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-3.htm">1 Chronicles 3:3</a>) seems introduced only to conclude the enumeration in a fitting way, as the descent of Eglah had not been communicated; just as, for a similar reason, the additional clause "the wife of David" is inserted in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-5.htm">2 Samuel 3:5</a>, without Eglah being thereby distinguished above the other wives as the most honoured. The concluding formula, "six were born to him in Hebron" (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-4.htm">1 Chronicles 3:4</a>), is followed by a notice of how long David reigned in Hebron and in Jerusalem (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>), which is intended to form a fitting transition to the following list of the sons who were born to him in Jerusalem.</body></html>
