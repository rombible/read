In this way they bring Zerubbabel into the direct line of descent from Shealtiel. But our Hebrew text, though peculiar, can hardly mean this. It makes Zerubbabel the son of Pedaiah, and nephew of Shealtiel. If Zerubbabel, for reasons unknown, became adopted son and heir of Shealtiel, his uncle, the seemingly discordant statements of the different passages before us are all reconciled; while that of our text is the more exact.<p><span class= "bld">And</span> <span class= "bld">the sons of Zerubbabel.</span>—The Hebrew received text has “<span class= "ital">and the son.</span>” This is not to be altered, although some MSS. have the plural.

Malchiram also&#8212;As far as Jeconiah, everything is plain; but there is reason to suspect that the text in the subsequent verses has been dislocated and disarranged. The object of the sacred historian is to trace the royal line through Zerubbabel; yet, according to the present reading, the genealogical stem cannot be drawn from Jeconiah downwards. The following arrangement of the text is given as removing all difficulties [Davidson, Hermeneutics]:&#8212;1Ch 3:17. And the sons of Jeconiah the the captive, Salathiel (Shealtiel, Ezr 3:2; Ne 12:1; Hag 1:12, 14; 2:2) his son. 1Ch 3:18.

From hence to the end of the chapter, the genealogy is carried on from the captivity of Babylon, out of which Zerubbabel came, to the coming of Christ; and if Ezra was the writer of this book, as is generally thought, who was contemporary with Zerubbabel, this account must be written by another hand: and it may be observed, that it is carried on in the same number of generations as in Matthew; and here it stands thus: <p>Zerubbabel, Hananiah, Jesaiah, Rephaiah, Arnan, Obadiah, Shecaniah, Shemaiah, Neariah, Elioenai, Anani; in Matthew thus, "Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Sadoc, Achim, Eliud, Eleazar, Matthan, Jacob, Joseph"; the difference in names may be accounted for by their having two names; and it is remarkable that the Targum makes Anani to be the King Messiah, who was to be revealed; which, though it makes one generation less to his time, yet plainly shows that the Jews expected the Messiah to come at the end of this genealogy, and about the time Jesus the true Messiah did. Anani is reckoned by other Jews a name of the Messiah, who is said to come in the clouds of heaven, which "Anani" signifies; see Gill on <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>. <p>(u) In Luc. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_chronicles/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the sons of Pedaiah <i>were</i>, <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> Zerubbabel, and Shimei: and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam, and Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister:</span><p>(f) Matthew says that Zerubbabel was the son of Shealtiel, meaning that he was his nephew according to the Hebrew speech: for he was Pedaiah's son.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">the</span> <span class="bld">sons</span> <span class="ital">of Zerubbabel</span>] R.V. = LXX.; A.V. = Heb.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">their sister</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">was their sister</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>19b–24.

Of the latter of these nothing else is known, unless Lord Hervey's theory below be correct. The former is a great name - its derivation perhaps doubtful.

We have in this name another instance of the treatment just commented on with regard to the name Salathiel in <a href="/luke/3-28.htm">Luke 3:28</a>. Zerubbabel is elsewhere invariably described as <span class="accented">son</span> of Salathiel, or Shealtiel; but as the genealogy of St. Luke gives the <span class="accented">natural</span> descent of Salathiel as from Neri, so does our genealogy in this one place give us the natural descent of Zerubbabel as from Pedaiah, one of Salathiel's brothers; while all other passages (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>; <a href="/haggai/1-12.htm">Haggai 1:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a>; <a href="/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>)give us that for which the genealogical table is chiefly designed, viz. the matter of <span class="accented">succession</span>, according to which Zerubbabel would be-shown as <span class="accented">son</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> link of succession, following on Shealtiel. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Meshullam</span>.

The word, though evidently a feminine form, is found for the name of a man, chief of the Izarhites (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-18.htm">1 Chronicles 23:18</a>), but very possibly by a mere clerical error, as the true form is given in the very next chapter (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-22.htm">1 Chronicles 24:22</a>) for the same character, viz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The kings of the house of David from Solomon till the exile. - Until Josiah the individual kings are mentioned in their order, each with the addition &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;, son of the preceding, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-10.htm">1 Chronicles 3:10-14</a>; the only omission being that of the usurper Athaliah, because she did not belong to the posterity of David. But in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a> four sons of Josiah are mentioned, not "in order to allow of a halt in the long line of David's descendants after Josiah the great reformer" (Berth.), but because with Josiah the regular succession to the throne in the house of David ceased. For the younger son Jehoahaz, who was made king after his father's death by the people, was soon dethroned by Pharaoh-Necho, and led away captive to Egypt; and of the other sons Jehoiakim was set up by Pharaoh, and Zedekiah by Nebuchadnezzar, so that both were only vassals of heathen lords of the land, and the independent kingship of David came properly to an end with the death of Josiah. Johanan, the first-born of the sons of Josiah, is not to be identified with Jehoahaz, whom the people raised to the throne. For, in the first place, it appears from the statement as to the ages of Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-2.htm">2 Chronicles 36:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-5.htm">2 Chronicles 36:5</a>, that Jehoahaz was two years younger than Jehoiakim, and consequently was not the first-born. In <a href="/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a> it is expressly declared that Shallum, the fourth son of Josiah, was king of Judah instead of his father, and was led away into captivity, and never saw his native land again, as history narrates of Jehoahaz. From this it would appear that Shallum took, as king, the name Jehoahaz. Johanan, the first-born, is not met with again in history, either because he died early, or because nothing remarkable could be told of him. Jehoiakim was called Eliakim before he was raised to the throne (<a href="/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24</a>). Zedekiah was at first Mattaniah (<a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>). Zedekiah, on his ascending the throne, was younger than Shallum, and that event occurred eleven years after the accession of Shallum  equals  Jehoahaz. Zedekiah was only twenty-one years old, while Jehoahaz had become king in his twenty-third year. But in our genealogy Zedekiah is introduced after Jehoiakim, and before Shallum, because, on the one hand, Jehoiakim and Zedekiah had occupied the throne for a longer period, each having been eleven years king; and on the other, Zedekiah and Shallum were sons of Hamutal (<a href="/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>), while Jehoiakim was the son of Zebudah (<a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>). According to age, they should have followed each other in this order - Johanan, Jehoiakim, Shallum, and Zedekiah; and in respect to their kingship, Shallum should have stood before Jehoiakim. But in both cases those born of the same mother, Hamutal, would have been separated. To avoid this, apparently, Shallum has been enumerated in the fourth place, along with his full brother Zedekiah. In <a href="/1_chronicles/3-6.htm">1 Chronicles 3:6</a> it is remarkable that a son of Jehoiakim's son Jeconiah is mentioned, named Zedekiah, while the sons of Jeconiah follow only in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/3-18.htm">1 Chronicles 3:18</a>. Jeconiah (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>; shortened Coniah, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Jeremiah 22:28</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>) is called, as kings, in <a href="/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>. and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a>, Jehoiachin, another form of the name, but having the same signification, "Jahve founds or establishes." Zedekiah can only be a son of Jeconiah, for the &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; which is added constantly denotes that the person so called is the son of his predecessor. Many commentators, certainly, were of opinion that Zedekiah was the same person as the brother of Jehoiakim mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a> under the name Zidkijahu, and who is here introduced as son of Jeconiah, because he was the successor of Jeconiah on the throne. For this view support was sought in a reference to <a href="/1_chronicles/3-10.htm">1 Chronicles 3:10</a>., in which all Solomon's successors in the kingship are enumerated in order with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;. But all the kings who succeeded each other from Solomon to Josiah were also, without exception, sons of their predecessors; so that there &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; throughout denotes a proper son, while King Zedekiah, on the contrary, was not the son, but an uncle of Jeconiah (Jehoiachin). We must therefore hold &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; for a literal son of Jeconiah, and that so much the more, because the name &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; differs also from &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, as the name of the king is constantly written in <a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>. and in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-10.htm">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>. But mention is made of this Zedekiah in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16</a> apart from the other sons of Jeconiah (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-17.htm">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/3-18.htm">1 Chronicles 3:18</a>), perhaps because he was not led away captive into exile with the others, but died in Judah before the breaking up of the kingdom. </body></html>
