In the same way, the names of the other kings and dukes are traced in the modern tribes of Arabia. But it is unnecessary to mention any more of these obscure nomads, except to notice that Jobab (1Ch 1:44), one of the kings of Edom, is considered to be Job, and that his seat was in the royal city of Dinahab (Ge 36:32; 1Ch 1:43), identified with O'Daeb, a well-known town in the center of Al Dahna, a great northern desert in the direction of Chaldea and the Euphrates [Forster].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,....

Besides this, the king called Hadad (v. 46f.), and the city &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; (v. 50), are in Genesis Hadar (<a href="/genesis/36-35.htm">Genesis 36:35</a>.) and &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/genesis/36-39.htm">Genesis 36:39</a>). The first of these variations has arisen from a transcriber's error, the other from a different pronunciation of the name. A somewhat more important divergence, however, appears, when in <a href="/genesis/36-39.htm">Genesis 36:39</a> the death of the king last named is not mentioned, because he was still alive in the time of Moses; while in the Chronicle, on the contrary, not only of him also is it added, &#1492;&#1491;&#1491; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;, because at the time of the writing of the Chronicle he had long been dead, but the list of the names of the territories of the phylarchs, which in Genesis follows the introductory formula &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; alum &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, is here connected with the enumeration of the kings by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, "Hadad died, and there were chiefs of Edom." This may mean that, in the view of the chronicler, the reign of the phylarchs took the place of the kingship after the death of the last king, but that interpretation is by no means necessary. The &#1493; consec. may also merely express the succession of thought, only connecting logically the mention of the princes with the enumeration of the kings; or it may signify that, besides the kings, there were also tribal princes who could rule the land and people. The contents of the register which follows require that &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; should be so understood. </body></html>
