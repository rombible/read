LIST OF THE SONS, GRANDSONS, AND OTHER DESCENDANTS OF ABRAHAM. In the first of these verses the new form of the name of Abraham is at once used in place of the old form. And the names of two of his sons are given, <span class="cmt_word">Isaac</span> the son by Sarah, and <span class="cmt_word">Ishmael</span> the son by Hagar, his Egyptian bondwoman. That these stand in the inverse order of their birth and age requires no explanation. The distinct and separate mention of these two sons, apart from all the others, is of course in harmony with <a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12, 13</a>, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called. And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed." Although stated in the first place in the order of importance, and Isaac takes precedence of Ishmael, the name of this latter and of his posterity are treated of first. To note each clear instance of this kind will guard us against inferring, in cases <span class="accented">not</span> clear, anything positive, one way or the other, respecting seniority merely from order. The order either of age or of historic importance may be given in the first instance, to be immediately reversed in favour of the order which shall enable the writer to clear out of his way the less important. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The peoples and races descended from the sons of Noah. - These are enumerated according to the table in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>; but our author has omitted not only the introductory and concluding remarks (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a>, <a href="/genesis/10-32.htm">Genesis 10:32</a>), but also the historical notices of the founding of a kingdom in Babel by Nimrod, and the distribution of the Japhetites and Shemites in their dwelling-places (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-5.htm">Genesis 10:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-9.htm">Genesis 10:9-12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18-20</a>, and <a href="/genesis/10-30.htm">Genesis 10:30</a> and <a href="/genesis/10-31.htm">Genesis 10:31</a>).

Finally, there is wanting in <a href="/1_chronicles/1-17.htm">1 Chronicles 1:17</a> &#1488;&#1512;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; before &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-23.htm">Genesis 10:23</a>, because, as in the case of Noah's sons, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-4.htm">1 Chronicles 1:4</a>, where their relationship is not mentioned, so also in reference to the peoples descended from Shem, the relationship subsisting between the names Uz, Hul, etc., and Aram, is supposed to be already known from Genesis. Other suppositions as to the omission of the words &#1488;&#1512;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; are improbable. That this register of seventy-one persons and tribes, descended from Shem, Ham, and Japhet, has been taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, is placed beyond doubt, by the fact that not only the names of our register exactly correspond with the table in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, with the exception of the few variations above mentioned, but also the plan and form of both registers is quite the same. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-5.htm">1 Chronicles 1:5-9</a> the sections of the register are connected, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-7</a>, by &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;; from <a href="/1_chronicles/1-10.htm">1 Chronicles 1:10</a> onwards by &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, as in <a href="/genesis/10-8.htm">Genesis 10:8</a>; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-17.htm">1 Chronicles 1:17</a>, again, by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>; and in <a href="/1_chronicles/1-18.htm">1 Chronicles 1:18</a> by &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, and <a href="/1_chronicles/1-19.htm">1 Chronicles 1:19</a> by &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;, as in <a href="/genesis/10-24.htm">Genesis 10:24</a> and <a href="/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25</a>. The historical and geographical explanation of the names has been given in the commentary to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>. According to Bertheau, the peoples descended from the sons of Noah amount to seventy, and fourteen of these are enumerated as descendants of Japhet, thirty of Ham, and twenty-six of Shem. These numbers he arrives at by omitting Nimrod, or not enumerating him among the sons of Ham; while, on the contrary, he takes Arphaxad, Shelah, Eber, Peleg, and Joktan, all of which are the names of persons, for names of people, in contradiction to Genesis, according to which the five names indicate persons, viz., the tribal ancestors of the Terahites and Joktanites, peoples descended from Eber by Peleg and Joktan. </body></html>
