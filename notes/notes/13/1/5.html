The “Genealogy” of the Nations<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The table which follows is taken from <a href="/context/genesis/10-2.htm" title="The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras....">Genesis 10:2-29</a>. In the A.V. several variations between Gen. and Chron. occur in the spelling of proper names. In the R.V. the spelling has been made uniform.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The table is geographical rather than ethnological, i.e. neighbouring nations are regarded as having the same descent. The world, as known to the writer, is divided into three zones, of which the Northern is assigned to the Sons of Japheth (<span class="bld">5–7</span>), the Southern to the Sons of Ham (<span class="bld">8–16</span>), and the Central to the Sons of Shem (<span class="bld">17–23</span>). Had the arrangement been according to descent the Semitic Zidonians and the (probably Mongoloid) Hittites would not have been equally described as the offspring of Ham (cp. Sayce, <span class="ital">Higher Criticism and the Monuments</span>, p. 122).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It must be noticed, moreover, that the passage contains a general table with two appendices. The General Table is derived from the so-called “Priestly” narrative (PC) of the Hexateuch, while the appendices have been inserted by a Redactor from an earlier narrative, the “Prophetical” (J) (cp. Driver, <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, p. 13). Thus we get the following scheme:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/1_chronicles/1-5.htm" title="The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras....">1 Chronicles 1:5-9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;PC<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;(General Table of the descendants of Japheth and Ham).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">10–16</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;J<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;(Appendix to the descendants of Ham).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">17</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;PC<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;(General Table of the descendants of Shem).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">18–23</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;J<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;(Appendix to the descendants of Shem).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It must be further noted that though the Priestly source is assigned in its main stock by critics to “the exilic or early post-exilic period,” some elements in it belong to pre-exilic times. This table of the nations in particular agrees with the state of the world as referred to by Ezekiel, and is probably to be assigned to a date anterior to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. (Sayce in Hastings’ <span class="ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, i. 347, suggests that the table is as early as the period of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Egyptian dynasties, when Palestine was under Egyptian suzerainty.)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - B. LIST OF SONS AND GRANDSONS OF JAPHETH. After the mention of Noah's three sons, in the order of their age (though some on slender ground think Ham the youngest), this order, as in <a href="/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>, is reversed; and the compiler, beginning with <span class="cmt_word">Japheth</span>, the youngest, apparently with the view of disposing of what his purpose may not so particularly require, gives the names of seven sons and seven grandsons, viz. three through <span class="cmt_word">Gomar</span>, the eldest son, and four through <span class="cmt_word">Javan</span>, the fourth son. These fourteen names are identical in the Authorized Version with the list of <a href="/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-4</a>. The Septuagint, though not identical in the spelling of the four names <span class="cmt_word">Madai</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Tiras</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Tarshish</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Kittim</span>, shows no material differences in the two places.

At the close of this short enumeration, we have in Genesis the statement, "By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations." It is evident here also that, whether the compiler borrowed from the Book of Genesis itself, or from some common source open to both, his objects are not exactly the same. Time and the present position and condition of that part of his people for which he was writing governed him, and dictated the difference. Accordingly we do not pause here on the colonizings and the fresh seats and habitations of the sons and grandsons of <span class="accented">Japheth.</span> The subject, one of extreme interest, and the threads of it perhaps not so hopelessly lost as is sometimes thought, belongs to the place in Genesis from which the above verse is cited. It may, however, be written here that the rather verbose disquisitions of Joseph Mede are neither altogether unin-retorting nor in some parts of them unlikely. They form Discourses 47, 48, bk. 1.

"And ate continually before him all his life," i.e., ate at the king's table (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7</a>). Moreover a daily ration of food was supplied to him by the king for the maintenance of his retainers, who formed his little court. The &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-30.htm">2 Kings 25:30</a>, upon which Thenius throws suspicion without any reason, refers to Jehoiachin like that in <a href="/2_kings/25-29.htm">2 Kings 25:29</a>; for the historian intended to show how Jehoiachin had fared from the day of his elevation to the end of his life. At the same time, we cannot infer from this with any certainty that Jehoiachin died before Evil-merodach; for the favour shown to him might be continued by Evil-merodach's successor. We cannot make any safe conjecture as to the motives which induced Evil-merodach to pardon Jehoiachin and confer this distinction upon him. The higher ground of this joyful termination of his imprisonment lay in the gracious decree of God, that the seed of David, though severely chastised for its apostasy from the Lord, should not be utterly rejected (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14-15</a>). At the same time, this event was also intended as a comforting sign to the whole of the captive people, that the Lord would one day put an end to their banishment, if they would acknowledge that it was a well-merited punishment for this sins that they had been driven away from before His face, and would turn again to the Lord their God with all their heart.</body></html>
