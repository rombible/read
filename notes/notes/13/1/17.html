The names Assurû, Elamû, Kassû, and Accadû occur together in an old Assyrian list of nations. Êlama, from which the Assyrian and Hebrew names are derived, is Accadian.

In regard to Elam, modern philologers have questioned the correctness of this view. It is, however, quite possible that at the time when the original of this table of nations was composed, some Semitic tribes were known to have effected a settlement in Elam, just as kindred tribes occupied Babylonia and Assyria.<p>The fourteen sons of Japheth and the thirty sons of Ham, and the twenty-six sons of Shem, make a total of seventy eponyms of nations. The number seventy is probably not accidental. Comp. the seventy elders (<a href="/numbers/11-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.">Numbers 11:16</a>); the seventy members of the Sanhedrin; and even the seventy disciples of Christ (<a href="/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>). The seventy nations of the world are often mentioned in the Talmud. Ezekiel’s prophecy concerning Tyre, and the peoples that had commerce with her (Ezekiel 27), is a valuable illustration of the table.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_chronicles/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_chronicles/1-17.htm" title="The sons of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram, and Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Meshech....">1 Chronicles 1:17-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">The sons of Shem — </span>Either the name of sons is so taken here as to include grandsons, or <span class="ital">the children of Aram </span>are understood before Uz, out of <a href="/genesis/10-23.htm" title="And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.">Genesis 10:23</a>, where they are expressed. <span class="ital">Arphaxad begat — </span>Either immediately, or mediately by his son Canaan, who is expressed <a href="/luke/3-35.htm" title="Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala,">Luke 3:35</a>. <span class="ital">Divided — </span>In their languages and habitations.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-27 This chapter, and many that follow, repeat the genealogies, or lists of fathers and children in the Bible history, and put them together, with many added. When compared with other places, there are some differences found; yet we must not therefore stumble at the word, but bless God that the things necessary to salvation are plain enough. The original of the Jewish nation is here traced from the first man that God created, and is thereby distinguished from the obscure, fabulous, and absurd origins assigned to other nations. But the nations now are all so mingled with one another, that no one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of these fountains. Only this we are sure of, that God has created of one blood all nations of men; they are all descended from one Adam, one Noah. Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us?

THE LIST OF SHEM'S DESCENDANTS TO ABRAM. This list is broken in two; it pauses a moment exactly halfway to Abram, at the name <span class="cmt_word">Peleg</span>, to mention Peleg's brother <span class="cmt_word">Joktan</span> and Joktan's thirteen sons. Then, repeating the first five names of lineal descent, and picking up the thread at Peleg, the list gives the remaining five to Abram. In the first half of this list, we have apparently the names of nine sons of Shem, but, as Genesis explains, really the names of five sons, and through Aram, the last of them, the names of four grandsons. Another grandson, through Arphaxad the third son, follows, and through this grandson two consecutive lineal descents bring us, in the name Peleg, half-way to Abram. It is here the lineal table pauses to give Joktan and his thirteen sons. The names then in this portion of the list are twenty-six in number. In the Authorized Version they correspond with those in Genesis, except that <span class="cmt_word">Meschech</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>) here is called Mash (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) there; <span class="cmt_word">Shelah</span> here is spelled Salah there; and <span class="cmt_word">Ebal</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) here is written Obal (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) there. The difference between the Hebrew texts justifies the first and last of these variations in the Authorized Version, but in all other respects those texts are in entire accord with one another, for this paragraph. The Septuagint gives very little of this portion of the list. It corresponds, whether with the Hebrew or the Authorized Version, only as far as to the name Arphaxad, after which it carries down the line at once to Abram by the remaining eight names as given in our twenty-fourth to twenty-seventh verses. Nor is it in agreement with its own version in Genesis, which has points of important variation with the Hebrew text also. It is then at this break of the list that, after the names of Joktan's sons, we have in Genesis these words, "And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lauds, after their nations. These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the Flood." Upon this follows the account of Babel, in nine long verses, and then a chronological summary is furnished in lineal descent <span class="accented">only</span> from Shem to Abram. It is with the names in this chronological summary that those in this second part of our list (vers. 24-27) are found to agree. But any attempt at reproduction of the chronology found in Genesis is again absent here. At this point a significant stage of these genealogies is reached. The ever-broadening stream of population now narrows again. Two thousand years have flown by, then Abraham appears on the stream and tide of human life. Of that long period the life of Adam himself spanned nearly the half. So far we learn without partiality of all his descendants in common. But henceforth, the real, the distinct purpose of the genealogy becomes apparent, in that the line of the descendants of Abraham, and that by one family, alone is maintained, and proves to be a purpose leading by one long straight line to Christ himself. With Abraham "the covenant of innoceney," long forfeited in Adam, is superseded by the everlasting "covenant of grace," and we lose sight in some measure of Adam, the "common father of our flesh," to think of a happier parentage found in Abraham, the "common father of the faithful." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The peoples and races descended from the sons of Noah. - These are enumerated according to the table in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>; but our author has omitted not only the introductory and concluding remarks (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a>, <a href="/genesis/10-32.htm">Genesis 10:32</a>), but also the historical notices of the founding of a kingdom in Babel by Nimrod, and the distribution of the Japhetites and Shemites in their dwelling-places (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-5.htm">Genesis 10:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-9.htm">Genesis 10:9-12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18-20</a>, and <a href="/genesis/10-30.htm">Genesis 10:30</a> and <a href="/genesis/10-31.htm">Genesis 10:31</a>).

Finally, there is wanting in <a href="/1_chronicles/1-17.htm">1 Chronicles 1:17</a> &#1488;&#1512;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; before &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-23.htm">Genesis 10:23</a>, because, as in the case of Noah's sons, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-4.htm">1 Chronicles 1:4</a>, where their relationship is not mentioned, so also in reference to the peoples descended from Shem, the relationship subsisting between the names Uz, Hul, etc., and Aram, is supposed to be already known from Genesis. Other suppositions as to the omission of the words &#1488;&#1512;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; are improbable. That this register of seventy-one persons and tribes, descended from Shem, Ham, and Japhet, has been taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, is placed beyond doubt, by the fact that not only the names of our register exactly correspond with the table in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, with the exception of the few variations above mentioned, but also the plan and form of both registers is quite the same. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-5.htm">1 Chronicles 1:5-9</a> the sections of the register are connected, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-7</a>, by &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;; from <a href="/1_chronicles/1-10.htm">1 Chronicles 1:10</a> onwards by &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, as in <a href="/genesis/10-8.htm">Genesis 10:8</a>; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-17.htm">1 Chronicles 1:17</a>, again, by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>; and in <a href="/1_chronicles/1-18.htm">1 Chronicles 1:18</a> by &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, and <a href="/1_chronicles/1-19.htm">1 Chronicles 1:19</a> by &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;, as in <a href="/genesis/10-24.htm">Genesis 10:24</a> and <a href="/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25</a>. The historical and geographical explanation of the names has been given in the commentary to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>. According to Bertheau, the peoples descended from the sons of Noah amount to seventy, and fourteen of these are enumerated as descendants of Japhet, thirty of Ham, and twenty-six of Shem. These numbers he arrives at by omitting Nimrod, or not enumerating him among the sons of Ham; while, on the contrary, he takes Arphaxad, Shelah, Eber, Peleg, and Joktan, all of which are the names of persons, for names of people, in contradiction to Genesis, according to which the five names indicate persons, viz., the tribal ancestors of the Terahites and Joktanites, peoples descended from Eber by Peleg and Joktan. </body></html>
