Finally, there is wanting in <a href="/1_chronicles/1-17.htm">1 Chronicles 1:17</a> &#1488;&#1512;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; before &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-23.htm">Genesis 10:23</a>, because, as in the case of Noah's sons, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-4.htm">1 Chronicles 1:4</a>, where their relationship is not mentioned, so also in reference to the peoples descended from Shem, the relationship subsisting between the names Uz, Hul, etc., and Aram, is supposed to be already known from Genesis. Other suppositions as to the omission of the words &#1488;&#1512;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; are improbable. That this register of seventy-one persons and tribes, descended from Shem, Ham, and Japhet, has been taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, is placed beyond doubt, by the fact that not only the names of our register exactly correspond with the table in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, with the exception of the few variations above mentioned, but also the plan and form of both registers is quite the same. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-5.htm">1 Chronicles 1:5-9</a> the sections of the register are connected, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-7</a>, by &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;; from <a href="/1_chronicles/1-10.htm">1 Chronicles 1:10</a> onwards by &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, as in <a href="/genesis/10-8.htm">Genesis 10:8</a>; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-17.htm">1 Chronicles 1:17</a>, again, by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>; and in <a href="/1_chronicles/1-18.htm">1 Chronicles 1:18</a> by &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, and <a href="/1_chronicles/1-19.htm">1 Chronicles 1:19</a> by &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;, as in <a href="/genesis/10-24.htm">Genesis 10:24</a> and <a href="/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25</a>. The historical and geographical explanation of the names has been given in the commentary to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>. According to Bertheau, the peoples descended from the sons of Noah amount to seventy, and fourteen of these are enumerated as descendants of Japhet, thirty of Ham, and twenty-six of Shem. These numbers he arrives at by omitting Nimrod, or not enumerating him among the sons of Ham; while, on the contrary, he takes Arphaxad, Shelah, Eber, Peleg, and Joktan, all of which are the names of persons, for names of people, in contradiction to Genesis, according to which the five names indicate persons, viz., the tribal ancestors of the Terahites and Joktanites, peoples descended from Eber by Peleg and Joktan. </body></html>
