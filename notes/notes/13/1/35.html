In <a href="/1_chronicles/1-36.htm" title="The sons of Eliphaz; Teman, and Omar, Zephi, and Gatam, Kenaz, and Timna, and Amalek.">1Chronicles 1:36</a> the name of Timna occurs under the general heading, “Sons of Eliphaz.” According to <a href="/genesis/36-12.htm" title="And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.">Genesis 36:12</a>, Timna was a secondary wife of Eliphaz, and mother of Amalek. Strange as this difference may at first sight appear, it is in fact absolutely unimportant. The writer’s intention being simply to enumerate the principal branches of the sons of Eliphaz, the statement of the special relations between the different clans might be omitted here, as fairly and naturally as the relations between Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth are left unnoticed in <a href="/1_chronicles/1-4.htm" title="Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.">1Chronicles 1:4</a>. Comp. also <a href="/1_chronicles/1-17.htm" title="The sons of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram, and Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Meshech.">1Chronicles 1:17</a>, where Uz, Hul, &c, are apparently co-ordinated with Aram, although <a href="/genesis/10-23.htm" title="And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.">Genesis 10:23</a> expressly calls them “sons of Aram.” The Vatican MS. of the LXX. has our text; the Alexandrine MS. follows that of <a href="/genesis/36-12.htm" title="And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.">Genesis 36:12</a>. It is at least curious that if Timna-Amalek be excluded from account, the sons of Esau are twelve in number. The fact is obscured in the compressed statement of the chronicler; but it becomes evident by reference to <a href="/context/genesis/36-11.htm" title="And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.">Genesis 36:11-14</a>, where five sons are reckoned to Eliphaz (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-11.htm" title="And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,">1Chronicles 1:11</a>), four to Reuel (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-13.htm" title="And Canaan begat Zidon his firstborn, and Heth,">1Chronicles 1:13</a>), and three to Esau’s wife Aholibamah (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-14.htm" title="The Jebusite also, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,">1Chronicles 1:14</a>), viz.: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. Although <a href="/1_chronicles/1-12.htm" title="And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (of whom came the Philistines,) and Caphthorim.">1Chronicles 1:12</a> of that passage reckons Amalek with the sons of Adah, mother of Eliphaz, it distinctly separates Timna-Amalek from the sons of Eliphaz. It would seem that Amalek was known to be but remotely connected with the pure Edomite stocks. For the or-fanisation of a people in twelve tribes, &c., comp.

From this Bertheau wrongly concludes that the chronicler probably did not find these names in his copy of the Pentateuch. The reason of the omission is rather this, that in Genesis the great-grandchildren are not themselves mentioned, but only the tribes descended from the grandchildren, while the chronicler wished to enumerate only the sons and grandsons.
