The best explanation is, that the writer has in his mind rather the tribes descended from Eliphaz than his actual children, and as there was a place, Timna, inhabited by his "dukes" (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-51.htm">1 Chronicles 1:51</a>; compare <a href="/genesis/35-40.htm">Genesis 35:40</a>), he puts the race which lived there among his "sons." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_chronicles/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37.

In the same way, the names of the other kings and dukes are traced in the modern tribes of Arabia. But it is unnecessary to mention any more of these obscure nomads, except to notice that Jobab (1Ch 1:44), one of the kings of Edom, is considered to be Job, and that his seat was in the royal city of Dinahab (Ge 36:32; 1Ch 1:43), identified with O'Daeb, a well-known town in the center of Al Dahna, a great northern desert in the direction of Chaldea and the Euphrates [Forster].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_chronicles/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The sons of Esau,....

From this Bertheau wrongly concludes that the chronicler probably did not find these names in his copy of the Pentateuch. The reason of the omission is rather this, that in Genesis the great-grandchildren are not themselves mentioned, but only the tribes descended from the grandchildren, while the chronicler wished to enumerate only the sons and grandsons. Keturah is called &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473; after <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-6.htm">Genesis 25:6</a>, where Keturah and Hagar are so named.</body></html>
