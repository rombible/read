When compared with other places, there are some differences found; yet we must not therefore stumble at the word, but bless God that the things necessary to salvation are plain enough. The original of the Jewish nation is here traced from the first man that God created, and is thereby distinguished from the obscure, fabulous, and absurd origins assigned to other nations. But the nations now are all so mingled with one another, that no one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of one nation, nor the greatest part of any, is descended entirely from any of these fountains. Only this we are sure of, that God has created of one blood all nations of men; they are all descended from one Adam, one Noah. Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us?

Either Nimrod represents the pre-Semitic inhabitants who were perhaps Hamitic, or Cush the father of Nimrod is wrongly identified with Cush son of Ham. The latter supposition is more probable, and Cush may stand for the “Kasi” who gave a dynasty to Babylonia which lasted (it is said) from b.c. 1806 to 1230 (Sayce, <span class="ital">Higher Criticism</span> p. 148).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">began to be mighty upon the earth</span>] Cp. <a href="/context/genesis/10-9.htm" title="He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: why it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD....">Genesis 10:9-12</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The Septuagint supplies the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>.

Up to that point the names in this book and Genesis are in agreement in the Septuagint Version.
