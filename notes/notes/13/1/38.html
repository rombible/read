LIST OF DESCENDANTS OF SEIR. These verses contain the names of seven sons of <span class="cmt_word">Seir</span> and one daughter, and of grandsons through every one of the seven sons, viz. two through <span class="cmt_word">Lotan</span> the first, five through <span class="cmt_word">Shobal</span> the second, two through <span class="cmt_word">Zibeon</span> the third, one through <span class="cmt_word">Anah</span> the fourth, four through <span class="cmt_word">Dishon</span> the fifth, three through <span class="cmt_word">Ezar</span> the sixth, and two through <span class="cmt_word">Dishan</span> the seventh, - twenty-six names in all, or, including the one daughter, who is introduced as <span class="cmt_word">Lotan's</span> <span class="cmt_word">sister</span>, twenty-seven. The first question which arises is, who Seir was, now first mentioned here. He is called in <a href="/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a> "Seir the Horite," and the only previous mention of the name Seir in that chapter is in ver. 8, "Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom;" while we read in <a href="/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a>, "The Horites in mount Self;" in <a href="/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>, "To the land of Seir, the country of Edom." For anything we know of the person Self, then, we are confined to these two notices - that in <a href="/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a> and the one in our text. The name signifies "rough;" and whether Seir. the person, took the name from Seir, the place (a mountain district, reaching from the Dead Sea to the Elanitic Gulf), or <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, it would seem plain that the proper name belonged to the head of the tribe, which had become located there, and was, of course, not in the line of Abraham. This tribe, called Horites - Hori being the name of Seir's eldest grandson - or Troglodytes, acquired their name from hollowing out dwellings in the rocks, as at Petra. They were visited evidently by Esau: he married at least one of his wives from them; and his descendants, the Edomites, in due time dispossessed and superseded them (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>). No doubt some were left behind, and contentedly submitted to the Edomites and became mingled with them. These considerations put together account for the introduction here of the names of Seir and his twenty-seven descendants, while the particulars of their genealogy, so far as here given, would lie easily to hand. The sons of Seir are called in Genesis also "dukes" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>), a word answered to by the later "sheikhs;" and they are called "dukes of the Horites," or "the dukes of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Self." The twenty-six or twenty-seven names under notice agree in the Authorized Version entirely with those in <a href="/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20-27</a>, except that for <span class="cmt_word">Homam, Allan, Shephi, Amram,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Jakan</span> here, we have Hemam, Alvan, Shepho, Hemdan, and Akau there. Also in the Hebrew the texts agree in the two places as regards these names, with the same exceptions. But in the Septuagint the names differ much more in the two places. Thus for <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x3c3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> (or <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>),<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3a9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> here, we have <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1fec;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3a9;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span> there. When the name of Anah is reached in Genesis, it is added, "This was that Anah that found the mules [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, more probably 'hot springs,' as the finder of which Anah is supposed to have been called <span class="accented">Beeri</span>] in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon, his father." And again, when Dishon is mentioned as the son of Anah, there is added, "And Aholi-bamah the daughter of Anah." Note is made of her name, no doubt, for the same kind of reason as Timna is mentioned above. Aholibamah (<span class="accented">i.q.</span> "Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite," <a href="/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34</a>) enjoys notice inasmuch as she became the wife of Esau; and Timna, as she became the concubine of Esau's son Eliphaz, and thereby the mother of Amalek. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The names of the generations (&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;) of Ishmael (Hebr.

In <a href="/1_chronicles/1-32.htm">1 Chronicles 1:32</a>. also, the names of the thirteen descendants of Abraham by Keturah, six sons and seven grandsons, agree with <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-1.htm">Genesis 25:1-4</a> (see commentary on that passage); only the tribes mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>, which were descended from Dedan the grandson of Keturah, are omitted. From this Bertheau wrongly concludes that the chronicler probably did not find these names in his copy of the Pentateuch. The reason of the omission is rather this, that in Genesis the great-grandchildren are not themselves mentioned, but only the tribes descended from the grandchildren, while the chronicler wished to enumerate only the sons and grandsons. Keturah is called &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473; after <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-6.htm">Genesis 25:6</a>, where Keturah and Hagar are so named.</body></html>
