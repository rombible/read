To be under the almighty protection of God our Saviour; to enjoy his favour as the smile of a loving Father, or as the cheering beams of the sun; while he mercifully forgives our sins, supplies our wants, consoles the heart, and prepares us by his grace for eternal glory; these things form the substance of this blessing, and the sum total of all blessings. In so rich a list of mercies worldly joys are not worthy to be mentioned. Here is a form of prayer. The name Jehovah is three times repeated. The Jews think there is some mystery; and we know what it is, the New Testament having explained it. There we are directed to expect the blessing from the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of the Father, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, 2Co 13:14; each of which Persons is Jehovah, and yet they are not three Lords, but one Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The priestly blessing (compare Ecclus. 36:17) is appointed as a solemn form to be used by the priests exclusively, and in this function their office as it were culminates (compare <a href="/leviticus/9-22.htm">Leviticus 9:22</a> note). God Himself provides a formula, through which from time to time, as His people by obedience place themselves in true and right relationship to Him, the authorised mediators may pronounce and communicate His special blessing to them. It was a Jewish tradition that this blessing was given at the close of the daily sacrifice.<p>The structure of the blessing is remarkable. It is rhythmical, consists of three distinct parts, and mounts by gradual stages to that peace which forms the last and most consummate gift which God can give His people.<p>From a Christian point of view, and comparing the counterpart benediction of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-14.htm">2 Corinthians 13:14</a>, it is impossible not to see shadowed forth the doctrine of the Holy Trinity (compare <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). And the three several sets of terms correspond fittingly to the office of the Three Persons in Their gracious work for the redemption of man.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-20. when the days of his separation are fulfilled, &c.&#8212;On the accomplishment of a limited vow of Nazaritism, Nazarites might cut their hair wherever they happened to be (Ac 18:18); but the hair was to be carefully kept and brought to the door of the sanctuary. Then after the presentation of sin offerings and burnt offerings, it was put under the vessel in which the peace offerings were boiled; and the priest, taking the shoulder (Le 7:32), when boiled, and a cake and wafer of the meat offering, put them on the hands of the Nazarites to wave before the Lord, as a token of thanksgiving, and thus released them from their vow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord spake unto Moses,.... At the same time perhaps that the above law was given concerning the Nazarites; though why this should follow upon that, and what connection there is between the one and the other, it is not easy to say; the Nazarites were holy persons, and so were the priests; and therefore, according to Aben Ezra and others, the law of the one is joined to the law of the other: <p>saying; as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord spake unto Moses.</span> It is a matter of mere conjecture at what point of time this command was given.
