To be under the almighty protection of God our Saviour; to enjoy his favour as the smile of a loving Father, or as the cheering beams of the sun; while he mercifully forgives our sins, supplies our wants, consoles the heart, and prepares us by his grace for eternal glory; these things form the substance of this blessing, and the sum total of all blessings. In so rich a list of mercies worldly joys are not worthy to be mentioned. Here is a form of prayer. The name Jehovah is three times repeated. The Jews think there is some mystery; and we know what it is, the New Testament having explained it. There we are directed to expect the blessing from the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of the Father, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, 2Co 13:14; each of which Persons is Jehovah, and yet they are not three Lords, but one Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Put my name upon the children of Israel - i. e. pronounce My Sacred Name over them in blessing them.

The Form of Blessing the People.<p>23-27. Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the congregation of Israel, &c.&#8212;This passage records the solemn benediction which God appointed for dismissing the people at the close of the daily service. The repetition of the name "Lord" or "Jehovah" three times, expresses the great mystery of the Godhead&#8212;three persons, and yet one God. The expressions in the separate clauses correspond to the respective offices of the Father, to "bless and keep us"; of the Son, to be "gracious to us"; and of the Holy Ghost, to "give us peace." And because the benediction, though pronounced by the lips of a fellow man, derived its virtue, not from the priest but from God, the encouraging assurance was added, "I the Lord will bless them."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Shall call them by my name, shall recommend them to me as my own people, and bless them and pray unto me for them as such; which is a powerful argument to prevail with God for them, and therefore hath been oft used by the prophets interceding for them, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/jeremiah/14-9.htm" title="Why should you be as a man astonished, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet you, O LORD, are in the middle of us, and we are called by your name; leave us not.">Jeremiah 14:9</a> <a href="/daniel/9-18.htm" title="O my God, incline your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by your name: for we do not present our supplications before you for our righteousnesses, but for your great mercies.">Daniel 9:18</a>,19</span>: compare <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/12-22.htm" title="For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it has pleased the LORD to make you his people.">1 Samuel 12:22</a></span>.

Call them by his name, the people of the Lord; call upon the name of the Lord to bless them, and pronounce the blessing on them in the name of the Lord, in or by the name Jehovah, as Jarchi, three times used in this form of blessing: <p>and I will bless them; really and truly bless them bless them with blessings indeed; with all sorts of blessings temporal and spiritual; with solid and substantial ones; and such are blessed, and will remain so, their blessings are irrevocable and irreversible; and unless the Lord blesses, in vain do the priests bless, or any of his ministers pronounce a blessing; theirs lies in words and wishes, his in real facts; they can only pray and wish for the blessing, it is he only that can give it, and can ratify and confirm what they declare and pronounce, according to his revealed word. Some refer the relative "them" to the priests, as if the sense was, I will bless the priests that bless Israel, for God will bless them that bless his people; but Aben Ezra thinks it belongs both to Israel, and to the priests, that God would confirm and establish the blessing of the priests pronounced on Israel, and bless the priests also, who needed the divine blessing as well as the people, and being found in the way of their duty, might expect it: the Targum of Jonathan is,"I will bless them in my Word;''his essential Word, Christ, in whom his chosen ones are blessed with all spiritual blessings, and who is the promised seed, in whom all nations of the earth shall be blessed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they shall put my <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.</span><p>(m) They shall pray in my Name for them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall put my name upon the children of Israel</span>. The "name of God is uniformly treated in Scripture as something very different from a mere arrangement of letters or an arbitrary vocal sound. All nations have bad names for the Supreme Being, but there was nothing sacred about them, except from association. <span class="accented">The</span> name of God was not of man, nor from man, but of his own direct revelation (<a href="/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>), and was therefore of an unspeakable sanctity (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>). Like the "word" of God, it cannot be dissociated from God himself. It is in some sense an extension outwards, into the sphere of the created and sensible, of the ineffable virtues of the Godhead itself. It stands in a real, though un-assignable, relation to infinite goodness and power, and therefore it comes fraught with untold blessing (or perchance cursing) to those on whom it lights. Hence, to put the name of God - the covenant name - upon the people had a real meaning. No one could do it except by his express direction; and when it was so done there was an invisible reality answering to the audible form; with the name pronounced in blessing came the blessing itself, came the special providence and presence of God, to abide upon such at least as were worthy of it. It is a fact, the significance of which cannot be denied, that the name which was commanded to be put upon the people was lost, and irrecoverably lost, by the later Jews. Out of an exaggerated   dread of possible profanation, they first disobeyed the command by substituting Adonai for that name outside the sanctuary; and finally, after the death of Simeon the Just, the priests ceased to pronounce that name at all, and therefore lost the tradition by which the pronunciation was fixed. Our method of spelling and pronouncing the name as Jehovah is merely conventional, and almost certainly incorrect. It would seem to be the more devout opinion that the name itself, as revealed by God and uttered by many generations of priests, was forfeited (like Paradise), was withdrawn, and ought not to be inquired after. <span class="cmt_word">And I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">bless them.</span> Here is the precise truth of all effectual benediction: <span class="accented">they</span> shall put my name;...  <span class="accented">I</span> will bless. The outward form was ministered by the priests, the inward reality was of God and from God alone. It is observable that the form of blessing is expressed in the singular; either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because all Israel was regarded as one, even as the first-born son of God (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22, 23</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>), or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because all real blessing must in truth be individual - a nation can only be blessed in its several members. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"This is the law of the Nazarite, who vowed his sacrificial gifts to the Lord on the ground of his consecration," i.e., who offered his sacrifice in accordance with the state of a Nazarite into which he had entered. For the sacrifices mentioned in <a href="/numbers/6-14.htm">Numbers 6:14</a>. were not the object of a special vow, but contained in the vow of the Nazarite, and therefore already vowed (Knobel). "Beside what his hand grasps," i.e., what he is otherwise able to perform (<a href="/leviticus/5-11.htm">Leviticus 5:11</a>), "according to the measure of his vow, which he vowed, so must he do according to the law of his consecration," i.e., he had to offer the sacrifices previously mentioned on the ground of his consecration vow. Beyond that he was free to vow anything else according to his ability, to present other sacrificial gifts to the Lord for His sanctuary and His servants, which did not necessarily belong to the vow of the Nazarite, but were frequently added. From this the custom afterwards grew up, that when poor persons took the Nazarite's vow upon them, those who were better off defrayed the expenses of the sacrifices (<a href="/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>; Josephus, Ant. xix. 6, 1; Mishnah Nasir, ii. 5ff.). </body></html>
