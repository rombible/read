Some were appointed of God, before their birth, to be Nazarites all their days, as Samson and John the Baptist. But, in general, it was a vow of separation from the world and devotedness to the services of religion, for a limited time, and under certain rules, which any person might make if they pleased. A Nazarite is spoken of as well known; but his obligation is brought to a greater certainty than before. That the fancies of superstitious men might not multiply the restraints endlessly, God gives them rules. They must not drink wine or strong drink, nor eat grapes. Those who separate themselves to God, must not gratify the desires of the body, but keep it under. Let all Christians be very moderate in the use of wine and strong drink; for if the love of these once gets the mastery of a man, he becomes an easy prey to Satan. The Nazarites were to eat nothing that came of the vine; this may teach the utmost care to avoid sin, and all that borders upon it, and leads to it, or may be a temptation to us. They must not cut their hair. They must neither poll their heads, nor shave their beards; this was the mark of Samson being a Nazarite. This signified neglect of the body, and of the ease and ornament of it. Those who separate themselves to God, must keep their consciences pure from dead works, and not touch unclean things. All the days of their separation they must be holy to the Lord. This was the meaning of those outward observances, and without this they were of no account. No penalty or sacrifice was appointed for those who wilfully broke their vow of being Nazarites; they must answer another day for such profane trifling with the Lord their God; but those were to be relieved who did not sin wilfully. There is nothing in Scripture that bears the least resemblance to the religious orders of the church of Rome, except these Nazarites. But mark the difference, or rather how completely opposed! The religious of that church are forbidden to marry; but no such restriction is laid upon the Nazarites. They are commanded to abstain from meats; but the Nazarites might eat any food allowed other Israelites. They are not generally forbidden wine, not even on their fasting days; but the Nazarites might not have wine at any time. Their vow is lasting, even to the end of their lives; the Nazarites' vow was only for a limited time, at their own will; and in certain cases not unless allowed by husbands or parents. Such a thorough difference there is between rules of man's invention and those directed in Scripture, Let us not forget that the Lord Jesus is not only our Surety, but also our example. For his sake we must renounce worldly pleasures, abstain from fleshy lusts, be separate from sinners, make open profession of our faith, moderate natural affections, be spiritually-minded, and devoted to God's service, and desirous to be an example all around us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beside that that his hand shall get - The Nazarite, in addition to the offerings prescribed above, was to present free-will offerings according to his possessions or means. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-20. when the days of his separation are fulfilled, &c.&#8212;On the accomplishment of a limited vow of Nazaritism, Nazarites might cut their hair wherever they happened to be (Ac 18:18); but the hair was to be carefully kept and brought to the door of the sanctuary. Then after the presentation of sin offerings and burnt offerings, it was put under the vessel in which the peace offerings were boiled; and the priest, taking the shoulder (Le 7:32), when boiled, and a cake and wafer of the meat offering, put them on the hands of the Nazarites to wave before the Lord, as a token of thanksgiving, and thus released them from their vow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Besides that that his hand shall get, </span> i.e. besides what he shall voluntarily promise and give according to his ability. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This is the law of the Nazarite, who hath vowed,....

In the thrice repeated name â€˜Jehovahâ€™ the writer did not, of course, contemplate the doctrine of the three Persons in the Godhead. But the words may nevertheless be regarded as an unconscious foreshadowing of the fuller Christian revelation. The form of the prayer is due to the parallelism which distinguishes Hebrew poetry. The words, which find an echo in <a href="/psalms/67-1.htm" title="God be merciful to us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine on us; Selah.">Psalm 67:1</a>, may be literally rendered:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jehovah bless thee,&emsp;&emsp;and guard thee.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jehovah light up His face towards thee,&emsp;&emsp;and favour thee.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jehovah lift up His face towards thee,&emsp;&emsp;and appoint for thee welfare.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">put my name upon</span>] This denotes that they are Jehovahâ€™s possession, and stand in the closest relationship with Him.

"On the day of the completion of the days of his consecration," i.e., on the day when the time of consecration expired, the Nazarite was to bring to the tabernacle, or offer as his gifts to the Lord, a sheep of a year old as a burnt-offering, and an ewe of a year old as a sin-offering; the latter as an expiation for the sins committed involuntarily during the period of consecration, the former as an embodiment of that surrender of himself, body and soul, to the Lord, upon which every act of worship should rest. In addition to this he was to bring a ram without blemish as a peace-offering, together with a basket of unleavened cakes and wafers baked, which were required, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>, for every praise-offering, "and their meat and drink-offerings," i.e., the gifts of meal, oil, and wine, which belonged, according to <a href="/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>., to the burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.</body></html>
