But they distrusted God's power and promise. How much we stand in our own light by our unbelief! At length the messengers returned; but the greater part discouraged the people from going forward to Canaan. Justly are the Israelites left to this temptation, for putting confidence in the judgment of men, when they had the word of God to trust in. Though they had found the land as good as God had said, yet they would not believe it to be as sure as he had said, but despaired of having it, though Eternal Truth had engaged it to them. This was the representation of the evil spies. Caleb, however, encouraged them to go forward, though seconded by Joshua only. He does not say, Let us go up and conquer it; but, Let us go and possess it. Difficulties that are in the way of salvation, dwindle and vanish before a lively, active faith in the power and promise of God. All things are possible, if they are promised, to him that believes; but carnal sense and carnal professors are not to be trusted. Unbelief overlooks the promises and power of God, magnifies every danger and difficulty, and fills the heart with discouragement. May the Lord help us to believe! we shall then find all things possible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Amalekites - See <a href="/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a> note.<p>The Canaanites - i. e. those of the Phoenician race: the word is here used in its narrow sense: compare <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15-18</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

But the existence of numerous walled and fortified towns was (apart from Divine aid) an almost insuperable obstacle to a people wholly ignorant of artillery or of siege operations; and the presence of giants was exceedingly terrifying in an age when battles were a series of personal encounters (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-11.htm">1 Samuel 17:11, 24</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In forty days the spies returned to the camp at Kadesh (see at <a href="/numbers/16-6.htm">Numbers 16:6</a>), and reported the great fertility of the land ("it floweth with milk and honey," see at <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), pointing, at the same time, to the fruit they had brought with them; "nevertheless," they added (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1508;&#1505;, "only that"), "the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are fortified, very large: and, moreover, we saw the children of Anak there."
