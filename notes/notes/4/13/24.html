The valley was, in all likelihood, originally named after one of the three chiefs who were confederate with Abraham <a href="/genesis/14-24.htm">Genesis 14:24</a>; but, as often came to pass, the Israelites, wittingly or unwittingly, took up in a new and significant sense the name which they found; and to them the valley thus became the Valley of the Cluster. Bunches of grapes are found in Palestine of many pounds weight. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. they came unto the brook of Eshcol&#8212;that is, "the torrent of the cluster." Its location was a little to the southwest of Hebron. The valley and its sloping hills are still covered with vineyards, the character of whose fruit corresponds to its ancient celebrity.<p>and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes&#8212;The grapes reared in this locality are still as magnificent as formerly&#8212;they are said by one to be equal in size to prunes, and compared by another to a man's thumb. One cluster sometimes weighs ten or twelve pounds. The mode of carrying the cluster cut down by the spies, though not necessary from its weight, was evidently adopted to preserve it entire as a specimen of the productions of the promised land; and the impression made by the sight of it would be all the greater because the Israelites were familiar only with the scanty vines and small grapes of Egypt.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The place was called the brook of Eshcol,.... That is, in later times: <p>because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence; the word "Eschol" signifying a "cluster"; and this cluster was typical of Christ, who may be compared to this, as he is to a cluster of camphire, Sol 1:14; there being in him a "cluster" of all perfections, of all the perfections of deity, the whole fulness of the Godhead dwelling bodily in him; and of all human perfections, he being in all things like unto his people, excepting sin; and there being also a cluster of all the graces and gifts of the Spirit without measure in him, as man; and of all the blessings of grace for his people, as Mediator; and of all the exceeding great and precious promises of the covenant of grace. The "staff", on which this was carried, may denote the ministration of the Gospel, which may seem mean and despicable in itself, but is the means of carrying the name of Christ, and the things of Christ, about in the world; see <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; and the "two" men which bore it, may signify the prophets of the Old Testament, and the ministers of the New, who both agree and join together in setting forth the person, offices, and grace of Christ. Moreover, this cluster may be an emblem of the Spirit of God, and his grace, and of the rich experience the people of God have of it in this present lift, while travellers in the wilderness, as a taste and earnest of the future glory and happiness in the heavenly Canaan. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">Eshcol</span>] ‘a cluster’ (R.V. marg.).

If so it is an admirable instance of the loose way in which etymologies are treated in the Old  Testament: what the place really received was not a new name, but a new signification to the old name; but this appeared all one in the eyes of the sacred writer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>They were to see the land, "what it was," i.e., what was its character, and the people that dwelt in it, whether they were strong, i.e., courageous and brave, or weak, i.e., spiritless and timid, and whether they were little or great, i.e., numerically; (<a href="/numbers/13-19.htm">Numbers 13:19</a>) what the land was, whether good or bad, sc., with regard to climate and cultivation, and whether the towns were camps, i.e., open villages and hamlets, or fortified places; also (<a href="/numbers/13-20.htm">Numbers 13:20</a>) whether the land was fat or lean, i.e., whether it had a fertile soil or not, and whether there were trees in it or not. All this they were to search out courageously (&#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;, to show one's self courageous in any occupation), and to fetch (some) of the fruits of the land, as it was the time of the first-ripe grapes. In Palestine the first grapes ripen as early as August, and sometimes even in July (vid., Robinson, ii. 100, ii. 611), whilst the vintage takes place in September and October. </body></html>
