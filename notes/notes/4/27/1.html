Their believing expectation that the word of the Lord would be performed in due season, and their desire of an interest in the promised inheritance; and the modest, candid manner in which they asked, without secret murmurs or discontents, are a good example. They ask for a possession in the land of Canaan. Herein they discovered, 1. Strong faith in the power and promise of God, concerning the giving of the land of Canaan to Israel. 2. And earnest desire of a place and name in the land of promise, which was a type of heaven. 3. Respect and honour for their father, whose name was dear to them now he was gone. He never had done any thing that might bar his children's claim. It is a comfort to parents when they come to die, if though they have smarted for their own sin, yet they are not conscious of any of those iniquities which God will visit on their children. God himself gives judgment. He takes notice of the affairs, not only of nations, but of private families, and orders them according to his will. The petition is granted. Those who seek an inheritance in the land of promise, shall have what they seek for, and other things shall be added to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Women in Israel had not, up to the present time, enjoyed any distinct right of inheritance. Yet a father, whether sons had been born to him or not, had the power, either before or at his death, to cause part of his estate to pass to a daughter; in which case her husband married into her family rather than she into his, and the children were regarded as of the family from which the estate had come. Thus, Machir, ancestor of Zelophehad, although he had a son Gilead, left also, as is probable, an inheritance to his daughter, the wife of Hezron of the tribe of Judah, by reason of which their descendants, among whom was Jair, were reckoned as belonging to the tribe of Manasseh (<a href="/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21</a> ff). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 27<p>Nu 27:1-11.

But the incident here related is regarded as an historical occurrence in the life of individuals. Its purpose is to introduce the law of inheritance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1–11</span>. <span class="ital">A law on the inheritance of property</span>. The Hebrews always adhered firmly to the principle that landed property must not be alienated from the tribe or family to which it belonged. In early days, inheritance by daughters was not contemplated. If a man died without children, his widow might be married to his brother in order to bear sons who should inherit the property (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/25-5.htm" title="If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without to a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother to her....">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>; cf. <a href="/matthew/22-24.htm" title="Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.">Matthew 22:24</a>). Or if a man wished to sell land, his next-of-kin had the first right of purchase (<a href="/jeremiah/32-8.htm" title="So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, Buy my field, I pray you, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.">Jeremiah 32:8</a>). And the same principle underlies the law of the Jubile (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm" title="And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee to you; and you shall return every man to his possession, and you shall return every man to his family.">Leviticus 25:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-31.htm" title="But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.">Leviticus 25:31</a>). The present law is also based upon the principle, but marks a new departure in the privileges accorded to women.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The daughters of Zelophehad.</span> The genealogy here given agrees with those in <a href="/numbers/26-29.htm">Numbers 26:29-33</a> and in <a href="/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a>.
