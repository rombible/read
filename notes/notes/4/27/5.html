Their believing expectation that the word of the Lord would be performed in due season, and their desire of an interest in the promised inheritance; and the modest, candid manner in which they asked, without secret murmurs or discontents, are a good example. They ask for a possession in the land of Canaan. Herein they discovered, 1. Strong faith in the power and promise of God, concerning the giving of the land of Canaan to Israel. 2. And earnest desire of a place and name in the land of promise, which was a type of heaven. 3. Respect and honour for their father, whose name was dear to them now he was gone. He never had done any thing that might bar his children's claim. It is a comfort to parents when they come to die, if though they have smarted for their own sin, yet they are not conscious of any of those iniquities which God will visit on their children. God himself gives judgment. He takes notice of the affairs, not only of nations, but of private families, and orders them according to his will. The petition is granted. Those who seek an inheritance in the land of promise, shall have what they seek for, and other things shall be added to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give unto us - As representing our father; that so he, through us his representatives, may enjoy a like inheritance with his brethren. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father&#8212;Those young women perceived that the males only in families had been registered in the census. Because there were none in their household, their family was omitted. So they made known their grievance to Moses, and the authorities conjoined with him in administering justice. The case was important; and as the peculiarity of daughters being the sole members of a family would be no infrequent or uncommon occurrence, the law of inheritance, under divine authority, was extended not only to meet all similar cases, but other cases also&#8212;such as when there were no children left by the proprietor, and no brothers to succeed him. A distribution of the promised land was about to be made; and it is interesting to know the legal provision made in these comparatively rare cases for preserving a patrimony from being alienated to another tribe.

For it seems it was too difficult for this court to decide; and it devolving upon Moses, as the president of it, and who only could have recourse to God at all times, he carried it to him and consulted with him about it: this, as the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem say, was one of the four causes that came before Moses the prophet, that he solved according to the mind of the Lord, which he consulted; one was concerning the blasphemer, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a>, the other concerning those defiled by the dead, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-8.htm">Numbers 9:8</a>, the third concerning the sabbath breaker, <a href="/numbers/15-34.htm">Numbers 15:34</a> and the fourth was this; See Gill on <a href="/leviticus/24-12.htm">Leviticus 24:12</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Moses brought their <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> cause before the LORD.</span><p>(b) That is, their matter to be judged, to know what he should determine, as he did all hard matters.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses brought their cause before the Lord.</span> Presumably by going into <span class="cmt_word">the</span> tabernacle with this matter upon his mind, and awaiting the revelation of the Divine will (cf. <a href="/exodus/18-19.htm">Exodus 18:19</a>; <a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Concluding formula with the remark in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-65.htm">Numbers 26:65</a>, that the penal sentence which God had pronounced in <a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29</a> and <a href="/numbers/14-38.htm">Numbers 14:38</a> upon the generation which came out of Egypt, had been completely carried out. </body></html>
