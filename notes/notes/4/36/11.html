God would not have one tribe enriched at the expense of another. Each tribe was to keep to its own inheritance. The daughters of Zelophehad submitted to this appointment. How could they fail to marry well, when God himself directed them? Let the people of God learn how suitable and proper it is, like the daughters of Israel, to be united only to their own people. Ought not every true believer Israel, to be united only to their own people. Ought not every true believer in Jesus, to be very attentive in the near and tender relations of life, to be united only to such as are united to the Lord? All our intentions and inclinations ought to be subjected to the will of God, when that is made known to us, and especially in contracting marriage. Although the word of God allows affection and preference in this important relation, it does not sanction that foolish, ungovernable, and idolatrous passion, which cares not what may be the end; but in defiance of authority, determines upon self-gratification. All such conduct, however disguised, is against common sense, the interests of society, the happiness of the marriage relation, and, what is still more evil, against the religion of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto their father's brothers' sons - Or more generally, "unto the sons of their kinsmen."<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-12. Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord&#8212;The plea appeared just and reasonable; and, accordingly an enactment was made by which the daughters of Zelophehad, while left to the free choice of their husbands, were restricted to marry not only within their own tribe, but within the family of their father's tribe&#8212;that is, one of their cousins. This restriction, however, was imposed only on those who were heiresses. The law was not applicable to daughters in different circumstances (1Ch 23:22)&#8212;for they might marry into another tribe; but if they did so, they were liable to forfeit their patrimonial inheritance, which, on the death of their father or brothers, went to the nearest of the family kinsmen. Here was an instance of progressive legislation (see also Ex 18:27) in Israel, the enactments made being suggested by circumstances. But it is deserving of special notice that those additions to, or modifications of, the law were confined to civil affairs; while the slightest change was inadmissible in the laws relating to worship or the maintenance of religion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is certain whether <span class="ital">brothers</span> or <span class="ital">sons</span> be taken strictly and properly, or more large, as those words are oft used in Scripture. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah,....

It is a curious instance of the inartificial character of the sacred records that these five names, which have not the least interest in themselves, are repeated thrice in this Book, and once in Joshua (<a href="/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a>). It is evident that the case made a deep impression upon the mind of the nation at the time. <span class="cmt_word">Their</span> <span class="cmt_word">father's brothers' sons.</span> The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span> is always translated "father's brother," or "uncle;" and that seems to be its ordinary meaning, although in <a href="/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a> it stands for uncle's son. There is no reason to depart from the customary reading here. No doubt the daughters of Zelophehad acted according to the spirit as well as the letter of the law, and married the nearest male relatives who were open to their choice. The Septuagint  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses declared that what they had affirmed was right (&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;), and then, by command of Jehovah, he told the daughters of Zelophehad that they might marry whoever pleased them (the suffix &#1470;&#1492;&#1501;, attached to &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, for &#1470;&#1492;&#1503;, as in <a href="/exodus/1-21.htm">Exodus 1:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-9.htm">Genesis 31:9</a>, etc.), but that he must belong to the family of their father's tribe, that is to say, must be a Manassite. For (<a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7</a>) the inheritance was not to turn away the Israelites from one tribe to another (not to be transferred from one to another), but every Israelite was to keep to the inheritance of his father's tribe, and no one was to enter upon the possession of another tribe by marrying an heiress belonging to that tribe. This is afterwards extended, in <a href="/numbers/36-8.htm">Numbers 36:8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/36-9.htm">Numbers 36:9</a>, into a general law for every heiress in Israel. </body></html>
