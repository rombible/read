God would not have one tribe enriched at the expense of another. Each tribe was to keep to its own inheritance. The daughters of Zelophehad submitted to this appointment. How could they fail to marry well, when God himself directed them? Let the people of God learn how suitable and proper it is, like the daughters of Israel, to be united only to their own people. Ought not every true believer Israel, to be united only to their own people. Ought not every true believer in Jesus, to be very attentive in the near and tender relations of life, to be united only to such as are united to the Lord? All our intentions and inclinations ought to be subjected to the will of God, when that is made known to us, and especially in contracting marriage. Although the word of God allows affection and preference in this important relation, it does not sanction that foolish, ungovernable, and idolatrous passion, which cares not what may be the end; but in defiance of authority, determines upon self-gratification. All such conduct, however disguised, is against common sense, the interests of society, the happiness of the marriage relation, and, what is still more evil, against the religion of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be taken away - i. e. be permanently taken away. The jubilee year, by not restoring the estate to the tribe to which it originally belonged, would in effect confirm the alienation.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-12. Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord&#8212;The plea appeared just and reasonable; and, accordingly an enactment was made by which the daughters of Zelophehad, while left to the free choice of their husbands, were restricted to marry not only within their own tribe, but within the family of their father's tribe&#8212;that is, one of their cousins. This restriction, however, was imposed only on those who were heiresses. The law was not applicable to daughters in different circumstances (1Ch 23:22)&#8212;for they might marry into another tribe; but if they did so, they were liable to forfeit their patrimonial inheritance, which, on the death of their father or brothers, went to the nearest of the family kinsmen. Here was an instance of progressive legislation (see also Ex 18:27) in Israel, the enactments made being suggested by circumstances. But it is deserving of special notice that those additions to, or modifications of, the law were confined to civil affairs; while the slightest change was inadmissible in the laws relating to worship or the maintenance of religion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe,.... Which shows that this concerns all the tribes of Israel, though yet not fully expressed, as it is afterwards: <p>for everyone of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers; or cleave (a) to a wife in that tribe for marriage; this word is used in the original institution of it, <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> though they were not strictly obliged to marry in their own tribe; and frequently they did intermarry with other tribes, which, had it been unlawful, would not have been done, as it was by kings, and priests, and others; nor was there any danger of an inheritance going into another tribe by a man's marrying into it; wherefore this signifies only, that they were to be careful to keep their inheritances in their tribe; and therefore if any of them had no sons, only daughters, he was to marry them in his own tribe and family, that the inheritance might not remove, as follows(a) "adhaerebunt", Montanus, Vatablus, Junius &amp; Tremellius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every one...  shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.</span> This was to be the general rule which governed all such questions. Every Israelite had his own share in the inheritance of his tribe, and with that he was to be content, and not seek to intrude on other tribes. Accordingly the decision in the case of the daughters of Zelophehad is extended to all similar cases. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The occasion for this law was a representation made to Moses and the princes of the congregation by the heads of the fathers' houses (&#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/6-25.htm">Exodus 6:25</a>, etc.) of the family of Gilead the Manassite, to which Zelophehad (<a href="/numbers/26-33.htm">Numbers 26:33</a>) belonged, to the effect that, by allotting an hereditary possession to the daughters of Zelophehad, the tribe-territory assigned to the Manassites would be diminished if they should marry into another tribe. They founded their appeal upon the command of Jehovah, that the land was to be distributed by lot among the Israelites for an inheritance (<a href="/numbers/36-2.htm">Numbers 36:2</a> compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55-56</a>, and <a href="/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>); and although it is not expressly stated, yet on the ground of the promise of the everlasting possession of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>), and the provision made by the law, that an inheritance was not to be alienated (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-13.htm">Leviticus 25:13</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>.), they understood it as signifying that the portion assigned to each tribe was to continue unchanged to all generations. (The singular pronoun, my Lord, in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/36-2.htm">Numbers 36:2</a>, refers to the speaker, as in <a href="/numbers/32-27.htm">Numbers 32:27</a>.) Now, as the inheritance of their brother, i.e., their tribe-mate Zelophehad, had been given to his daughters (<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a>), if they should be chosen as wives by any of the children of the (other) tribes of Israel, i.e., should marry into another tribe, their inheritance would be taken away from the tribe-territory of Manasseh, and would be added to that of the tribe into which they were received. The suffix &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; (<a href="/numbers/36-3.htm">Numbers 36:3</a>) refers ad sensum to &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, the tribe regarded according to its members. </body></html>
