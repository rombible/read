The particular site, as indicated by the words "Jordan near Jericho," is now called El-Koura&#8212;a large plain lying not far from Nebo, between the Arnon and a small tributary stream, the Wael [Burckhardt].

But after that subscription further laws at Sinai are collected in Numbers 1 ff. It has therefore been conjectured that both subscriptions were added by a scribe, when the Pentateuch was divided into five books.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The commandments,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. This is one of the words which recur so continually in Deuteronomy and in <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>. It is found four times in chapter 15, and in a few other passages of the earlier books, including <a href="/leviticus/27-34.htm">Leviticus 27:34</a>. The judgments. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. A similar formula is found at the conclusion of Leviticus (<a href="/leviticus/26-46.htm">Leviticus 26:46</a>), where, however, "the commandments" represents a different word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), and a third term, "the laws" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span>), is added. It is difficult to say confidently what is included under the "these" of this verse. Comparing it with <a href="/numbers/33-50.htm">Numbers 33:50</a>, it would seem that it only referred to the final regulations and enactments of the last four chapters; but as we have no reason to believe that the later sections of the Book are arranged in any methodical order, we cannot limit <span class="accented">its</span> scope to those, or deny that it may include the laws of chapters 28-30. For a similar reason we cannot say that the use of this concluding formula excludes the possibility of further large additions having been subsequently made to the Divine legislation in the same place and by the same person, as recorded in the Book of Deuteronomy. All we can say is, that the Book of Numbers knows nothing about any such additions, and concludes in such sort as to make it a matter of surprise that such additions are afterwards met with. The continuity, which so clearly binds together the main bulk of the four books of Moses, ends with this verse. This fact does not of course decide any question which arises concerning the fifth book; it merely leaves all such questions to be determined on their own merits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses declared that what they had affirmed was right (&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;), and then, by command of Jehovah, he told the daughters of Zelophehad that they might marry whoever pleased them (the suffix &#1470;&#1492;&#1501;, attached to &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, for &#1470;&#1492;&#1503;, as in <a href="/exodus/1-21.htm">Exodus 1:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-9.htm">Genesis 31:9</a>, etc.), but that he must belong to the family of their father's tribe, that is to say, must be a Manassite. For (<a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7</a>) the inheritance was not to turn away the Israelites from one tribe to another (not to be transferred from one to another), but every Israelite was to keep to the inheritance of his father's tribe, and no one was to enter upon the possession of another tribe by marrying an heiress belonging to that tribe. This is afterwards extended, in <a href="/numbers/36-8.htm">Numbers 36:8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/36-9.htm">Numbers 36:9</a>, into a general law for every heiress in Israel. </body></html>
