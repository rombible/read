In this case the encampment at the foot of Mount Sinai had lasted eleven months and nineteen days.

True religion begins with the knowledge of the holy law of God, and humiliation for sin, but we must go on towards perfection, in acquaintance with Christ and his gospel, and those effectual encouragements, motives, and assistances to holiness, which it proposes. They took their journey according to the commandment of the Lord, De 1:6-8, and as the cloud led them. Those who give themselves to the direction of God's word and Spirit, steer a steady course, even when they seem bewildered. While they are sure they cannot lose their God and Guide, they need not fear losing their way. They went out of the wilderness of Sinai, and rested in the wilderness of Paran. All our removes in this world are but from one wilderness to another. The changes we think will be for the better do not always prove so. We shall never be at rest, never at home, till we come to heaven, but all will be well there.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>At this point commences the second great division of the book, extending to the close of <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>.

It came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, &c.&#8212;The Israelites had lain encamped in Wady-Er-Rahah and the neighboring valleys of the Sinaitic range for the space of eleven months and twenty-nine days. (Compare Ex 19:1). Besides the religious purposes of the highest importance to which their long sojourn at Sinai was subservient, the Israelites, after the hardships and oppression of the Egyptian servitude, required an interval of repose and refreshment. They were neither physically nor morally in a condition to enter the lists with the warlike people they had to encounter before obtaining possession of Canaan. But the wondrous transactions at Sinai&#8212;the arm of Jehovah so visibly displayed in their favor&#8212;the covenant entered into, and the special blessings guaranteed, beginning a course of moral and religious education which moulded the character of this people&#8212;made them acquainted with their high destiny and inspired them with those noble principles of divine truth and righteousness which alone make a great nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year,....
