The line of march and the places of encampment were clearly marked out by the cloud, but many difficulties would arise in the course of the journeys, and at the places of encampment, which Hobab’s familiarity with the desert would enable him to meet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/numbers/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/10-31.htm" title="And he said, Leave us not, I pray you; for as much as you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you may be to us instead of eyes.">Numbers 10:31</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou mayest be to us instead of eyes — </span>A very significant expression, importing that he should be to them as a guide to the blind. Several ancient versions, however, give a different turn to these words, probably in order to reconcile them with the promise of the divine conduct. The Chaldaic Paraphrase explains it thus: <span class="ital">Thou knowest how we have encamped in the wilderness, and thine eyes have seen the miracles which have been wrought for us. </span>The Samaritan thus: <span class="ital">Thou knowest our encampments, and hast been to us instead of eyes. </span>But this cannot be a just interpretation, for Hobab had not yet followed their camp. The Syriac thus: <span class="ital">Thou shalt be dear to us as our eyes. </span>The LXX., <span class="greekheb">εση εν ημιν πρεσβυτης</span>, <span class="ital">Thou shalt be a senator among us; </span>the counsellors of princes being sometimes called their eyes. But our translation seems most exactly to express the sense of the Hebrew, and certainly implies nothing inconsistent with the promise of the divine guidance; for though the cloud determined them to a general place, yet many particulars might be unknown to Moses, wherein Hobab, having long lived in those parts, might be able to advise him; as concerning the conveniences of water for their cattle; concerning the safety or danger of the several parts, by reason of serpents, or wild beasts, or enemies, in the parts adjoining to them, that so they might guard themselves better against them. Or, this is to be understood of his directing them not so much in their way, as about great and difficult matters, wherein the counsel Moses had from God did not exclude the advice of men, as we see in Hobab’s father, Jethro, Exodus 18. And it is probable this was the wise son of a wise father.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/numbers/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:29-32 Moses invites his kindred to go to Canaan. Those that are bound for the heavenly Canaan, should ask and encourage their friends to go with them: we shall have none the less of the joys of heaven, for others coming to share with us. It is good having fellowship with those who have fellowship with God. But the things of this world, which are seen, draw strongly from the pursuit of the things of the other world, which are not seen. Moses urges that Hobab might be serviceable to them. Not to show where they must encamp, nor what way they must march, the cloud was to direct that; but to show the conveniences of the place they marched through, and encamped in. It well consists with our trust in God's providence, to use the help of our friends.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou mayest be to us instead of eyes - A proverbial expression still in use in the East.

Leave us not, I pray thee &#8230; and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes&#8212;The earnest importunity of Moses to secure the attendance of this man, when he enjoyed the benefit of the directing cloud, has surprised many. But it should be recollected that the guidance of the cloud, though it showed the general route to be taken through the trackless desert, would not be so special and minute as to point out the places where pasture, shade, and water were to be obtained and which were often hid in obscure spots by the shifting sands. Besides, several detachments were sent off from the main body; the services of Hobab, not as a single Arab, but as a prince of a powerful clan, would have been exceedingly useful.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To direct and guide us; for though the cloud determined them to a general place, yet many particulars might be uncertain and unknown to Moses, wherein Hobab, having long lived in those parts, might be able to advise him, as concerning the conveniences of water for their cattle, concerning the safety or danger of the several parts by reason of serpents or wild beasts, or enemies, in the parts adjoining to them, that so they might guard themselves better against them.

It is not indeed easy to say <span class="accented">where</span> any room was left for the good <span class="accented">offices</span> and experience of Hobab; the cloud of the Divine Presence <span class="accented">seemed</span> to control absolutely the journeying and encamping of the people; yet if we really knew in detail the actual ordering of that wondrous march, we should doubtless find that the heavenly guidance did but give unity and certainty to all the wisdom, caution, and endeavour of its earthly leaders. Indeed if we recall to mind that the host is calculated at more than two millions of people, it is quite evident that even during the march to Kadesh (and much more in the long wanderings which followed) it must have been extremely difficult to keep the various divisions together. In the broken and difficult country which they were to traverse, which had been familiar to Hobab from his youth, there would be scope enough for all his ability as a guide. And it would seem that it was just this prospect of being really useful to the people of Israel that prevailed with Hobab. He must indeed have felt assured that a wonderful future awaited a nation whose past and present were, even within his own knowledge, so wonderful. But that alone could not move him to leave his own land and his own kindred, a firing so unspeakably repugnant to the feelings and traditions of his age and country. Doubtless to the child of the desert, whose life was a never-ending struggle with the dangers and vicissitudes of the wilderness, the land of promise, flowing with milk and honey, watered with the rain of heaven, seemed like the garden of Eden. Yet the offer of an heritage within that land moved him  not so much, it would appear, as the claim upon his own good offices in helping the chosen people to reach their own abode. The Septuagint translation, or rather paraphrase, of this verse is, "Leave us not, forasmuch as thou wast with us in the wilderness, and thou shalt be an elder among us." This seems, on the one hand, to identify Hobab with Jethro; on the other, to imply that he was shortly afterwards one of the seventy elders upon whom the spirit came. This, however, is not likely. Hobab does indeed seem to have gone with the people, but his descendants were not incorporated into Israel; they were with them, but not of them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Behind the sacred things came the banners of Ephraim, with Manasseh and Benjamin (see <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/2-18.htm">Numbers 2:18-24</a>), and Dan with Asher and Naphtali (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/2-25.htm">Numbers 2:25-31</a>); so that the camp of Dan was the "collector of all the camps according to their hosts," i.e., formed that division of the army which kept the hosts together. </body></html>
