Their laws in every case were to be Divine, therefore, even in this matter Moses is directed. These trumpets typify the preached gospel. It sounds an alarm to sinners, calls them to repent, proclaims liberty to the captives and slaves of Satan, and collects the worshippers of God. It directs and encourages their heavenly journey; stirs them up to combat against the world and sin, encouraging them with the assurance of victory. It leads their attention to the sacrifice of Christ, and shows the Lord's presence for their protection. It is also necessary that the gospel trumpet give a distinct sound, according to the persons addressed, or the end proposed; whether to convince, humble, console, exhort, reprove, or teach. The sounding of the trumpet of the gospel is God's ordinance, and demands the attention of all to whom it is sent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A year - literally, "days," idiomatically a year <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-29.htm">Leviticus 25:29</a>, an expression equivalent to "a full period," though not necessarily the period of a year. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 10<p>Nu 10:1-36.

It is, however, a mistake to suppose that this use of trumpets has been anticipated in <a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>, or elsewhere, for the "trumpets" there mentioned were altogether different in shape, as in material. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As Jehovah was with His people in the cloud, the rising and falling of the cloud was "the command of the Lord" to the Israelites to break up or to pitch the camp.
