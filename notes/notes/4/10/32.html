Those that are bound for the heavenly Canaan, should ask and encourage their friends to go with them: we shall have none the less of the joys of heaven, for others coming to share with us. It is good having fellowship with those who have fellowship with God. But the things of this world, which are seen, draw strongly from the pursuit of the things of the other world, which are not seen. Moses urges that Hobab might be serviceable to them. Not to show where they must encamp, nor what way they must march, the cloud was to direct that; but to show the conveniences of the place they marched through, and encamped in.

This repetition is for the confirmation of it, more strongly assuring him of what follows: <p>that what goodness the Lord shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee; signifying that whatsoever they enjoyed in the land of Canaan he should have his share with them: the Targum of Jonathan adds,"in the division of the land;''Jarchi says, when the land was divided, the fatness of Jericho was given to the sons of Jethro, to Jonadab, the son of Rechab, see <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>; from whence, however, as well as from other places, <a href="/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>; it appears that the posterity of this man had a settlement in the land of Canaan, and from his silence it may be thought that he was prevailed upon to go along with Moses; or if he departed into his own country, as he said he would, he returned again; at least some of his children did. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou go with us.</span> From <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a> we learn that the sons of Hobab joined themselves to the sons of Judah, and dwelt amongst them on the southern border of the land.
