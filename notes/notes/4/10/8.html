There are cases, however, in the later history (as <a href="/2_kings/11-14.htm" title="And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.">2Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-42.htm" title="And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God.

The number of these trumpets was increased in the time of David and Solomon. We read in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-24.htm" title="And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.">1Chronicles 15:24</a> of seven priests blowing with them before the ark of God, and in <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm" title="Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brothers, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)">2Chronicles 5:12</a> of one hundred and twenty priests blowing with them.

Their laws in every case were to be Divine, therefore, even in this matter Moses is directed. These trumpets typify the preached gospel. It sounds an alarm to sinners, calls them to repent, proclaims liberty to the captives and slaves of Satan, and collects the worshippers of God. It directs and encourages their heavenly journey; stirs them up to combat against the world and sin, encouraging them with the assurance of victory. It leads their attention to the sacrifice of Christ, and shows the Lord's presence for their protection. It is also necessary that the gospel trumpet give a distinct sound, according to the persons addressed, or the end proposed; whether to convince, humble, console, exhort, reprove, or teach. The sounding of the trumpet of the gospel is God's ordinance, and demands the attention of all to whom it is sent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sons of Aaron - As the trumpets were emblematic of the voice of God, the priests only were to use them.

In order to attract greater attention and more faithful observance, it was reserved to the priests alone, as the Lord's ministers; and as anciently in Persia and other Eastern countries the alarm trumpets were sounded from the tent of the sovereign, so were they blown from the tabernacle, the visible residence of Israel's King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The sons of Aaron shall blow, </span> to oblige them to the greater regard and observance, as if God himself had called them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the sons of Aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets,....

To this end God directed him to prepare two silver trumpets of beaten work (mikshah, see <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18</a>), which should serve "for the calling of the assembly, and for the breaking up of the camps," i.e., which were to be used for this purpose. The form of these trumpets is not further described. No doubt they were straight, not curved, as we may infer both from the representation of these trumpets on the triumphal arch of Titus at Rome, and also from the fact, that none but straight trumpets occur on the old Egyptian monuments (see my Arch. ii. p. 187). With regard to the use of them for calling the congregation, the following directions are given in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-3.htm">Numbers 10:3</a>, <a href="/numbers/10-4.htm">Numbers 10:4</a> : "When they shall blow with them (i.e., with both), the whole congregation (in all its representatives) shall assemble at the door of the tabernacle; if they blow with only one, the princes or heads of the families of Israel shall assemble together." </body></html>
