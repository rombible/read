Those that are bound for the heavenly Canaan, should ask and encourage their friends to go with them: we shall have none the less of the joys of heaven, for others coming to share with us. It is good having fellowship with those who have fellowship with God. But the things of this world, which are seen, draw strongly from the pursuit of the things of the other world, which are not seen. Moses urges that Hobab might be serviceable to them. Not to show where they must encamp, nor what way they must march, the cloud was to direct that; but to show the conveniences of the place they marched through, and encamped in. It well consists with our trust in God's providence, to use the help of our friends.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hobab, the son of Raguel - Or Reuel <a href="/exodus/2-18.htm">Exodus 2:18</a>.

Hobab <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a> eventually accompanied the Israelites and obtained a settlement with them in the land of Canaan.

Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite&#8212;called also Reuel (the same as Jethro [Ex 2:18, Margin]). Hobab, the son of this Midianite chief and brother-in-law to Moses, seems to have sojourned among the Israelites during the whole period of their encampment at Sinai and now on their removal proposed returning to his own abode. Moses urged him to remain, both for his own benefit from a religious point of view, and for the useful services his nomad habits could enable him to render.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So he might truly and sincerely say, though after this speech he was overcome by the entreaties and persuasions of Moses.

Ḥobab’s words shew that the route from Sinai to his home in Midian (which was on the east of the Golf of Akaba) was in a different direction from the route to Canaan. This is one of the many indications that Sinai did not lie in the position traditionally assigned to it, and found in modern maps, at the south of the peninsula; otherwise the route of the Israelites would have coincided with that of Ḥobab for a large part of the distance. The site of Sinai seems to have been further north, in the region of Ḳadesh.
