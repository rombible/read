They called the rebels the people of the Lord; and find fault with Divine justice. The obstinacy of Israel notwithstanding the terrors of God's law, as given on mount Sinai, and the terrors of his judgments, shows how necessary the grace of God is to change men's hearts and lives. Love will do what fear cannot. Moses and Aaron interceded with God for mercy, knowing how great the provocation was. Aaron went, and burned incense between the living and the dead, not to purify the air, but to pacify an offended God. As one tender of the life of every Israelite, Aaron made all possible speed. We must render good for evil. Observe especially, that Aaron was a type of Christ. There is an infection of sin in the world, which only the cross and intercession of Jesus Christ can stay and remove. He enters the defiled and dying camp. He stands between the dead and the living; between the eternal Judge and the souls under condemnation. We must have redemption through His blood, even the remission of sins. We admire the ready devotion of Aaron: shall we not bless and praise the unspeakable grace and love which filled the Saviour's heart, when he placed himself in our stead, and bought us with his life? Greatly indeed hath God commended his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, Ro 5:8.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A censer - Rather, the censer. i. e. that of the high priest which was used by him on the great Day of Atonement: compare <a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41. the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord&#8212;What a strange exhibition of popular prejudice and passion&#8212;to blame the leaders for saving the rebels!

But since the sin had been the burning of incense, the means for its atonement was similar. Cf. the bronze serpent (<a href="/context/numbers/21-6.htm" title="And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died....">Numbers 21:6-9</a>). A converse application of the same principle is seen in the laws of retaliation—‘an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">there is wrath gone out</span>] lit. the <span class="ital">wrath has gone out</span>. The divine wrath is thought of almost as an emanation; it has, so to speak, an existence independent of Jehovah, as soon as it proceeds from Him. Cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Should you help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath on you from before the LORD.">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>, where, however, ‘wrath’ is without the article.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take a censer.</span> Rather, "the censer," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the proper censer of the high <span class="accented">priest</span>, which he used upon the great day of atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a>), and which is said in <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a> to have been of gold, and to have been kept in the most holy place.

Whether Moses received any intimation that the wroth might be thus averted, or whether it was the daring thought of a devoted heart when all else failed, it is impossible to say. As it had no precedent, so it never serous to have been repeated; nor is the name or idea of atonement anywhere else connected with the offering of incense apart from the shedding of blood. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Or <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-1.htm">Numbers 17:1-5</a>). After the destruction of the sinners, the Lord commanded that Eleazar should take up the censers "from between the burning," i.e., from the midst of the men that had been burned, and scatter the fire (the burning coals in the pans) far away, that it might not be used any more. "For they (the censers) are holy;" that is to say, they had become holy through being brought before Jehovah (<a href="/numbers/16-39.htm">Numbers 16:39</a>); and therefore, when the men who brought them were slain, they fell as banned articles to the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a>). "The censers of these sinners against their souls" (i.e., the men who have forfeited their lives through their sin: cf. <a href="/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a>), "let them make into broad plates for a covering to the altar" (of burnt-offering). Through this application of them they became a sign, or, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16-39.htm">Numbers 16:39</a>, a memorial to all who drew near to the sanctuary, which was to remind them continually of this judgment of God, and warn the congregation of grasping at the priestly prerogatives.
