The rebels quarrel with the settlement of the priesthood upon Aaron and his family. Small reason they had to boast of the people's purity, or of God's favour, as the people had been so often and so lately polluted with sin, and were now under the marks of God's displeasure. They unjustly charge Moses and Aaron with taking honour to themselves; whereas they were called of God to it. See here, 1. What spirit levellers are of; those who resist the powers God has set over them. 2. What usage they have been serviceable. Moses sought instruction from God. The heart of the wise studies to answer, and asks counsel of God. Moses shows their privileges as Levites, and convicts them of the sin of undervaluing these privileges.

The time past may suffice for the exercise of your despotic and arbitrary power; though it seems to be chiefly levelled against Aaron, and his priesthood, which they thought Moses had conferred on his brother of himself, any instruction from God: <p>seeing all the congregation are holy, everyone of them; having all heard the words of the Lord on Sinai, as Jarchi notes; and were all fit to be priests, and to offer sacrifice in and for their families, as they had used to do, before the separation of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood: <p>and the Lord is among them; in the tabernacle, to whom they could approach and offer their offerings without a priest to do it for them: <p>wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord? since they were all upon a level, everyone holy to the Lord, and might draw nigh unto him, and officiate as priests; wherefore they represent it as great pride and vanity in them; in Moses to take upon him to dispose of the priesthood at his pleasure, and make Aaron the high priest of the people; and in Aaron to take this office upon him, and to be an high priest, and not all the sons of Levi, but over all the children of Israel. <p>(m) "sat est vel satis sit", Pagninus, Vatablus, Drusius, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; so Aben Ezra. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> <i>Ye take</i> too much upon you, seeing all the congregation <i>are</i> holy, <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> every one of them, and the LORD <i>is</i> among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?</span><p>(a) Or let it suffice you: meaning, to have abused them this long.<p>(b) All are equally holy: therefore no one should be preferred above other: thus the wicked reason against God's ordinance.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">Ye take too much upon you</span>] lit.

At the same time, the attack of Korah and his company (with whom alone the narrative is really concerned here) was directed especially against the ecclesiastical rule which Moses exercised through his brother Aaron. <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">take too much upon you.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5be;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, "much for you," probably in the sense of "enough for you" (cf. the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> in <a href="/genesis/45-28.htm">Genesis 45:28</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, you have enjoyed power long enough; so the Targum Palestine.

There was a sanctity which pertained to Israel as a nation, in which all its members shared as distinguished from the nations around (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>); there was a priesthood which was inherent in all the sons of Israel, older and more indelible than that which was conferred on Aaron's line - a priesthood which, apart from special restrictions, or in exceptional circumstances, might and did assert itself in priestly acts (<a href="/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, and compare the cases of Samuel, Elijah, and others who offered sacrifice during the failure of the appointed priesthood). It Moses had taken the power to himself, or it he had (as they doubtless supposed) restricted active priestly functions to Aaron because he was his brother, and wholly under his influence, their contention would have been quite right. They erred, as most violent men do, not because they asserted what was false, but because they took for granted that the truth which they asserted was really inconsistent with the claims which they assailed. The congregation were all holy; the sons of Israel were all priests; that was true - but it was also true that by Divine command Israel could only exercise his corporate priesthood outwardly through the one family which God had set apart for that purpose. The same God who has lodged in the body certain faculties and powers for the benefit of the body, has decreed that those faculties and powers can only be exercised through certain determinate organs, the very specialization of which is both condition and result of a high organization. <span class="cmt_word">The congregation of the Lord.</span> There are two words for congregation in this verse: <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> here, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> before. The former seems to be used in the more solemn sense, but they are for the most part indistinguishable, and certainly cannot be assigned to different authors. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>). The command to wear Tassels on the Edge of the Upper Garment appears to have been occasioned by the incident just described. The Israelites were to wear &#1510;&#1497;&#1510;&#1514;, tassels, on the wings of their upper garments, or, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>, at the four corners of the upper garment. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, the covering in which a man wraps himself, synonymous with &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;, was the upper garment, consisting of a four-cornered cloth or piece of stuff, which was thrown over the body-coat (see my Bibl. Archol. ii. pp. 36, 37), and is not to be referred, as Schultz supposes, to the bed-coverings also, although this garment was actually used as a counterpane by the poor (see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25-26</a>). "And upon the tassel of the wing they shall put a string of hyacinth-blue," namely, to fasten the tassel to the edge of the garment. &#1510;&#1497;&#1510;&#1514; (fem., from &#1510;&#1497;&#1509;, the glittering, the bloom or flower) signifies something flowery or bloom-like, and is used in <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> for a lock of hair; here it is applied to a tassel, as being made of twisted threads: lxx &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a>, "borders." The size of these tassels is not prescribed. The Pharisees liked to make them large, to exhibit openly their punctilious fulfilment of the law. For the Rabbinical directions how to make them, see Carpzov. apparat. pp. 197ff.; and Bodenschatz, kirchliche Verfassung der heutigen Juden, iv. pp. 11ff. </body></html>
