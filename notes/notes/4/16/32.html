It is true, indeed, that in <a href="/numbers/26-10.htm" title="And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.">Numbers 26:10</a> Korah is mentioned in conjunction with Dathan and Abiram (see Note <span class= "ital">in loc.</span>)<span class= "ital">; </span>but in the other places in which reference is made to the conspiracy, the fate of the chief conspirators is separated. Thus, in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-6.htm" title="And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the middle of all Israel:">Deuteronomy 11:6</a> we read only of what God did unto Dathan and Abiram and their households and tents; and in <a href="/psalms/106-17.htm" title="The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.">Psalm 106:17</a> we read that “The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram,” whilst in the following verse it is added that “The flame burned up the wicked.” If Korah’s tent remained in its appointed place amongst the Kohathites, it may reasonably be supposed that the chasm did not extend beyond the tents of Dathan and Abiram; or if Korah had pitched a tent for himself adjoining the tents of Dathan and Abiram, it may be inferred that those only of his household remained in it who shared in the conspiracy, and that his sons remained amongst the other Kohathites, or withdrew with the rest of the congregation at the command of Moses. It is most natural to suppose that Korah was at this time before the door of the Tabernacle, with the 250 men of his company who had presumed to offer incense, and that he shared their doom. Ibn Ezra observes that in the song of the Red Sea there is no mention made of the drowning of Pharaoh, but only of his chariots and hosts; whilst in <a href="/psalms/136-15.htm" title="But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endures for ever.">Psalm 136:15</a> we read that Pharaoh and his host were overthrown in the Red Sea.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/numbers/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/16-32.htm" title="And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.">Numbers 16:32</a></span>. <span class="ital">All that appertained unto Korah — </span>That is, all his family that were there, women, children, and servants; but his sons, who were spared, (<a href="/numbers/26-11.htm" title="Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.">Numbers 26:11</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-58.htm" title="These are the families of the Levites: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korathites.

Korah himself, it seems, was not here, but continued with his two hundred and fifty men before the Lord, where they were waiting for God’s decision of the controversy. Indeed, it is not probable that their chief captain would desert them, and leave them standing there without a head, especially when Aaron, his great adversary, abode there still, and did not go with Moses to Dathan. Korah was probably consumed with those two hundred and fifty, as seems to be intimated, <a href="/numbers/16-40.htm" title="To be a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.">Numbers 16:40</a>. Accordingly, when the psalmist relates this history, (Psalms 106.,) the earth’s swallowing them up is confined to Dathan and Abiram, (<a href="/numbers/16-17.htm" title="And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring you before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.">Numbers 16:17</a>,) and for all the rest of that conspiracy, it is added, (<a href="/numbers/16-18.htm" title="And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.">Numbers 16:18</a>,) <span class="ital">And a fire was kindled in their company, the flame burned up the wicked.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/numbers/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:23-34 The seventy elders of Israel attend Moses. It is our duty to do what we can to countenance and support lawful authority when it is opposed. And those who would not perish with sinners, must come out from among them, and be separate. It was in answer to the prayer of Moses, that God stirred up the hearts of the congregation to remove for their own safety. Grace to separate from evil-doers is one of the things that accompany salvation. God, in justice, left the rebels to the obstinacy and hardness of their own hearts. Moses, by Divine direction, when all Israel were waiting the event, declares that if the rebels die a common death, he will be content to be called and counted an imposter. As soon as Moses had spoken the word, God caused the earth to open and swallow them all up. The children perished with their parents; in which, though we cannot tell how bad they might be to deserve it, or how good God might be otherwise to them; yet of this we are sure, that Infinite Justice did them no wrong. It was altogether miraculous. God has, when he pleases, strange punishments for the workers of iniquity. It was very significant. Considering how the earth is still in like manner loaded with the weight of man's sins, we have reason to wonder that it does not now sink under its load. The ruin of others should be our warning. Could we, by faith, hear the outcries of those that are gone down to the bottomless pit, we should give more diligence than we do to escape for our lives, lest we also come into their condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the men ... - Not his sons (see <a href="/numbers/26-11.htm">Numbers 26:11</a>), but all belonging to him who had associated themselves with him in this rebellion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28-34.
