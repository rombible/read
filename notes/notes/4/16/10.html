The rebels quarrel with the settlement of the priesthood upon Aaron and his family. Small reason they had to boast of the people's purity, or of God's favour, as the people had been so often and so lately polluted with sin, and were now under the marks of God's displeasure. They unjustly charge Moses and Aaron with taking honour to themselves; whereas they were called of God to it. See here, 1. What spirit levellers are of; those who resist the powers God has set over them. 2. What usage they have been serviceable. Moses sought instruction from God. The heart of the wise studies to answer, and asks counsel of God. Moses shows their privileges as Levites, and convicts them of the sin of undervaluing these privileges.

Take your censers, Korah, and all his company, &c.&#8212;that is, since you aspire to the priesthood, then go, perform the highest function of the office&#8212;that of offering incense; and if you are accepted well. How magnanimous the conduct of Moses, who was now as willing that God's people should be priests, as formerly that they should be prophets (Nu 11:29).

Korah is there personally addressed: <p>and all thy brethren, the sons of Levi, with thee; the whole tribe of them, excepting Aaron and his family, who were advanced to be priests: <p>and seek ye the priesthood also? the high priesthood, as the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan; this opens the true cause of their discontent and rebellion; they could not be satisfied with being the ministers of the priests, but wanted to be priests themselves, and Korah perhaps to be high priest. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he hath brought thee near <i>to <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> him</i>, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?</span><p>(e) To serve in the congregation, as in the verse before. </div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses heard these words of the rebels, he fell upon his face, to complain of the matter to the Lord, as in <a href="/numbers/14-5.htm">Numbers 14:5</a>.
