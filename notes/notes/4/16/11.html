The rebels quarrel with the settlement of the priesthood upon Aaron and his family. Small reason they had to boast of the people's purity, or of God's favour, as the people had been so often and so lately polluted with sin, and were now under the marks of God's displeasure. They unjustly charge Moses and Aaron with taking honour to themselves; whereas they were called of God to it. See here, 1. What spirit levellers are of; those who resist the powers God has set over them. 2. What usage they have been serviceable. Moses sought instruction from God. The heart of the wise studies to answer, and asks counsel of God. Moses shows their privileges as Levites, and convicts them of the sin of undervaluing these privileges. It will help to keep us from envying those above us, duly to consider how many there are below us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words of Moses in his wrath are broken.

Take your censers, Korah, and all his company, &c.&#8212;that is, since you aspire to the priesthood, then go, perform the highest function of the office&#8212;that of offering incense; and if you are accepted well. How magnanimous the conduct of Moses, who was now as willing that God's people should be priests, as formerly that they should be prophets (Nu 11:29).

His "company" apparently included representative men from all the tribes, or at least from many (see on verse 2). They were seeking the priesthood because they affirmed it to be the common possession of all Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Against the Lord.</span> It was in his name that they appeared, and to some extent no doubt sincerely; but since they appeared to dispute an ordinance actually and historically made by God himself, it was indeed against him that they were gathered. <span class="cmt_word">And what is</span> <span class="cmt_word">Aaron,</span> <span class="cmt_word">that ye murmur against him?</span> The construction is broken, as so often when we have the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of Moses, whose meekness did not enable him to speak calmly under provocation. The sentence runs, "For which cause thou and all thy company who arc gathered against the Lord, - and Aaron, who is he, that ye murmur against him?" It was easy to represent the position of Aaron in an invidious light, as though they were assailing some personal sacerdotal pretensions; but in truth he was only a poor servant of God doing what he was bid. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses heard these words of the rebels, he fell upon his face, to complain of the matter to the Lord, as in <a href="/numbers/14-5.htm">Numbers 14:5</a>. He then said to Korah and his company, "To-morrow Jehovah will show who is His and holy, and will let him come near to Him, and he whom He chooseth will draw near to Him." The meaning of &#1500;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is evident from &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; &#1497;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. He is Jehovah's, whom He chooses, so that He belongs to Him with his whole life. The reference is to the priestly rank, to which God had chosen Aaron and his sons out of the whole nation, and sanctified them by a special consecration (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>, <a href="/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>), and by which they became the persons "standing near to Him" (<a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>), and were qualified to appear before Him in the sanctuary, and present to Him the sacrifices of the nation. </body></html>
