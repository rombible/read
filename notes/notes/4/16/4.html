The rebels quarrel with the settlement of the priesthood upon Aaron and his family. Small reason they had to boast of the people's purity, or of God's favour, as the people had been so often and so lately polluted with sin, and were now under the marks of God's displeasure. They unjustly charge Moses and Aaron with taking honour to themselves; whereas they were called of God to it. See here, 1. What spirit levellers are of; those who resist the powers God has set over them. 2. What usage they have been serviceable. Moses sought instruction from God. The heart of the wise studies to answer, and asks counsel of God. Moses shows their privileges as Levites, and convicts them of the sin of undervaluing these privileges.

Korah's object was not to abolish the distinction between the Levites and the people, but to win priestly dignity for himself and his kinsmen <a href="/numbers/16-10.htm">Numbers 16:10</a>. This ultimate design is masked for the present in order to win support from the Reubenites by putting forward claims to spiritual equality on behalf of every Israelite. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face&#8212;This attitude of prostration indicated not only his humble and earnest desire that God would interpose to free him from the false and odious imputation, but also his strong sense of the daring sin involved in this proceeding. Whatever feelings may be entertained respecting Aaron, who had formerly headed a sedition himself [Nu 12:1], it is impossible not to sympathize with Moses in this difficult emergency. But he was a devout man, and the prudential course he adopted was probably the dictate of that heavenly wisdom with which, in answer to his prayers, he was endowed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Humbly begging that God would direct him, and defend and vindicate him from this false and odious imputation.

What they said, their complaint against him, for setting up Aaron for an high priest, and against Aaron for taking this honour to himself: <p>he fell upon his face; through shame, as the Targum of Jonathan, blushing at their sin, in opposing the ordinance of God; and through fear of the divine displeasure, and of the wrath of God coming upon them for such wickedness; and in order to pray to God for them to make them sensible of their sin, and give them repentance for it, and pardon of it, and avert his judgments from them such a conduct called aloud for. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And it shall be to you for a tassel," i.e., the fastening of the tassel with the dark blue thread to the corners of your garments shall be to you a tassel, "that ye, when ye see it, may remember all the commandments of Jehovah, and do them; and ye shall not stray after your hearts and your eyes, after which ye go a whoring." The zizith on the sky-blue thread was to serve as a memorial sign to the Israelites, to remind them of the commandments of God, that they might have them constantly before their eyes and follow them, and not direct their heart and eyes to the things of this world, which turn away from the word of God, and lead astray to idolatry (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25-26</a>). Another reason for these instructions, as is afterwards added in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-40.htm">Numbers 15:40</a>, was to remind Israel of all the commandments of the Lord, that they might do them and be holy to their God, and sanctify their daily life to Him who had brought them out of Egypt, to be their God, i.e., to show Himself as God to them. </body></html>
