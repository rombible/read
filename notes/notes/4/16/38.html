The altar of burnt-offering had already a covering of brass; but, as the altar was made of wood, an additional covering afforded further security against the fire which was continually burning on it. The censers of Korah and his company were made of brass (<a href="/numbers/16-39.htm" title="And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, with which they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:">Numbers 16:39</a>). Those of Aaron and his sons are thought by some to have been made of silver, but there seems to be no sufficient authority for this supposition; and in <a href="/exodus/38-3.htm" title="And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, and the meat hooks, and the fire pans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass.">Exodus 38:3</a>, where the same Hebrew word is used, but which in the English version is rendered “firepans,” it is said that all the vessels of the altar were made of brass. In the time of Solomon the censers were made of gold (<a href="/1_kings/7-50.htm" title="And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.">1Kings 7:50</a>). That used by Aaron on the great day of atonement was of gold. (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.">Revelation 8:3</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/numbers/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/16-38.htm" title="The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.">Numbers 16:38</a></span>. <span class="ital">Their own souls — </span>That is, their own lives; who were the authors of their own destruction. <span class="ital">The altar — </span>Of burnt-offerings, which was made of wood, but covered with brass before this time, (<a href="/context/exodus/27-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits....">Exodus 27:1-2</a>,) to which this other covering was added for further ornament, and security against the fire, continually burning upon it. <span class="ital">A sign — </span>A warning to all strangers to take heed of invading the priesthood.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/numbers/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:35-40 A fire went out from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense, while Aaron, who stood with them, was preserved alive. God is jealous of the honour of his own institutions, and will not have them invaded. The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord. The censers are devoted, and, as all devoted things, must be made serviceable to the glory of God. This covering of the altar would remind the children of Israel of this event, that others might hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously. They brought destruction on themselves both in body and soul.
