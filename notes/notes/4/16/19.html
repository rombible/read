Though the people had treacherously deserted them, yet Moses and Aaron approved themselves faithful shepherds of Israel. If others fail in their duty to us, that does not take away the obligations we are under to seek their welfare.

Not his own company only, but as many of the whole congregation of Israel as he could get together, and especially the principal men; so that it seems there was a, general prevailing inclination in the people to take part with him against Moses and Aaron, who wished him success in his undertaking, and readily came together to animate and encourage him in it, and to see the issue of it. Jarchi suggests, that all night he was going to the several tribes, persuading them that it was not for his own private interest, but for the public good, that he acted against two men, who had taken to themselves, the one the kingdom, and the other the priesthood, and by this means got a great multitude together: <p>unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; that is, before it, where Korah and his company stood, whose part they took, and had like to have suffered severely for it, had it not been for the interposition of Moses and Aaron: <p>and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the congregation; the Shechinah, or divine Majesty, which dwelt between the cherubim in the most holy place, removed and came to the door of the tabernacle, where the people were assembled, in the sight of them, showing some visible token of his presence, though no similitude of himself was seen; or, however, he appeared in the cloud that was over the tabernacle, in which was seen a glory, a brightness and splendour, or such coruscations and flashes of lightning as were very unusual and amazing, and plainly showed the Lord was there; so Jarchi says, that he came in the pillar of cloud. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Korah gathered all the <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.</span><p>(l) All that were of their faction.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">Korah assembled all the congregation</span>] He was upholding the claims of the whole of Israel against the Levites, so he brought them to witness the test.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">against them</span>] This perhaps implies that all Israel as a whole favoured Korah; and this would explain God’s words in <span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/16-21.htm" title="Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.">Numbers 16:21</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Korah gathered all the congregation against them.</span> It does not follow that the whole congregation was actively or deliberately on Korah's side. But a movement ostensibly in behalf of the many as against the few is sure to enlist a general, if not a deep, sympathy; nor is it to be supposed that Moses and Aaron could escape a large amount of unpopularity under the grievous circumstances of the time. The thoughtless multitude would have hailed their downfall with real though short-lived satisfaction. <span class="cmt_word">The glory of the Lord appeared.</span> As before (<a href="/numbers/14-10.htm">Numbers 14:10</a>), filling the tabernacle probably, and flashing out before <span class="cmt_word">the eyes</span> of all <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To leave the decision of this to the Lord, Korah and his company, who laid claim to this prerogative, were to take censers, and bring lighted incense before Jehovah. He whom the Lord should choose was to be the sanctified one. This was to satisfy them. With the expression &#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1500;&#1499;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16-7.htm">Numbers 16:7</a>, Moses gives the rebels back their own words in <a href="/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>. The divine decision was connected with the offering of incense, because this was the holiest function of the priestly service, which brought the priest into the immediate presence of God, and in connection with which Jehovah had already shown to the whole congregation how He sanctified Himself, by a penal judgment on those who took this office upon themselves without a divine call (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-3</a>). <a href="/numbers/16-8.htm">Numbers 16:8</a>. He then set before them the wickedness of their enterprise, to lead them to search themselves, and avert the judgment which threatened them. In doing this, he made a distinction between Korah the Levite, and Dathan and Abiram the Reubenites, according to the difference in the motives which prompted their rebellion, and the claims which they asserted. He first of all (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16-8.htm">Numbers 16:8-11</a>) reminded Korah the Levite of the way in which God had distinguished his tribe, by separating the Levites from the rest of the congregation, to attend to the service of the sanctuary (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5</a>., <a href="/numbers/8-6.htm">Numbers 8:6</a>.), and asked him, "Is this too little for you? The God of Israel (this epithet is used emphatically for Jehovah) has brought thee near to Himself, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee, and ye strive after the priesthood also. Therefore...thou and thy company, who have leagued themselves against Jehovah:...and Aaron, what is he, that he murmur against him?" These last words, as an expression of wrath, are elliptical, or rather an aposiopesis, and are to be filled up in the following manner: "Therefore,...as Jehovah has distinguished you in this manner,...what do ye want? Ye rebel against Jehovah! why do ye murmur against Aaron? He has not seized upon the priesthood of his own accord, but Jehovah has called him to it, and he is only a feeble servant of God" (cf. <a href="/exodus/16-7.htm">Exodus 16:7</a>). Moses then (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16-12.htm">Numbers 16:12-14</a>) sent for Dathan and Abiram, who, as is tacitly assumed, had gone back to their tents during the warning given to Korah. But they replied, "We shall not come up." &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, to go up, is used either with reference to the tabernacle, as being in a spiritual sense the culminating point of the entire camp, or with reference to appearance before Moses, the head and ruler of the nation. "Is it too little that thou hast brought us out of a land flowing with milk and honey (they apply this expression in bitter irony to Egypt), to kill us in the wilderness (deliver us up to death), that thou wilt be always playing the lord over us?" The idea of continuance, which is implied in the inf. abs., &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1512;, to exalt one's self as ruler (Ges. 131, 36), is here still further intensified by &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;. "Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, or given us fields and vineyards for an inheritance (i.e., thou hast not kept thy promise, <a href="/exodus/4-30.htm">Exodus 4:30</a> compared with <a href="/numbers/3-7.htm">Numbers 3:7</a>.). Wilt thou put out the eyes of these people?" i.e., wilt thou blind them as to thy doings and designs? </body></html>
