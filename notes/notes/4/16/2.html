The rebels quarrel with the settlement of the priesthood upon Aaron and his family. Small reason they had to boast of the people's purity, or of God's favour, as the people had been so often and so lately polluted with sin, and were now under the marks of God's displeasure. They unjustly charge Moses and Aaron with taking honour to themselves; whereas they were called of God to it. See here, 1. What spirit levellers are of; those who resist the powers God has set over them. 2. What usage they have been serviceable. Moses sought instruction from God. The heart of the wise studies to answer, and asks counsel of God. Moses shows their privileges as Levites, and convicts them of the sin of undervaluing these privileges. It will help to keep us from envying those above us, duly to consider how many there are below us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "princes" appear to have belonged to the other tribes (compare <a href="/numbers/27-3.htm">Numbers 27:3</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 16<p>Nu 16:1-30. The Rebellion of Korah.<p>1, 2. Now Korah, the son of Izhar&#8212;Izhar, brother of Amram (Ex 6:18), was the second son of Kohath, and for some reason unrecorded he had been supplanted by a descendant of the fourth son of Kohath, who was appointed prince or chief of the Kohathites (Nu 3:30). Discontent with the preferment over him of a younger relative was probably the originating cause of this seditious movement on the part of Korah.<p>Dathan and Abiram, &#8230; and On&#8212;These were confederate leaders in the rebellion, but On seems to have afterwards withdrawn from the conspiracy [compare Nu 16:12, 24, 25, 27; 26:9; De 11:6; Ps 106:17].<p>took men&#8212;The latter mentioned individuals, being all sons of Reuben, the eldest of Jacob's family, had been stimulated to this insurrection on the pretext that Moses had, by an arbitrary arrangement, taken away the right of primogeniture, which had vested the hereditary dignity of the priesthood in the first-born of every family, with a view of transferring the hereditary exercise of the sacred functions to a particular branch of his own house; and that this gross instance of partiality to his own relations, to the permanent detriment of others, was a sufficient ground for refusing allegiance to his government. In addition to this grievance, another cause of jealousy and dissatisfaction that rankled in the breasts of the Reubenites was the advancement of Judah to the leadership among the tribes. These malcontents had been incited by the artful representations of Korah (Jude 11), with whom the position of their camp on the south side afforded them facilities of frequent intercourse. In addition to his feeling of personal wrongs, Korah participated in their desire (if he did not originate the attempt) to recover their lost rights of primogeniture. When the conspiracy was ripe, they openly and boldly declared its object, and at the head of two hundred fifty princes, charged Moses with an ambitious and unwarrantable usurpation of authority, especially in the appropriation of the priesthood, for they disputed the claim of Aaron also to pre-eminence [Nu 16:3].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They, </span> i.e. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, last mentioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Rose up, </span> i.e. conspired together, and put their seditious design in execution. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Before Moses; </span> not privily and obscurely, but openly and boldly, not fearing nor regarding the presence of Moses, who was an eye-witness of their conspiracy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Famous, </span> for place and birth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they rose up before Moses,....

These accusations have nothing whatever in the narrative to support them, and are suspicious because they are so easy and so sure to be made in such cases.

The command to wear Tassels on the Edge of the Upper Garment appears to have been occasioned by the incident just described. The Israelites were to wear &#1510;&#1497;&#1510;&#1514;, tassels, on the wings of their upper garments, or, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>, at the four corners of the upper garment. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, the covering in which a man wraps himself, synonymous with &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;, was the upper garment, consisting of a four-cornered cloth or piece of stuff, which was thrown over the body-coat (see my Bibl. Archol. ii. pp. 36, 37), and is not to be referred, as Schultz supposes, to the bed-coverings also, although this garment was actually used as a counterpane by the poor (see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25-26</a>). "And upon the tassel of the wing they shall put a string of hyacinth-blue," namely, to fasten the tassel to the edge of the garment. &#1510;&#1497;&#1510;&#1514; (fem., from &#1510;&#1497;&#1509;, the glittering, the bloom or flower) signifies something flowery or bloom-like, and is used in <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> for a lock of hair; here it is applied to a tassel, as being made of twisted threads: lxx &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a>, "borders." The size of these tassels is not prescribed. The Pharisees liked to make them large, to exhibit openly their punctilious fulfilment of the law. For the Rabbinical directions how to make them, see Carpzov. apparat. pp. 197ff.; and Bodenschatz, kirchliche Verfassung der heutigen Juden, iv. pp. 11ff. </body></html>
