The burning of the wrath of God, which was to be turned away from the people by the punishment of the guilty, as enjoined upon Moses, consisted, as we may see from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9</a>, in a plague inflicted upon the nation, which carried off a great number of the people, a sudden death, as in <a href="/numbers/14-37.htm">Numbers 14:37</a>; <a href="/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11</a>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506;, from &#1497;&#1511;&#1506;, to be torn apart or torn away (Ges., Winer), refers to the punishment of crucifixion, a mode of capital punishment which was adopted by most of the nations of antiquity (see Winer, bibl. R. W. i. p. 680), and was carried out sometimes by driving a stake into the body, and so impaling them (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), the mode practised by the Assyrians and Persians (Herod. iii. 159, and Layard's Nineveh and its Remains, vol. ii. p. 374, and plate on p. 369), at other times by fastening them to a stake or nailing them to a cross (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;). In the instance before us, however, the idolaters were not impaled or crucified alive, but, as we may see from the word &#1492;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-5.htm">Numbers 25:5</a>, and in accordance with the custom frequently adopted by other nations (see Herzog's Encyclopaedia), they were first of all put to death, and then impaled upon a stake or fastened upon a cross, so that the impaling or crucifixion was only an aggravation of the capital punishment, like the burning in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>, and the hanging (&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;) in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22</a>.
