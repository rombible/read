God established with Phinehas in particular that covenant which He had made generally with all his people; and among its blessings peace is especially mentioned, because of the peace between God and the congregation which Phinehas had brought about. As an additional gift there is assigned to him and his seed forever the office of peace-making, the legitimate function of the priesthood (compare <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>); and the covenant was thus to him a covenant not only of peace but of life (compare the marginal reference). Phinehas became highpriest after the death of his father Eleazar, and the office, with a short interruption from the days of Eli to those of David, when for unknown reasons it was filled by the descendants of his uncle Ithamar, was perpetuated in his line; nor indeed is it known to have departed from that line again until the typical priesthood of the sons of Aaron was merged in the actual priesthood of the Saviour of mankind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

It seems to mean that several clans descended from one tribe-father looked up to Zur as their head. In <a href="/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a> he is called one of the five "kings" of Midian. That the daughter of such a man should have been selected, and should have been willing, to play such a part throws a strong light upon the studied character and the peculiar danger of the seduction. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Twenty-four thousand men were killed by this plague.
