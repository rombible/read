From one of the cities of Moab or Midian, the latter rather, by what follows; where he had been, very probably, to an idolatrous feast, and had eaten of the sacrifices, and worshipped idols, and committed fornication with the daughters of the land; and not content with indulging himself with those impurities at a distance and where he was less known: <p>brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman; into his father's family, into a tent where his brethren dwelt: <p>in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel; in the most open and undisguised manner, into the midst of the camp, passing by Moses, and a great number of the people, who were gathered together on this solemn occasion, to seek the Lord, and humble themselves before him: <p>who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; the place where the people used to assemble together for religious exercises; here they were weeping and mourning for the sins and abominations that were committed among them, and on account of the punishment inflicted on many of them, by the hand of the civil magistrate, and because of the plague that was broke out upon them, from an angry God; by which it appears, that though there were many who had fallen into those foul sins, yet there were a great number which were not defiled with them, and sighed and cried for the abominations in the midst of them: and because the fact here recorded was such an amazing piece of impudence, the word "behold" is prefixed to the account of it, it being done in such a public, bold, and audacious manner, and at such a time, when so many had been hanged up for it, and the plague of God was broke out among the people on account of it, and good men were bewailing the sin, and the punishment of it; and if this was on a sabbath day, as the Samaritan Chronicle (x) relates, it was a further aggravation of it. <p>(x) Apud Hottinger.

In this case Balaam lived (according to P ) not in Mesopotamia or Ammon (see on <a href="/numbers/22-5.htm" title="He sent messengers therefore to Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:">Numbers 22:5</a>) but in Midian. The conjecture receives support from <a href="/numbers/31-8.htm" title="And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.">Numbers 31:8</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-16.htm" title="Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.">Numbers 31:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">6–15</span>. <span class="ital">The zeal of Phinehas, and its reward</span>. The passage belongs to the period after the exile, when those only were recognised as priests who could trace their ancestry through Phinehas, and Eleazar his father, to Aaron.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A Midianitish woman.</span> Rather, "the Midianitish woman." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>.

The writer deals with an incident only too notorious, and which by the peculiar aggravation of its circumstances had fixed itself deeply in the popular memory. This is the first mention of the Midianites in connection with this  affair, and it prepares us to learn without surprise that they were in reality the authors of this mischief. <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">the congregation,...</span> <span class="cmt_word">who were weeping.</span> According to the loose sense in which this expression is used throughout the Pentateuch, it evidently means that those who truly represented the nation, not only as a political, but also as a religions community, were gathered in this distress before the presence of their invisible King. They wept on account of the wrath of God provoked; probably also on account of the wrath of God already gone forth in the form of a pestilence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At the close of this announcement Balaam and Balak departed from one another. "Balaam rose up, and went and turned towards his place" (i.e., set out on the way to his house); "and king Balak also went his way." &#1500;&#1502;&#1511;&#1502;&#1493; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; does not mean, "he returned to his place," into his home beyond the Euphrates (equivalent to &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1511;&#1502;&#1493; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;), but merely "he turned towards his place" (both here and in <a href="/genesis/18-33.htm">Genesis 18:33</a>). That he really returned home, is not implied in the words themselves; and the question, whether he did so, must be determined from other circumstances. In the further course of the history, we learn that Balaam went to the Midianites, and advised them to seduce the Israelites to unfaithfulness to Jehovah, by tempting them to join in the worship of Peor (<a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>). He was still with them at the time when the Israelites engaged in the war of vengeance against that people, and was slain by the Israelites along with the five princes of Midian (<a href="/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-22.htm">Joshua 13:22</a>). At the time when he fell into the hands of the Israelites, he no doubt made a full communication to the Israelitish general, or to Phinehas, who accompanied the army as priest, concerning his blessings and prophecies, probably in the hope of saving his life; though he failed to accomplish his end.<p>(Note: It is possible, however, as Hengstenberg imagines, that after Balaam's departure from Balak, he took his way into the camp of the Israelites, and there made known his prophecies to Moses or to the elders of Israel, in the hope of obtaining from them the reward which Balak had withheld, and that it was not till after his failure to obtain full satisfaction to his ambition and covetousness here, that he went to the Midianites, to avenge himself upon the Israelites, by the proposals that he made to them. The objections made by Kurtz to this conjecture are not strong enough to prove that it is inadmissible, though the possibility of the thing does not involve either its probability or its certainty.) </body></html>
