Here is the sin of Israel, to which they are enticed by the daughters of Moab and Midian. Those are our worst enemies who draw us to sin, for that is the greatest mischief any man can do us. Israel's sin did that which all Balaam's enchantments could not do; it set God against them.

An Israelite brought a Midianite woman into the camp, and Phinehas, for his zeal in killing them both, received the promise that his descendants should perpetually possess the priesthood (P ). The narratives are quite distinct, but both express condemnation of the immorality of the Israelites in consorting with foreign women. The interest of the former is prophetic, and is concerned with the struggle between the pure worship of Jehovah and the native local cults. The interest of the latter is ecclesiastical, and is concerned with the succession of the Aaronite priesthood.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abode in Shittim.</span> For a considerable time; from their first arrival in the Arboth Moab until the crossing of the Jordan. Shittim is the shortened form of Abel-Shittim, "Field of Acacias" (<a href="/numbers/33-49.htm">Numbers 33:49</a>). It seems to have been the northernmost part of the last encampment of Israel on that side Jordan, and the head-quarters of the host (<a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.</span> This commencement of sin seems to have been made by Israel without special provocation.

Balaam sees them, not with the eyes of his body, but in a state of ecstasy, like the star out of Jacob. "Beginning of the heathen is Amalek, and its end is destruction." Amalek is called the beginning of the nations, not "as belonging to the most distinguished and foremost of the nations in age, power, and celebrity" (Knobel), - for in all these respects this Bedouin tribe, which descended from a grandson of Esau, was surpassed by many other nations, - but as the first heathen nation which opened the conflict of the heathen nations against Israel as the people of God (see at <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8</a>.). As its beginning had been enmity against Israel, its end would be "even to the perishing" (&#1488;&#1489;&#1491; &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;), i.e., reaching the position of one who was perishing, falling into destruction, which commenced under Saul and was completed under Hezekiah. </body></html>
