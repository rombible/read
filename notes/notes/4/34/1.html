God here directs Moses, and he is ordered to direct Israel, concerning the line by which the land of Canaan was to be bounded on all sides. Its limits, or bounds, are described, 1st, To guide and bound them in their wars and conquests, that they might not seek the enlargement of their empire, after the manner of other nations, but be contented with their own portion. 2d, To encourage them in their attempt upon Canaan, and assure them of their success. There was a much larger possession promised them, if they were obedient, even to the river Euphrates; and even so far the dominions of Israel did extend in David’s and Solomon’s time, <a href="/2_chronicles/9-26.htm" title="And he reigned over all the kings from the river even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>. But this, which is properly Canaan, lay in a very little compass. It is but about a hundred and sixty miles in length, and about fifty in breadth. This was that little spot of ground, in which alone, for many ages, God was known! But its littleness was abundantly compensated by its fruitfulness; otherwise it could not have sustained so numerous a nation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>See how little a share of the world God often gives to his own people! But they that have their portion in heaven, can be content with a small pittance of this earth.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/numbers/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:1-15 Canaan was of small extent; as it is here bounded, it is but about 160 miles in length, and about 50 in breadth; yet this was the country promised to the father of the faithful, and the possession of the seed of Israel. This was that little spot of ground, in which alone, for many ages, God was known. This was the vineyard of the Lord, the garden enclosed; but as it is with gardens and vineyards, the narrowness of the space was made up by the fruitfulness of the soil. Though the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, yet few know him, and serve him; but those few are happy, because fruitful to God. Also, see how little a share of the world God gives to his own people. Those who have their portion in heaven, have reason to be content with a small pittance of this earth. Yet a little that a righteous man has, having it from the love of God, and with his blessing, is far better and more comfortable than the riches of many wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The expulsion of the Canaanites and the destruction of their monuments of idolatry had been already enjoined (see the marginal references); and <a href="/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a> is substantially a repetition from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-53.htm">Exodus 26:53-55</a>.
