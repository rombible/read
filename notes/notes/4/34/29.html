The order in which the tribes are named is peculiar to this passage. If they be taken in pairs, Judah and Simeon, Benjamin and Dan, Manasseh and Ephraim, Zebulun and Issachar, Asher and Naphtali, the order of the pairs agrees with the order in which the allotments in the Holy land, taken also in couples, followed each other in the map from south to north. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-29. names of the men &#8230; which shall divide the land&#8212;This appointment by the Lord before the Jordan tended not only to animate the Israelites faith in the certainty of the conquest, but to prevent all subsequent dispute and discontent, which might have been dangerous in presence of the natives. The nominees were ten princes for the nine and a half tribes, one of them being selected from the western section of Manasseh, and all subordinate to the great military and ecclesiastical chiefs, Joshua and Eleazar. The names are mentioned in the exact order in which the tribes obtained possession of the land, and according to brotherly connection.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These are they whom the Lord commanded,....

Of these princes, namely heads of fathers' houses of the tribes (<a href="/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>), not heads of tribes (see at <a href="/numbers/13-2.htm">Numbers 13:2</a>), Caleb, who is well known from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, is the only one whose name if known. The others are not mentioned anywhere else. The list of tribes, in the enumeration of their princes, corresponds, with some exceptions, to the situation of the territory which the tribes received in Canaan, reckoning from south to north, and deviates considerably from the order in which the lots came out for the different tribes, as described in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15.htm">Joshua 15-19</a>. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; in the Kal, in <a href="/numbers/34-17.htm">Numbers 34:17</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-18.htm">Numbers 34:18</a>, signifies to give for an inheritance, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-8.htm">Exodus 34:8</a>, to put into possession.
