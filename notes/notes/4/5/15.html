On the other hand, it would hinder the cruel treatment such suspicions might occasion. It would also hinder the guilty from escaping, and the innocent from coming under just suspicion. When no proof could be brought, the wife was called on to make this solemn appeal to a heart-searching God. No woman, if she were guilty, could say Amen to the adjuration, and drink the water after it, unless she disbelieved the truth of God, or defied his justice. The water is called the bitter water, because it caused the curse. Thus sin is called an evil and a bitter thing. Let all that meddle with forbidden pleasures, know that they will be bitterness in the latter end. From the whole learn, 1. Secret sins are known to God, and sometimes are strangely brought to light in this life; and that there is a day coming when God will, by Christ, judge the secrets of men according to the gospel, Ro 2:16. 2 In particular, Whoremongers and adulterers God will surely judge. Though we have not now the waters of jealousy, yet we have God's word, which ought to be as great a terror. Sensual lusts will end in bitterness. 3. God will manifest the innocency of the innocent.

His suspicions, however, were sufficient in the absence of witnesses (Le 20:10) to warrant the trial described; and the course of proceeding to be followed was for the jealous husband to bring his wife unto the priest with an offering of barley meal, because none were allowed to approach the sanctuary empty handed (Ex 23:15). On other occasions, there were mingled with the offering, oil which signified joy, and frankincense which denoted acceptance (Ps 141:2). But on the occasion referred to, both these ingredients were to be excluded, partly because it was a solemn appeal to God in distressing circumstances, and partly because it was a sin offering on the part of the wife, who came before God in the character of a real or suspected offender.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then, </span> she persisting in her denial, and her husband requiring her submission to this way of trial. <span class="ital">Her offering</span> was partly because none were to appear before God empty, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/23-15.htm" title="You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: (you shall eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded you, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it you came out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)">Exodus 23:15</a></span>; partly, by way of solemn appeal to God, whom hereby she desired to judge between her and her husband; and partly, by way of atonement to appease God, who had for her sins stirred up her husband against her, and sent an evil spirit between them.

Not to the high priest but to a common priest, anyone then officiating in his course; for there was a jealousy offering to be offered up before the Lord upon the altar, which none but a priest might do; and besides, the whole process in this affair was to be carried, on by him: according to the Misnah (n), the man brought his wife first to the sanhedrim, or court of judicature in the place where he lived; before whom, as Maimonides (o) says, he proved by witnesses that he had warned his wife of being in private with such a man, and yet she had done it again; and whereas she insisted on her chastity, he desired that the bitter waters might be given her, that the truth might appear; and then they sent him with two disciples of the wise men, to the great sanhedrim at Jerusalem, where the trial was made; who, in order to bring her too confession, endeavoured to terrify her, as they do persons in capital cases, and finding this wilt not do, then they used smooth words, saying, my daughter, perhaps much wine was the occasion of it, or much laughter, &amp;c. <p>and he shall bring her offering for her: not the priest, but her husband, and that whether he is willing or not, as Aben Ezra; who also observes, that it may be interpreted, with her, or for her sake, not to make any expiation for any fault of his, that when he first observed her immodesty, did not reprove her; for the offering, though brought by him, was not his, but his wife's, and not to expiate her sin, but to bring it to remembrance, as is after expressed: <p>the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; which was an omer, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/16-36.htm">Exodus 16:36</a>, the quantity of manna for one man every day, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16</a>, and the quantity of flour in the daily meat offering, <a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>; only that was of fine wheaten flour; this of barley, the food of beasts, as the Targum of Jonathan remarks; and R. Gamaliel in the Misnah (p) says, that as her deed was the deed of a beast, so her offering was the food of a beast; and this is observed by Jarchi and Aben Ezra on the text, as the reason of barley being used in this offering: some say it was a symbol of her impudence, others of her being little at home, as the barley is not long under ground (q); the true reason, it may be, was for her humiliation, being vile, and mean, hence it follows: <p>he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; as used to be oft meat offerings, denoting their acceptableness to God, <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>; the reason seems to be, because these were tokens of joy and gladness, whereas this was a mournful affair to the husband, that he should have any cause of suspicion and jealousy, to the wife that she should be suspected, and to the whole family on that account: <p>for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance; if guilty of it, and therefore oil and frankincense were forbidden in this kind of offering as in a sin offering, <a href="/leviticus/5-11.htm">Leviticus 5:11</a>. <p>(n) Ut supra, (Misn.

"If a man or a woman do one of the sins of men, to commit unfaithfulness against Jehovah, and the same soul has incurred guilt, they shall confess their sin which they have done, and (the doer) shall recompense his debt according to its sum" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, as in <a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>), etc. &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;, one of the sins occurring among men, not "a sin against a man" (Luther, Ros., etc.). The meaning is a sin, with which a &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; was committed against Jehovah, i.e., one of the acts described in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm">Leviticus 6:3-4</a>, by which injury was done to the property of a neighbour, whereby a man brought a debt upon himself, for the wiping out of which a material restitution of the other's property was prescribed, together with the addition of a fifth of its value, and also the presentation of a sin-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4-7</a>). To guard against that disturbance of fellowship and peace in the congregation, which would arise from such trespasses as these, the law already given in <a href="/leviticus/6-1.htm">Leviticus 6:1</a> is here renewed and supplemented by the additional stipulation, that if the man who had been unjustly deprived of some of his property had no Gol, to whom restitution could be made for the debt, the compensation should be paid to Jehovah for the priests. The Gol was the nearest relative, upon whom the obligation rested to redeem a person who had fallen into slavery through poverty (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>). The allusion to the Gol in this connection presupposes that the injured person was no longer alive. To this there are appended, in <a href="/numbers/5-9.htm">Numbers 5:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/5-10.htm">Numbers 5:10</a>, the directions which are substantially connected with this, viz., that every heave-offering (Terumah, see at <a href="/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>) in the holy gifts of the children of Israel, which they presented to the priest, was to belong to him (the priest), and also all the holy gifts which were brought by different individuals.
