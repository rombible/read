On the other hand, it would hinder the cruel treatment such suspicions might occasion. It would also hinder the guilty from escaping, and the innocent from coming under just suspicion. When no proof could be brought, the wife was called on to make this solemn appeal to a heart-searching God. No woman, if she were guilty, could say Amen to the adjuration, and drink the water after it, unless she disbelieved the truth of God, or defied his justice. The water is called the bitter water, because it caused the curse. Thus sin is called an evil and a bitter thing. Let all that meddle with forbidden pleasures, know that they will be bitterness in the latter end. From the whole learn, 1. Secret sins are known to God, and sometimes are strangely brought to light in this life; and that there is a day coming when God will, by Christ, judge the secrets of men according to the gospel, Ro 2:16. 2 In particular, Whoremongers and adulterers God will surely judge. Though we have not now the waters of jealousy, yet we have God's word, which ought to be as great a terror. Sensual lusts will end in bitterness. 3. God will manifest the innocency of the innocent. The same providence is for good to some, and for hurt to others. And it will answer the purposes which God intends.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The trial of jealousy. Since the crime of adultery is especially defiling and destructive of the very foundations of social order, the whole subject is dealt with at a length proportionate to its importance. The process prescribed has lately been strikingly illustrated from an Egyptian "romance," which refers to the time of Rameses the Great, and may therefore well serve to illustrate the manners and customs of the Mosaic times. This mode of trial, like several other ordinances, was adopted by Moses from existing and probably very ancient and widely spread institutions.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Nu 5:11-31.

The Ordeal of Jealousy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Though in its present form a late priestly composition this section is evidently based upon very ancient material. Its contents find no parallel in the other Pentateuchal codes; but the custom of trial by ordeal was a very ancient feature in Israelite life, as it was in the life of many other nations, and it still has a wide prevalence, especially in Africa. The forms of ordeal differ greatly—drinking a potion (as here), being thrown into water (as in the case of suspected witches in the middle ages in Europe), walking upon heated metal, or holding it in the hand, or very frequently invoking upon oneself a curse which will come true in the event of guilt. The latter, as well as the potion, forms part of the ordeal in the present passage1 [Note: References to ordeals in other nations are given in Gray’s Numbers, pp. 44 f.] . Another Biblical instance of an ordeal appears in the story of Korah (<a href="/context/numbers/16-16.htm" title="And Moses said to Korah, Be you and all your company before the LORD, you, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:...">Numbers 16:16-18</a>), and the practice perhaps underlies <a href="/psalms/109-18.htm" title="As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.">Psalm 109:18</a>, <a href="/proverbs/6-27.htm" title="Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?">Proverbs 6:27</a> f. The essential element in all cases is that the accused is subjected to a test, the visible results of which will be a conclusive divine sentence of innocence or guilt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the present instance a woman is suspected of adultery which cannot be legally proved, and her husband’s jealousy is roused. He brings her to the priest with an accompanying offering of flour. The priest places her ‘before Jehovah,’ and after dictating a curse upon herself which the woman endorses by responding ‘Amen, Amen,’ he causes her to drink a potion, consisting of holy water with two added ingredients—dust from the floor of the Tabernacle, and the written words of the curse which have been washed off into the water. If she is guilty of the charge, the potion will have a harmful effect upon her body which will prevent her being delivered of a child, but if she is innocent it will do her no harm and she will conceive seed.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Restitution in Case of a Trespass. - No crime against the property of a neighbour was to remain without expiation in the congregation of Israel, which was encamped or dwelt around the sanctuary of Jehovah; and the wrong committed was not to remain without restitution, because such crimes involved unfaithfulness (&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, see <a href="/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>) towards Jehovah. "If a man or a woman do one of the sins of men, to commit unfaithfulness against Jehovah, and the same soul has incurred guilt, they shall confess their sin which they have done, and (the doer) shall recompense his debt according to its sum" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, as in <a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>), etc. &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;, one of the sins occurring among men, not "a sin against a man" (Luther, Ros., etc.). The meaning is a sin, with which a &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; was committed against Jehovah, i.e., one of the acts described in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm">Leviticus 6:3-4</a>, by which injury was done to the property of a neighbour, whereby a man brought a debt upon himself, for the wiping out of which a material restitution of the other's property was prescribed, together with the addition of a fifth of its value, and also the presentation of a sin-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4-7</a>). To guard against that disturbance of fellowship and peace in the congregation, which would arise from such trespasses as these, the law already given in <a href="/leviticus/6-1.htm">Leviticus 6:1</a> is here renewed and supplemented by the additional stipulation, that if the man who had been unjustly deprived of some of his property had no Gol, to whom restitution could be made for the debt, the compensation should be paid to Jehovah for the priests. The Gol was the nearest relative, upon whom the obligation rested to redeem a person who had fallen into slavery through poverty (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>). The allusion to the Gol in this connection presupposes that the injured person was no longer alive. To this there are appended, in <a href="/numbers/5-9.htm">Numbers 5:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/5-10.htm">Numbers 5:10</a>, the directions which are substantially connected with this, viz., that every heave-offering (Terumah, see at <a href="/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>) in the holy gifts of the children of Israel, which they presented to the priest, was to belong to him (the priest), and also all the holy gifts which were brought by different individuals. The reference is not to literal sacrifices, i.e., gifts intended for the altar, but to dedicatory offerings, first-fruits, and such like. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, "with regard to every man's, his holy gifts...to him (the priest) shall they be; what any man gives to the priest shall belong to him." The second clause serves to explain and confirm the first. &#1488;&#1514;: as far, with regard to, quoad (see Ewald, 277, d; Ges. 117, 2, note). </body></html>
