The present registration enrolled persons "after their families, by the house of their fathers;" and was superintended not by the Levites (see <a href="/exodus/38-21.htm">Exodus 38:21</a> and note), but by <a href="/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4</a> an assessor for each tribe to act in the business with Moses and Aaron.

Commentary by Robert Jamieson   <p>CHAPTER 1<p>Nu 1:1-54. Moses Numbering the Men of War.<p>1, 2. on the first day of the second month, &c.&#8212;Thirteen months had elapsed since the exodus. About one month had been occupied in the journey; and the rest of the period had been passed in encampment among the recesses of Sinai, where the transactions took place, and the laws, religious and civil, were promulgated, which are contained in the two preceding books. As the tabernacle was erected on the first day of the first month, and the order here mentioned was given on the first day of the second, some think the laws in Leviticus were all given in one month. The Israelites having been formed into a separate nation, under the special government of God as their King, it was necessary, before resuming their march towards the promised land, to put them into good order. And accordingly Moses was commissioned, along with Aaron, to take a census of the people. This census was incidentally noticed (Ex 38:26), in reference to the poll tax for the works of the tabernacle; but it is here described in detail, in order to show the relative increase and military strength of the different tribes. The enumeration was confined to those capable of bearing arms [Nu 1:3], and it was to be made with a careful distinction of the tribe, family, and household to which every individual belonged. By this rule of summation many important advantages were secured: an exact genealogical register was formed, the relative strength of each tribe was ascertained, and the reason found for arranging the order of precedence in march as well as disposing the different tribes in camp around the tabernacle. The promise of God to Abraham [Ge 22:17] was seen to be fulfilled in the extraordinary increase of his posterity, and provision made for tracing the regular descent of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is not the same muster with that <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/38-26.htm" title="A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.">Exodus 38:26</a></span>, as plainly appears, because that was before the building of the tabernacle, which was built and set up <span class="ital">on the first day of the first month</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/40-2.htm" title="On the first day of the first month shall you set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.">Exodus 40:2</a></span>; but this was after it, to wit, on the first day of the second month, as is said <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/1-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,">Numbers 1:1</a></span>.
