Singular services shall be recompensed by singular honours. It was to the honour of the Levites, that to them was committed the care of the tabernacle and its treasures, in their camps and in their marches. It was for the honour of the holy things that none should see them, or touch them, but those who were called of God to the service. We all are unfit and unworthy to have fellowship with God, till called by his grace into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and so, being the spiritual seed of that great High Priest, we are made priests to our God. Great care must be taken to prevent sin, for preventing sin is preventing wrath. Being a holy tribe, they were not reckoned among other Israelites. They that minister about holy things, should neither entangle themselves, nor be entangled, in worldly affairs. And let every believer seek to do what the Lord has commanded.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>had spoken - Render spake. The formal appointment is only now made, in reward for their zeal <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26-29</a>, though reference to their future office appears previously in <a href="/leviticus/25-32.htm">Leviticus 25:32</a> ff, and they had already acted as assistants to the priests (compare <a href="/exodus/38-21.htm">Exodus 38:21</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>47-54. But the Levites &#8230; were not numbered among them&#8212;They were obliged to keep a register of their own. They were consecrated to the priestly office, which in all countries has been exempted customarily, and in Israel by the express authority of God, from military service. The custody of the things devoted to the divine service was assigned to them so exclusively, that "no stranger"&#8212;that is, no person, not even an Israelite of any other tribe, was allowed, under penalty of death, to approach these [Nu 16:40]. Hence they encamped round the tabernacle in order that there should be no manifestation of the divine displeasure among the people. Thus the numbering of the people was subservient to the separation of the Levites from those Israelites who were fit for military service, and to the practical introduction of the law respecting the first-born, for whom the tribe of Levi became a substitute [Ex 13:2; Nu 3:12].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Israel did according to all the Lord commanded Moses,....
