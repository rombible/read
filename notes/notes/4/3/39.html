(See Bishop Wordsworth’s Notes <span class= "ital">in loc., </span>where the reasons which may be assigned for the extreme paucity of this tribe, as compared with the other tribes, are discussed.) The later census, which also included the children from a month old and upwards, shows but a very small increase in the number of this tribe, the number on that occasion amounting only to 23,000 (<a href="/numbers/26-62.htm" title="And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.">Numbers 26:62</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/numbers/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/3-39.htm" title="All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand.">Numbers 3:39</a></span>. <span class="ital">Two and twenty thousand — </span>If the particular numbers mentioned (<a href="/numbers/3-22.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.">Numbers 3:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-28.htm" title="In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.">Numbers 3:28</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-34.htm" title="And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand and two hundred.">Numbers 3:34</a>) be put together, they make twenty-two thousand three hundred. But the odd three hundred are omitted here, either according to the use of the Holy Scripture, where in so great numbers small ones are commonly neglected, or because they were the firstborn of the Levites, and therefore belonged to God already, and so could not be given to him again instead of the other firstborn. If this number of firstborn seem small to come from twenty-two thousand Levites, it must be considered, that only such firstborn are here named as were males, and such as continued in their parents’ families, not such as had erected new families of their own. Add to this, that God so ordered things by his wise providence, for divers weighty reasons, that this tribe should be much the least of all the tribes, as is evident by comparing the numbers of the other tribes, from twenty years old, (Numbers 1.,) with the number of this from a month old; and therefore it is not strange if the number of their firstborn be less than in other tribes.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/numbers/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:14-39 The Levites were in three classes, according to the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; and these were subdivided into families. The posterity of Moses were not at all honoured or privileged, but stood upon the level with other Levites; thus it was plain, that Moses did not seek the advancement of his own family, or to secure any honours to it.

Others consider the difference due to an error in the Hebrew text.<p>The tribe of Levi is shown by this census to have been by far the smallest of the tribes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39. twenty and two thousand&#8212;The result of this census, though made on conditions most advantageous to Levi, proved it to be by far the smallest in Israel. The separate numbers stated in Nu 3:22, 28, 34, when added together, amount to twenty-two thousand three hundred. The omission of the three hundred is variously accounted for&#8212;by some, because they might be first-born who were already devoted to God and could not be counted as substitutes; and by others, because in Scripture style, the sum is reckoned in round numbers. The most probable conjecture is, that as Hebrew letters are employed for figures, one letter was, in the course of transcription, taken for another of like form but smaller value.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Object.</span> But if the particular numbers, mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/3-22.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.">Numbers 3:22</a>,28,34</span>, be put together, they make exactly 22,300. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> The odd 300 are omitted here, either according to the use of the Holy Scripture, which in so great numbers small sums are commonly neglected, or because they were the first-born of the Levites, and therefore belonged to God already, and so could not be given to him again instead of the other first-born.

If this number of first-born seem very small to come from 22,000 Levites, it must be considered, that only such first-born are here named as were males, and such as continued in their parents families, not such as had erected new families of their own. Add to this, that God so ordered things by his wise providence for divers weighty reasons, that this tribe should be much the least of all the tribes, as is evident by comparing the numbers of the other tribes from twenty years old, <span class="bld"> Num 1</span>, with the number of this from a month old; and therefore it is not strange if the number of their first-born be less than in other tribes. Although if the other tribes had been computed from a month old, as this was, their number of 600,000 had probably been double or treble to that; and consequently the number of their first-born being 22,273 <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/3-43.htm" title="And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and three score and thirteen.">Numbers 3:43</a></span>, would have been as unproportionable to their whole sum, as this of 300 first-born Levites seems to their whole number. And some add, that only those first-born are numbered, both in this and in the other tribes, which were born since they came out of Egypt, when God challenged all the first-born to be his. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron,  <p>numbered at the commandment of the Lord, throughout their families,.... Whence it appears, that Moses was not alone, but Aaron with him, in numbering the Levites, and that by the appointment of the Lord. The word "Aaron", in the Hebrew text, has a dot on every letter, for what reason it is not certain; the word itself is left out in the Samaritan and Syriac versions: <p>all the males, from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand; 22,000 men; but by putting the sums together they amount to three hundred more; for of the Gershonites there were 7,500, and of the Kohathites 8,600, and of the Merarites 6,200, in all 22,300; which difficulty some endeavour to remove by saying, as Aben Ezra observes, that the Scripture takes a short way, mentioning the thousands, and leaving out the hundreds but this, he says, is not right, nor is it the way of the Scripture in this chapter: and in an after account of the firstborn of the Israelites, not only the hundreds are mentioned, but the broken number of seventy three. Others think there is a corruption crept into the text somewhere in the particular numbers, through the inadvertency of some copyist; and suppose it to be in the number of the Kohathites, where they fancy  six, is put instead of  three: but there is no occasion to suppose either of these, for which there is no foundation, since the reason why three hundred are left out in the sum total may be, because there were so many firstborn among the Levites, and these could not be exchanged for the firstborn of the other tribes; they, as such, being the Lord's, and one firstborn could not redeem another; and so it is said in the Talmud (t), these three hundred were firstborn, and there is no firstborn redeems a firstborn, or frees from the redemption price of five shekels. <p>(t) T.

There is nothing to be said against this explanation, except that no trace of it appears in a narrative otherwise very full and minute.
