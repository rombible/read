Known unto God are all his works beforehand; there is an exact proportion between them, and so it will appear, when they are compared together. The small number of first-born, over and above the number of the Levites, were to be redeemed, and the redemption-money given to Aaron. The church is called the church of the first-born, which is redeemed, not as they were, with silver and gold; but, being devoted by sin to the justice of God, is ransomed with the precious blood of the Son of God. All men are the Lord's by creation, and all true christians are his by redemption. Each should know his own post and duty; nor can any service required by such a Master be rightly accounted mean or hard.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This redemption money (see the marginal references) would perhaps be exacted from the parents of the "youngest" children of the 22,273 <a href="/numbers/3-43.htm">Numbers 3:43</a>. The cattle of the Levites was doubtless taken in the gross as an equivalent for the first-born cattle of the other tribes, which of course, no less than the first-born of men, belonged to the Lord; and in future would have to be redeemed <a href="/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-19.htm">Deuteronomy 15:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41. the cattle of the Levites&#8212;These, which they kept to graze on the glebes and meadows in the suburbs of their cities, to supply their families with dairy produce and animal food, were also taken as an equivalent for all the firstlings of the cattle which the Israelites at that time possessed. In consequence of this exchange the firstlings were not brought then, as afterwards, to the altar and the priests.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To whom all the Levites were given, and therefore the money which came in their stead. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed,....

The number of the first-born of the twelve tribes amounted to 22,273 of a month old and upwards (<a href="/numbers/3-43.htm">Numbers 3:43</a>). Of this number 22,000 were exchanged for the 22,000 Levites, and the cattle of the Levites were also set against the first-born of the cattle of the tribes of Israel, though without their being numbered and exchanged head for head. In <a href="/numbers/3-44.htm">Numbers 3:44</a> and <a href="/numbers/3-45.htm">Numbers 3:45</a> the command of God concerning the adoption of the Levites is repeated, for the purpose of adding the further instructions with regard to the 273, the number by which the first-born of the tribes exceeded those of the Levites. "And as for the redemption of the 273 (lit., the 273 to be redeemed) of the first-born of the children of Israel which were more than the Levites, thou shalt take five shekels a head," etc. This was the general price established by the law for the redemption of the first-born of men (see <a href="/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>). On the sacred shekel, see at <a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>. The redemption money for 273 first-born, in all 1365 shekels, was to be paid to Aaron and his sons as compensation for the persons who properly belonged to Jehovah, and had been appointed as first-born for the service of the priests. </body></html>
