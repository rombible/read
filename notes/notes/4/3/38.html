The posterity of Moses were not at all honoured or privileged, but stood upon the level with other Levites; thus it was plain, that Moses did not seek the advancement of his own family, or to secure any honours to it. The tribe of Levi was by much the least of all the tribes.

There is an extraordinary prick on the word Aaron, to show, as Jarchi says, that he was not in the number of Levites, though of the tribe of Levi, being high priest: <p>keeping the charge of the sanctuary, for the charge of the children of Israel; either in their room and stead, which otherwise they must have kept; or rather for their safety and security, keeping out all persons from entering into the sanctuary, who had no business there, that they died not, as it follows: <p>and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death; that is, whoever came nigh to enter into the holy place, and did, who was no priest, though an Israelite, and even a Levite, or into the most holy place, excepting the high priest, it was death unto him, either by the civil magistrate, or by the hand of heaven; so the Targum of Jonathan. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, <i>even</i> before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, <i>shall be</i> Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</span><p>(n) That no one should enter into the tabernacle contrary to God's appointment.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">38</span>. <span class="ital">Moses</span>] The mention of his name in a command given to him is strange.
