The enemies of God's church often perish by the counsels they think most wisely taken. Og, king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his neighbours, to make peace with Israel, makes war with them, which proves in like manner his destruction. Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselves and their possessions against the judgments of God; but all in vain, when the day comes on which they must fall. God gave Israel success, while Moses was with them, that he might see the beginning of the glorious work, though he must not live to see it finished. This was, in comparison, but as the day of small things, yet it was an earnest of great things. We must prepare for fresh conflicts and enemies. We must make no peace or truce with the powers of darkness, nor even treat with them; nor should we expect any pause in our contest. But, trusting in God, and obeying his commands, we shall be more than conquerors over every enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They that speak in proverbs - The original word is almost equivalent to "the poets."

The historical writers of those times, among the Amorites, who were usually poets, and wrote the history of the wars between the Moabites and Amorites in verse; as Homer among the Greeks wrote the wars of Troy; and the compositions of those ancient bards were short and compendious, and wrapped up in proverbial sayings, and enigmatical and figurative expressions, that they might be the better retained in memory, and therefore were called proverbialists. Jarchi says, they were Balaam and Beor that took up their parables, and said: <p>come into Heshbon; which words are the beginning of the song, and in which the Amorites are represented as inviting Sihon, and his nobles, to enter Heshbon, which he had taken, and make it his royal seat; or as encouraging one another to go into it and repair it, having suffered much at the taking of it, which seems to be confirmed by what follows: <p>let the city of Sihon be built and prepared; that is, let us set about rebuilding of the city, and let us fit it up for Sihon our king, and let it be called his city, and made the place of his residence, his palace, and where his court may be kept. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">they that speak in proverbs say</span>] <span class="ital">they that</span> <span class="bld">recite ballads</span> <span class="ital">say</span>. The Heb. <span class="ital">mâshâl</span> was ‘any suggestive saying that implied more than it actually said.’ This might be a ‘proverb,’ i.e. a sententious or pithy remark containing a proposition which was widely applicable in human life, or a didactic or authoritative utterance, as those of Balaam (chs. 23 f.), or a short song or ode with some special characteristic either in its contents or in its artistic construction, such as a dirge, a taunt-song over a fallen foe, or more generally a ballad.

A class of persons well marked among the Hebrews, as perhaps in all ancient countries. It was their gift, and almost their profession, to express in the sententious, antistrophic poetry of the age such thoughts or such facts as took hold of men's minds. At a time when there was little difference between poetry and rhetoric, and when the distinction was hardly drawn between the inventive faculty of man and the Divine afflatus, it is not surprising to find the word <span class="accented">mashal</span> applied to the rhapsody of Balsam (<a href="/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>), to the "taunting song" of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>), to the "riddle" of Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2</a>), as well as to the collection of earthly and heavenly wisdom in the Book of Proverbs. That which follows is a taunting song, most like to the one cited from Isaiah, the archaic character of which is marked by its strongly antithetic form and abrupt transitions, as well as by the peculiarity of some of the words. <span class="cmt_word">Come to Heshbon.</span> This may be ironically addressed to the Amorites, lately so victorious, now so overthrown; or, possibly, it may be intended to express the jubilation of the Amorites themselves in the day of their pride. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Defeat of the Amorite Kings, Sihon of Heshbon and Og of Bashan, and Conquest of their Kingdoms.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-23</a><p>When the Israelites reached the eastern border of the kingdom of the Amorite king Sihon (see at <a href="/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>), they sent messengers to him, as they had previously done to the king of Edom, to ask permission to pass peaceably through his territory upon the high road (cf. <a href="/numbers/21-22.htm">Numbers 21:22</a> and <a href="/numbers/20-17.htm">Numbers 20:17</a>); and Sihon refused this request, just as the king of Edom had done, and marched with all his people against the Israelites. But whereas the Lord forbade the Israelites to make war upon their kinsmen the Edomites, He now commanded them to make war upon the Amorite king, and take possession of his land (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-25</a>); for the Amorites belonged to the Canaanitish tribes which were ripe for the judgment of extermination (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). And if, notwithstanding this, the Israelites sent to him with words of peace (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-26.htm">Deuteronomy 2:26</a>), this was simply done to leave the decision of his fate in his own hand (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24</a>). Sihon came out against the Israelites into the desert as far as Jahza, where a battle was fought, in which he was defeated. The accounts of the Onom. concerning Jahza, which was situated, according to Eusebius, between Medamon (Medaba) and Debous (Dibon, see above), and according to Jerome, between Medaba and Deblatai, may be reconciled with the statement that it was in the desert, provided we assume that it was not in a straight line between the places named, but in a more easterly direction on the edge of the desert, near to the commencement of the Wady Wale, a conclusion to which the juxtaposition of Jahza and Mephaot in <a href="/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-21.htm">Jeremiah 48:21</a>, also points (see at <a href="/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>).</body></html>
