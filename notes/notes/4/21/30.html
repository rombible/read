The enemies of God's church often perish by the counsels they think most wisely taken. Og, king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his neighbours, to make peace with Israel, makes war with them, which proves in like manner his destruction. Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselves and their possessions against the judgments of God; but all in vain, when the day comes on which they must fall. God gave Israel success, while Moses was with them, that he might see the beginning of the glorious work, though he must not live to see it finished. This was, in comparison, but as the day of small things, yet it was an earnest of great things. We must prepare for fresh conflicts and enemies. We must make no peace or truce with the powers of darkness, nor even treat with them; nor should we expect any pause in our contest. But, trusting in God, and obeying his commands, we shall be more than conquerors over every enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Chemosh - The national God of the Moabites (compare the marginal references). The name probably means "Vanquisher," or "Master." The worship of Chemosh was introduced into Israel by Solomon <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>. It was no doubt to Chemosh that Mesha, king of Moab, offered up his son as a burnt-offering <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-26.htm">2 Kings 3:26-27</a>.<p>In the first six lines <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-27.htm">Numbers 21:27-28</a> the poet imagines for the Amorites a song of exultation for their victories over Moab, and for the consequent glories of Heshbon, their own capital. In the next lines <a href="/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a> he himself joins in this strain; which now becomes one of half-real, half-ironical compassion for the Moabites, whom their idol Chemosh was unable to save. But in the last lines <a href="/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a> a startling change takes place; the new and decisive triumph of the poet's own countrymen is abruptly introduced; and the boastings of the Arnorites fade utterly away. Of the towns Heshbon was the northernmost, and therefore, to the advancing Israelites, the last to be reached. Medeba, now Madeba, was four miles south of Heshbon (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/19-15.htm">1 Chronicles 19:15</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. people of Chemosh&#8212;the name of the Moabite idol (1Ki 11:7-33; 2Ki 23:13; Jer 48:46).<p>he&#8212;that is, their god, hath surrendered his worshippers to the victorious arms of Sihon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Though you feeble Moabites, and your god too, could not resist Sihon, we Israelites, by the help of our God, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">have shot</span>, to wit, with success and victory, as the following words show, at them, to wit, at Sihon and his Amorites; which is easily and plainly understood, both from the foregoing and following words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Heshbon, </span> the royal city of Sihon, and by him lately repaired, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">is perished</span>, is taken away from Sihon, and so is all his territory or country, even as far as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Dibon, </span> which, as some think is called <span class="ital">Dibon-gad</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/33-45.htm" title="And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.">Numbers 33:45</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which reached unto Medeba</span>, i.e. whose territory extendeth to Medeba.

Either the Amorites at the Moabites, or else the Israelites at the Amorites; for, according to Aben Ezra, these are the words of Moses, though they, with <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>, seem rather to be a continuation of the song of the old Amorite bards, describing the ruin of the country of Moab by them; and this clause may be rendered with the next, "their light, or lamp, is perished from Heshbon" (r); or their yoke, as Jarchi, and so the Vulgate Latin version; that is, their kingdom, and the glory of it, as the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan interpret it, and so Jarchi: <p>even unto Dibon; which was another city in the land of Moab; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>, <p>and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reached unto Medeba; Nophah perhaps is the same with Nebo, mentioned along with Medeba, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>, however, they were both places in Moab, and are mentioned to show how far the desolation had or would spread; and the whole is observed to prove, that this part of the country of Moab, now possessed by the Israelites, was taken from them, not by them, but by the Amorites, a people Israel now conquered, and so had a right to what they found them in the possession of. <p>(r)   "lucerna eorum, Heshbon (seilicet) periit", Tigurine version; "regnum eorum periit a Chesbon", Pagninus, Vatablus; "imperium eorum", Munster. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="bld">And</span> <span class="ital">we</span> <span class="bld">shot</span> <span class="ital">at them</span>] So the Heb. text. An extremely doubtful clause, which represents a single word in the Heb. (<span class="greekheb">וַנִּירָם</span>). If it is correct, the taunt has now ceased, and the words are those of the Israelites who triumph over the Amorites. But the sudden introduction of the first person is strange, the form of the Heb. verb is unusual, and the rhythmical division of the line is disturbed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon</span>] A very awkward expression, if it means that the people of all the towns from Heshbon to Dibon perished. Both these clauses require emendation. LXX. has <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτῶν ἀπολεῖται</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ἑσεβὼν ἕως Δαιβών</span>, which may preserve the true reading, ‘<span class="bld">and their posterity</span> (<span class="greekheb">וְנִינָם</span>) <span class="ital">perished</span> (<span class="bld">from</span>) <span class="ital">Heshbon to Dibon</span>.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And we have laid waste … Medeba</span>] This latter half of the verse is even more corrupt, and no very satisfactory solution has been proposed. A variety of emendations is possible, as may be seen in Dillmann’s note on the passage1 [Note: Pesh. reads the last three words as <span class="greekheb">אֲשֶׁר עַל מִדְבָּר</span> ‘which is on the desert.’ This is adopted by G. A. Smith (H. G. 560). The LXX. translators found the passage hopeless.] . Nothing more can be said with certainty than that the verse describes the destruction of Moabite towns.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Dibon</span>] The modern <span class="ital">Dhibân</span>, which lies in the south of what was the Amorite district, half-an-hour’s walk N.W. of Aroer, and 1½ hours from the Arnon (Baedeker’s <span class="ital">Palestine</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Nophah</span>] is unknown, and the name is probably only the result of the corruption of the text. G. A. Smith and others suggest Nobaḥ, which is mentioned with Jogbehah in <a href="/judges/8-11.htm" title="And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelled in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.">Jdg 8:11</a>; this lay to the east of Moab near the desert.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Medeba</span>] spelt Mehedeba in Mesha’s inscription. It is the modern <span class="ital">Mâdebâ</span>, two hours to the south of Heshbon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another explanation of the song, adopted by several writers, is that it celebrates a conquest of Moab by <span class="ital">Israel</span>. The verbs in <span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/21-28.htm" title="For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.">Numbers 21:28</a></span> f. can, in this case, be rendered as perfects, as in R.V. But nothing has been said of any conquest of the Moabites by Israel; indeed in the tradition preserved in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:9</a> the Israelites were forbidden to attack Moab. Hence the supporters of this interpretation understand the song to refer to a later victory over Moab, e.g. that in the 9th century which reduced Moab to pay tribute to Israel (see <a href="/2_kings/3-4.htm" title="And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep master, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.">2 Kings 3:4</a> f., and Mesha’s inscription), and suppose that the compiler inserted it at this point with no regard to the context. But even if that were possible it would leave ‘wherefore’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/21-27.htm" title="Why they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:">Numbers 21:27</a></span>) unexplained. If the words ‘unto an Amorite king Sihon’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/21-29.htm" title="Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.">Numbers 21:29</a></span>) are genuine, they definitely exclude this interpretation; but see note above.

A poetical word of somewhat doubtful meaning. It is generally supposed to be a verbal form (first person plural imperf.

The site of Nophah, perhaps the Nobah of <a href="/judges/8-11.htm">Judges 8:11</a>, is unknown. <span class="cmt_word">Which reacheth unto Medeba.</span> The reading is uncertain here as well as the meaning. The received text has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, which gives no meaning, but the circle over the <span class="accented">resh</span> marks it as suspicious. The Septuagint (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;</span>) and the Samaritan evidently read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and this has been generally followed: "we have wasted even unto Nophah, - with fire unto Medeba." Medeba, of which the ruins are still known by the same name, lay five or six miles south-south-east of Heshbon. It was a fortress in the time of David (<a href="/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>) and of Omri, as appears from the Moabite stone. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, i.e., without quarter (see <a href="/genesis/34-26.htm">Genesis 34:26</a>), and took possession of his land "from Arnon (Mojeb) to the Jabbok, unto the children of Ammon," i.e., to the upper Jabbok, the modern Nahr or Moiet Ammn. The Jabbok, now called Zerka, i.e., the blue, does not take its rise, as Seetzen supposed, on the pilgrim-road by the castle of Zerka; but its source, according to Abulfeda (tab. Syr. p. 91) and Buckingham, is the Nahr Ammn, which flowed down from the ancient capital of the Ammonites, and was called the upper Jabbok, and formed the western border of the Ammonites towards the kingdom of Sihon, and subsequently towards Gad (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-37.htm">Deuteronomy 2:37</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-16.htm">Deuteronomy 3:16</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>). "For the border of the Ammonites was strong" (firm), i.e., strongly fortified; "for which reason Sihon had only been able to push his conquests to the upper Jabbok, not into the territory of the Ammonites." This explanation of Knobel's is perfectly correct; since the reason why the Israelites did not press forward into the country of the Ammonites, was not the strength of their frontier, but the word of the Lord, "Make not war upon them, for I shall give thee no possession of the land of the children of Ammon" (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). God had only promised the patriarchs, on behalf of their posterity, that He would give them the land of Canaan, which was bounded towards the east by the Jordan (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2-12</a>; compared with <a href="/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>); and the Israelites would have received no settlement at all on the eastern side of the Jordan, had not the Canaanitish branch of the Amorites extended itself to that side in the time of Moses, and conquered a large portion of the possessions of the Moabites, and also (according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>, as compared with <a href="/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13</a>) of the Ammonites, driving back the Moabites as far as the Arnon, and the Ammonites behind the Nahr Ammn. With the defeat of the Amorites, all the land that they had conquered passed into the possession of the Israelites, who took possession of these towns (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-34.htm">Deuteronomy 2:34-36</a>). The statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25</a>, that Israel settled in all the towns of the Amorites, is somewhat anticipatory of the history itself, as the settlement did not occur till Moses gave the conquered land to the tribes of Reuben and Gad for a possession (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>). The only places mentioned here are Heshbon and her daughters, i.e., the smaller towns belonging to it (cf. <a href="/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>), which are enumerated singly in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34-38</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15-28</a>. In explanation of the expression, "Heshbon and her daughters," it is added in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a>, that Heshbon was the city, i.e., the capital of the Amorite king Sihon, who had made war upon the former king of Moab, and taken away all his land as far as the Arnon. Consequently, even down to the time of the predecessor of Balak, the king of the Moabites at that time, the land to the north of the Arnon, and probably even as far as the lower Jabbok, to which point the kingdom of Sihon extended (see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12-13</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>), belonged to the Moabites. And in accordance with this, the country where the Israelites encamped opposite to Jericho, before crossing the Jordan, is reckoned as part of the land of Moab (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-1.htm">Deuteronomy 29:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5-6</a>), and called Arboth Moab (see <a href="/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a>); whilst the women who seduced the Israelites to join in the idolatrous worship of Baal Peor are called daughters of Moab (<a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>).</body></html>
