Thus (Leviticus 18.) where the Israelites are cautioned against the commission of several enormous crimes, such as <span class="ital">offering their children to Moloch, lying with mankind as with womankind, lying with beasts, and women standing before beasts to lie down to them, </span>it is added, <span class="ital">For in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you. </span>And again, <span class="ital">— For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you. </span>Thus it appears that the destined period for their extirpation was arrived; <span class="ital">their iniquities were full, </span>and they brought down this desolation upon themselves. It must be observed, however, that this decree of utter destruction only extended to the seven nations of Canaan, all, it seems, equally sunk in guilt and depravity. The Israelites were at liberty to offer, nay, were commanded to offer, peace to other cities or states that were not of those nations, on condition that they became tributaries to them. See the whole command on this subject, (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/20-10.htm" title="When you come near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it....">Deuteronomy 20:10-18</a>,) with the reason assigned for destroying the seven nations, which is thus expressed: <span class="ital">That they teach you not to do after their abominations, which they have done unto their gods, so should you sin against the Lord your God. </span>It may be proper to observe further here, that the extirpation of this people, so sunk in idolatry and wickedness, was intended to be a warning to the Israelites themselves, and a most awful one it certainly was; and it was one which they had great need of; for such was their proneness to idolatry in that age of the world, that nothing less seemed likely to be effectual to restrain them from it, than to impress their minds with the most horrid idea of that crime, as what rendered nations accursed in the sight of God and men, and destined to be utterly extirpated from the face of the earth.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/numbers/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-3 Before the people began their march round the country of Edom, the king of Arad, a Canaanite, who inhabited the southern part of the country, attacked them in the wilderness, and took some prisoners.

The order of the narrative in these chapters, as occasionally elsewhere in this book (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-1.htm">Numbers 9:1</a>, etc.), is not that of time, but of subject matter; and the war against Arad is introduced here as the first of the series of victories gained under Moses, which the historian now takes in hand to narrate. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2, 3. Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord&#8212;Made to feel their own weakness, they implored the aid of Heaven, and, in anticipation of it, devoted the cities of this king to future destruction. The nature and consequence of such anathemas are described (Le 27:1-34; De 13:1-18). This vow of extermination against Arad [Nu 21:2] gave name to the place Hormah (slaughter and destruction) though it was not accomplished till after the passage of the Jordan. Others think Hormah the name of a town mentioned (Jos 12:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Being sensible of their own weakness, they endeavour to engage God to help them in the war, which they intended to renew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will utterly destroy their cities; </span> I will reserve no person nor thing for my own use, but devote them all to total destruction, which was the consequent of such vows.

If it was right to destroy the Canaanites at all, no fault can be found with the vow; it merely did for that military proceeding what national feeling and discipline does for the far more bloody exigencies of modern warfare, removing it from the sphere of private hatred, revenge, and cupidity, and placing it upon a higher level. The patriot soldier of these days feels himself to be a mere instrument in the hands of the rulers of his people to maintain their rights or avenge their wrongs. The Israelite could not have this feeling, which was foreign to his time and place in history, but he could feel that he was a mere instrument in the hands of God to perform <span class="accented">his</span> will upon <span class="accented">his</span> enemies. In either case a must important advantage is secured; the soldier does not slay in order to gratify his own hatred, or in order to satisfy his own cupidity. It is quite true that such vows as are here mentioned would certainly in a more advanced stage of civilization be abused to throw a cloak of religion over frightful enormities; but it does not in the least follow that they were not permitted and even encouraged by God in an age to which they were natural, and under circumstances in which they were beneficial. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Death of Aaron at Mount Hor. - The Israelites left Kadesh, and passed along the road just mentioned to Mount Hor. This mountain, which was situated, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-37.htm">Numbers 33:37</a>, on the border of the land of Edom, is placed by Josephus (Ant. iv. 4, 7) in the neighbourhood of Petra; so also by Eusebius and Jerome: "Or mons, in quo mortuus est Aaron, juxta civitatem Petram." According to modern travellers, it is Mount Harun, on the north-western side of Wady Musa (Petra), which is described by Robinson (vol. ii. p. 508) as "a cone irregularly truncated, having three ragged points or peaks, of which that upon the north-east is the highest, and has upon it the Muhammedan Wely, or tomb of Aaron," from which the mountain has received its name "Harun," i.e., Aaron (vid., Burckhardt, Syr. pp. 715, 716; v. Schubert, Reise, ii. pp. 419ff.; Ritter, Erdkunde, xiv. pp. 1127ff.). There can be no doubt as to the general correctness of this tradition;<p>(Note: There is no force whatever in the arguments by which Knobel has endeavoured to prove that it is incorrect. The first objection, viz., that the Hebrews reached Mount Hor from Kadesh in a single march, has no foundation in the biblical text, and cannot be inferred from the circumstance that there is no place of encampment mentioned between Kadesh and Mount Hor; for, on the one hand, we may clearly see, not only from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10</a>, but even from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1</a>, as compared with <a href="/numbers/33-41.htm">Numbers 33:41</a>. and <a href="/numbers/33-12.htm">Numbers 33:12</a>., that only those places of encampment are mentioned in the historical account where events occurred that were worthy of narrating; and, on the other hand, it is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>, that the Israelites sometimes continued marching for several days before they formed an encampment again. The second objection - viz., that if Hor was near Petra, it is impossible to see how the advance of the Hebrews from Kadesh to Hor could be regarded by the king of Arad, who lived more than thirty hours' journey to the north, as coming (<a href="/numbers/33-40.htm">Numbers 33:40</a>), not to mention "coming by the way of the spies" (<a href="/numbers/21-1.htm">Numbers 21:1</a>), and how this king could come into conflict with the Hebrews when posted at Petra - rests upon the erroneous assumption, that the attack of the king of Arad did not take place till after the death of Aaron, because it is not mentioned till afterwards. Lastly, the third objection - viz., that a march from Kadesh in a south-westerly direction to Wady Musa, and then northwards past Zalmona to Phunon (<a href="/numbers/33-41.htm">Numbers 33:41</a>), is much too adventurous - is overthrown by <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>, where the Israelites are said to have gone from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea. (See the notes on <a href="/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10</a>.))<p>for even if the Mohammedan tradition concerning Aaron's grave is not well accredited, the situation of this mountain is in perfect harmony with the statement in <a href="/numbers/20-23.htm">Numbers 20:23</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-37.htm">Numbers 33:37</a>, viz., that the Israelites had then reached the border of the land of Edom. The place where the people encamped is called Mosera in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6</a>, and Moseroth in the list of stations in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-30.htm">Numbers 33:30</a>, and is at all events to be sought for in the Arabah, in the neighbourhood of Mount Hor, though it is altogether unknown to us. The camp of 600,000 men, with their wives, children, and flocks, would certainly require a space miles wide, and might therefore easily stretch from the mouths of the Wady el Weibeh and Wady Ghuweir, in the Arabah, to the neighbourhood of Mount Harun. The place of encampment is called after this mountain, Hor, both here and in <a href="/numbers/33-37.htm">Numbers 33:37</a>., because it was there that Aaron died and was buried. The Lord foretold his death to Moses, and directed him to take off Aaron's priestly robes, and put them upon Eleazar his son, as Aaron was not to enter the promised land, because they (Aaron and Moses) had opposed the command of Jehovah at the water of strife (see at <a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>). "Gathered to his people," like the patriarchs (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>, <a href="/genesis/25-17.htm">Genesis 25:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-29.htm">Genesis 35:29</a>; <a href="/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>). </body></html>
