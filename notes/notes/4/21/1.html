Arad seems rather to be the name of a place, city, or country, of which the Canaanite was king, than the name of a man, since we read of the king of Arad, <a href="/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a> see also <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a> and so the Targums of Onkelos and Jerusalem here render it, the king of Arad; and the Targum of Jonathan says, he changed his seat and reigned in Arad, which might have its name from Arvad, a son of Canaan, <a href="/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a> and Jerom says (n), that Arath, the same with Arad, is a city of the Amorites, near the wilderness of Kadesh, and that to this day it is shown, a village four miles from Malatis and twenty from Hebron, in the tribe of Judah; and so Aben Ezra observes, that the ancients say, this is Sihon (the king of the Amorites), and he is called a Canaanite, because all the Amorites are Canaanites; but, according to Jarchi, the Amalekites are meant, as it is said, "the Amalekites dwell in the land of the south": <a href="/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a> and so the Targum of Jonathan here,"and when Amalek heard, that dwelt in the land of the south;''what he heard is particularly expressed in the following clause: <p>heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies: either after the manner of spies, or rather by the way in which the spies went thirty eight years ago, which was the way of the south, where this Canaanitish king dwelt, see <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>, the Septuagint version leaves the word untranslated, taking it for the name of a place, and reads, "by the way of Atharim", so the Samaritan Pentateuch and Arabic version; and did such a place appear to have been hereabout, it would be the most likely sense of the passage; for as the spies were never discovered by the Canaanites, the way they went could not be known by them; nor is it very probable that, if it had been known, it should be so called, since nothing of any consequence to them as yet followed upon it: <p>then he fought against Israel; raised his forces and marched out against them, to oppose their passage, and engaged in a battle with them: <p>and took some of them prisoners; according to the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem, great numbers of them; but Jarchi says, only one single maidservant. <p>(n) De locis Heb. fol. 87.

R.V. marg. retains the rendering of A.V. ‘the spies,’ a suggestion derived from the Targum. Dillmann refers to an Arabic word <span class="ital">athar</span>, ‘a footprint,’ or ‘trace,’ and suggests that ‘the way of Atharim’ might mean ‘the track-way,’ i.e. ‘the caravan route.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1–3</span>. The attack made upon Israel by the Canaanites and Israel’s victory over them at Hormah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The source of this passage is a great problem. The verses appear to imply a movement on the part of the Israelites northwards from the desert through the Negeb. They have no connexion with <span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/21-4.htm" title="And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.">Numbers 21:4</a></span> ff., in which the people moved S.E. towards the Red Sea. And it is difficult to find any point in the narratives of the wanderings to which a northward movement with a successful battle can belong, on the supposition that the passage has been misplaced, and that it belongs to J E . Possibly, however, it is to be ascribed to E . It is contradictory to the account in <a href="/context/numbers/14-40.htm" title="And they rose up early in the morning, and got them up into the top of the mountain, saying, See, we be here, and will go up to the place which the LORD has promised: for we have sinned....">Numbers 14:40-45</a> (J ), where it is stated that the Israelites were defeated by the Canaanites at Hormah. It is noteworthy that <a href="/judges/1-17.htm" title="And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.">Jdg 1:17</a> contains a narrative which is closely similar to the present one; it relates a victory over the Canaanites at Hormah, and (as here) the name Hormah is explained by a play on the word <span class="ital">ḥçrem</span> ‘a ban’; and Hormah, moreover, is mentioned in close conjunction with Arad. But the conquerors are not the whole of Israel but the tribes of Judah and Simeon, with whom the Kenites had moved into the district. It is far from impossible that the two passages are closely connected. In the present passage it is strange that the Israelites, after gaining such a decisive victory, should not have moved further northwards, and established themselves at once in Canaan. And an increasing number of modern students think that they actually did so, and that this passage is an isolated fragment from a circle of traditions according to which some of the Israelites did not travel round to Moab with the main body, but entered Canaan straight from the southern deserts. If that theory were correct, we should have to conclude that the victory which <a href="/judges/1-17.htm" title="And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.">Jdg 1:17</a> ascribes to Judah and Simeon with the Kenites is, in the present form of the verses before us, ascribed less accurately to the whole of Israel.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell.</span> Rather, "And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, which dwelt in the Negeb, heard tell." It is possible that Arad was the name of the king (it occurs as the name of a man, <a href="/1_chronicles/8-15.htm">1 Chronicles 8:15</a>), but it was almost certainly the name of his place. The "king of Arad, is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>, and "the Negeb of Arad" in <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>. From the context of these passages it is evident that it was situated in the southernmost district of what was afterwards the territory of Judah.

According to modern travellers, it is Mount Harun, on the north-western side of Wady Musa (Petra), which is described by Robinson (vol. ii. p. 508) as "a cone irregularly truncated, having three ragged points or peaks, of which that upon the north-east is the highest, and has upon it the Muhammedan Wely, or tomb of Aaron," from which the mountain has received its name "Harun," i.e., Aaron (vid., Burckhardt, Syr. pp. 715, 716; v. Schubert, Reise, ii. pp. 419ff.; Ritter, Erdkunde, xiv. pp. 1127ff.). There can be no doubt as to the general correctness of this tradition;<p>(Note: There is no force whatever in the arguments by which Knobel has endeavoured to prove that it is incorrect. The first objection, viz., that the Hebrews reached Mount Hor from Kadesh in a single march, has no foundation in the biblical text, and cannot be inferred from the circumstance that there is no place of encampment mentioned between Kadesh and Mount Hor; for, on the one hand, we may clearly see, not only from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10</a>, but even from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1</a>, as compared with <a href="/numbers/33-41.htm">Numbers 33:41</a>. and <a href="/numbers/33-12.htm">Numbers 33:12</a>., that only those places of encampment are mentioned in the historical account where events occurred that were worthy of narrating; and, on the other hand, it is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>, that the Israelites sometimes continued marching for several days before they formed an encampment again. The second objection - viz., that if Hor was near Petra, it is impossible to see how the advance of the Hebrews from Kadesh to Hor could be regarded by the king of Arad, who lived more than thirty hours' journey to the north, as coming (<a href="/numbers/33-40.htm">Numbers 33:40</a>), not to mention "coming by the way of the spies" (<a href="/numbers/21-1.htm">Numbers 21:1</a>), and how this king could come into conflict with the Hebrews when posted at Petra - rests upon the erroneous assumption, that the attack of the king of Arad did not take place till after the death of Aaron, because it is not mentioned till afterwards. Lastly, the third objection - viz., that a march from Kadesh in a south-westerly direction to Wady Musa, and then northwards past Zalmona to Phunon (<a href="/numbers/33-41.htm">Numbers 33:41</a>), is much too adventurous - is overthrown by <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>, where the Israelites are said to have gone from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea. (See the notes on <a href="/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10</a>.))<p>for even if the Mohammedan tradition concerning Aaron's grave is not well accredited, the situation of this mountain is in perfect harmony with the statement in <a href="/numbers/20-23.htm">Numbers 20:23</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-37.htm">Numbers 33:37</a>, viz., that the Israelites had then reached the border of the land of Edom. The place where the people encamped is called Mosera in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6</a>, and Moseroth in the list of stations in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-30.htm">Numbers 33:30</a>, and is at all events to be sought for in the Arabah, in the neighbourhood of Mount Hor, though it is altogether unknown to us. The camp of 600,000 men, with their wives, children, and flocks, would certainly require a space miles wide, and might therefore easily stretch from the mouths of the Wady el Weibeh and Wady Ghuweir, in the Arabah, to the neighbourhood of Mount Harun. The place of encampment is called after this mountain, Hor, both here and in <a href="/numbers/33-37.htm">Numbers 33:37</a>., because it was there that Aaron died and was buried. The Lord foretold his death to Moses, and directed him to take off Aaron's priestly robes, and put them upon Eleazar his son, as Aaron was not to enter the promised land, because they (Aaron and Moses) had opposed the command of Jehovah at the water of strife (see at <a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>). "Gathered to his people," like the patriarchs (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>, <a href="/genesis/25-17.htm">Genesis 25:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-29.htm">Genesis 35:29</a>; <a href="/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>). </body></html>
