The end of their pilgrimage was near. They set forward. It were well if we did thus; and the nearer we come to heaven, were so much the more active and abundant in the work of the Lord. The wonderful success God granted to his people, is here spoken of, and, among the rest, their actions on the river Arnon, at Vaheb in Suphah, and other places on that river. In every stage of our lives, nay, in every step, we should notice what God has wrought for us; what he did at such a time, and what in such a place, ought to be distinctly remembered. God blessed his people with a supply of water. When we come to heaven, we shall remove to the well of life, the fountain of living waters. They received it with joy and thankfulness, which made the mercy doubly sweet. With joy must we draw water out of the wells of salvation, Isa 12:3. As the brazen serpent was a figure of Christ, who is lifted up for our cure, so is this well a figure of the Spirit, who is poured forth for our comfort, and from whom flow to us rivers of living waters, Joh 7:38,39. Does this well spring up in our souls? If so, we should take the comfort to ourselves, and give the glory to God. God promised to give water, but they must open the ground. God's favours must be expected in the use of such means as are within our power, but still the power is only of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the country of Moab - Rather, in the field of Moab: the upland pastures, or flat downs, intersected by the ravine of Wady Waleh.<p>Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon - Or, "toward the waste."

From the summit the Israelites gained their first view of the wastes of the Dead Sea and of the valley of the Jordan: and Moses again ascended it, to view, before his death, the land of promise. The interest attaching to the spot, and the need of a convenient name for it, has led Christians often to designate it as "Nebo," rather than as "the mountain of, or near to, Nebo;" but the latter is the more correct: Nebo denoted the town <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a> on the western slope of the ridge. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17, 18.

The original runs simply thus: "And from Bamoth - the valley which in the field - Moab - the top - Pisgah." It may therefore be read, "And from the heights to the valley that is in the field of Moab, viz., the top of Pisgah." The "field" of Moab (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>) was no doubt the open, treeless expanse north of Arnon, drained by the Wady Waleh, which had formerly belonged to Moab. Pisgah ("the ridge") was a part of the Abarim ranges west of Heshbon, from the summit of which the first view is gained of the valley of Jordan and the hills of Palestine (cf. <a href="/numbers/33-47.htm">Numbers 33:47</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-27.htm">Deuteronomy 3:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which looketh toward Jeshimon.</span> Jeshimon, or "the waste," seems to mean here that desert plain on the north-east side of the Salt Sea now called the Ghor el Belka, which included in its barren desolation the southernmost portion of the Jordan valley. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Therefore," sc., because the Lord had thus given king Sihon, with all his land, into the hand of Israel, "it is written in the book of the wars of the Lord: Vaheb (Jehovah takes) in storm, and the brooks of Arnon and the valley of the brooks, which turns to the dwelling of Ar, and leans upon the border of Moab." The book of the wars of Jehovah is neither an Amoritish book of the conflicts of Baal, in which the warlike feats performed by Sihon and other Amoritish heroes with the help of Baal were celebrated in verse, as G. Unruh fabulously asserts in his Zug der Isr. aus Aeg. nach Canaan (p. 130), nor a work "dating from the time of Jehoshaphat, containing the early history of the Israelites, from the Hebrew patriarchs till past the time of Joshua, with the law interwoven," which is the character that Knobel's critical fancy would stamp upon it, but a collection of odes of the time of Moses himself, in celebration of the glorious acts of the Lord to and for the Israelites; and "the quotation bears the same relation to the history itself, as the verses of Krner would bear to the writings of any historian of the wars of freedom, who had himself taken part in these wars, and introduced the verses into his own historical work" (Hengstenberg).<p>(Note: "That such a book should arise in the last days of Moses, when the youthful generation began for the first time to regard and manifest itself, both vigorously and generally, as the army of Jehovah, is so far from being a surprising fact, that we can scarcely imagine a more suitable time for the commencement of such a work" (Baumgarten). And if this is the case, the allusion to this collection of odes cannot be adduced as an argument against the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, since Moses certainly did not write out the history of the journey from Kadesh to the Arboth Moab until after the two kings of the Amorites had been defeated, and the land to the east of the Jordan conquered, or till the Israelites had encamped in the steppes of Moab, opposite to Jericho.)<p>The strophe selected from the ode has neither subject nor verb in it, as the ode was well known to the contemporaries, and what had to be supplied could easily be gathered from the title, "Wars of Jehovah." Vaheb is no doubt the proper name of an Amoritish fortress; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492;, "in storm," is to be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>, "The Lord, in the storm is His way." "Advancing in storm, He took Vaheb and the brooks of Arnon," i.e., the different wadys, valleys cut by brooks, which open into the Arnon. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;, lit., pouring of the brooks, from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;, effusio, the pouring, then the place where brooks pour down, the slope of mountains or hills, for which the term &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1492; is generally used in the plural, particularly to denote the slopes of the mountains of Pisgah (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-20.htm">Joshua 13:20</a>), and the hilly region of Palestine, which formed the transition from the mountains to the plain (<a href="/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a> and <a href="/joshua/12-8.htm">Joshua 12:8</a>). &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;, the dwelling, used poetically for the dwelling-place, as in <a href="/2_samuel/23-7.htm">2 Samuel 23:7</a> and <a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3</a>. &#1506;&#1512; (Ar), the antiquated form for &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, a city, is the same as Ar Moab in <a href="/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>, "the city of Moab, on the border of the Arnon, which is at the end of the (Moabitish) territory" (<a href="/numbers/22-36.htm">Numbers 22:36</a>). It was called Areopolis by the Greeks, and was near to Aror (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a> and <a href="/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>), probably standing at the confluence of the Lejum and Mojeb, in the "fine green pasture land, in the midst of which there is a hill with some ruins," and not far away the ruin of a small castle, with a heap of broken columns (Burckhardt, Syr. p. 636). This Ar is not to be identified with the modern Rabba, in the midst of the land of the Moabites, six hours to the south of Lejum, to which the name Areopolis was transferred in the patristic age, probably after the destruction of Ar, the ancient Areopolis, by an earthquake, of which Jerome gives an account in connection with his own childhood (see his Com. on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1-9</a>), possibly the earthquake which occurred in the year a.d. 342, and by which many cities of the East were destroyed, and among others Nicomedia (cf. Hengstenberg, Balaam, pp. 525-528; Ritter, Erdkunde, xv. pp. 1212ff.; and v. Raumer, Palstina, pp. 270, 271, Ed. 4).</body></html>
