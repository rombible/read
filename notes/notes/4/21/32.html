The enemies of God's church often perish by the counsels they think most wisely taken. Og, king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his neighbours, to make peace with Israel, makes war with them, which proves in like manner his destruction. Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselves and their possessions against the judgments of God; but all in vain, when the day comes on which they must fall. God gave Israel success, while Moses was with them, that he might see the beginning of the glorious work, though he must not live to see it finished. This was, in comparison, but as the day of small things, yet it was an earnest of great things. We must prepare for fresh conflicts and enemies. We must make no peace or truce with the powers of darkness, nor even treat with them; nor should we expect any pause in our contest. But, trusting in God, and obeying his commands, we shall be more than conquerors over every enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jaazer - To he identified probably with the ruins Sir or es-Sir 10 miles north of Heshbon.

If the present passage is compared with <a href="/context/deuteronomy/3-1.htm" title="Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei....">Deuteronomy 3:1-3</a> it will be seen that it agrees almost <span class="ital">verbatim</span> with the latter, except for the substitution of the third person for the first. In the Pesh. version there are several insertions in Numbers of passages from Deut., and this is probably an earlier instance in the Heb. text. It is to be noticed also that there is no reference to Og in <a href="/numbers/22-2.htm" title="And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.">Numbers 22:2</a>. The account of the conquest of Bashan, therefore, is not preserved in any tradition earlier than Deut., and many writers on that account doubt if it is historical. The question cannot be decided with certainty; but there is nothing in the nature of the case to render such a conquest improbable. Bashan was a fertile and attractive district; and there is no evidence that Israel stayed east of the Jordan such a short time as to make an advance to the north improbable. See G. A.

The Jabbok, now called Zerka, i.e., the blue, does not take its rise, as Seetzen supposed, on the pilgrim-road by the castle of Zerka; but its source, according to Abulfeda (tab. Syr. p. 91) and Buckingham, is the Nahr Ammn, which flowed down from the ancient capital of the Ammonites, and was called the upper Jabbok, and formed the western border of the Ammonites towards the kingdom of Sihon, and subsequently towards Gad (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-37.htm">Deuteronomy 2:37</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-16.htm">Deuteronomy 3:16</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>). "For the border of the Ammonites was strong" (firm), i.e., strongly fortified; "for which reason Sihon had only been able to push his conquests to the upper Jabbok, not into the territory of the Ammonites." This explanation of Knobel's is perfectly correct; since the reason why the Israelites did not press forward into the country of the Ammonites, was not the strength of their frontier, but the word of the Lord, "Make not war upon them, for I shall give thee no possession of the land of the children of Ammon" (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). God had only promised the patriarchs, on behalf of their posterity, that He would give them the land of Canaan, which was bounded towards the east by the Jordan (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2-12</a>; compared with <a href="/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>); and the Israelites would have received no settlement at all on the eastern side of the Jordan, had not the Canaanitish branch of the Amorites extended itself to that side in the time of Moses, and conquered a large portion of the possessions of the Moabites, and also (according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>, as compared with <a href="/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13</a>) of the Ammonites, driving back the Moabites as far as the Arnon, and the Ammonites behind the Nahr Ammn. With the defeat of the Amorites, all the land that they had conquered passed into the possession of the Israelites, who took possession of these towns (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-34.htm">Deuteronomy 2:34-36</a>). The statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25</a>, that Israel settled in all the towns of the Amorites, is somewhat anticipatory of the history itself, as the settlement did not occur till Moses gave the conquered land to the tribes of Reuben and Gad for a possession (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>). The only places mentioned here are Heshbon and her daughters, i.e., the smaller towns belonging to it (cf. <a href="/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>), which are enumerated singly in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34-38</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15-28</a>. In explanation of the expression, "Heshbon and her daughters," it is added in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a>, that Heshbon was the city, i.e., the capital of the Amorite king Sihon, who had made war upon the former king of Moab, and taken away all his land as far as the Arnon. Consequently, even down to the time of the predecessor of Balak, the king of the Moabites at that time, the land to the north of the Arnon, and probably even as far as the lower Jabbok, to which point the kingdom of Sihon extended (see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12-13</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>), belonged to the Moabites. And in accordance with this, the country where the Israelites encamped opposite to Jericho, before crossing the Jordan, is reckoned as part of the land of Moab (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-1.htm">Deuteronomy 29:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5-6</a>), and called Arboth Moab (see <a href="/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a>); whilst the women who seduced the Israelites to join in the idolatrous worship of Baal Peor are called daughters of Moab (<a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>).</body></html>
