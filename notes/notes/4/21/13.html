The end of their pilgrimage was near. They set forward. It were well if we did thus; and the nearer we come to heaven, were so much the more active and abundant in the work of the Lord. The wonderful success God granted to his people, is here spoken of, and, among the rest, their actions on the river Arnon, at Vaheb in Suphah, and other places on that river. In every stage of our lives, nay, in every step, we should notice what God has wrought for us; what he did at such a time, and what in such a place, ought to be distinctly remembered. God blessed his people with a supply of water. When we come to heaven, we shall remove to the well of life, the fountain of living waters. They received it with joy and thankfulness, which made the mercy doubly sweet. With joy must we draw water out of the wells of salvation, Isa 12:3. As the brazen serpent was a figure of Christ, who is lifted up for our cure, so is this well a figure of the Spirit, who is poured forth for our comfort, and from whom flow to us rivers of living waters, Joh 7:38,39. Does this well spring up in our souls? If so, we should take the comfort to ourselves, and give the glory to God. God promised to give water, but they must open the ground. God's favours must be expected in the use of such means as are within our power, but still the power is only of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Arnon, now the Wady Mojeb, an impetuous torrent, divided the territory which remained to the Moabites from that which the Amorites had wrested from them, <a href="/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. pitched on the other side of Arnon&#8212;now El-Mojib, a deep, broad, and rapid stream, dividing the dominions of the Moabites and Amorites.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">On the other side of Arnon, </span> or rather, <span class="ital">on this side of Arnon</span>, for so it now was to the Israelites, who had not yet passed over it, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm" title="Rise you up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.">Deu 2:24</a></span>.

At an earlier time the Moabites had possessed some land north of the river, and the Ammonites had lived north of them as far as the Jabbok. But shortly before the arrival of the Israelites, the Amorites had driven the Ammonites eastward into the desert, and the Moabites to the south of the Arnon (<span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/21-26.htm" title="For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.">Numbers 21:26</a></span>, <a href="/judges/11-22.htm" title="And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to Jordan.">Jdg 11:22</a>).
