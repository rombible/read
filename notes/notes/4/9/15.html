Thus we are taught to see God always near us, both night and day. As long as the cloud rested on the tabernacle, so long they continued in the same place. There is no time lost, while we are waiting God's time. When the cloud was taken up, they removed, however comfortably they were encamped. We are kept at uncertainty concerning the time of our putting off the earthly house of this tabernacle, that we may be always ready to remove at the command of the Lord. It is very safe and pleasant going when we see God before us, and resting where he appoints us to rest. The leading of this cloud is spoken of as signifying the guidance of the blessed Spirit. We are not now to expect such tokens of the Divine presence and guidance; but the promise is sure to all God's spiritual Israel, that he will guide them by his counsel. Ps 73:24, even unto death, Ps 48:14. All the children of God shall be led by the Spirit of God, Ro 8:14. He will direct the paths of those who in all their ways acknowledge him, Pr 3:6. At the commandment of the Lord, our hearts should always move and rest, saying, Father, thy will be done; dispose of me and mine as thou pleasest. What thou wilt, and where thou wilt; only let me be thine, and always in the way of my duty. In applying general precepts to particular circumstances, there should be good counsel and fervent prayer. When any undertaking is evidently wrong, or doubtfully right, and yet the mind leans that way, in such a case the moving of the cloud, as men sometimes miscall it, is generally no more than a temptation Satan is permitted to propose; and men fancy they are following the Lord, when they are following their own wayward inclinations. The record of his mercy will conduct us with unerring truth, through Christ, to everlasting peace. Follow the pillar of the cloud and of fire. Lay the BIBLE to heart, and receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The cloud ... - The phenomenon first appeared at the Exodus itself, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>.

A Cloud Guides the Israelites.<p>15. the cloud covered the tabernacle&#8212;The inspired historian here enters on an entirely new subject, which might properly have formed a separate chapter, beginning at this verse and ending at Nu 10:29 [Calmet]. The cloud was a visible token of God's special presence and guardian care of the Israelites (Ex 14:20; Ps 105:39). It was easily distinguishable from all other clouds by its peculiar form and its fixed position; for from the day of the completion of the tabernacle it rested by day as a dark, by night as a fiery, column on that part of the sanctuary which contained the ark of the testimony (Le 16:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">1490</span> Of <span class="ital">the cloud</span>, see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">The tabernacle, namely, </span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the tent of the testimony, </span> or, <span class="ital">the tabernacle towards</span> or <span class="ital">above the tent of the testimony</span>, i.e. that part of the tabernacle in which was the testimony, or the ark of the testimony; for there the cloudy pillar stood, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat, which is on the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.">Leviticus 16:2</a></span>.

Everything after that was but preparatory to the approaching departure, and therefore is narrated not in any order of time, but either as it referred back to the first day of the first month, or forward to the twentieth day of the second month. <span class="cmt_word">The cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony.</span> The testimony was the decalogue written on the two tables of stone, and enshrined within the ark, the moral law which lay at the heart of Judaism. The tent of the testimony was the holy of holies in which the ark dwelt (see on Numbers 10:11; 18:2). The exact meaning of the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5bb;&#x5d7;</span> is disputed, or the rather significance of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> with which the phrase "tent of the testimony" is appended to the word "tabernacle" (dwelling). Some take it as equivalent in construction to the genitive, "the dwelling of the tent of the testimony;" in which case it would simply mean that the cloud covered the whole tabernacle, the <span class="accented">mishcan</span> which enveloped and enclosed the <span class="accented">ohel</span>, which again enshrined the ark and the testimony. Others take <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> here in the sense of "at" or "towards," and read, "covered the dwelling, towards the tent of the testimony," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, over that part of it in which the testimony was kept. Apart from the strict grammatical question, the comparison of other passages cited (especially <a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>) seems in favour of the first interpretation, and so apparently the Septuagint and the Targums. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehovah gave these general instructions: "Every one who is defiled by a corpse or upon a distant<p>(Note: The &#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1492; is marked as suspicious by puncta extraordinaria, probably first of all simply on the ground that the more exact definition is not found in <a href="/numbers/9-13.htm">Numbers 9:13</a>. The Rabbins suppose the marks to indicate that rechokah is not to be taken here in its literal sense, but denotes merely distance from Jerusalem, or from the threshold of the outer court of the temple. See Mishnah Pesach ix. 2, with the commentaries of Bartenora and Maimonides, and the conjectures of the Pesikta on the ten passages in the Pentateuch with punctis extraordinariis, in Drusii notae uberiores ad h. v.)<p>journey, of you and your future families, shall keep the Passover in the second month on the fourteenth, between the two evenings," and that in all respects according to the statute of this feast, the three leading points of which - viz., eating the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, leaving nothing till the next day, and not breaking a bone (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-10.htm">Exodus 12:10</a>, <a href="/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a>), - are repeated here. But lest any one should pervert this permission, to celebrate the Passover a month later in case of insuperable difficulties, which had only been given for the purpose of enforcing the obligation to keep the covenant meal upon every member of the nation, into an excuse for postponing it without any necessity and merely from indifference, on the ground that he could make it up afterwards, the threat is held out in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-13.htm">Numbers 9:13</a>, that whoever should omit to keep the feast at the legal time, if he was neither unclean nor upon a journey, should be cut off; and in <a href="/numbers/9-14.htm">Numbers 9:14</a> the command is repeated with reference to foreigners, that they were also to keep the law and ordinance with the greatest minuteness when they observed the Passover: cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48-49</a>, according to which the stranger was required first of all to let himself be circumcised.
