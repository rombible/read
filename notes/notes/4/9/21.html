Thus we are taught to see God always near us, both night and day. As long as the cloud rested on the tabernacle, so long they continued in the same place. There is no time lost, while we are waiting God's time. When the cloud was taken up, they removed, however comfortably they were encamped. We are kept at uncertainty concerning the time of our putting off the earthly house of this tabernacle, that we may be always ready to remove at the command of the Lord. It is very safe and pleasant going when we see God before us, and resting where he appoints us to rest. The leading of this cloud is spoken of as signifying the guidance of the blessed Spirit. We are not now to expect such tokens of the Divine presence and guidance; but the promise is sure to all God's spiritual Israel, that he will guide them by his counsel. Ps 73:24, even unto death, Ps 48:14. All the children of God shall be led by the Spirit of God, Ro 8:14. He will direct the paths of those who in all their ways acknowledge him, Pr 3:6. At the commandment of the Lord, our hearts should always move and rest, saying, Father, thy will be done; dispose of me and mine as thou pleasest. What thou wilt, and where thou wilt; only let me be thine, and always in the way of my duty. In applying general precepts to particular circumstances, there should be good counsel and fervent prayer. When any undertaking is evidently wrong, or doubtfully right, and yet the mind leans that way, in such a case the moving of the cloud, as men sometimes miscall it, is generally no more than a temptation Satan is permitted to propose; and men fancy they are following the Lord, when they are following their own wayward inclinations. The record of his mercy will conduct us with unerring truth, through Christ, to everlasting peace. Follow the pillar of the cloud and of fire.

Many incidents show that the Israelites had strongly imbibed this nomad habit and were desirous of hastening to Canaan. But still the phases of the cloud indicated the command of God: and whatsoever irksomeness they might have felt in remaining long stationary in camp, "when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, they kept the charge of the Lord, and journeyed not." Happy for them had they always exhibited this spirit of obedience! and happy for all if, through the wilderness of this world, we implicitly follow the leadings of God's Providence and the directions of God's Word!   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And so it was when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,....

It is not necessary to press the question whether the writer thought that, when the encampment was for a single night’s rest, the whole elaborate structure was erected.

This cloud had come down upon the dwelling when the tabernacle was erected, whilst the glory of the Lord filled the holy of holies (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-38</a>). In <a href="/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15</a> the historian refers to this fact, and then describes more fully what had been already briefly alluded to in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-36.htm">Exodus 40:36-37</a>, namely, that when the cloud rose up from the dwelling of the tabernacle it was a sign for removing, and when it came down upon the dwelling, a sign for encamping. In <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15</a>, "on the day of the setting up of the dwelling," <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>, is resumed; and in <a href="/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15</a> the appearance of the cloud during the night, from evening till morning, is described in accordance with <a href="/exodus/40-38.htm">Exodus 40:38</a>. (On the fact itself, see the exposition of <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). &#1492;&#1506;&#1491;&#1514; &#1500;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, "the dwelling of the tent of witness" (&#1500; used for the genitive to avoid a double construct state: Ewald, 292, a). In the place of ohel mod, "tent of the meeting of Jehovah with His people," we have here "tent of witness" (or "testimony"), i.e., of the tables with the decalogue which were laid up in the ark of the covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>), because the decalogue formed the basis of the covenant of Jehovah with Israel, and the pledge of the gracious presence of the Lord in the tabernacle. In the place of "dwellings of the tent of witness," we have "dwelling of witness" (testimony) in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a>, and "tent of witness" in <a href="/numbers/18-2.htm">Numbers 18:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-8.htm">Numbers 17:8</a>, to denote the whole dwelling, as divided into the holy place and the holy of holies, and not the holy of holies alone. This is unmistakeably evident from a comparison of the verse before us with <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>, according to which the cloud covered not merely one portion of the tabernacle, but the whole of the tent of meeting (ohel mod). The rendering, "the cloud covered the dwelling at the tent of witness," i.e., at that part of it in which the witness (or "testimony") was kept, viz., the holy of holies, which Rosenmller and Knobel adopt, cannot be sustained, inasmuch as &#1500; has no such meaning, but simply conveys the idea of motion and passage into a place or condition (cf. Ewald, 217, d); and the dwelling or tabernacle was not first made into the tent of witness through the cloud which covered it.</body></html>
