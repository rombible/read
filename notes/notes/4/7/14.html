Here is an example to those in authority, and of the highest rank; they ought to use their honour and power, their estate and interest, to promote religion and the service of God in the places where they live. Though it was a time of joy and rejoicing, yet still, in the midst of their sacrifices, we find a sin-offering. As, in our best services, we are conscious that there is sin, there should be repentance, even in our most joyful services. In all approaches to God we must by faith look to Christ as the Sin-offering. They brought their offerings each on a day. God's work should not be done confusedly, or in a hurry; take time, and we shall have done the sooner, or, at least, we shall have done the better. If services are to be done for twelve days together, we must not call it a task and a burden. All their offerings were the same; all the tribes of Israel had an equal share in the altar, and an equal interest in the sacrifices offered upon it. He who now spake to Moses, as the Shechinah or Divine Majesty, from between the Cherubim, was the Eternal Word, the second Person in the Trinity; for all God's communion with man is by his Son, by whom he made the world, and rules the church, who is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The several princes make their offerings in the order assigned to the tribes <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>. It was doubtless the tribes themselves which presented these gifts through their chiefs. The twelve offerings are strictly alike, and were offered on twelve separate days. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-17. He that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon &#8230; of the tribe of Judah, &c.&#8212;Judah having had the precedence assigned to it, the prince or head of that tribe was the first admitted to offer as its representative; and his offering, as well as that of the others, is thought, from its costliness, to have been furnished not from his own private means, but from the general contributions of each tribe. Some parts of the offering, as the animals for sacrifice, were for the ritual service of the day, the peace offerings being by much the most numerous, as the princes and some of the people joined with the priests afterwards in celebrating the occasion with festive rejoicing. Hence the feast of dedication became afterwards an anniversary festival. Other parts of the offering were intended for permanent use, as utensils necessary in the service of the sanctuary; such as an immense platter and bowl (Ex 25:29). Being of silver, they were to be employed at the altar of burnt offering, or in the court, not in the holy place, all the furniture of which was of solid or plated gold; and there was a golden spoon, the contents of which show its destination to have been the altar of incense. The word rendered "spoon" means a hollow cup, in the shape of a hand, with which the priests on ordinary occasions might lift a quantity from the incense-box to throw on the altar-fire, or into the censers; but on the ceremonial on the day of the annual atonement no instrument was allowed but the high priest's own hands (Le 16:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ten shekels of gold, </span> and therefore belonging to the altar of incense. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>One spoon of ten shekels of gold, &amp;c.
