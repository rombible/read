Here is an example to those in authority, and of the highest rank; they ought to use their honour and power, their estate and interest, to promote religion and the service of God in the places where they live. Though it was a time of joy and rejoicing, yet still, in the midst of their sacrifices, we find a sin-offering. As, in our best services, we are conscious that there is sin, there should be repentance, even in our most joyful services. In all approaches to God we must by faith look to Christ as the Sin-offering. They brought their offerings each on a day. God's work should not be done confusedly, or in a hurry; take time, and we shall have done the sooner, or, at least, we shall have done the better. If services are to be done for twelve days together, we must not call it a task and a burden. All their offerings were the same; all the tribes of Israel had an equal share in the altar, and an equal interest in the sacrifices offered upon it. He who now spake to Moses, as the Shechinah or Divine Majesty, from between the Cherubim, was the Eternal Word, the second Person in the Trinity; for all God's communion with man is by his Son, by whom he made the world, and rules the church, who is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The several princes make their offerings in the order assigned to the tribes <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>. It was doubtless the tribes themselves which presented these gifts through their chiefs. The twelve offerings are strictly alike, and were offered on twelve separate days. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-83. On the second day Nethaneel &#8230; prince of Issachar, did offer&#8212;This tribe being stationed on the right side of Judah, offered next through its representative; then Zebulun, which was on the left side; and so on in orderly succession, every tribe making the same kind of offering and in the same amount, to show that, as each was under equal obligation, each rendered an equal tribute. Although each offering made was the same in quantity as well as quality, a separate notice is given of each, as a separate day was appointed for the presentation, that equal honor might be conferred on each, and none appear to be overlooked or slighted. And as the sacred books were frequently read in public, posterity, in each successive age, would feel a livelier interest in the national worship, from the permanent recognition of the offerings made by the ancestors of the respective tribes. But while this was done in one respect, as subjects offering tribute to their king, it was in another respect, a purely religious act. The vessels offered were for a sacrificial use&#8212;the animals brought were clean and fit for sacrifice, both symbolically denoting, that while God was to dwell among them as their Sovereign, they were a holy people, who by this offering dedicated themselves to God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And for a sacrifice of peace offerings,....

Even the small peculiarity of omitting the word <span class="accented">shekels</span> from the statement of the weight of the silver chargers and the golden spoons appears throughout (cf. <a href="/genesis/20-16.htm">Genesis 20:16</a>). No doubt the record was copied or enlarged from some document written at the time, and its studied sameness reflects the careful and equal solemnity with which the offerings of the several princes were received. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>All the princes brought the same gifts. The order in which the twelve princes, whose names have already been given at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5-15</a>, made their presentation, corresponded to the order of the tribes in the camp (ch. 2), the tribe-prince of Judah taking the lead, and the prince of Naphtali coming last. In the statements as to the weight of the silver kearoth and the golden cappoth, the word shekel is invariably omitted, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/20-16.htm">Genesis 20:16</a>, etc. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/7-84.htm">Numbers 7:84-86</a>, the dedication gifts are summed up, and the total weight given, viz., twelve silver dishes and twelve silver bowls, weighing together 2400 shekels, and twelve golden spoons, weighing 120 shekels in all. On the sacred shekel, see at <a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; and on the probable value of the shekel of gold, at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24-25</a>.
