And this seems to be added in this place to show that when men had done their part, God was not wanting in the performance of his part and promise. It also explains the manner how God communicated his will to Moses, not by some impression upon his mind in a vision, or by representing things to him in a dream; but by a clear and distinct <span class="ital">voice, </span>which he heard of one speaking to him <span class="ital">from between the cherubim, </span>though, at the same time, he saw no image or similitude.

We may observe further here, that God’s speaking thus to Moses by an audible voice, as if he had been clothed with a body, was an earnest of the incarnation of the Son of God, when in the fulness of time the Word should be made flesh, and speak in the language of the sons of men. That he who spake to Moses was the Eternal Word, was the belief of many of the ancients.

Here is an example to those in authority, and of the highest rank; they ought to use their honour and power, their estate and interest, to promote religion and the service of God in the places where they live. Though it was a time of joy and rejoicing, yet still, in the midst of their sacrifices, we find a sin-offering. As, in our best services, we are conscious that there is sin, there should be repentance, even in our most joyful services. In all approaches to God we must by faith look to Christ as the Sin-offering. They brought their offerings each on a day. God's work should not be done confusedly, or in a hurry; take time, and we shall have done the sooner, or, at least, we shall have done the better. If services are to be done for twelve days together, we must not call it a task and a burden. All their offerings were the same; all the tribes of Israel had an equal share in the altar, and an equal interest in the sacrifices offered upon it. He who now spake to Moses, as the Shechinah or Divine Majesty, from between the Cherubim, was the Eternal Word, the second Person in the Trinity; for all God's communion with man is by his Son, by whom he made the world, and rules the church, who is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With him - i. e. as marginal, "with God," not (as some) with himself.<p>He heard the voice of one speaking - Rather, he heard the voice speaking, or conversing.

All being now complete as God had appointed, and the camp purified from defilements, God meets Moses the mediator of the people, not as before on the peak of Sinai far away, but in the midst of them, in the dwelling-place which He henceforth vouchsafed to tenant. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>89.

With God, to consult him on some affair or another, or to learn whether he had anything else to communicate to him, to be delivered to the children of Israel; or whether he had any directions and instructions to give him about the presents and gifts of the princes, since this seems to be immediately after their offerings: <p>then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him; the Targum of Jonathan paraphrases it, the voice of the Spirit; but rather the voice of the Shechinah, or Word of God, the eternal "Logos", is what was heard; who in the fulness of time was to be made flesh, and dwell among men, and be heard, and seen, and handled by them; for as for the voice of the Father, the was not heard at any time, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>, <p>from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim; upon the ark in which the law was, called the testimony, was the mercy seat; over that were placed two cherubim shadowing it, and between these was the seat of the divine Majesty, which he had now taken, and from hence the voice of him speaking, was heard; which, as it follows upon the presents and offerings of the princes, may be interpreted, of the divine approbation and acceptance of them, since it was promised by the Lord to Moses, that upon their building a tabernacle for him he would dwell in it; and upon the making a mercy seat with the cherubim over the ark, he would there meet with Moses, and commune with him; all which being done to his mind he fulfils his promise: though it seems that at this time Moses did not go into the most holy place, only into the tabernacle of the congregation, the outward sanctuary, the court of the tabernacle; and there he heard the voice, as Jarchi observes, coming out of the most holy place, and from the mercy seat there, which was so loud, clear, and distinct, as to be well heard and understood by him; he supposes the voice went out from heaven to between the two cherubim, and from thence to the tabernacle of the congregation: and he spake unto him; what he spoke is not said, unless it is what follows in the next chapter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when Moses was gone into the <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that <i>was</i> upon the ark of testimony, from <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> between the two cherubims: and he spake unto him.</span><p>(h) That is, the sanctuary.<p>(i) According as he had promised in Ex 25:22.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">89</span>.

The words ‘with him’ imply that Jehovah has been mentioned previously in the original context of the passage.

Hithpael, as in <a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>. Here is a distinct statement of the supernatural fact that God spake to Moses with an audible human voice, and (no doubt) in the Hebrew language, from out the empty darkness behind the veil. In the fact, indeed, of God so speaking audibly there was nothing new (see <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>, &c.), nor in the fact of his so speaking to Moses (see <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a> and Exodus 33:9); but this records the fulfillment of that promise which was part of God's covenant with Israel, that he would at all times converse with Moses as their mediator from above the mercy-seat (see on Exodus 25:20-22, and cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/5-23.htm">Deuteronomy 5:23-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he spake unto him,</span> i.e., God spake unto Moses: the voice made itself audible, and by the voice God himself spake unto him. It is quite obvious that this statement more properly belongs to an earlier period, viz., to that immediately succeeding the consecration of the tabernacle. On the day it was set up Moses was not able to enter it (<a href="/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>), but no doubt he did so very soon afterwards, and received from the mouth of the Lord, speaking in the holiest, all the commandments and ordinances recorded in Leviticus and in the beginning of this book. Perhaps the first communication made to him in this way concerned the offerings of the princes when first brought near (verses 4, 11), and for that reason the statement may have been appended to the record of those offerings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>All the princes brought the same gifts. The order in which the twelve princes, whose names have already been given at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5-15</a>, made their presentation, corresponded to the order of the tribes in the camp (ch. 2), the tribe-prince of Judah taking the lead, and the prince of Naphtali coming last. In the statements as to the weight of the silver kearoth and the golden cappoth, the word shekel is invariably omitted, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/20-16.htm">Genesis 20:16</a>, etc. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/7-84.htm">Numbers 7:84-86</a>, the dedication gifts are summed up, and the total weight given, viz., twelve silver dishes and twelve silver bowls, weighing together 2400 shekels, and twelve golden spoons, weighing 120 shekels in all.
