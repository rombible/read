This was a new generation of men; and they were concerned to keep their peace with God when at war with their enemies. The daily sacrifice is called a continual burnt-offering; when we are bid to pray always, at least every morning and evening we should offer up solemn prayers and praises to God. Nothing is added here but that the wine poured out in the drink-offering is to be strong wine, to teach us to serve God with the best we have. It was a figure of the blood of Christ, the memorial of which is still left to the church in wine; and of the blood of the martyrs, which was poured out as a drink-offering on the sacrifice and service of our faith, Php 2:17.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My offering, and my bread ... - Or, my offering, even my bread, etc. Offering is here &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503;  qorba&#770;n (compare <a href="/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2</a>; <a href="/mark/7-11.htm">Mark 7:11</a>), a term in itself of quite general import, but often especially applied, as apparently in this instance, to the meat-offering which accompanied the sacrifices. This meat-offering connected itself, from its very nature, with the life of the Israelites in Canaan, not with their life in the wilderness; and it was annexed to the animal sacrifices as a token that the people must dedicate to God their property and the fruits of their labor as well as their own persons.

Moses was to consecrate him for entering upon this office by the laying on of hands, or, as is more fully explained in <a href="/numbers/27-19.htm">Numbers 27:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/27-20.htm">Numbers 27:20</a>, he was to set him before Eleazar the high priest and the congregation, to command (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;) him, i.e., instruct him with regard to his office before their eyes, and to lay of his eminence (&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;) upon him, i.e., to transfer a portion of his own dignity and majesty to him by the imposition of hands, that the whole congregation might hearken to him, or trust to his guidance. The object to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (hearken) must be supplied from the context, viz., &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (to him), as <a href="/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a> clearly shows. The &#1502;&#1503; (of) in <a href="/numbers/27-20.htm">Numbers 27:20</a> is partitive, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>, etc. The eminence and authority of Moses were not to be entirely transferred to Joshua, for they were bound up with his own person alone (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>), but only so much of it as he needed for the discharge of the duties of his office. Joshua was to be neither the lawgiver nor the absolute governor of Israel, but to be placed under the judgment of the Urim, with which Eleazar was entrusted, so far as the supreme decision of the affairs of Israel was concerned. This is the meaning of <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a> : "Eleazar shall ask to him (for him) the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah." Urim is an abbreviation for Urim and Thummim (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>), and denotes the means with which the high priest was entrusted of ascertaining the divine will and counsel in all the important business of the congregation. "After his mouth" (i.e., according to the decision of the high priest, by virtue of the right of Urim and Thummim entrusted to him), Joshua and the whole congregation were to go out and in, i.e., to regulate their conduct and decide upon their undertakings. "All the congregation," in distinction from 'all the children of Israel," denotes the whole body of heads of the people, or the college of elders, which represented the congregation and administered its affairs. </body></html>
