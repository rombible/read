The Mishnah (Menach. iv. 2) considers that these animals were to be presented together with the loaves, whereas those named in Numbers were additional sacrifices of the day.

No hurrying employments, or perilous situations, or prosperous circumstances, should cause slackness in our religious exercises; but should rather stir us up to greater diligence in seeking help from, or giving thanks to the Lord. And all is to be accompanied with repentance, faith is the Lord Jesus, and love to him, and to produce true holiness in our conduct towards all men; otherwise God will abhor our most solemn services and abundant devotions. And Christ is able to supply the wants of every day, every week, every month, every year, every ordinance, every case.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The festival offering at the season of first-fruits was to be offered on one day only; and was the same with that of the new moon and Passover.

It is not the same as that prescribed for the same day in <a href="/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>, and it is difficult to determine whether it was meant to supersede the previous ordinance, or to be distinct and additional. The fact that no notice is taken of the sacrifice already ordered would seem to point to the former conclusion; but the further fact that no mention is made of the offering of wave-loaves, with which the sacrifices in Leviticus were distinctively connected, seems to show that the two lists were independent (cf. Josephus, 'Ant.,' 3:10, 6). The fact seems to be that throughout this section no sacrifices are mentioned save such as formed a part of the system which is here for the first time elaborated. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The same number of sacrifices as at the new moon were to be offered on every one of the seven days of the feast of unleavened bread (Mazzoth), from the 15th to the 21st of the month, whereas there was no general festal offering on the day of the Passover, or the 14th of the month (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-14</a>). With regard to the feast of Mazzoth, the rule is repeated from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15-20</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6-8</a>, that on the first and seventh day there was to be a Sabbath rest and holy meeting. </body></html>
