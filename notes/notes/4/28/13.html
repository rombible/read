This teaches us to double our devotions on sabbath days, for so the duty of the day requires. The sabbath rest is to be observed, in order more closely to apply ourselves to the sabbath work, which ought to fill up the sabbath time. The offerings in the new moons showed thankfulness for the renewing of earthly blessings: when we rejoice in the gifts of providence, we must make the sacrifice of Christ, that great gift of special grace, the fountain and spring-head of our joy. And the worship performed in the new moons is made typical of gospel solemnities, Isa 66:23. As the moon borrows light from the sun, and is renewed by its influences; so the church borrows her light from Jesus Christ, who is the Sun of righteousness, renewing the state of the church, especially under the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The New-moon offering is here also commanded for the first time. The goat as a sin-offering, though mentioned last, would seem in fact to have been offered first (compare the precedents in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5.htm">Leviticus 5</a>; 8; 9; 14; 16). The sin-offering, which <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22-26</a> had been contemplated in cases where a sin had been committed ignorantly without the knowledge of the congregation, was henceforth not to be offered merely at discretion, as circumstances might seem to require, but to be regularly repeated, not less frequently than once a month. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-15. And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord&#8212;These were held as sacred festivals; and though not possessing the character of solemn feasts, they were distinguished by the blowing of trumpets over the sacrifices (Nu 10:10), by the suspension of all labor except the domestic occupations of women (Am 8:5), by the celebration of public worship (2Ki 4:23), and by social or family feasts (1Sa 20:5). These observations are not prescribed in the law though they obtained in the practice of a later time. The beginning of the month was known, not by astronomical calculations, but, according to Jewish writers, by the testimony of messengers appointed to watch the first visible appearance of the new moon; and then the fact was announced through the whole country by signal-fires kindled on the mountain tops. The new-moon festivals having been common among the heathen, it is probable that an important design of their institution in Israel was to give the minds of that people a better direction; and assuming this to have been one of the objects contemplated, it will account for one of the kids being offered unto the Lord (Nu 28:15), not unto the moon, as the Egyptians and Syrians did. The Sabbath and the new moon are frequently mentioned together.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock,....

Shecar does not mean intoxicating drink here (see at <a href="/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>), but strong drink, in distinction from water as simple drink. The drink-offering consisted of wine only (see at <a href="/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5</a>.); and hence Onkelos paraphrases it, "of old wine." </body></html>
