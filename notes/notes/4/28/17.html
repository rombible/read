No hurrying employments, or perilous situations, or prosperous circumstances, should cause slackness in our religious exercises; but should rather stir us up to greater diligence in seeking help from, or giving thanks to the Lord. And all is to be accompanied with repentance, faith is the Lord Jesus, and love to him, and to produce true holiness in our conduct towards all men; otherwise God will abhor our most solemn services and abundant devotions. And Christ is able to supply the wants of every day, every week, every month, every year, every ordinance, every case.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Passover offering was the same as that of the New moon, and was repeated on each of the seven days of the festival, thus marking the importance and the solemnity of the occasion.

To this there was also to be added a sin-offering of a shaggy goat (see at <a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23</a>). The custom of distinguishing the beginnings of the months of new moon's days by a peculiar festal sacrifice, without their being, strictly speaking, festal days, with sabbatical rest and a holy meeting, <p>(Note: In later times, however, the new moon grew more and more into a feast-day, trade was suspended (<a href="/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>), the pious Israelite sought instruction from the prophets (<a href="/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>), many families and households presented yearly thank-offerings (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-6.htm">1 Samuel 20:6</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a>), and at a still later period the most devout abstained from fasting (Judith 8:6); consequently it is frequently referred to by the prophets as a feast resembling the Sabbath (<a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a>).)<p>arose from the relation in which the month stood to the single day. "If the congregation was to sanctify its life and labour to the Lord every day by a burnt-offering, it could not well be omitted at the commencement of the larger division of time formed by the month; on the contrary, it was only right that the commencement of a new month should be sanctified by a special sacrifice. Whilst, then, a burnt-offering, in which the idea of expiation was subordinate to that of consecrating surrender to the Lord, was sufficient for the single day; for the whole month it was necessary that, in consideration of the sins that had been committed in the course of the past month, and had remained without expiation, a special sin-offering should be offered for their expiation, in order that, upon the ground of the forgiveness and reconciliation with God which had been thereby obtained, the lives of the people might be sanctified afresh to the Lord in the burnt-offering. This significance of the new moon sacrifice was still further intensified by the fact, that during the presentation of the sacrifice the priests sounded the silver trumpets, in order that it might be to the congregation for a memorial before God (<a href="/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>). The trumpet blast was intended to bring before God the prayers of the congregation embodied in the sacrifice, that God might remember them in mercy, granting them the forgiveness of their sins and power for sanctification, and quickening them again in the fellowship of His saving grace" (see my Archaeologie, i. p. 369). </body></html>
