This was a new generation of men; and they were concerned to keep their peace with God when at war with their enemies. The daily sacrifice is called a continual burnt-offering; when we are bid to pray always, at least every morning and evening we should offer up solemn prayers and praises to God. Nothing is added here but that the wine poured out in the drink-offering is to be strong wine, to teach us to serve God with the best we have. It was a figure of the blood of Christ, the memorial of which is still left to the church in wine; and of the blood of the martyrs, which was poured out as a drink-offering on the sacrifice and service of our faith, Php 2:17.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The original of the word "strong wine" &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;  she&#770;ka&#772;r is a term usually employed to describe strong drink other than wine (<a href="/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a> note). The Israelites in the wilderness had, in their lack of wine, substituted shechar made from barley for it. They had thus observed the spirit, though not the letter of the ordinance. The drink-offering was either poured round the foot of the altar; or on the altar, and so upon the flesh of the sacrifice by which the altar was covered (compare <a href="/exodus/30-9.htm">Exodus 30:9</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.
