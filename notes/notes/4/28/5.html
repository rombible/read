This was a new generation of men; and they were concerned to keep their peace with God when at war with their enemies. The daily sacrifice is called a continual burnt-offering; when we are bid to pray always, at least every morning and evening we should offer up solemn prayers and praises to God. Nothing is added here but that the wine poured out in the drink-offering is to be strong wine, to teach us to serve God with the best we have. It was a figure of the blood of Christ, the memorial of which is still left to the church in wine; and of the blood of the martyrs, which was poured out as a drink-offering on the sacrifice and service of our faith, Php 2:17.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My offering, and my bread ... - Or, my offering, even my bread, etc. Offering is here &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503;  qorba&#770;n (compare <a href="/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2</a>; <a href="/mark/7-11.htm">Mark 7:11</a>), a term in itself of quite general import, but often especially applied, as apparently in this instance, to the meat-offering which accompanied the sacrifices. This meat-offering connected itself, from its very nature, with the life of the Israelites in Canaan, not with their life in the wilderness; and it was annexed to the animal sacrifices as a token that the people must dedicate to God their property and the fruits of their labor as well as their own persons.
