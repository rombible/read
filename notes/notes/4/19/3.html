Under these circumstances the victim, like the defiled persons themselves, would be removed outside the camp. The particular pollution to be remedied by this ordinance was the indirect one resulting from contact with tokens and manifestations of sin, not the direct and personal one arising from actual commission of sin.

It was led "forth without the camp," in accordance with the law regarding victims laden with the sins of the people, and thus typical of Christ (Heb 13:12; also Le 24:14). The priest was to sprinkle the blood "seven times" before&#8212;literally, "towards" or "near" the tabernacle, a description which seems to imply either that he carried a portion of the blood in a basin to the door of the tabernacle (Le 4:17), or that in the act of sprinkling he turned his face towards the sacred edifice, being disqualified through the defiling influence of this operation from approaching close to it. By this attitude he indicated that he was presenting an expiatory sacrifice, for the acceptance of which he hoped, in the grace of God, by looking to the mercy seat. Every part of it was consumed by fire except the blood used in sprinkling, and the ingredients mixed with the ashes were the same as those employed in the sprinkling of lepers (Le 14:4-7). It was a water of separation&#8212;that is, of "sanctification" for the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto Eleazar, </span> who was the second priest, and, in some cases, the vicegerent or deputy of the high priest.

The son of Aaron; the Sagan of the priests, as the Targum of Jonathan calls him, the second or deputy priest; it was not to be given to Aaron, that he might not be defiled, though but for a small time, that so he might not be hindered in his office at all; but to Eleazar, to inure him to his office, and to confirm him in it: <p>that he may bring her forth without the camp; without the camp of Israel; Jarchi says, without the three camps, as afterwards without Jerusalem; it used in later times to be burnt on the mount of Olives; it was brought forth as impure, and was a type of Christ, having the sins of his people on him, and who in conformity to this type suffered without the gates of Jerusalem, see <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11</a>, <p>and one shall slay her before his face; the Targum of Jonathan says, another priest; but it was not necessary that it should be slain by a priest, any man might do it. Jarchi says, a stranger slew, and Eleazar looked on; though it was not slain by him, yet it was slain before him, that it might look like a sacrifice, though not offered on the altar; and slaying of it denotes the putting of Christ to death, which was done in the presence, and with the approbation, of the priests and elders of the people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> <i>one</i> shall slay her before his face:</span><p>(b) Another priest.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">one</span> <span class="ital">shall bring her forth</span>] Probably the person who is to kill her; not Eleazar.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto Eleazar the priest.</span> Possibly in order that Aaron himself might not be associated with dearly, even in this indirect way (see verse 6).

In this case, however, the whole sacrifice was performed outside the camp, and was only brought into relation with the national sanctuary by the sprinkling of the blood in that direction. Various symbolic reasons have been assigned to this fact, but none are satisfactory except the following: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It served to intensify the conviction, which the whole of this ordinance was intended to bring home to the minds of men, that death was an awful thing, and that everything connected with it was wholly foreign to the presence and habitation of the living God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It served to mark with more emphasis the contrast between this one offering, which  was perhaps almost the only one they had in the wilderness, and those which ought to have been offered continually according to the Levitical ordinances. The red heifer stood quite outside the number of ordinary victims as demanded by the law, and therefore it was not slain at any hallowed altar, nor, necessarily, by any hallowed hand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> It served to prefigure in a wonderful and indeed startling way the sacrifice of Christ outside the gate.
