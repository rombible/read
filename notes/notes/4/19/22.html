Because death is the wages of sin, which entered into the world by it, and reigns by the power of it. The law could not conquer death, nor abolish it, as the gospel does, by bringing life and immortality to light, and so introducing a better hope. As the ashes of the heifer signified the merit of Christ, so the running water signified the power and grace of the blessed Spirit, who is compared to rivers of living water; and it is by his work that the righteousness of Christ is applied to us for our cleansing. Those who promise themselves benefit by the righteousness of Christ, while they submit not to the grace and influence of the Holy Spirit, do but deceive themselves; we cannot be purified by the ashes, otherwise than in the running water. What use could there be in these appointments, if they do not refer to the doctrines concerning the sacrifice of Christ? But comparing them with the New Testament, the knowledge to be got from them is evident. The true state of fallen man is shown in these institutions. Here we learn the defiling nature of sin, and are warned to avoid evil communications.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>One practical effect of attaching defilement to a dead body, and to all that touched it, etc., would be to insure early burial, and to correct a practice not uncommon in the East, of leaving the deal to be devoured by the wild beasts. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. he that sprinkleth &#8230; ; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even&#8212;The opposite effects ascribed to the water of separation&#8212;of cleansing one person and defiling another&#8212;are very singular, and not capable of very satisfactory explanation. One important lesson, however, was thus taught, that its purifying efficacy was not inherent in itself, but arose from the divine appointment, as in other ordinances of religion, which are effectual means of salvation, not from any virtue in them, or in him that administers them, but solely through the grace of God communicated thereby.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The unclean person; </span> not he who is so only by touching the water of separation, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/19-21.htm" title="And it shall be a perpetual statute to them, that he that sprinkles the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that touches the water of separation shall be unclean until even.">Numbers 19:21</a></span>, but he who is so by the greater sort of uncleanness, which lasted seven days, of which <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/19-11.htm" title="He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.">Numbers 19:11</a>,16</span>, and which was not removed without the use of this water of purification, as is manifest from the context and other places of Scripture, and from the nature of the thing; for the lesser sort of uncleanness, mentioned in the foregoing verse, lasted only till even, and was cleansed by the sole washing of his clothes and flesh in water, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/19-7.htm" title="Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.">Numbers 19:7</a></span>, without any use of this water of purification, which, if it had been necessary, must have been used on the third and on the seventh day, according to the rule, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/19-12.htm" title="He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.">Numbers 19:12</a>,19</span>, and so the uncleanness of one day had been made an uncleanness of seven days, which is a contradiction. Besides it is unreasonable, that he who immediately touched the defiling thing, should be no more and longer unclean than he who touched that person only; and it was contrary to other rules in like cases, as <span class="bld"> Le 15</span>, where the man or woman having an issue, are thereby made unclean for seven days, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/15-13.htm" title="And when he that has an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.">Leviticus 15:13</a>,28</span>, but he who toucheth them is made unclean only till even, <span class="bld"> Le 15 7,27</span>.

If a man died in a tent, every one who entered it, or who was there at the time, became unclean for seven days. So also did every "open vessel upon which there was not a covering, a string," i.e., that had not a covering fastened by a string, to prevent the smell of the corpse from penetrating it. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1500;, a string, is in apposition to &#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, a band, or binding (see Ges. 113; Ewald, 287, e.). This also applied to any one in the open field, who touched a man who had either been slain by the sword or had died a natural death, or even a bone (skeleton), or a grave.</body></html>
