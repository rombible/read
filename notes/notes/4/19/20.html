Because death is the wages of sin, which entered into the world by it, and reigns by the power of it. The law could not conquer death, nor abolish it, as the gospel does, by bringing life and immortality to light, and so introducing a better hope. As the ashes of the heifer signified the merit of Christ, so the running water signified the power and grace of the blessed Spirit, who is compared to rivers of living water; and it is by his work that the righteousness of Christ is applied to us for our cleansing. Those who promise themselves benefit by the righteousness of Christ, while they submit not to the grace and influence of the Holy Spirit, do but deceive themselves; we cannot be purified by the ashes, otherwise than in the running water. What use could there be in these appointments, if they do not refer to the doctrines concerning the sacrifice of Christ? But comparing them with the New Testament, the knowledge to be got from them is evident. The true state of fallen man is shown in these institutions. Here we learn the defiling nature of sin, and are warned to avoid evil communications.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>One practical effect of attaching defilement to a dead body, and to all that touched it, etc., would be to insure early burial, and to correct a practice not uncommon in the East, of leaving the deal to be devoured by the wild beasts. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. when a man dieth in a tent, &c.&#8212;The instances adduced appear very minute and trivial; but important ends, both of a religious and of a sanitary nature, were promoted by carrying the idea of pollution from contact with dead bodies to so great an extent. While it would effectually prevent that Egyptianized race of Israelites imitating the superstitious custom of the Egyptians, who kept in their houses the mummied remains of their ancestors, it ensured a speedy interment to all, thus not only keeping burial places at a distance, but removing from the habitations of the living the corpses of persons who died from infectious disorders, and from the open field the unburied remains of strangers and foreigners who fell in battle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shall not purify himself, </span> i.e, shall contemptuously refuse to submit to this way of purification. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the man that shall be unclean,....

If a man died in a tent, every one who entered it, or who was there at the time, became unclean for seven days. So also did every "open vessel upon which there was not a covering, a string," i.e., that had not a covering fastened by a string, to prevent the smell of the corpse from penetrating it. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1500;, a string, is in apposition to &#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, a band, or binding (see Ges. 113; Ewald, 287, e.). This also applied to any one in the open field, who touched a man who had either been slain by the sword or had died a natural death, or even a bone (skeleton), or a grave.</body></html>
