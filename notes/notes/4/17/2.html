Speak unto the children of Israel&#8212;The controversy with Moses and Aaron about the priesthood was of such a nature and magnitude as required a decisive and authoritative settlement. For the removal of all doubts and the silencing of all murmuring in the future regarding the holder of the office, a miracle was wrought of a remarkable character and permanent duration; and in the manner of performing it, all the people were made to have a direct and special interest.<p>take of every one &#8230; princes &#8230; twelve rods&#8212;As the princes, being the oldest sons of the chief family, and heads of their tribes, might have advanced the best claims to the priesthood, if that sacred dignity was to be shared among all the tribes, they were therefore selected, and being twelve in number&#8212;that of Joseph being counted only one&#8212;Moses was ordered to see that the name of each was inscribed&#8212;a practice borrowed from the Egyptians&#8212;upon his rod or wand of office. The name of Aaron rather than of Levi was used, as the latter name would have opened a door of controversy among the Levites; and as there was to be one rod only for the head of each tribe, the express appointment of a rod for Aaron determined him to be the head of that tribe, as well as that branch or family of the tribe to which the priestly dignity should belong. These rods were to be laid in the tabernacle close to the ark (compare Nu 17:10 and Heb 9:4), where a divine token was promised that would for all time terminate the dispute.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Speak unto the children of Israel, </span> that I may fully and finally satisfy all their scruples, and take away all pretence and cause of murmuring. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of every one of them; </span> not of every person, but of every tribe, as it follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A rod; </span> either an ordinary walking staff; or rather, that staff or rod which the princes carried in their hand as tokens of their dignity and authority, as may be gathered from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/21-18.htm" title="The princes dig the well, the nobles of the people dig it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves.

It is also used in the sense of "tribe" (<a href="/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4, 16</a>). Each tribe was but a branch, or rod, out of the stock of Israel, and, therefore, was most naturally represented by the rod cut from the tree. 'The words used for scepter in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, and in <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>, and for rod in <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, and elsewhere are different, but the same imagery underlies the use of all of them. <span class="cmt_word">Of all</span> <span class="cmt_word">their princes...  twelve rods.</span> These princes must be those named in chapter 2 and 7. Since among these are to be found the tribe princes of Ephraim and Manasseh, standing upon a perfect equality with the rest, it is evident that the twelve rods were exclusive of that of Aaron. The joining together of Ephraim and Manasseh in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-12.htm">Deuteronomy 27:12</a> was a very different thing, because it could not raise any question as between the two. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thereupon they both went into the court of (&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;, as in <a href="/leviticus/9-5.htm">Leviticus 9:5</a>) the tabernacle, and God commanded them to rise up (&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, Niphal of &#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;; see Ges. 65, Anm. 5) out of this congregation, which He would immediately destroy. But they fell upon their faces in prayer, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16-21.htm">Numbers 16:21-22</a>. This time, however, they could not avert the bursting forth of the wrathful judgment, as they had done the day before (<a href="/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>). The plague had already commenced, when Moses told Aaron to take the censer quickly into the midst of the congregation, with coals and incense (&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498;, imper. Hiph.), to make expiation for it with an incense-offering. And when this was done, and Aaron placed himself between the dead and the living, the plague, which had already destroyed 14,700 men, was stayed. The plague consisted apparently of a sudden death, as in the case of a pestilence raging with extreme violence, though we cannot regard it as an actual pestilence.<p>The means resorted to by Moses to stay the plague showed afresh how the faithful servant of God bore the rescue of his people upon his heart. All the motives which he had hitherto pleaded, in his repeated intercession that this evil congregation might be spared, were now exhausted. He could not stake his life for the nation, as at Horeb (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>), for the nation had rejected him. He could no longer appeal to the honour of Jehovah among the heathen, seeing that the Lord, even when sentencing the rebellious race to fall in the desert, had assured him that the whole earth should be filled with His glory (<a href="/numbers/14-20.htm">Numbers 14:20</a>.). Still less could he pray to God that He would not be wrathful with all for the sake of one or a few sinners, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>, seeing that the whole congregation had taken part with the rebels. In this condition of things there was but one way left of averting the threatened destruction of the whole nation, namely, to adopt the means which the Lord Himself had given to His congregation, in the high-priestly office, to wipe away their sins, and recover the divine grace which they had forfeited through sin, - viz., the offering of incense which embodied the high-priestly prayer, and the strength and operation of which were not dependent upon the sincerity and earnestness of subjective faith, but had a firm and immovable foundation in the objective force of the divine appointment. This was the means adopted by the faithful servant of the Lord, and the judgment of wrath was averted in its course; the plague was averted. - The effectual operation of the incense-offering of the high priest also served to furnish the people with a practical proof of the power and operation of the true and divinely appointed priesthood. "The priesthood which the company of Korah had so wickedly usurped, had brought down death and destruction upon himself, through his offering of incense; but the divinely appointed priesthood of Aaron averted death and destruction from the whole congregation when incense was offered by him, and stayed the well-merited judgment, which had broken forth upon it" (Kurtz). </body></html>
