Twelve rods or staves were to be brought in. It is probable that they were the staves which the princes used as ensigns of their authority; old dry staves, that had no sap in them. They were to expect that the rod of the tribe, or prince, whom God chose to the priesthood, should bud and blossom. Moses did not object that the matter was sufficiently settled already; he did not undertake to determine it; but left the case before the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The whole number of rods was twelve exclusive of Aaron's, as the Vulgate expressly states. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. the rod of Aaron was among their rods&#8212;either one of the twelve, or, as many suppose, a thirteenth in the midst (Heb 9:4).

Confirmation of the High-Priesthood of Aaron. - Whilst the Lord had thus given a practical proof to the people, that Aaron was the high priest appointed by Him for His congregation, by allowing the high-priestly incense offered by Aaron to expiate His wrath, and by removing the plague; He also gave them a still further confirmation of His priesthood, by a miracle which was well adapted to put to silence all the murmuring of the congregation.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-1.htm">Numbers 17:1-5</a><p>He commanded Moses to take twelve rods of the tribe-princes of Israel, one for the fathers' house of each of their tribes, and to write upon each the name of the tribe; but upon that of the tribe of Levi he was to write Aaron's name, because each rod was to stand for the head of their fathers' houses, i.e., for the existing head of the tribe; and in the case of Levi, the tribe-head was Aaron. As only twelve rods were taken for all the tribes of Israel, and Levi was included among them, Ephraim and Manasseh must have been reckoned as the one tribe of Joseph, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-12.htm">Deuteronomy 27:12</a>.
