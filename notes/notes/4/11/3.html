See the sinfulness of sin, which takes occasion from the commandment to be provoking. The weakness of the law discovered sin, but could not destroy it; checked, but could not conquer it. They complained. Those who are of a discontented spirit, will always find something to quarrel or fret about, though the circumstances of their outward condition be ever so favourable. The Lord heard it, though Moses did not. God knows the secret frettings and murmurings of the heart, though concealed from men. What he noticed, he was much displeased with, and he chastised them for this sin. The fire of their wrath against God burned in their minds; justly did the fire of God's wrath fasten on their bodies; but God's judgments came on them gradually, that they might take warning. It appeared that God delights not in punishing; when he begins, he is soon prevailed with to let it fall.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Taberah - i. e.

When the people complained it displeased the Lord, &c.&#8212;Unaccustomed to the fatigues of travel and wandering into the depths of a desert, less mountainous but far more gloomy and desolate than that of Sinai, without any near prospect of the rich country that had been promised, they fell into a state of vehement discontent, which was vented at these irksome and fruitless journeyings. The displeasure of God was manifested against the ungrateful complainers by fire sent in an extraordinary manner. It is worthy of notice, however, that the discontent seems to have been confined to the extremities of the camp, where, in all likelihood, "the mixed multitude" [see on [71]Ex 12:38] had their station. At the intercession of Moses, the appalling judgment ceased [Nu 11:2], and the name given to the place, "Taberah" (a burning), remained ever after a monument of national sin and punishment. (See on [72]Nu 11:34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Tabera, </span> from this fire; as it was called <span class="ital">Kibroth-hattaa-vah</span> from another occasion, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/11-34.htm" title="And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.">Numbers 11:34</a>,35 33:16</span>; as it is no new thing in Scripture for persons and places to have two names.

This name does not occur in the list of stations in chapter 33, which mentions nothing between Sinai and Kibroth-Hattaavah. It would seem probable, however, that the conflagration occurred while Israel was encamped, or else there could hardly have been a burning "in the end of the camp." We may therefore suppose either that Tabeerah was some spot in the immediate neighbourhood of Sinai whither the people gathered for their first long march; or that it was one of the halting-places on the "three days' journey" not mentioned in the list, because that journey was considered as all one; or that it was the same place afterwards called Kibroth-Hatta-avah. There is nothing in the narrative to decide a question which is in itself unimportant. It is necessary to remember that where the ancient and local names derived from marked natural features were not available, such names as Tabeerah given to the halting-places of so vast a host must have had a very loose significance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 11:4-35 KIBROTH HATTAAVAH (verses 4-35). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And they (the Israelites) departed from the mount of Jehovah (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>) three days' journey; the ark of the covenant of Jehovah going before them, to search out a resting-place for them. And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day, when they broke up from the camp." Jehovah still did as He had already done on the way to Sinai (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>): He went before them in the pillar of cloud, according to His promise (<a href="/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>), on their journey from Sinai to Canaan; with this simple difference, however, that henceforth the cloud that embodied the presence of Jehovah was connected with the ark of the covenant, as the visible throne of His gracious presence which had been appointed by Jehovah Himself. To this end the ark of the covenant was carried separately from the rest of the sacred things, in front of the whole army; so that the cloud which went before them floated above the ark, leading the procession, and regulating its movements in the direction it took in such a manner that the permanent connection between the cloud and the sanctuary might be visibly manifested even during their march. It is true that, in the order observed in the camp and on the march, no mention is made of the ark of the covenant going in front of the whole army; but this omission is no more a proof of any discrepancy between this verse and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a>, or of a difference of authorship, than the separation of the different divisions of the Levites upon the march, which is also not mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a>, although the Gershonites and Merarites actually marched between the banners of Judah and Reuben, and the Kohathites with the holy things between the banners of Reuben and Ephraim (<a href="/numbers/10-17.htm">Numbers 10:17</a> and <a href="/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>).<p>(Note: As the critics do not deny that vv. 11-28 are written by the "Elohist" notwithstanding this difference, they have no right to bring forward the account of the ark going first as a contradiction to ch. 2, and therefore a proof that <a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>. are not of Elohistic origin.)<p>The words, "the cloud was above them" (the Israelites), and so forth, can be reconciled with this supposition without any difficulty, whether we understand them as signifying that the cloud, which appeared as a guiding column floating above the ark and moved forward along with it, also extended itself along the whole procession, and spread out as a protecting shade over the whole army (as O. v. Gerlach and Baumgarten suppose), or that "above them" (upon them) is to be regarded as expressive of the fact that it accompanied them as a protection and shade. Nor is <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-39.htm">Psalm 105:39</a>, which seems, so far as the words are concerned, rather to favour the first explanation, really at variance with this view; for the Psalmist's intention is not so much to give a physical description of the phenomenon, as to describe the sheltering protection of God in poetical words as a spreading out of the cloud above the wandering people of God, in the form of a protection against both heat and rain (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5-6</a>). Moreover, <a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a> and <a href="/numbers/10-34.htm">Numbers 10:34</a> have a poetical character, answering to the elevated nature of their subject, and are to be interpreted as follows according to the laws of a poetical parallelism: The one thought that the ark of the covenant, with the cloud soaring above it, led the way and sheltered those who were marching, is divided into two clauses; in <a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a> only the ark of the covenant is mentioned as going in front of the Israelites, and in <a href="/numbers/10-34.htm">Numbers 10:34</a> only the cloud as a shelter over them: whereas the carrying of the ark in front of the army could only accomplish the end proposed, viz., to search out a resting-place for them, by Jehovah going above them in the cloud, and showing the bearers of the ark both the way they were to take, and the place where they were to rest. The ark with the tables of the law is not called "the ark of testimony" here, according to its contents, as in <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33-34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>, etc., but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, according to its design and signification for Israel, which was the only point, or at any rate the principal point, in consideration here. The resting-place which the ark of the covenant found at the end of three days, is not mentioned in <a href="/numbers/10-34.htm">Numbers 10:34</a>; it was not Tabeerah, however (<a href="/numbers/11-3.htm">Numbers 11:3</a>), but Kibroth-hattaavah (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11-34.htm">Numbers 11:34-35</a>; cf. <a href="/numbers/33-16.htm">Numbers 33:16</a>). </body></html>
