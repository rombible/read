He gave of his Spirit to the seventy elders. They discoursed to the people of the things of God, so that all who heard them might say, that God was with them of a truth. Two of the elders, Eldad and Medad, went not out unto the tabernacle, as the rest, being sensible of their own weakness and unworthiness. But the Spirit of God found them in the camp, and there they exercised their gift of praying, preaching, and praising God; they spake as moved by the Holy Ghost. The Spirit of God is not confined to the tabernacle, but, like the wind, blows where He listeth. And they that humble themselves shall be exalted; and those who are most fit for government, are least ambitious of it. Joshua does not desire that they should be punished, but only restrained for the future. This motion he made out of zeal for what he thought to be the unity of the church. He would have them silenced, lest they should occasion a schism, or should rival Moses; but Moses was not afraid of any such effects from that Spirit which God had put upon them. Shall we reject those whom Christ has owned, or restrain any from doing good, because they are not in every thing of our mind? Moses wishes all the Lord's people were prophets, that he would put his Spirit upon all of them. Let the testimony of Moses be believed by those who desire to be in power; that government is a burden. It is a burden of care and trouble to those who make conscience of the duty of it; and to those who do not, it will prove a heavier burden in the day of account. Let the example of Moses be followed by those in power; let them not despise the advice and assistance of others, but desire it, and be thankful for it. If all the present number of the Lord's people were rendered prophets, or ministers, by the Spirit of Christ, though not all agreed in outward matters, there is work enough for all, in calling sinners to repentance, and faith in our Lord Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They prophesied - i. e. under the extraordinary impulse of the Holy Spirit they uttered forth the praises of God, or declared His will.

And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came on him.">2 Kings 3:15</a>).

It was not an imparting of wisdom and influence for the purpose of permanently helping Moses.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord came down in a cloud,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in the cloud which was the symbol of his perpetual presence with. them. At other times this cloud dwelt (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>) above the tabernacle, soaring steadily above it in the clear air; but on certain occasions, for greater impressiveness, the cloud came down and filled the tabernacle, or at any rate the entrance of it, while Moses stood without (cf. <a href="/numbers/12-5.htm">Numbers 12:5</a> and <a href="/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Took of the spirit which was upon him.</span> Not certainly in anger, or by way of diminishing the fullness of the spirit which was in Moses, but in order that the seventy might participate, and be known to participate, in a gift originally and specially given to Moses. The whole intention of the ceremonial was to declare in the most unmistakable way that the gifts of the seventy were to be exercised only in union with and in subordination to the mediator of Israel. The Targums are substantially correct in their paraphrase: "The Lord made <span class="accented">enlargement</span> of the spirit that was upon him, and imparted to the seventy men, the eiders." Theodoret very happily observes on this passage, "Just as a man who kindles a thousand flames from one does not lessen the first in communicating light to the others, so God did not diminish the grace imparted  to Moses by the fact that he communicated of it to the seventy." <span class="cmt_word">They</span> <span class="cmt_word">prophesied.</span> The phenomenon here mentioned for the first time was no doubt an ecstatic utterance, not exactly beyond the control, but certainly beyond the origination, of those who prophesied. It must not be confounded with that state of calm, spiritual exaltation in which such men as Isaac and Jacob spake concerning things to come (<a href="/hebrews/11-20.htm">Hebrews 11:20</a>; cf. <a href="/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>; <a href="/genesis/49-28.htm">Genesis 49:28</a>). The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> means literally "were caused to pour forth," and the fundamental idea is that those affected became for the time being vents for the audible utterance of thoughts and expressions which were not theirs, but the Holy Ghost's. Compare the thought in <a href="/job/32-18.htm">Job 32:18-20</a>, and the case of Saul and his messengers, as above. As to the matter of these prophesyings, we may probably conclude that they were of the same nature as the ecstatic utterances of the tongues on the day of Pentecost and afterwards; not "prophecy" in the ordinary sense, but inspired glorification of God, and declaration of his wonderful works (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">did not cease.</span> Rather, "did not add," or "repeat." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>.

The ecstatic utterance did not continue or reappear. The New Testament history no doubt supplies us with the explanation of this. The supernatural sign thus accorded was of little use in itself, and was of much danger, because it attracted to its exhibition an attention which was rather due to more inward and spiritual things. As a sign it was sufficient that it should be once unmistakably manifested before all the people. (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-8.htm">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>). The permanent <span class="accented">charisma</span> of the Holy Spirit which the seventy received and retained from this time forth was no doubt the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; the gift of "help" or "governance," not in temporal matters, but in the religious education and direction of the people. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehovah would also relieve the complaining of the people, and that in such a way that the murmurers should experience at the same time the holiness of His judgments.

Jehovah would give them flesh, so that they should eat it not one day, or two, or five, or ten, or twenty, but a whole month long (of "days," as in <a href="/genesis/29-14.htm">Genesis 29:14</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1</a>), "till it come out of your nostrils, and become loathsome unto you," as a punishment for having despised Jehovah in the midst of them, in their contempt of the manna given by God, and for having shown their regret at leaving the land of Egypt in their longing for the provisions of that land. </body></html>
