Even true and great believers sometimes find it hard to trust God under the discouragements of second causes, and against hope to believe in hope.

"Why hast Thou done evil to Thy servant? and why have I not found favour in Thy sight, to lay upon me the burden of all this people?" The "burden of all this people" is the expression which he uses to denote "the care of governing the people, and providing everything for it" (C. a. Lap.). This burden, which God imposed upon him in connection with his office, appeared to him a bad and ungracious treatment on the part of God. This is the language of the discontent of despair, which differs from the murmuring of unbelief, in the fact that it is addressed to God, for the purpose of entreating help and deliverance from Him; whereas unbelief complains of the ways of God, but while complaining of its troubles, does not pray to the Lord its God. "Have I conceived all this people," Moses continues, "or have I brought it forth, that Thou requirest me to carry it in my bosom, as a nursing father carries the suckling, into the promised land?" He does not intend by these words to throw off entirely all care for the people, but simply to plead with God that the duty of carrying and providing for Israel rests with Him, the Creator and Father of Israel (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>). Moses, a weak man, was wanting in the omnipotent power which alone could satisfy the crying of the people for flesh. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, "they weep unto me," i.e., they come weeping to ask me to relieve their distress. "I am not able to carry this burden alone; it is too heavy for me."</body></html>
