They were weary of the provision God had made for them, although wholesome food and nourishing. It cost no money or care, and the labour of gathering it was very little indeed; yet they talked of Egypt's cheapness, and the fish they ate there freely; as if that cost them nothing, when they paid dearly for it with hard service! While they lived on manna, they seemed exempt from the curse sin has brought on man, that in the sweat of his face he should eat bread; yet they speak of it with scorn. Peevish, discontented minds will find fault with that which has no fault in it, but that it is too good for them. Those who might be happy, often make themselves miserable by discontent. They could not be satisfied unless they had flesh to eat. It is evidence of the dominion of the carnal mind, when we want to have the delights and satisfaction of sense. We should not indulge in any desire which we cannot in faith turn into prayer, as we cannot when we ask meat for our lust. What is lawful of itself becomes evil, when God does not allot it to us, yet we desire it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is nothing at all ... - literally, "Nought at all have we except that our eyes are unto this manna;" i. e.

But now &#8230; there is nothing &#8230; beside this manna&#8212;Daily familiarity had disgusted them with the sight and taste of the monotonous food; and, ungrateful for the heavenly gift, they longed for a change of fare. It may be noticed that the resemblance of the manna to coriander seed was not in the color, but in the size and figure; and from its comparison to bdellium, which is either a drop of white gum or a white pearl, we are enabled to form a better idea of it. Moreover, it is evident, from the process of baking into cakes, that it could not have been the natural manna of the Arabian desert, for that is too gummy or unctuous to admit of being ground into meal. In taste it is said to have been like "wafers made with honey" (Ex 16:31), and here to have the taste of fresh oil. The discrepancy in these statements is only apparent; for in the latter the manna is described in its raw state; in the former, after it was ground and baked. The minute description given here of its nature and use was designed to show the great sinfulness of the people, in being dissatisfied with such excellent food, furnished so plentifully and gratuitously.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Our soul</span>; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="bld">Our life</span>, as the soul signifies, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/9-5.htm" title="And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.">Genesis 9:5</a> <a href="/psalms/33-19.htm" title="To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.">Psalm 33:19</a> <a href="/job/36-14.htm" title="They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.">Job 36:14</a></span>; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. <span class="bld">Our body</span>, which is oft signified by the soul, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10</a> <a href="/psalms/35-12.htm" title="They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.">Psalm 35:12</a> 105:18</span>.

Different substances which have been suggested, such as a gum from the tamarisk or <span class="ital">tÃ¢rfÃ¢</span> tree, oak honey, or an edible lichen, are described in art. â€˜Mannaâ€™ in <span class="ital">DB. </span>and <span class="ital">EBib.</span> If the numbers of the people were really 600,000 (<span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/11-21.htm" title="And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.">Numbers 11:21</a></span>), the only miraculous feature in the present case would be the enormous supply required for them. But their numbers were, in all probability, much smaller (see on <a href="/numbers/1-46.htm" title="Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.">Numbers 1:46</a>). When the time of D was reached, the manna had come to be considered a mysterious unknown food (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm" title="And he humbled you, and suffered you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you knew not, neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD does man live.">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-16.htm" title="Who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers knew not, that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end;">Deuteronomy 8:16</a>), and the same idea is seen in P (Exodus 16), who relates (<span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/11-33.htm" title="And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.">Numbers 11:33</a></span> f.) that a pot containing one omer of it was laid up in front of the ark in the Holy of Holies (cf. <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a>, <a href="/revelation/2-17.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.">Revelation 2:17</a>). The manna as a type of the spiritual â€˜Bread that came down from heavenâ€™ forms the subject of our Lordâ€™s discourse to the Jews in <a href="/context/john/6-30.htm" title="They said therefore to him, What sign show you then, that we may see, and believe you? what do you work?...">John 6:30-35</a>; <a href="/context/john/6-41.htm" title="The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven....">John 6:41-58</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our soul is</span> <span class="cmt_word">dried away.</span> This exaggerated statement expressed their craving for the juicy and savoury food of which they had been thinking, and which was obviously unattainable in the wilderness. There is a physical craving in man for variety of diet, and especially for such condiments and flavours as he has been used to all his life, which makes the lack of them a real hardship. It is not necessary to condemn the Israelites for feeling very keenly the loss of their accustomed food, which is notoriously the one thing which the poorest classes <span class="cmt_word">are</span> least able to bear; it is only necessary to condemn them for making this one loss of more account than all their gain. <span class="cmt_word">There is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.</span> Rather, "we have nothing (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>) except that our eye (falls) upon this manna." These graphic words speak of the longing looks which turned in every direction after the accustomed dainties, only to fall with disgust upon the inevitable manna. It was very ungrateful of them to speak disparagingly of the manna, which was good and wholesome food, and sufficient to keep them in health and strength; but it is useless to  deny that manna only for people who had been accustomed to a rich and varied diet must have been exceedingly trying both to the palate and the stomach (cf. <a href="/numbers/21-5.htm">Numbers 21:5</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-36.htm">Numbers 10:36</a>, the words which Moses was in the habit of uttering, both when the ark removed and when it came to rest again, are given not only as a proof of the joyous confidence of Moses, but as an encouragement to the congregation to cherish the same believing confidence. When breaking up, he said, "Rise up, Jehovah! that Thine enemies may be scattered, and they that hate Thee may flee before Thy face;" and when it rested, "Return, Jehovah, to the ten thousand thousands of Israel!" Moses could speak in this way, because he knew that Jehovah and the ark of the covenant were inseparably connected, and saw in the ark of the covenant, as the throne of Jehovah, a material pledge of the gracious presence of the Almighty God. He said this, however, not merely with reference to enemies who might encounter the Israelites in the desert, but with a confident anticipation of the calling of Israel, to strive for the cause of the Lord in this hostile world, and rear His kingdom upon earth. Human power was not sufficient for this; but to accomplish this end, it was necessary that the Almighty God should go before His people, and scatter their foes. The prayer addressed to God to do this, is an expression of bold believing confidence, - a prayer sure of its answer; and to Israel it was the word with which the congregation of God was to carry on the conflict at all times against the powers and authorities of a whole hostile world. It is in this sense that in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>, the words are held up by David before himself and his generation as a banner of victory, "to arm the Church with confidence, and fortify it against the violent attacks of its foes" (Calvin). &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; is construed with an accusative: return to the ten thousands of the hosts of Israel, i.e., after having scattered Thine enemies, turn back again to Thy people to dwell among them. The "thousands of Israel," as in <a href="/numbers/1-16.htm">Numbers 1:16</a>.<p>(Note: The inverted nuns, &#1504;, at the beginning and close of <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-36.htm">Numbers 10:36</a>, which are found, according to R.

Matt. Hilleri de Arcano Kethib et Keri libri duo, pp. 158, 159). The Cabbalists, on the other hand, according to R.
