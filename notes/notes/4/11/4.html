They were weary of the provision God had made for them, although wholesome food and nourishing. It cost no money or care, and the labour of gathering it was very little indeed; yet they talked of Egypt's cheapness, and the fish they ate there freely; as if that cost them nothing, when they paid dearly for it with hard service! While they lived on manna, they seemed exempt from the curse sin has brought on man, that in the sweat of his face he should eat bread; yet they speak of it with scorn. Peevish, discontented minds will find fault with that which has no fault in it, but that it is too good for them. Those who might be happy, often make themselves miserable by discontent. They could not be satisfied unless they had flesh to eat. It is evidence of the dominion of the carnal mind, when we want to have the delights and satisfaction of sense. We should not indulge in any desire which we cannot in faith turn into prayer, as we cannot when we ask meat for our lust.

But the word need not be pressed. J relates a murmuring in <a href="/context/exodus/15-23.htm" title="And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah....">Exodus 15:23-25</a>. It is not certain, however, that the words are an their original form.

In the process of compilation two sentences were lost. The words ‘And Moses said unto Jehovah’ in <span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/11-11.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, Why have you afflicted your servant? and why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?">Numbers 11:11</a></span> a are required for both narratives, and must be added for (I) at the beginning of <span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/11-13.htm" title="From where should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.">Numbers 11:13</a></span>.

Jehovah was angry and warned them that they would loathe the flesh when it came. Moses was incredulous that such a miracle could be performed. But a wind brought a mass of quails, and a plague was the result.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(II) Moses found the care and guidance of the people a burden too heavy to bear, and prayed that he might die.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(III) Jehovah took some of Moses’ spirit and put it upon seventy elders, so that they were filled with prophetic frenzy, including two who were not with the others in front of the Tent. Joshua wished Moses to forbid them, but he refused.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(I) <span class="ital"><a href="/context/numbers/11-4.htm" title="And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?...">Numbers 11:4-10</a>; <a href="/numbers/11-13.htm" title="From where should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.">Numbers 11:13</a>; <a href="/context/numbers/11-18.htm" title="And say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and you shall eat flesh: for you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and you shall eat....">Numbers 11:18-24</a></span> a, 31–34. <span class="ital">Manna and Quails</span>. In Exodus 16 there is a more complete narrative of the manna, from P , where <span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/11-35.htm" title="And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah to Hazeroth; and stayed at Hazeroth.">Numbers 11:35</a></span> (‘they did eat the manna … until they came into the borders of the land of Canaan’) shews that manna was not sent on two distinct occasions, but that the two narratives are parallel accounts. In the present chapter the <span class="ital">sending</span> of the manna is not related (see on <span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/11-6.htm" title="But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.">Numbers 11:6</a></span>). But it must not be concluded from this that our narrative is the <span class="ital">sequel</span> to that in Exodus 16; for (I) a description of the manna is given, as though it were a new phenomenon, in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/numbers/11-7.htm" title="And the manna was as coriander seed, and the color thereof as the color of bdellium....">Numbers 11:7-9</a></span> as well as in <a href="/exodus/16-14.htm" title="And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, on the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.">Exodus 16:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/16-31.htm" title="And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.">Exodus 16:31</a>, and there are considerable differences in the two accounts; and (2) the laying of the pot of manna ‘before the Testimony’ (<a href="/exodus/16-34.htm" title="As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.">Exodus 16:34</a>) shews that that narrative belongs to a time after the Testimony (i.e. the Decalogue) was given at Sinai. Thus both in P and J it is related that manna was sent after the departure from the mountain. Moreover, while P has this very full parallel account of the manna, it also has fragmentary references to the quails embedded in it. See <a href="/exodus/16-8.htm" title="And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD hears your murmurings which you murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.">Exodus 16:8</a> a (‘in the evening flesh to eat’), 12 (‘at even ye shall eat flesh’), 13a (‘at even the quails came up and covered the camp’).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(II) <span class="ital"><a href="/context/numbers/11-11.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, Why have you afflicted your servant? and why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?...">Numbers 11:11-12</a>; <a href="/context/numbers/11-14.htm" title="I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me....">Numbers 11:14-15</a></span>. It is not at first sight so clear that (II) is unconnected with (III). The gift of Moses’ spirit to the elders might seem to be the answer to Moses’ prayer for more help in managing the people. And the compiler has given this impression by the insertion of <span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/11-17.htm" title="And I will come down and talk with you there: and I will take of the spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you bear it not yourself alone.">Numbers 11:17</a></span> b. But (1) the spirit is not represented as being a spirit of wisdom and understanding, but merely of ecstasy or frenzy which enabled them to ‘prophesy’ as in the case of Saul and his messengers at a later time (<a href="/1_samuel/19-20.htm" title="And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.">1 Samuel 19:20</a> f., 23 f.). Moses’ answer to Joshua (<span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/11-29.htm" title="And Moses said to him, Envy you for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit on them!">Numbers 11:29</a></span>) as well as the express statement that the inspiration was purely temporary (<span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/11-25.htm" title="And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was on him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested on them, they prophesied, and did not cease.">Numbers 11:25</a></span>), quite preclude the idea that the elders were to help him in bearing the burden of the people. And (2) Moses’ complaint of the burden is closely similar in thought and language to <a href="/exodus/33-12.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, See, you say to me, Bring up this people: and you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, I know you by name, and you have also found grace in my sight.">Exodus 33:12</a> to <a href="/exodus/34-9.htm" title="And he said, If now I have found grace in your sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray you, go among us; for it is a stiff necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.">Exodus 34:9</a>. The discussion of the whole problem belongs rather to a commentary on Exodus. But it is far from improbable that (II) has been displaced from Exodus 33. Because the people had sinned, Jehovah said that He would not go to Canaan with them; Moses, therefore, would have to bear the burden alone; and he was overwhelmed with the thought. In consequence of Moses’ repeated intercession Jehovah relented and condescended to go with them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(III) <span class="ital"><a href="/context/numbers/11-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you....">Numbers 11:16-17</a></span> a, 24b–30. There are indications that the narrative of the elders is from E . Now the last passage from E previously to this is <a href="/context/exodus/33-7.htm" title="And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp....">Exodus 33:7-11</a>, a fragment relating Moses’ usual practice with regard to the ‘Tent of Meeting,’ in which the young man Joshua acted as his minister, and where Jehovah used to ‘come down’ in the cloud and converse with Moses. If that passage and (III) are read side by side, it will be seen that they are connected in the closest possible manner, both in style and subject-matter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(I) <span class="bld">4–10</span>. The Manna.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="cmt_word">The mixed multitude.</span> Hebrew, ha-<span class="accented">saphsuph</span>, the gathered; the rift-raft, or rabble, which had followed the fortunes of Israel out of Egypt, where they had probably been strangers and slaves themselves. What the nature and the number and the fate of this rabble were is a matter of mere conjecture  and of some perplexity. There does not seem any room for them in the regulations laid down for Israel, nor are they mentioned in any other place except at <a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>. In <a href="/leviticus/24-10.htm">Leviticus 24:10</a> we read of the son of an Israelitish woman by an Egyptian father, and this might lead us to conjecture that a great part of the "mixed multitude" was the offspring of such left-handed alliances. These half-breeds, according to the general rule in such cases, would follow their mothers; they would be regarded with contempt by the Jews of pure blood, and would accompany the march as hangers-on of the various tribes with which they were connected. As to their fate, it may be probably concluded, from the reason of things and from the absence of any further notice of them, that they found their way back to the slavery and the indulgences of Egypt; they were bound by no such strong restraints and animated by no such national feelings as the true people of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel also wept again.</span> This expression, again (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>, used adverbially), would seem to point to some former weeping, and this is generally found in the "murmuring" of which they had been guilty in the desert of Sin (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2, 3</a>). This, however, is unsatisfactory for several reasons: first, because that occurrence was too remote, having been more than a year ago; second, because there is no mention of any "weeping" at that time; third, because the matter of complaint on the two occasions was really quite different: <span class="accented">then</span> they murmured faithlessly at the blank starvation which apparently stared them in the face; <span class="accented">now</span> they weep greedily at the absence of remembered luxuries. It is therefore much more likely that the expression has regard to the "complaining" which had just taken place at Tabeerah. It was indeed wonderful that the punishment then inflicted did not check the sin; wonderful that it burst out again in an aggravated form almost immediately. But such was the obstinacy of this people, that Divine vengeance, which only perhaps affected a few, and only lasted for a brief space, was not sufficient to silence their wicked clamour. <span class="cmt_word">Who shall give us flesh to eat?</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> - Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> - means flesh-meat generally. They had flocks and herds it is true, but they were no doubt carefully preserved, and the increase of them would little more than suffice for sacrifice; no one would dream of slaughtering them for ordinary eating. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And they (the Israelites) departed from the mount of Jehovah (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>) three days' journey; the ark of the covenant of Jehovah going before them, to search out a resting-place for them. And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day, when they broke up from the camp." Jehovah still did as He had already done on the way to Sinai (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>): He went before them in the pillar of cloud, according to His promise (<a href="/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>), on their journey from Sinai to Canaan; with this simple difference, however, that henceforth the cloud that embodied the presence of Jehovah was connected with the ark of the covenant, as the visible throne of His gracious presence which had been appointed by Jehovah Himself. To this end the ark of the covenant was carried separately from the rest of the sacred things, in front of the whole army; so that the cloud which went before them floated above the ark, leading the procession, and regulating its movements in the direction it took in such a manner that the permanent connection between the cloud and the sanctuary might be visibly manifested even during their march. It is true that, in the order observed in the camp and on the march, no mention is made of the ark of the covenant going in front of the whole army; but this omission is no more a proof of any discrepancy between this verse and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a>, or of a difference of authorship, than the separation of the different divisions of the Levites upon the march, which is also not mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a>, although the Gershonites and Merarites actually marched between the banners of Judah and Reuben, and the Kohathites with the holy things between the banners of Reuben and Ephraim (<a href="/numbers/10-17.htm">Numbers 10:17</a> and <a href="/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>).<p>(Note: As the critics do not deny that vv. 11-28 are written by the "Elohist" notwithstanding this difference, they have no right to bring forward the account of the ark going first as a contradiction to ch. 2, and therefore a proof that <a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>. are not of Elohistic origin.)<p>The words, "the cloud was above them" (the Israelites), and so forth, can be reconciled with this supposition without any difficulty, whether we understand them as signifying that the cloud, which appeared as a guiding column floating above the ark and moved forward along with it, also extended itself along the whole procession, and spread out as a protecting shade over the whole army (as O. v. Gerlach and Baumgarten suppose), or that "above them" (upon them) is to be regarded as expressive of the fact that it accompanied them as a protection and shade. Nor is <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-39.htm">Psalm 105:39</a>, which seems, so far as the words are concerned, rather to favour the first explanation, really at variance with this view; for the Psalmist's intention is not so much to give a physical description of the phenomenon, as to describe the sheltering protection of God in poetical words as a spreading out of the cloud above the wandering people of God, in the form of a protection against both heat and rain (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5-6</a>). Moreover, <a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a> and <a href="/numbers/10-34.htm">Numbers 10:34</a> have a poetical character, answering to the elevated nature of their subject, and are to be interpreted as follows according to the laws of a poetical parallelism: The one thought that the ark of the covenant, with the cloud soaring above it, led the way and sheltered those who were marching, is divided into two clauses; in <a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a> only the ark of the covenant is mentioned as going in front of the Israelites, and in <a href="/numbers/10-34.htm">Numbers 10:34</a> only the cloud as a shelter over them: whereas the carrying of the ark in front of the army could only accomplish the end proposed, viz., to search out a resting-place for them, by Jehovah going above them in the cloud, and showing the bearers of the ark both the way they were to take, and the place where they were to rest. The ark with the tables of the law is not called "the ark of testimony" here, according to its contents, as in <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33-34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>, etc., but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, according to its design and signification for Israel, which was the only point, or at any rate the principal point, in consideration here. The resting-place which the ark of the covenant found at the end of three days, is not mentioned in <a href="/numbers/10-34.htm">Numbers 10:34</a>; it was not Tabeerah, however (<a href="/numbers/11-3.htm">Numbers 11:3</a>), but Kibroth-hattaavah (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11-34.htm">Numbers 11:34-35</a>; cf. <a href="/numbers/33-16.htm">Numbers 33:16</a>). </body></html>
