The Jews were distinguished from their neighbours in their dress, as well as in their diet, and thus taught not to be conformed to the way of the heathen in other things. They proclaimed themselves Jews wherever they were, as not ashamed of God and his law. The fringes were not appointed for trimming and adorning their clothes, but to stir up their minds by way of remembrance, 2Pe 3:1. If they were tempted to sin, the fringe would warn them not to break God's commandments. We should use every means of refreshing our memories with the truths and precepts of God's word, to strengthen and quicken our obedience, and arm our minds against temptation. Be holy unto your God; cleansed from sin, and sincerely devoted to his service; and that great reason for all the commandments is again and again repeated, I am the Lord your God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue - Reader that they add to the fringes of the borders (or corners) a thread of blue (compare the marginal references). These fringes are considered to be of Egypttian origin. The ordinary outer Jewish garment was a quadrangular piece of cloth like a modern plaid, to the corners of which, in conformity with this command, a tassel was attached. Each tassel had a conspicuous thread of deep blue, this color being doubtless symbolic of the heavenly origin of the commandments of which it was to serve as a memento. Tradition determined that the other threads should be white - this color being an emblem of purity (compare <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>). The arrangement of the threads and knots, to which the Jews attached the greatest importance, was so adjusted as to set forth symbolically the 613 precepts of which the Law was believed to consist. In our Lord's time the Pharisees enlarged their fringes <a href="/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a> in order to obtain reputation for their piety. In later times howerer, the Jews have worn the fringed garment (ta&#772;l&#305;&#770;&#772;th) of a smaller size and as an under-dress. Its use is still retained, especially at morning prayer in the Synagogue. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38. bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments&#8212;These were narrow strips, in a wing-like form, wrapped over the shoulders and on various parts of the attire. "Fringe," however, is the English rendering of two distinct Hebrew words&#8212;the one meaning a narrow lappet or edging, called the "hem" or "border" (Mt 23:5; Lu 8:44), which, in order to make it more attractive to the eye and consequently more serviceable to the purpose described, was covered with a riband of blue or rather purple color; the other term signifies strings with tassels at the end, fastened to the corners of the garment. Both of these are seen on the Egyptian and Assyrian frocks; and as the Jewish people were commanded by express and repeated ordinances to have them, the fashion was rendered subservient, in their case, to awaken high and religious associations&#8212;to keep them in habitual remembrance of the divine commandments.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It, </span> i.e. the riband, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall be unto you, </span> i.e. shall serve you <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">for the fringe, </span> to wit, to render it more visible and notorious by its certain, and remarkable, and distinct colour, whereas the fringe without this was of the same piece and colour with the garment, and therefore less observable.

The blue ribbon or lace shall be in or upon the fringe to fasten it: <p>that ye may look upon it; the blue lace making the whole the more conspicuous: from hence the Jews gather, that the night is not the time for wearing fringe, which lessens the sight, and it is not so easily seen; and that night garments are not obliged to have the fringe on them; and yet, they say, a blind man is bound to wear it, because, though he cannot see it, others can (g): <p>and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them: this is the general use, end, and design of the fringes, that upon sight of them they might be put in mind of the commandments and put upon the practice of them; these being at the four corners of their vestments, let them look which way they would downwards, before or behind, or on either side, they could not but see them: and the many threads in them might put them in mind of the many precepts they were to observe; and the white colour, the purity and holiness of them; and the blue or sky-coloured lace might lead them to observe the heavenly original of them; or being of a purple colour rather, might direct them to the blood of Christ, for the remission of the transgressions of them: the Jews have many fanciful things about the use and virtue of these fringes, not worthy of notice; and they say, that such who are careful to observe this law of the fringe, are worthy to see the face of the divine Majesty, and will be preserved from evil spirits (h): <p>and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes; to have and enjoy, and do those things, in matters of worship, which were of their own devising, and pleasing in their sight, as well as in moral things, what were agreeable to their carnal hearts, and make for the gratification of their senses: <p>after which ye use to go a whoring; which seems to restrain the sense pretty much to idolatry, to false and superstitious worship, which are often in Scripture expressed by fornication and whoredom; though other sins and lusts also are sometimes signified by the same words. <p>(g) Maimon. in Misn.

The words apparently mean—Ye are still prone to follow the superstitious and illegitimate practices to which your heart and your eyes lead you.

But there seems little doubt that the earlier superstitions connected with the tassels are referred to.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments.</span> It was indeed a minute and apparently trivial distinction, and yet such an one as would most surely strike the eye, and through the eye the mind. It was like the facings on a uniform which recall the fame and exploits of a famous regiment. The tasseled Hebrew was a marked man in other eyes, and in his own; he could not pass himself off as one of the heathen; he was perpetually reminded of the special relation in which he stood to the Lord, whose livery (so to speak) - or, to use another simile, whose colours - he wore. No doubt the sky-blue string or thread which was so prominent was meant to remind him of heaven, and of the God of heaven. <span class="cmt_word">And that ye seek not after your</span> own <span class="cmt_word">heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring.</span> The office of the tassels was to promote a recollected spirit. As it was, their fickle minds were always ready to stray away towards any heathen follies which their restless eyes might light upon. The trivial but striking peculiarity of their dress should recall them to <span class="cmt_word">the</span> thought that they were a peculiar people, holy to the Lord. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The History of the Sabbath-Breaker is no doubt inserted here as a practical illustration of sinning "with a high hand." It shows, too, at the same time, how the nation, as a whole, was impressed with the inviolable sanctity of the Lord's day. From the words with which it is introduced, "and the children of Israel were in the wilderness," all that can be gathered is, that the occurrence took place at the time when Israel was condemned to wander about in the wilderness for forty years. They found a man gathering sticks in the desert on the Sabbath, and brought him as an open transgressor of the law of the Sabbath before Moses and Aaron and the whole congregation, i.e., the college of elders, as the judicial authorities of the congregation (<a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>.). They kept him in custody, like the blasphemer in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-12.htm">Leviticus 24:12</a>, because it had not yet been determined what was to be done to him. It is true that it had already been laid down in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14-15</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-2.htm">Exodus 35:2</a>, that any breach of the law of the Sabbath should be punished by death and extermination, but the mode had not yet been prescribed. This was done now, and Jehovah commanded stoning (see <a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>), which was executed upon the criminal without delay. </body></html>
