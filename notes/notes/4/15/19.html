The beginning of this law is very encouraging, When ye come into the land of your habitation which I give unto you. This was a plain intimation that God would secure the promised land to their seed. It was requisite, since the sacrifices of acknowledgment were intended as the food of God's table, that there should be a constant supply of bread, oil, and wine, whatever the flesh-meat was. And the intent of this law is to direct the proportions of the meat-offering and drink-offering. Natives and strangers are placed on a level in this as in other like matters. It was a happy forewarning of the calling of the Gentiles, and of their admission into the church. If the law made so little difference between Jew and Gentile, much less would the gospel, which broke down the partition-wall, and reconciled both to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The general principle which includes the ordinance of this and the three verses following is laid down in <a href="/exodus/22-29.htm">Exodus 22:29</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering&#8212;The offering prescribed was to precede the act of eating.<p>unto the Lord&#8212;that is, the priests of the Lord (Eze 44:30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When ye eat, </span> i.e. when you are about to eat it; for before they did eat it, they were to offer this offering to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the bread, </span> i.e. the bread-corn, as that word is used. <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/job/28-5.htm" title="As for the earth, out of it comes bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.">Job 28:5</a> <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm" title="And wine that makes glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengthens man's heart.">Psalm 104:15</a> <a href="/isaiah/28-22.htm" title="Now therefore be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined on the whole earth.">Isaiah 28:22</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto the Lord, </span> i.e. to the priest of the Lord, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/ezekiel/44-30.htm" title="And the first of all the first fruits of all things, and every oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: you shall also give to the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in your house.">Ezekiel 44:30</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then it shall be, that when ye eat of the bread of the land,....
