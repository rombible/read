The Jews were distinguished from their neighbours in their dress, as well as in their diet, and thus taught not to be conformed to the way of the heathen in other things. They proclaimed themselves Jews wherever they were, as not ashamed of God and his law. The fringes were not appointed for trimming and adorning their clothes, but to stir up their minds by way of remembrance, 2Pe 3:1. If they were tempted to sin, the fringe would warn them not to break God's commandments. We should use every means of refreshing our memories with the truths and precepts of God's word, to strengthen and quicken our obedience, and arm our minds against temptation. Be holy unto your God; cleansed from sin, and sincerely devoted to his service; and that great reason for all the commandments is again and again repeated, I am the Lord your God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue - Reader that they add to the fringes of the borders (or corners) a thread of blue (compare the marginal references). These fringes are considered to be of Egypttian origin. The ordinary outer Jewish garment was a quadrangular piece of cloth like a modern plaid, to the corners of which, in conformity with this command, a tassel was attached. Each tassel had a conspicuous thread of deep blue, this color being doubtless symbolic of the heavenly origin of the commandments of which it was to serve as a memento. Tradition determined that the other threads should be white - this color being an emblem of purity (compare <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>). The arrangement of the threads and knots, to which the Jews attached the greatest importance, was so adjusted as to set forth symbolically the 613 precepts of which the Law was believed to consist. In our Lord's time the Pharisees enlarged their fringes <a href="/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a> in order to obtain reputation for their piety. In later times howerer, the Jews have worn the fringed garment (ta&#772;l&#305;&#770;&#772;th) of a smaller size and as an under-dress. Its use is still retained, especially at morning prayer in the Synagogue. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38. bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments&#8212;These were narrow strips, in a wing-like form, wrapped over the shoulders and on various parts of the attire. "Fringe," however, is the English rendering of two distinct Hebrew words&#8212;the one meaning a narrow lappet or edging, called the "hem" or "border" (Mt 23:5; Lu 8:44), which, in order to make it more attractive to the eye and consequently more serviceable to the purpose described, was covered with a riband of blue or rather purple color; the other term signifies strings with tassels at the end, fastened to the corners of the garment. Both of these are seen on the Egyptian and Assyrian frocks; and as the Jewish people were commanded by express and repeated ordinances to have them, the fashion was rendered subservient, in their case, to awaken high and religious associations&#8212;to keep them in habitual remembrance of the divine commandments.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Fringes</span> were certain threads or ends of their garments, standing out a little further than the rest of their garments, left there for this use. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the borders, </span> i.e. in the four <span class="ital">borders</span> or <span class="ital">quarters</span>, as it is <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/22-12.htm" title="You shall make you fringes on the four quarters of your clothing, with which you cover yourself.">Deu 22:12</a></span>.

No statement is there made as to the reason for the observance. It was probably a very ancient custom, dating from a time when such tassels were superstitiously worn as magical charms. Here, however, it has been invested with a higher religious significance. The practice is referred to in the N.T., <a href="/matthew/14-36.htm" title="And sought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.">Matthew 14:36</a>, <a href="/mark/6-56.htm" title="And wherever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and sought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.">Mark 6:56</a> (E.V. ‘border of his garment’); and it continues among the Jews to this day. In the synagogue all males over thirteen years of age wear a special garment called a <span class="ital">tallith</span>, which ‘consists of an oblong cloth with a tassel at each corner.

It seems to signify something flower-like and bright, like the blooms on a shrub; the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;</span>. is applied to the shining plate of gold upon Aaron's head-band (<a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>). In <a href="/jeremiah/48-9.htm">Jeremiah 48:9</a> it seems to mean a wing, and in <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span> is a lock of hair. The exact meaning must be gathered from the context, and on the whole that suggests a tassel rather than a fringe. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span>, used in the parallel passage <a href="/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>, seems to have this meaning. The Septuagint renders it by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, which is adopted in the Gospels (see on Matthew 23:5). <span class="cmt_word">In the borders of their garments.</span> Literally, "on the wings," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>.

It was also used as a coverlet by the poor (<a href="/exodus/22-27.htm">Exodus 22:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband</span> <span class="cmt_word">of blue.</span> Rather, "that they put a string (or thread) of hyacinth-blue upon the tassel of the wing."

This may have been a blue string with which to fasten the tassel to the corner of the garment, as if it were the stalk on which this flower grew; or it may have been a prominent blue thread in the tassel itself. The later Jews seem to have understood it in this sense, and concerned themselves greatly with the symbolical arrangements of the blue and other threads, and the method in which they were knotted together, so as to set forth the whole law with all its several commandments. The later Jews, however, have always contrived, with all their minute observance, to break the plain letter of the law: thus the modern <span class="accented">talith</span> is an under, and not an upper, garment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The History of the Sabbath-Breaker is no doubt inserted here as a practical illustration of sinning "with a high hand." It shows, too, at the same time, how the nation, as a whole, was impressed with the inviolable sanctity of the Lord's day. From the words with which it is introduced, "and the children of Israel were in the wilderness," all that can be gathered is, that the occurrence took place at the time when Israel was condemned to wander about in the wilderness for forty years. They found a man gathering sticks in the desert on the Sabbath, and brought him as an open transgressor of the law of the Sabbath before Moses and Aaron and the whole congregation, i.e., the college of elders, as the judicial authorities of the congregation (<a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>.). They kept him in custody, like the blasphemer in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-12.htm">Leviticus 24:12</a>, because it had not yet been determined what was to be done to him. It is true that it had already been laid down in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14-15</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/35-2.htm">Exodus 35:2</a>, that any breach of the law of the Sabbath should be punished by death and extermination, but the mode had not yet been prescribed. This was done now, and Jehovah commanded stoning (see <a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>), which was executed upon the criminal without delay. </body></html>
