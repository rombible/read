For though the typical service of the tabernacle or temple was only in one place, the preaching of the word of God, and prayer and praise, were not thus confined. These cities were to be given out of each tribe. Each thus made a grateful acknowledgement to God. Each tribe had the benefit of the Levites dwelling amongst them, to teach them the knowledge of the Lord; thus no parts of the country were left to sit in darkness. The gospel provides that he who is taught in the word, should communicate to him that teaches, in all good things, Ga 6:6. We are to free God's ministers from distracting cares, and to leave them at leisure for the duties of their station; so that they may be wholly employed therein, and avail themselves of every opportunity, by acts of kindness, to gain the good-will of the people, and to draw their attention.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Suburbs - Rather, "pasture-grounds," required for their large cattle, for their sheep and goats, and for all their beasts whatever they might be <a href="/numbers/35-3.htm">Numbers 35:3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in&#8212;As the Levites were to have no territorial domain allocated to them like the other tribes on the conquest of Canaan, they were to be distributed throughout the land in certain cities appropriated to their use; and these cities were to be surrounded by extensive suburbs. There is an apparent discrepancy between Nu 35:4 and Nu 35:5, with regard to the extent of these suburbs; but the statements in the two verses refer to totally different things&#8212;the one to the extent of the suburbs from the walls of the city, the other to the space of two thousand cubits from their extremity. In point of fact, there was an extent of ground, amounting to three thousand cubits, measured from the wall of the city. One thousand were most probably occupied with outhouses for the accommodation of shepherds and other servants, with gardens, vineyards, or oliveyards. And these which were portioned out to different families (1Ch 6:60) might be sold by one Levite to another, but not to any individual of another tribe (Jer 32:7). The other two thousand cubits remained a common for the pasturing of cattle (Le 25:34) and, considering their number, that space would be fully required.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Object.</span> In the next verse it is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">two thousand.</span> How do these agree? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> 1.

The one thousand cubits may be in length from the city, and the two thousand cubits in breadth on each side of the city, and so they well agree; for a line of a thousand cubits being draw in length eastward, and another westward, and another northward, and another southward, a line drawn at a thousand cubits distance from the city, from east to west, must needs contain two thousand cubits, and so must the other line from north to south, and so on every side of the city there must be two thousand cubits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> 3. This verse and the next do not speak to the same thing: this speaks of the space or place from whence the suburbs shall be measured, the next verse speaks of the space unto which that measure shall be extended; and the words may very well be read thus, <span class="ital">And the suburbs</span>—shall be (so it is only an ellipsis of the verb substantive, which is most frequent, and the meaning is, shall be taken or accounted) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">from the wall of the city, </span> and from (that particle being supplied or understood from the foregoing words, which is very usual) <span class="ital">without it</span>, or, from <span class="ital">the outward parts of it</span>, (which being a general and indefinite expression is limited and explained by the following words,) even from <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">a thousand cubits round about; </span> which are mentioned not as the thing measured, for as yet there is not a word of <span class="ital">measuring</span>, but as the term or space from which the measuring line should begin. And then it follows, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/35-5.htm" title="And you shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the middle: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.">Numbers 35:5</a></span>, <span class="ital">And ye shall measure from without the city</span> (not <span class="ital">from the wall of the city</span>, as was said before, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/35-4.htm" title="And the suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.">Numbers 35:4</a></span>, but <span class="ital">from without it</span>, i.e. from the said outward part or space of a thousand cubits without the wall of the city round about) <span class="ital">on the east side two thousand cubits</span>, &c.
