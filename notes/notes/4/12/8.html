The pretence was, that he had married a foreign wife; but probably their pride was hurt, and their envy stirred up, by his superior authority. Opposition from our near relations, and from religious friends, is most painful. But this is to be looked for, and it will be well if in such circumstances we can preserve the gentleness and meekness of Moses. Moses was thus fitted to the work he was called to. God not only cleared Moses, but praised him. Moses had the spirit of prophecy in a way which set him far above all other prophets; yet he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he; and our Lord Jesus infinitely excels him, Heb 3:1. Let Miriam and Aaron consider whom it was they insulted. We have reason to be afraid of saying or doing any thing against the servants of God. And those are presumptuous indeed who are not afraid to speak evil of dignities, 2Pe 2:10. The removal of God's presence is the surest and saddest token of God's displeasure.

It was the Deity Himself manifesting Himself so as to be cognizable to mortal eye. The special footing on which Moses stood as regards God is here laid down in detail, because it at once demonstrates that the supremacy of Moses rested on the distinct appointment of God, and also that Miriam in contravening that supremacy had incurred the penalty proper to sins against the theocracy.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. with him will I speak mouth to mouth&#8212;immediately, not by an interpreter, nor by visionary symbols presented to his fancy.<p>apparently&#8212;plainly and surely.<p>not in dark speeches&#8212;parables or similitudes.<p>the similitude of the Lord shall he behold&#8212;not the face or essence of God, who is invisible (Ex 33:20; Col 1:15; Joh 1:18); but some unmistakable evidence of His glorious presence (Ex 33:2; 34:5).

What the exact facts of the case were it is not possible to know, scarcely to imagine; but the words seem to imply a familiar speaking with an audible voice on the part of God, as distinguished from the internal voice, inaudible to the ear, with which he spake "in" the prophets. To assert that the revelations accorded to Moses were only subjective modifications of his own consciousness is to evacuate these strong words of any meaning whatever. <span class="cmt_word">Apparently.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> (Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) is an accusative in apposition to what goes before by way (apparently) of further definition. It is the same word translated "vision" in verse 6; but its meaning here must be determined by the expression "in riddles," which stands in antithesis to it. It was confessed]y the case with most prophetic utterances that the language in which they were couched was quite as much intended to conceal as to express their full meaning; but to Moses God spake without any such concealments. <span class="cmt_word">The similitude</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the Lord shall he behold.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>. Not the essential nature of God, which no man can see, but a form (wholly unknown and unimaginable to us) in which it pleased him to veil his glory. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>, referring, apparently, to the vision promised in <a href="/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>; and the Targum Palestine speaks here of the vision of the burning bush. The motive for this alteration is no doubt to be sought in a profound jealousy for the great truth declared in such texts as <a href="/deuteronomy/4-15.htm">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>, and afterwards in <a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>. But the statement in the text is a general one, and can only mean that Moses habitually in his intercourse with God had before his eyes some visible manifestation of the invisible God, which helped to make that intercourse at once more awfully real and more intensely blessed. Such manifestation to the sense of sight must be distinguished both from the visionary (or subjective) sight of God in human figure accorded to Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>), to Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>), to St. John (<a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2, 8</a>), and perhaps to others, and also from such theophanies in angel guise as are recorded in <a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>; <a href="/judges/13-9.htm">Judges 13:9, 2</a>, and elsewhere. On the other hand, the seventy elders seem to have seen the "Temunah" of the Lord upon that one occasion when they <span class="cmt_word">were</span> called up into Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses! No</span> doubt it was the double fact of their relationship to Moses after the flesh, and of their sharing with him in certain spiritual gifts and prerogatives, which made them oblivious of the great distinction which lifted him above their rivalry, and should have lifted him above their contradiction. That contradiction, however, served to bring out in the clearest way the singular and unapproached position of the mediator of Israel; and it serves still to enable us to estimate aright the peculiar dignity of his legislation and his writings. The substance of prophetic teaching may be of deeper interest and of wider import titan "the law," but this latter will still rank higher in the scale of inspiration, as having been more directly communicated front on high. Thus "the law" (as the Jews rightly taught) remained the body of Divine revelation until "that Prophet" came who was "like unto" Moses in the fact that he enjoyed constant, open, and direct communication with the Godhead. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Miriam and Aaron said, "Hath Jehovah then spoken only by Moses, and not also by us?" Are not we - the high priest Aaron, who brings the rights of the congregation before Jehovah in the Urim and Thummim (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>), and the prophetess Miriam (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>) - also organs and mediators of divine revelation? "They are proud of the prophetic gift, which ought rather to have fostered modesty in them. But such is the depravity of human nature, that they not only abuse the gifts of God towards the brother whom they despise, but by an ungodly and sacrilegious glorification extol the gifts themselves in such a manner as to hide the Author of the gifts" (Calvin). - "And Jehovah heard." This is stated for the purpose of preparing the way for the judicial interposition of God. When God hears what is wrong, He must proceed to stop it by punishment. Moses might also have heard what they said, but "the man Moses was very meek (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#836;&#769;&#x3c2;, lxx, mitis, Vulg.; not 'plagued,' geplagt, as Luther renders it), more than all men upon the earth." No one approached Moses in meekness, because no one was raised so high by God as he was. The higher the position which a man occupies among his fellow-men, the harder is it for the natural man to bear attacks upon himself with meekness, especially if they are directed against his official rank and honour. This remark as to the character of Moses serves to bring out to view the position of the person attacked, and points out the reason why Moses not only abstained from all self-defence, but did not even cry to God for vengeance on account of the injury that had been done to him. Because he was the meekest of all men, he could calmly leave this attack upon himself to the all-wise and righteous Judge, who had both called and qualified him for his office. "For this is the idea of the eulogium of his meekness. It is as if Moses had said that he had swallowed the injury in silence, inasmuch as he had imposed a law of patience upon himself because of his meekness" (Calvin).<p>The self-praise on the part of Moses, which many have discovered in this description of his character, and on account of which some even of the earlier expositors regarded this verse as a later gloss, whilst more recent critics have used it as an argument against the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, is not an expression of vain self-display, or a glorification of his own gifts and excellences, which he prided himself upon possessing above all others. It is simply a statement, which was indispensable to a full and correct interpretation of all the circumstances, and which was made quite objectively, with reference to the character which Moses had not given to himself but had acquired through the grace of God, and which he never falsified from the very time of his calling until the day of his death, either at the rebellion of the people at Kibroth-hattaavah (ch. 11), or at the water of strife (at Kadesh (ch. 20). His despondency under the heavy burden of his office in the former case (ch. 11) speaks rather for than against the meekness of his character; and the sin at Kadesh (ch. 20) consisted simply in the fact, that he suffered himself to be brought to doubt either the omnipotence of God, or the possibility of divine help, in account of the unbelief of the people.<p>(Note: There is not a word in <a href="/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10</a> or <a href="/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32</a> to the effect, that "his dissatisfaction broke out into evident passion" (Kurtz). And it is quite a mistake to observe, that in the case before us there was nothing at all to provoke Moses to appeal to his meekness, since it was not his meekness that Miriam had disputed, but only his prophetic call. If such grounds as these are interpolated into the words of Moses, and it is to be held that an attack upon the prophetic calling does not involve such an attack upon the person as might have excited anger, it is certainly impossible to maintain the Mosaic authorship of this statement as to the character of Moses; for the vanity of wishing to procure the recognition of his meekness by praising it, cannot certainly be imputed to Moses the man of God.)<p>No doubt it was only such a man as Moses who could speak of himself in such a way, - a man who had so entirely sacrificed his own personality to the office assigned him by the Lord, that he was ready at any moment to stake his life for the cause and glory of the Lord (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11-15.htm">Numbers 11:15</a>, and <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>), and of whom Calmet observes with as much truth as force, "As he praises himself here without pride, so he will blame himself elsewhere with humility,"-a man or God whose character is not to be measured by the standard of ordinary men (cf. Hengstenberg, Dissertations, vol. ii. pp. 141ff.). </body></html>
