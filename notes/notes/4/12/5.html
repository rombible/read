The pretence was, that he had married a foreign wife; but probably their pride was hurt, and their envy stirred up, by his superior authority. Opposition from our near relations, and from religious friends, is most painful. But this is to be looked for, and it will be well if in such circumstances we can preserve the gentleness and meekness of Moses. Moses was thus fitted to the work he was called to. God not only cleared Moses, but praised him. Moses had the spirit of prophecy in a way which set him far above all other prophets; yet he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he; and our Lord Jesus infinitely excels him, Heb 3:1. Let Miriam and Aaron consider whom it was they insulted. We have reason to be afraid of saying or doing any thing against the servants of God. And those are presumptuous indeed who are not afraid to speak evil of dignities, 2Pe 2:10. The removal of God's presence is the surest and saddest token of God's displeasure. Woe to us, if he depart! he never departs, till by sin and folly we drive him from us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The man Moses was very meek - In this and in other passages in which Moses no less unequivocally records his own faults (compare <a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a> ff; <a href="/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24</a> ff; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-37.htm">Deuteronomy 1:37</a>), there is the simplicity of one who bare witness of himself, but not to himself (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-29</a>).

The same thing may have occurred in the present case. Aaron and Miriam, in vaunting their claim to equality, imitated the action of Moses and entered with him; and they were then summoned to come forth to hear Jehovah’s oracle. His previous command ‘Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting’ was a challenge to Aaron and Miriam to do as Moses did, and to experience the result. Compare the similar challenge made by Aaron in <a href="/numbers/16-6.htm" title="This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;">Numbers 16:6</a> f.

On the other hand, the phrase must certainly be understood to mean the entrance of the court, or sacred enclosure, in <a href="/leviticus/8-3.htm">Leviticus 8:3, 31, 33</a>, and probably in other places. As it is hardly possible that the phrase can have had both meanings, the latter must be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">And they both came forth.</span> Not out of the sanctuary, into which Miriam could not have entered, but out of the enclosure.
