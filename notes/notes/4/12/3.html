It is possible that the writer of <a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm" title="And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,">Deuteronomy 34:10</a> may have inserted these words in this place. On the other hand, there is no necessity for such a supposition. An objective statement, such as that contained in these words, is perfectly consistent with true humility and with a deep sense of sinfulness and frailty. When such expressions are required in order to a full understanding of all the circumstances of the history, they afford no just ground of objection either against the writer, or against the genuineness of the writing; and least of all can they be justly objected to in the case of those who, like Moses and St. Paul, were ever ready to sacrifice their own personality in the cause to which they had devoted their lives (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very most chief apostles.">2Corinthians 11:5</a>). It may be observed, further, that the word <span class= "ital">anav, </span>meek, is frequently interchanged with the cognate word <span class= "ital">ani, </span>and that the meaning may be <span class= "ital">bowed down, </span>or <span class= "ital">oppressed.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/numbers/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/12-3.htm" title="(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were on the face of the earth.)">Numbers 12:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">The man Moses was very meek — </span>This is added as the reason why Moses took no notice of their reproach, and why God did so severely plead his cause. Thus was he fitted for the work he was called to, which required all the meekness he had. And this is often more tried by the unkindness of our friends, than by the malice of our enemies. This meekness of Moses was a great aggravation of the sin or his brother and sister, namely, that they should behave so insolently toward a man of his mild and sweet disposition, who was farthest of all men living from abusing his power, slighting any person beneath him, or harbouring the least malice for personal affronts. Probably this commendation was added, as some other clauses were, by some succeeding prophet. But how was Moses so meek, when we often read of his anger? Not to mention that <span class="ital">the law made nothing perfect, </span>(<a href="/hebrews/7-19.htm" title="For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.">Hebrews 7:19</a>,) it must be observed, true meekness does not exclude every kind of anger, but only such as is sinful.

The pretence was, that he had married a foreign wife; but probably their pride was hurt, and their envy stirred up, by his superior authority. Opposition from our near relations, and from religious friends, is most painful. But this is to be looked for, and it will be well if in such circumstances we can preserve the gentleness and meekness of Moses. Moses was thus fitted to the work he was called to. God not only cleared Moses, but praised him. Moses had the spirit of prophecy in a way which set him far above all other prophets; yet he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he; and our Lord Jesus infinitely excels him, Heb 3:1. Let Miriam and Aaron consider whom it was they insulted. We have reason to be afraid of saying or doing any thing against the servants of God. And those are presumptuous indeed who are not afraid to speak evil of dignities, 2Pe 2:10. The removal of God's presence is the surest and saddest token of God's displeasure.

This observation might have been made to account for Moses taking no notice of their angry reproaches and for God's interposing so speedily for the vindication of His servant's cause. The circumstance of Moses recording an eulogium on a distinguishing excellence of his own character is not without a parallel among the sacred writers, when forced to it by the insolence and contempt of opponents (2Co 11:5; 12:11, 12). But it is not improbable that, as this verse appears to be a parenthesis, it may have been inserted as a gloss by Ezra or some later prophet. Others, instead of "very meek," suggest "very afflicted," as the proper rendering.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is added as the reason why Moses took no notice of their reproach, but was one that heard it not, and why God did so speedily and severely plead Moses’s cause, because he did not avenge himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> 1.

The holy penmen of Scripture are not to be measured or censured by other profane writers, because they are guided by special instinct in every thing they write; and as they ofttimes publish their own and their near relations’ greatest faults, where it may be useful to the honour of God, and the edification of the church in after-ages; so it is not strange if for the same reasons sometimes they commend themselves, especially when they are forced to it by the insolence and contempt of their adversaries, which was Moses’s case here, in which case St. Paul also commends himself, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very most chief apostles.">2 Corinthians 11:5</a></span>, &c. <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="I am become a fool in glorying; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very most chief apostles, though I be nothing.">2 Corinthians 12:11</a>,12</span>; which they might the better do, because all their writings and carriage made it evident to all men that they did not this out of vain-glory, and that they were exalted above the affectation of men’s praises, and the dread of men’s reproaches. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

So that they might say anything against him, and he not be affronted, nor resent any injury; and this therefore is introduced as a reason why the Lord undertook the cause, and vindicated him, resenting the obloquies of Miriam and Aaron against him; because he knew he was so exceeding meek, that he himself would pass it by without taking notice of it, though he might hear it: hence the Targum of Jonathan"and he cared not for their words;''they gave him no concern or uneasiness, so meek, mild, and gentle was he: and this is to be considered; not as a self-commendation of Moses, but as a testimony of his character by God himself, by whom he was inspired in writing it; though it is possible this might be added by another hand, Joshua or Ezra, under the same direction and inspiration of the Spirit of God; who chose that such a character of Moses should stand here, in opposition to the calumnies cast upon him, and as giving a reason why not he himself, but the Lord, appeared in his vindication, he being so meek and lowly, as is said of his antitype, and by himself, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>, <p>above all the men which were upon the face of the earth; being seldom angry, and when he was, it was generally, if not always, when the honour of God was concerned, and not on account of his own person and character; though it must not be said of him that he was perfect in this respect, or free from passion, or from blame at any time on account of it, but, when compared with others, he was the meekest man that ever lived; whereby he became the fittest person to have to do with such a peevish, perverse, and rebellious people as the Israelites were, whom no other man could well have bore with. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">(Now the man Moses <i>was</i> very <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> meek, above all the men which <i>were</i> upon the face of the earth.)</span><p>(b) And so endured their grudging, although he knew of them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">very meek</span>] <span class="ital">very</span> <span class="bld">humble</span>; it might almost be rendered ‘very pious.’ The word does not connote meekness towards men, in the sense of patience under wrongs or insults, but always pious humility towards God. It is found frequently in the Psalms; and see <a href="/zephaniah/2-3.htm" title="Seek you the LORD, all you meek of the earth, which have worked his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be you shall be hid in the day of the LORD's anger.">Zephaniah 2:3</a>. Because of Moses’ humble piety, Jehovah grants him an overwhelming vindication in answer to the jealous challenge. To those who have held that the Pentateuch was from Moses’ own pen, this verse, with its appearance of self-righteousness, has always been a serious difficulty.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.</span> For the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> here; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">mitis.</span> The Targum Palestine has "bowed down in his mind," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, overwhelmed ("plagued," Luther). The ordinary version is undoubtedly' right; the object of the parenthesis was either to explain that there was no real ground for the hostility of Miriam and Aaron, or to show that the direct interference of the Lord himself was necessary for the protection of his servant. The verse bears a difficulty on its very face, because it speaks of Moses in terms which could hardly have been used by Moses of himself. Nor is this difficulty in the least degree diminished by the explanations which are offered by those who are determined to maintain at any cost the Mosaic authorship of every word in the Pentateuch. It is no doubt true to some extent that when a great and good man is writing of himself (and especially when he writes under the influence of the Holy Spirit), he can speak of himself with the same calm and simple truthfulness with which he would speak of any other. It is sufficient, however, to refer to the example of St. Paul to show that neither any height of spiritual privilege and authority, nor any intensity of Divine inspiration, obliterates the natural virtue of modesty, or allows a really humble man to praise himself without pain and shrinking. It is also to be observed that while St. Paul forces himself to speak of his privileges, distinctions, and sufferings, all of which were outward to himself, Moses would here be claiming for himself the possession of an inward virtue in greater measure than any other living soul. Surely it is not too much to say that if he did possess it in such measure, he could not possibly have been conscious that he did; only One was thus conscious of his own ineffable superiority, and this very consciousness is one of the strongest arguments for believing that he was infinitely more than a mere man, howsoever good and exalted. There is but one theory that will make it morally possible for Moses to have written this verse, viz., that in writing he was a mere instrument, and not morally responsible for what he did write. Such a theory will find few upholders. But, further, it is necessary to prove not only that Moses might have made this statement, but also that he might have made it in this form. Granted that it was necessary to the narrative to point out that he was very meek; it was <span class="accented">not</span> necessary to assert that he was absolutely the meekest man living. And if it was unnecessary, it was also unnatural. No good man would go out of his way to compare himself to his own advantage with all men upon the face of the earth.  The whole form of the sentence, indeed, as well as its position, proclaim it so clearly to be an addition by some later hand, that the question may be left to the common sense and knowledge of human nature of every reader; for the broad outlines of human character, morality, and virtue are the same in every age, and are not displaced by any accident of position, or even of inspiration. A slight examination of passages from other sacred writers, which are sometimes adduced as analogous, will serve to show how profound is the difference between what holy men <span class="accented">could</span> say of themselves and what they <span class="accented">could not</span> (cf. <a href="/daniel/1-19.htm">Daniel 1:19, 20</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-11.htm">Daniel 5:11, 12</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-11.htm">Daniel 10:11</a>). On the question of the inspiration of this verse, supposing it to be an interpolation, and as to the probable author of it, see the Preface. As to the fact of Moses' meekness, we have no reason to doubt it, but we may legitimately look upon the form in which it is stated as one of those conventional hyperboles which are not uncommon even in the sacred writings (cf. <a href="/genesis/7-19.htm">Genesis 7:19</a>; <a href="/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>). And we cannot avoid perceiving that Moses' meekness was far from being perfect, and was marred by sinful impatience and passion on more than one recorded occasion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As soon as Moses had returned with the elders into the camp, God fulfilled His second promise. "A wind arose from Jehovah, and brought quails (salvim, see <a href="/exodus/16-13.htm">Exodus 16:13</a>) over from the sea, and threw them over the camp about a day's journey wide from here and there (i.e., on both sides), in the neighbourhood of the camp, and about two cubits above the surface." The wind was a south-east wind (<a href="/psalms/78-26.htm">Psalm 78:26</a>), which blew from the Arabian Gulf and brought the quails - which fly northwards in the spring from the interior of Africa in very great numbers - from the sea to the Israelites. &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, which only occurs here and in the Psalm of Moses (<a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>), signifies to drive over, in Arabic and Syriac to pass over, not "to cut off," as the Rabbins suppose: the wind cut off the quails from the sea. &#1504;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;, to throw them scattered about (<a href="/exodus/29-5.htm">Exodus 29:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/31-12.htm">Exodus 31:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>). The idea is not that the wind caused the flock of quails to spread itself out as much as two days' journey over the camp, and to fly about two cubits above the surface of the ground; so that, being exhausted with their flight across the sea, they fell partly into the hands of the Israelites and partly upon the ground, as Knobel follows the Vulgate (volabant in are duobus cubitis altitudine super terram) and many of the Rabbins in supposing: for &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473; does not mean to cause to fly or spread out over the camp, but to throw over or upon the camp. The words cannot therefore be understood in any other way than they are in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-27.htm">Psalm 78:27-28</a>, viz., that the wind threw them about over the camp, so that they fell upon the ground a day's journey on either side of it, and that in such numbers that they lay, of course not for the whole distance mentioned, but in places about the camp, as much as two cubits deep. It is only in this sense of the words, that the people could possibly gather quails the whole of that day, the whole night, and the whole of the next day, in such quantities that he who had gathered but little had collected ten homers. A homer, the largest measure of capacity among the Hebrews, which contained ten ephahs, held, according to the lower reckoning of Thenius, 10,143 Parisian inches, or about two bushels Dresden measure. By this enormous quantity, which so immensely surpassed the natural size of the flocks of quails, God purposed to show the people His power, to give them flesh not for one day or several days, but for a whole month, both to put to shame their unbelief, and also to punish their greediness. As they could not eat this quantity all at once, they spread them round the camp to dry in the sun, in the same manner in which the Egyptians are in the habit of drying fish (Herod. ii. 77). </body></html>
