Those who have God for their Inheritance and their Portion for ever, ought to look with holy contempt and indifference upon the possessions of this world. The Levites were to give God his dues out of their tithes, as well as the Israelites out of their increase. See, in ver. 31, the way to have comfort in all our worldly possessions, so as to bear no sin by reason of them. 1. We must be sure that what we have is got honestly and in the service of God. That meat is best eaten which is first earned; but if any will not work, neither shall he eat, 2Th 3:10. 2. We must be sure that God has his dues out of it. We have the comfort of our substance, when we have honoured the Lord with it. Ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved the best from it. We should give alms of such things as we have, that all may be holy and comfortable to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek: Jacob had promised the tithe of all wherewith God blessed him if he should return in peace to his father's house.

The notion of &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;, keeping, as in <a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/16-32.htm">Exodus 16:32</a>, is defined in the second parallel clause as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492;, a portion (see at <a href="/leviticus/7-35.htm">Leviticus 7:35</a>). The priests were to keep all the heave-offerings, as the portion which belonged to them, out of the sacrificial gifts that the children of Israel offered to the Lord. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;, heave-offerings (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>, and <a href="/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>), is used here in the broadest sense, as including all the holy gifts (kodashim, see <a href="/leviticus/21-22.htm">Leviticus 21:22</a>) which the Israelites lifted off from their possessions and presented to the Lord (as in <a href="/numbers/5-9.htm">Numbers 5:9</a>). Among these, for example, were, first of all, the most holy gifts in the meat-offerings, sin-offerings, and trespass-offerings (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-9.htm">Numbers 18:9</a>, <a href="/numbers/18-10.htm">Numbers 18:10</a>; see at <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>). The burnt-offerings are not mentioned, because the whole of the flesh of these was burned upon the altar, and the skin alone fell to the portion of the priest (<a href="/leviticus/7-8.htm">Leviticus 7:8</a>). "From the fire," sc., of the altar. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, fire, is equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; ot , firing (see <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). These gifts they were to eat, as most holy, in a most holy place, i.e., in the court of the tabernacle (see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9</a>, <a href="/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6</a>), which is called "most holy" here, to lay a stronger emphasis upon the precept. In the second place, these gifts included also "the holy gifts;" viz., (a) (<a href="/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11</a>) the heave-offering of their gifts in all wave-offerings (tenuphoth), i.e., the wave-breast and heave-leg of the peace-offerings, and whatever else was waved in connection with the sacrifices (see at <a href="/leviticus/7-33.htm">Leviticus 7:33</a>): these might be eaten by both the male and female members of the priestly families, provided they were legally clean (<a href="/leviticus/22-3.htm">Leviticus 22:3</a>.); (b) (<a href="/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>) the gifts of first-fruits: "all the fat (i.e., the best, as in <a href="/genesis/45-18.htm">Genesis 45:18</a>) of oil, new wine, and corn," viz., &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501;, "the first of them," the &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "the first-grown fruits" of the land, and that of all the fruit of the ground (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/26-10.htm">Deuteronomy 26:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>), corn, wine, oil, honey, and tree-fruit (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>, compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-23.htm">Leviticus 19:23-24</a>), which were offered, according to <a href="/2_chronicles/31-5.htm">2 Chronicles 31:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-36.htm">Nehemiah 10:36</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38</a>, Tob. 1:6, as first-fruits every year (see Mishnah, Bikkur, i. 3, 10, where the first-fruits are specified according to the productions mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>; the law prescribed nothing in relation to the quantity of the different first-fruits, but left this entirely to the offerer himself); (c) (<a href="/numbers/18-14.htm">Numbers 18:14</a>) everything placed under a ban (see at <a href="/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a>); and (d) (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15-18</a>) the first-born of man and beast.
