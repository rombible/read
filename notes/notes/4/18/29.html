Those who have God for their Inheritance and their Portion for ever, ought to look with holy contempt and indifference upon the possessions of this world. The Levites were to give God his dues out of their tithes, as well as the Israelites out of their increase. See, in ver. 31, the way to have comfort in all our worldly possessions, so as to bear no sin by reason of them. 1. We must be sure that what we have is got honestly and in the service of God. That meat is best eaten which is first earned; but if any will not work, neither shall he eat, 2Th 3:10. 2. We must be sure that God has his dues out of it. We have the comfort of our substance, when we have honoured the Lord with it. Ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved the best from it. We should give alms of such things as we have, that all may be holy and comfortable to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Out of all your gifts - The spirit of this law would extend to all the revenues of the Levites; of the increase of their cattle, as well as of their tithes, a tithe would be paid by them for the Lord's service. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. the Levites &#8230; offer &#8230; a tenth of the tithe&#8212;Out of their own they were to pay tithes to the priests equally as the people gave to them.
