Godliness has the promise of the life that now is. And from the provision here made for the priests, the apostle shows that it is the duty of christian churches to maintain their ministers. Scandalous maintenance makes scandalous ministers. The priests were to be wholly devoted to their ministry, not diverted from it, or disturbed in it, by worldly care or business. Also, that they might be examples of living by faith, not only in God's providence, but in his ordinances. The best should be offered for the first-fruits unto the Lord.

To this end God had handed over the Levites to them as a gift, to be their assistants (see at <a href="/numbers/3-9.htm">Numbers 3:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/8-16.htm">Numbers 8:16</a>, <a href="/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>). But Aaron and his sons were to attend to the priesthood "with regard to everything of the altar and within the vail" (i.e., of the most holy place, see <a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a>). The allusion is to all the priestly duties from the altar of burnt-offering to the most holy place, including the holy place which lay between. This office, which brought them into the closest fellowship with the Lord, was a favour accorded to them by the grace of God. This is expressed in the words, "as a service of gift (a service with which I present you) I give you the priesthood." The last words in <a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a> are the same as in <a href="/numbers/1-51.htm">Numbers 1:51</a>; and "stranger" (zar), as in <a href="/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>. </body></html>
