Thus a confession of God's overruling power is extorted from a wicked prophet, to the confusion of a wicked prince. A second time the curse is turned into a blessing; and this blessing is both larger and stronger than the former. Men change their minds, and break their words; but God never changes his mind, and therefore never recalls his promise. And when in Scripture he is said to repent, it does not mean any change of his mind; but only a change of his way. There was sin in Jacob, and God saw it; but there was not such as might provoke him to give them up to ruin. If the Lord sees that we trust in his mercy, and accept of his salvation; that we indulge no secret lust, and continue not in rebellion, but endeavour to serve and glorify him; we may be sure that he looks upon us as accepted in Christ, that our sins are all pardoned. Oh the wonders of providence and grace, the wonders of redeeming love, of pardoning mercy, of the new-creating Spirit! Balak had no hope of ruining Israel, and Balaam showed that he had more reason to fear being ruined by them. Since Balaam cannot say what he would have him, Balak wished him to say nothing. But though there are many devices in man's heart, God's counsels shall stand. Yet they resolve to make another attempt, though they had no promise on which to build their hopes. Let us, who have a promise that the vision at the end shall speak and not lie, continue earnest in prayer, Lu 18:1.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fourth part of Israel - i. e., each one of the four camps, into which the host of Israel was divided (see <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>), seemed to swarm with innumerable multitudes.

Balaam bears testimony in this verse to the fulfillment of the promises in <a href="/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>.<p>The righteous - i. e., the ancestors of Israel, who "died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off" <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>.

The meaning is: they are a people happy, above all others, not only in life, but at death, from their knowledge of the true God, and their hope through His grace. Balaam is a representative of a large class in the world, who express a wish for the blessedness which Christ has promised to His people but are averse to imitate the mind that was in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I speak not these words by my own choice, but by the constraint of a higher power, which I cannot resist. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he answered and said,....
