Of one of this species, sent to London from Bengal in the year 1739, Dr. Parsons observes, “The vivacity and promptitude of his movements led me to think that he is altogether unconquerable, and that he could easily overtake any man who should offend him.” — See <span class="ital">Ency.

Thus a confession of God's overruling power is extorted from a wicked prophet, to the confusion of a wicked prince. A second time the curse is turned into a blessing; and this blessing is both larger and stronger than the former. Men change their minds, and break their words; but God never changes his mind, and therefore never recalls his promise. And when in Scripture he is said to repent, it does not mean any change of his mind; but only a change of his way. There was sin in Jacob, and God saw it; but there was not such as might provoke him to give them up to ruin. If the Lord sees that we trust in his mercy, and accept of his salvation; that we indulge no secret lust, and continue not in rebellion, but endeavour to serve and glorify him; we may be sure that he looks upon us as accepted in Christ, that our sins are all pardoned. Oh the wonders of providence and grace, the wonders of redeeming love, of pardoning mercy, of the new-creating Spirit! Balak had no hope of ruining Israel, and Balaam showed that he had more reason to fear being ruined by them. Since Balaam cannot say what he would have him, Balak wished him to say nothing. But though there are many devices in man's heart, God's counsels shall stand. Yet they resolve to make another attempt, though they had no promise on which to build their hopes. Let us, who have a promise that the vision at the end shall speak and not lie, continue earnest in prayer, Lu 18:1.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An unicorn - A wild bull, the now extinct Aurochs, formidable for its size, strength, speed, and ferocity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn&#8212;Israel is not as they were at the Exodus, a horde of poor, feeble, spiritless people, but powerful and invincible as a reem&#8212;that is, a rhinoceros (Job 39:9; Ps 22:21; 92:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God brought them out of Egypt, </span> to wit, by a strong hand, and in spite of all their enemies, and therefore it is in vain to seek or hope to overcome them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

But the words are strange in the midst of a passage describing the fierce and irresistible advance of an army with a divine King and Captain at their head. In <span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/23-21.htm" title="He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.">Numbers 23:21</a></span> the words for ‘calamity’ and ‘trouble’ can also be rendered, as in R.V. , ‘iniquity’ and ‘perverseness.’ And it is very probable that a scribe, who understood the two words in the latter sense, inserted the present clause as a marginal comment on <span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/23-21.htm" title="He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.">Numbers 23:21</a></span>, thus endorsing the principle contained in <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm" title="For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.">1 Samuel 15:23</a>, that soothsaying and divination by means of teraphim are sins no less than rebellion against God’s commands. It is further noteworthy that in the same chapter (<a href="/1_samuel/15-29.htm" title="And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.">1 Samuel 15:29</a>) are quoted Balaam’s words in <span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/23-19.htm" title="God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?">Numbers 23:19</a></span> a.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">23b</span>. <span class="ital">Now shall it be said</span> &c.] If the former half of the verse was not originally part of the poem, these words refer suitably to God’s action in bringing Israel out of Egypt (<span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/23-22.htm" title="God brought them out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn.">Numbers 23:22</a></span> a).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>, and also at the end of the next verse, and four times in the next chapter (verses 4, 8, 16, 23).

It is evident, however, from <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a> and other passages that the teem had two hems, and that its horns were its most prominent feature. It would also appear from <a href="/job/39-9.htm">Job 39:9-12</a> and <a href="/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a> that, while itself untameable, it was allied to species employed in husbandry. The reem may therefore have been the aurochs or urus, now extinct, but which formerly had so large a range in the forests of the old world. There is some doubt, however, whether the urns existed in those days in Syria, and it may have been a wild buffalo, or some kindred animal of the bovine genus, whose size, fierceness, and length of horn made it a wonder and a fear.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Upon Pisgah, Balak and Balaam made the same preparations for a fresh revelation from God as upon Bamoth-baal (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/23-1.htm">Numbers 23:1-6</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/numbers/23-15.htm">Numbers 23:15</a> does not mean "here" or "yonder," but "so" or "thus," as in every other case.
