Speak unto Aaron, &c.&#8212;The candlestick, which was made of one solid, massive piece of pure gold, with six lamps supported on as many branches, a seventh in the center surmounting the shaft itself (Ex 25:31; 37:17), and completed according to the pattern shown in the mount, was now to be lighted, when the other things in the sanctuary began to be applied to religious service. It was Aaron's personal duty, as the servant of God, to light His house, which, being without windows, required the aid of lights (2Pe 1:19). And the course he was ordered to follow was first to light the middle lamp from the altar-fire, and then the other lamps from each other&#8212;a course symbolical of all the light of heavenly truth being derived from Christ, and diffused by His ministers throughout the world (Re 4:5).<p>the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick&#8212;The candlestick stood close to the boards of the sanctuary, on the south side, in full view of the table of showbread on the north (Ex 26:35), having one set of its lamps turned towards the east, and another towards the west; so that all parts of the tabernacle were thus lighted up.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Aaron did so, he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick,.... As God had taken up his residence in the most holy place, as appears by the voice speaking from off the mercy seat, <a href="/numbers/7-89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>; and sacrifices were begun to be offered in the outward court on the altar of burnt offering, it was proper that the service of God in the holy place should also be set on foot; as placing of the shewbread on the shewbread table, and burning incense on the golden altar of incense; which could not well be done until the lamps were lighted, and therefore orders were given for the lighting them, which was accordingly done by Aaron: <p>as the Lord commanded Moses; <a href="/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>All the princes brought the same gifts. The order in which the twelve princes, whose names have already been given at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5-15</a>, made their presentation, corresponded to the order of the tribes in the camp (ch. 2), the tribe-prince of Judah taking the lead, and the prince of Naphtali coming last. In the statements as to the weight of the silver kearoth and the golden cappoth, the word shekel is invariably omitted, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/20-16.htm">Genesis 20:16</a>, etc. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/7-84.htm">Numbers 7:84-86</a>, the dedication gifts are summed up, and the total weight given, viz., twelve silver dishes and twelve silver bowls, weighing together 2400 shekels, and twelve golden spoons, weighing 120 shekels in all. On the sacred shekel, see at <a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; and on the probable value of the shekel of gold, at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24-25</a>.
