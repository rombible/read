All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him, according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns, he employs; angels themselves have their services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The children of Israel - i. e. through the heads of their tribes, who <a href="/numbers/7-2.htm">Numbers 7:2</a> no doubt acted for their tribesmen.

This party, who laid their hands upon the Levites, are supposed by some to have been the first-born, who by that act, transferred their peculiar privilege of acting as God's ministers to the Levitical tribe; and by others, to have been the princes, who thus blessed them. It appears, from this passage, that the imposition of hands was a ceremony used in consecrating persons to holy offices in the ancient, as, from the example of our Lord and His apostles, it has been perpetuated in the Christian Church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The children of Israel; </span> not all of them, which was impossible, but some in the name and stead, and by the appointment of all, to wit, either the first-born, or rather the princes or chiefs of each tribe, who used to transact things in the name of their tribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Put their hands upon the Levites; </span> whereby they signified their transferring of that right of ministering to God from the first-born, in whose hands it formerly was, unto the Levites, and their renouncing of their interest in the Levites, from whom they might otherwise have expected help by their persons or purses, as they did from other tribes, in their common concernments, and their entire resignation and dedication of them to God’s service; as the person offering, by laying his hand upon the head of his sacrifice, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm" title="And he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.">Leviticus 1:4</a></span>, signified his translation of his guilt upon the beast, and his dedication of it unto God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord,....

Some think by this rite is signified the consent of the people in the designation and appointment of the ministers of the word to their work and office; but what in the New Testament seems to answer to this is, the laying of the hands of the presbytery on ministers of the word, <a href="/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:</span><p>(e) Meaning, certain of them in the name of the whole.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">shall lay their hands</span>] Through their representatives (<a href="/context/numbers/1-4.htm" title="And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers....">Numbers 1:4-16</a>), to indicate that the whole community offered the Levites as their gift. Cf. the same action in the case of the burnt-offering (<a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm" title="And he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.">Leviticus 1:4</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the Lord.</span> As in chapter Numbers 5:16, either near the brazen altar, or more probably before the entrance of the tabernacle. <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites.</span> Presumably by means of their representatives, probably the tribe princes. This laying on of hands signified that the obligation to assist personally in the service of the sanctuary was transferred from the whole congregation to the Levites. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Consecration of the Levites. - The command of God to consecrate the Levites for their service, is introduced in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/8-1.htm">Numbers 8:1-4</a> by directions issued to Aaron with regard to the lighting of the candlestick in the dwelling of the tabernacle. Aaron was to place the seven lamps upon the candlestick in such a manner that they would shine &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;. These directions are not a mere repetition, but also a more precise definition, of the general instructions given in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>, when the candlestick was made, to place the seven lamps upon the candlestick in such a manner that each should give light over against its front, i.e., should throw its light upon the side opposite to the front of the candlestick. In itself, therefore, there is nothing at all striking in the renewal and explanation of those directions, which committed the task of lighting the lamps to Aaron; for this had not been done before, as <a href="/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a> merely assigns the daily preparation of the candlestick to Aaron and his sons; and their being placed in the connection in which we find them may be explained from the signification of the seven lamps in relation to the dwelling of God, viz., as indicating that Israel was thereby to be represented perpetually before the Lord as a people causing its light to shine in the darkness of this world. And when Aaron is commanded to attend to the lighting of the candlestick, so that it may light up the dwelling, in these special instructions the entire fulfilment of his service in the dwelling is enforced upon him as a duty. In this respect the instructions themselves, coupled with the statement of the fact that Aaron had fulfilled them, stand quite appropriately between the account of what the tribe-princes had done for the consecration of the altar service as representatives of the congregation, and the account of the solemn inauguration of the Levites in their service in the sanctuary. The repetition on this occasion (<a href="/exodus/27-4.htm">Exodus 27:4</a>) of an allusion to the artistic character of the candlestick, which had been made according to the pattern seen by Moses in the mount (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>.), is quite in keeping with the antiquated style of narrative adopted in these books. </body></html>
