The time of service during the wanderings in the wilderness was from thirty to fifty (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-23.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shall you number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-30.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old shall you number them, every one that enters into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:30</a>), during which time the constant removal of the Tabernacle required the services of men in the full vigour of life. The chronological order of events is not always observed in this book, and the directions contained in <a href="/context/numbers/8-23.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 8:23-26</a> may have been given at a later period, but inserted here in connection with the account of the appointment of the Levites to their office. On the other hand, it is quite possible that from the first the Levites entered upon the lighter parts of their office at the age of twenty-five years, but were not employed before they were thirty years of age in the more onerous duties of removing the Tabernacle, or in bearing on their shoulders the sacred vessels, as in the case of the Kohathites.<p><span class= "bld">To wait upon the service.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">to war the warfare, or to serve the </span>(<span class= "ital">military</span>)<span class= "ital"> service. </span>Similarly, in the following verse, <span class= "ital">he shall return from the warfare of the service.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:5-26 Here we have directions for the solemn ordination of the Levites. All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him, according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns, he employs; angels themselves have their services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Twenty and five years old and upward - The permanent limit as distinguished from the temporary <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-23.htm">Numbers 4:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-30.htm">Numbers 4:30</a>, though David found it necessary to extend the period of the Levites' service by causing it to commence at 20 years of age <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24-28</a>.

That direction, however, concerned the transport of the tabernacle and its belongings; this was a permanent regulation designed for the ordinary labours of the sanctuary at a time when the Levites would be scattered throughout their cities, and could only serve by courses. For the latter purpose many more would be required; and indeed they were found insufficient as it was in the latter days of David, when the wealth and devotion of the kingdom were fast increasing (see on 1 Chronicles 23:24-27). <span class="cmt_word">To wait upon the service.</span> Literally, "to war the warfare;" the idea of the <span class="accented">militia sacra</span> is kept up. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Levites were then to close this transfer of themselves to the Lord with a sin-offering and burnt-offering, in which they laid their hands upon the sacrificial animals. By this imposition of hands they made the sacrificial animals their representatives, in which they presented their own bodies to the Lord as a living sacrifice well-pleasing to Him. The signification of the dedication of the Levites, as here enjoined, is still further explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/8-13.htm">Numbers 8:13-19</a>. The meaning of <a href="/numbers/8-13.htm">Numbers 8:13</a>. is this: According to the command already given (in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/8-6.htm">Numbers 8:6-12</a>), thou shalt place the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and wave them as a wave-offering before the Lord, and so separate them from the midst of the children of Israel, that they may be Mine. They shall then come to serve the tabernacle. So shalt thou cleanse them and wave them.
