All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him, according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns, he employs; angels themselves have their services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Offer ... offering - Compare the margin Aaron pointed to the Levites, and then waved his hands, indicating (compare <a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a> note) that the offering was dedicated to God, and, again, by grant from Him, withdrawn for the use of the priests.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. after that, shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation&#8212;into the court, to assist the priests; and at removal into the tabernacle&#8212;that is, into the door of it&#8212;to receive the covered furniture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine,  <p>both men and beasts,....

The ceremony of waving consisted no doubt in his conducting the Levites solemnly up to the altar, and then back again. On the signification of the verb, see at <a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a>. The design of the waving is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/8-11.htm">Numbers 8:11</a>, viz., "that they might be to perform the service of Jehovah" (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24-26</a> compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4-33</a>). </body></html>
