All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him, according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns, he employs; angels themselves have their services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Levites could only undertake their duties <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/3.htm">Numbers 3</a>; 4 after the formal exchange of the Levites for the first-born <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/3-44.htm">Numbers 3:44-51</a>.<p>The distinction between the "consecration" of the priests <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a> and the less solemn "purification" <a href="/numbers/8-21.htm">Numbers 8:21</a> of the Levites is marked.

The Levites are inferior to the priests, and are therefore merely cleansed from the ceremonial pollution of ordinary life, while the priests receive something higher, an actual quality which the Hebrews called ‘holiness,’ i.e. not moral excellence, but separation, exclusiveness (Exodus 29, Leviticus 8).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord spake unto Moses.</span> At some time subsequent to the command given in chapters Numbers 3:6-13, and no doubt before the passover. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>All the princes brought the same gifts.
