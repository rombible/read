All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him, according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to do nothing.

Although the tribe was to be devoted to the divine service, their hereditary descent alone was not a sufficient qualification for entering on the duties of the sacred office. They were to be set apart by a special ceremony, which, however, was much simpler than that appointed for the priests; neither washing nor anointing, nor investiture with official robes, was necessary. Their purification consisted, along with the offering of the requisite sacrifices (Le 1:4; 3:2; 4:4), in being sprinkled by water mixed with the ashes of a red heifer (Nu 19:9), and shaved all over, and their clothes washed&#8212;a combination of symbolical acts which was intended to remind them of the mortification of carnal and worldly desires, and the maintenance of that purity in heart and life which became the servants of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of purifying, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">of sin</span>, i.e. for the expiation of sin.

It is not likely to have been prepared in the same manner as this latter (<a href="/numbers/19-9.htm">Numbers 19:9</a>), both because of the great difference between the two cases, and because the ordinance of the red heifer belonged to a later period. Nor is it likely to have resembled that used for cleansing the leper, or the water of jealousy. But it is rash to conclude that, because we do not read any special directions for its preparation, it must, therefore, have been nothing trot water from the laver which stood in the outer court. That water appears, indeed, to be called "holy water" in <a href="/numbers/5-17.htm">Numbers 5:17</a>, which is intelligible enough; but no probable reason  can be shown why it should be called "sin water;" it would seem as reasonable to call the water which our Lord turned into wine "sill water," because it stood there "for the purifying of the Jews." It is better to say that we do not know, because it is not recorded, how this water was prepared, or how it corresponded to its name. The Levites who were to be sprinkled would seem to have included all the males, some twenty thousand in number; because it was <span class="accented">all</span> the males, and not only those between thirty and fifty, who were to be dedicated in place of the first-born. In any case it was, of course, impossible that Moses could have sprinkled them individually (see below on verse 11). <span class="cmt_word">Let them shave all their flesh.</span> Literally, "let them cause the razor to pass over their whole body." Some distinguish between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> here and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> in <a href="/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8, 9</a>, as though the latter meant a much more complete shaving off of the hair than the former; but this difference is doubtful; the fact that the whole body as well as the head was to be shaved implies that it was more than a mere cutting short of the hair. <span class="cmt_word">Let them wash their clothes.</span> This was constantly enjoined on all the faithful as a preparation for any special religious service (see on Exodus 19:10). <span class="cmt_word">And so make themselves clean.</span> The shaving and washing had, no doubt, a symbolic significance, but their primary object was simply and obviously personal cleanliness; it is the hair and the clothes that chiefly harbour impurities, especially in a hot climate. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Consecration of the Levites. - The command of God to consecrate the Levites for their service, is introduced in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/8-1.htm">Numbers 8:1-4</a> by directions issued to Aaron with regard to the lighting of the candlestick in the dwelling of the tabernacle. Aaron was to place the seven lamps upon the candlestick in such a manner that they would shine &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;. These directions are not a mere repetition, but also a more precise definition, of the general instructions given in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>, when the candlestick was made, to place the seven lamps upon the candlestick in such a manner that each should give light over against its front, i.e., should throw its light upon the side opposite to the front of the candlestick. In itself, therefore, there is nothing at all striking in the renewal and explanation of those directions, which committed the task of lighting the lamps to Aaron; for this had not been done before, as <a href="/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a> merely assigns the daily preparation of the candlestick to Aaron and his sons; and their being placed in the connection in which we find them may be explained from the signification of the seven lamps in relation to the dwelling of God, viz., as indicating that Israel was thereby to be represented perpetually before the Lord as a people causing its light to shine in the darkness of this world. And when Aaron is commanded to attend to the lighting of the candlestick, so that it may light up the dwelling, in these special instructions the entire fulfilment of his service in the dwelling is enforced upon him as a duty. In this respect the instructions themselves, coupled with the statement of the fact that Aaron had fulfilled them, stand quite appropriately between the account of what the tribe-princes had done for the consecration of the altar service as representatives of the congregation, and the account of the solemn inauguration of the Levites in their service in the sanctuary. The repetition on this occasion (<a href="/exodus/27-4.htm">Exodus 27:4</a>) of an allusion to the artistic character of the candlestick, which had been made according to the pattern seen by Moses in the mount (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>.), is quite in keeping with the antiquated style of narrative adopted in these books. </body></html>
