But disbelief of the promise forbids the benefit. Those who despise the pleasant land shall be shut out of it. The promise of God should be fulfilled to their children. They wished to die in the wilderness; God made their sin their ruin, took them at their word, and their carcases fell in the wilderness. They were made to groan under the burden of their own sin, which was too heavy for them to bear. Ye shall know my breach of promise, both the causes of it, that it is procured by your sin, for God never leaves any till they first leave him; and the consequences of it, that will produce your ruin. But your little ones, now under twenty years old, which ye, in your unbelief, said should be a prey, them will I bring in. God will let them know that he can put a difference between the guilty and the innocent, and cut them off without touching their children.

But more probably the expression denotes simply a large number of times, like the English ‘dozen’ or ‘score’; cf. <a href="/genesis/31-7.htm" title="And your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.">Genesis 31:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-41.htm" title="Thus have I been twenty years in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your cattle: and you have changed my wages ten times.">Genesis 31:41</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/4-12.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelled by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places from where you shall return to us they will be on you.">Nehemiah 4:12</a>, <a href="/job/19-3.htm" title="These ten times have you reproached me: you are not ashamed that you make yourselves strange to me.">Job 19:3</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because all those men.</span> The particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is not to be rendered "because;" it simply introduces the substance of the oath: "As I live...  all those men...  shall not see." So the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">And have tempted me now these ten times.</span> It is not in the least necessary to press this expression, borrowed from the vague usage of men, literally. It is the language of indignation, meaning that the full measure of provocation had been received (cf. <a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>; <a href="/job/19-3.htm">Job 19:3</a>). The recorded instances of national "temptations" cannot be made to reach the number ten. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Intercession of Moses. - <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>, <a href="/numbers/14-12.htm">Numbers 14:12</a>. Jehovah resented the conduct of the people as base contempt of His deity, and as utter mistrust of Him, notwithstanding all the signs which He had wrought in the midst of the nation; and declared that He would smite the rebellious people with pestilence, and destroy them, and make of Moses a greater and still mightier people. This was just what He had done before, when the rebellion took place at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>). But Moses, as a servant who was faithful over the whole house of God, and therefore sought not his own honour, but the honour of his God alone, stood in the breach on this occasion also (<a href="/psalms/106-23.htm">Psalm 106:23</a>), with a similar intercessory prayer to that which he had presented at Horeb, except that on this occasion he pleaded the honour of God among the heathen, and the glorious revelation of the divine nature with which he had been favoured at Sinai, as a motive for sparing the rebellious nation (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13-19</a>; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). The first he expressed in these words (<a href="/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>.): "Not only have the Egyptians heard that Thou hast brought out this people from among them with Thy might; they have also told it to the inhabitants of this land. They (the Egyptians and the other nations) have heard that Thou, Jehovah, art in the midst of this people; that Thou, Jehovah, appearest eye to eye, and Thy cloud stands over them, and Thou goest before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. Now, if Thou shouldst slay this people as one man, the nations which have heard the tidings of Thee would say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which He sware to them, He has slain them in the desert." In that case God would be regarded by the heathen as powerless, and His honour would be impaired (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-9.htm">Joshua 7:9</a>). It was for the sake of His own honour that God, at a later time, did not allow the Israelites to perish in exile (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/48-11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22-23</a>). - &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;...&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>, <a href="/numbers/14-14.htm">Numbers 14:14</a>), et audierunt et dixerunt; &#1493; - &#1493;  equals  et - et, both - and. The inhabitants of this land (<a href="/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>) were not merely the Arabians, but, according to <a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a>., the tribes dwelling in and round Arabia, the Philistines, Edomites, Moabites, and Canaanites, to whom the tidings had been brought of the miracles of God in Egypt and at the Dead Sea. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm">Numbers 14:14</a>, can neither stand for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (dixerunt) se audivisse, nor for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, qui audierunt. They are neither of them grammatically admissible, as the relative pronoun cannot be readily omitted in prose; and neither of them would give a really suitable meaning. It is rather a rhetorical resumption of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>, and the subject of the verb is not only "the Egyptians," but also "the inhabitants of this land" who held communication with the Egyptians, or "the nations" who had heard the report of Jehovah (<a href="/numbers/14-15.htm">Numbers 14:15</a>), i.e., all that God had hitherto done for and among the Israelites in Egypt, and on the journey through the desert. "Eye to eye:" i.e., Thou hast appeared to them in the closest proximity. On the pillar of cloud and fire, see at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>. "As one man," equivalent to "with a stroke" (<a href="/judges/6-16.htm">Judges 6:16</a>). - In <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-17.htm">Numbers 14:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>, Moses adduces a second argument, viz., the word in which God Himself had revealed His inmost being to him at Sinai (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). The words, "Let the power be great," equivalent to "show Thyself great in power," are not to be connected with what precedes, but with what follows; viz., "show Thyself mighty by verifying Thy word, 'Jehovah, long-suffering and great in mercy,' etc.; forgive, I beseech Thee, this people according to the greatness of Thy mercy, and as Thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now." &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; (<a href="/numbers/14-19.htm">Numbers 14:19</a>)  equals  &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; (<a href="/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>). </body></html>
