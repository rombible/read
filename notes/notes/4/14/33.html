But disbelief of the promise forbids the benefit. Those who despise the pleasant land shall be shut out of it. The promise of God should be fulfilled to their children. They wished to die in the wilderness; God made their sin their ruin, took them at their word, and their carcases fell in the wilderness. They were made to groan under the burden of their own sin, which was too heavy for them to bear. Ye shall know my breach of promise, both the causes of it, that it is procured by your sin, for God never leaves any till they first leave him; and the consequences of it, that will produce your ruin. But your little ones, now under twenty years old, which ye, in your unbelief, said should be a prey, them will I bring in.

And as the children of the unchaste have generally to bear in their earthly careers much of the disgrace and the misery which forms the natural penalty of their parents' transgression; so here the children of the Israelites, although suffered to hope for an eventual entry into Canaan, were yet to endure, through many long years' wandering, the appropriate punishment of their fathers' willfulness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. save Caleb &#8230; and Joshua&#8212;These are specially mentioned, as honorable exceptions to the rest of the scouts, and also as the future leaders of the people.

The metaphor of whoredom, the action of a woman who deserts her husband for another, is frequently applied to Israel. By defiant unbelief (as here), or by the worship of foreign gods (as <a href="/hosea/2-7.htm" title="And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.">Hosea 2:7</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-1.htm" title="Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for you have gone a whoring from your God, you have loved a reward on every corn floor.">Hosea 9:1</a>), or by foreign alliances (as <a href="/ezekiel/16-26.htm" title="You have also committed fornication with the Egyptians your neighbors, great of flesh; and have increased your prostitutions, to provoke me to anger.">Ezekiel 16:26</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/23-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,...">Ezekiel 23:1-35</a>), she proved, time after time, unfaithful to Jehovah.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your children shall wander.</span> Literally, "shall pasture." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>.

That the Jews were guilty of idolatry in the wilderness is distinctly asserted (cf. <a href="/acts/7-42.htm">Acts 7:42, 43</a>); and these idolatrous practices, carried on no doubt in secret, must have been a sore trial to the generation which grew up amidst them (cf. <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14, 23</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This announcement commences in a tone of anger, with an aposiopesis, "How long this evil congregation" (sc., "shall I forgive it," the simplest plan being to supply &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, as Rosenmller suggests, from <a href="/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>), "that they murmur against Me?"</body></html>
