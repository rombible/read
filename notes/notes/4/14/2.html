The sorrow of the world worketh death. The Israelites murmured against Moses and Aaron, and in them reproached the Lord. They look back with causeless discontent. See the madness of unbridled passions, which makes men prodigal of what nature accounts most dear, life itself. They wish rather to die criminals under God's justice, than to live conquerors in his favour. At last they resolve, that, instead of going forward to Canaan, they would go back to Egypt. Those who walk not in God's counsels, seek their own ruin. Could they expect that God's cloud would lead them, or his manna attend them? Suppose the difficulties of conquering Canaan were as they imagined, those of returning to Egypt were much greater. We complain of our place and lot, and we would change; but is there any place or condition in this world, that has not something in it to make us uneasy, if we are disposed to be so? The way to better our condition, is to get our spirits in a better frame. See the folly of turning from the ways of God. But men run on the certain fatal consequences of a sinful course.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A land that eateth up ... - i. e. it is a land which from its position is exposed to incessant attacks from one quarter and another, and so its occupants must be always armed and watchful. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-4. Would God that we had died in Egypt&#8212;Such insolence to their generous leaders, and such base ingratitude to God, show the deep degradation of the Israelites, and the absolute necessity of the decree that debarred that generation from entering the promised land [Nu 14:29-35]. They were punished by their wishes being granted to die in that wilderness [Heb 3:17; Jude 5]. A leader to reconduct them to Egypt is spoken of (Ne 9:17) as actually nominated. The sinfulness and insane folly of their conduct are almost incredible. Their conduct, however, is paralleled by too many among us, who shrink from the smallest difficulties and rather remain slaves to sin than resolutely try to surmount the obstacles that lie in their way to the Canaan above.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Against Moses and against Aaron, </span> as the instruments and occasions of their present calamity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That we had died in the wilderness:</span> it was not long before they had their desire, and did die in the wilderness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses, and against Aaron,....
