But it came too late. If men would but be as earnest for heaven while their day of grace lasts, as they will be when it is over, how well would it be for them! That which has been duty in its season, when mistimed, may be turned into sin. Those who are out of the way of their duty, are not under God's protection, and go at their peril. God bade them go, and they would not; he forbade them, and they would go. Thus is the carnal mind enmity against God. They had distrusted God's strength; they now presume upon their own without his. And the expedition fails accordingly; now the sentence began to be executed, that their carcases should fall in the wilderness. That affair can never end well, which begins with sin. The way to obtain peace with our friends, and success against our enemies, is, to have God, as our Friend, and to keep in his love. Let us take warning from the fate of Israel, lest we perish after the same example of unbelief. Let us go forth, depending on God's mercy, power, promise, and truth; he will be with us, and bring our souls to everlasting rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My breach of promise - In the original, a word, found elsewhere only in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>, and meaning "my withdrawals" "my turning away."

They rushed from one extreme of rashness and perversity to another, and the obstinacy of their rebellious spirit was evinced by their active preparations to ascend the hill, notwithstanding the divine warning they had received not to undertake that enterprise.<p>for we have sinned&#8212;that is, realizing our sin, we now repent of it, and are eager to do as Caleb and Joshua exhorted us&#8212;or, as some render it, though we have sinned, we trust God will yet give us the land of promise. The entreaties of their prudent and pious leader, who represented to them that their enemies, scaling the other side of the valley, would post themselves on the top of the hill before them, were disregarded. How strangely perverse the conduct of the Israelites, who, shortly before, were afraid that, though their Almighty King was with them, they could not get possession of the land; and yet now they act still more foolishly in supposing that, though God were not with them, they could expel the inhabitants by their unaided efforts. The consequences were such as might have been anticipated. The Amalekites and Canaanites, who had been lying in ambuscade expecting their movement, rushed down upon them from the heights and became the instruments of punishing their guilty rebellion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Gat them up, </span> i.e. designed, or attempted, or prepared themselves to go up; for that they were not yet actually gone up, plainly appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/14-42.htm" title="Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that you be not smitten before your enemies.">Numbers 14:42</a>,44</span>, and from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/1-41.htm" title="Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us.
