Caleb and Joshua assured the people of the goodness of the land. They made nothing of the difficulties in the way of their gaining it. If men were convinced of the desirableness of the gains of religion, they would not stick at the services of it. Though the Canaanites dwell in walled cities, their defence was departed from them. The other spies took notice of their strength, but these of their wickedness. No people can be safe, when they have provoked God to leave them. Though Israel dwell in tents, they are fortified. While we have the presence of God with us, we need not fear the most powerful force against us. Sinners are ruined by their own rebellion. But those who, like Caleb and Joshua, faithfully expose themselves for God, are sure to be taken under his special protection, and shall be hid from the rage of men, either under heaven or in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Already Caleb had endeavored to still the people before Moses <a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>; already Moses himself (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-29.htm">Deuteronomy 1:29</a> ff) had endeavored to recall the people to obedience. After the failure of these efforts Moses and Aaron cast themselves down in solemn prayer before God (compare <a href="/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>); and the appearance of the glory of the Lord in the "tabernacle of the congregation" <a href="/numbers/14-10.htm">Numbers 14:10</a> was the immediate answer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

It was not, however, in this case an attitude of intercession, but the instinctive action of those who await in silent horror a catastrophe which they see to be inevitable; it testified to all who saw it that they were overwhelmed with shame and sorrow in view of the awful sin of the people, and of the terrible punishment which must follow. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus they spread an evil report of the land among the Israelites, by exaggerating the difficulties of the conquest in their unbelieving despair, and describing Canaan as a land which "ate up its inhabitants." Their meaning certainly was not "that the wretched inhabitants were worn out by the laborious task of cultivating it, or that the land was pestilential on account of the inclemency of the weather, or that the cultivation of the land was difficult, and attended with many evils," as Calvin maintains. Their only wish was to lay stress upon the difficulties and dangers connected with the conquest and maintenance of the land, on account of the tribes inhabiting and surrounding it: the land was an apple of discord, because of its fruitfulness and situation; and as the different nations strove for its possession, its inhabitants wasted away (Cler., Ros., O. v. Gerlach). The people, they added, are &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, "men of measures," i.e., of tall stature (cf. <a href="/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>), "and there we saw the Nephilim, i.e., primeval tyrants (see at <a href="/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>), Anak's sons, giants of Nephilim, and we seemed to ourselves and to them as small as grasshoppers." </body></html>
