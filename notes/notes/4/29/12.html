A larger number of burnt offerings was appointed for this feast than for any other festival. Seventy oxen in all were to be offered on the seven days of the feast, the number being diminished by one daily—viz., thirteen on the first day, twelve on the second, eleven on the third, and in like manner until the seventh day, on which seven oxen, the perfect number, were to be offered. In addition to the oxen, two rams and fourteen lambs were to be offered daily as burnt offerings, and a he-goat as a sin offering, in addition to the daily burnt offering. The appointed meal offerings and drink offerings were to be offered with all the burnt offerings. The large number of the sacrifices offered at this time may be accounted for from the consideration that at this feast the people not only expressed their gratitude for the Divine presence and protection, but also for the rich fruits of the harvest which had been recently ingathered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/numbers/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/29-12.htm" title="And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work, and you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days:">Numbers 29:12</a></span>. The eighth and last of these national sacrifices, which was also annual, was to be at the feast of tabernacles, to be observed on the fifteenth day of this same seventh month, in solemn commemoration of their travels in the wilderness, and as a thanksgiving for their happy settlement in the land of Canaan: see <a href="/leviticus/23-34.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:34</a>. <span class="ital">Seven days — </span>Not by abstaining so long from all servile work, but by offering extraordinary sacrifices each day.

Their days of rejoicing were to be days of sacrifices. A disposition to be cheerful does us good, when it encourages our hearts in the duties of God's service. All the days of dwelling in booths they must offer sacrifices; while we are here in a tabernacle state, it is our interest, as well as our duty, constantly to keep up communion with God. The sacrifices for each of the seven days are appointed. Every day there must be a sin-offering, as in the other feasts. Our burnt-offerings of praise cannot be accepted of God, unless we have an interest in the great sacrifice which Christ offered, when he made himself a Sin-offering for us. And no extraordinary services should put aside stated devotions. Every thing here reminds us of our sinfulness. The life that we live in the flesh must be by the faith of the Son of God; until we go to be with him, to behold his glory, and praise his mercy, who hath loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. To whom be honour and glory for ever.

The offerings required at this feast were the largest of all. It was especially one of thankfulness to God for the gift of the fruits of the earth; and the quantity and the nature of the offerings (see <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7-11</a>) were determined accordingly.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-34. on the fifteenth day&#8212;was to be held the feast of booths or tabernacles. (See Le 23:34, 35). The feast was to last seven days, the first and last of which were to be kept as Sabbaths, and a particular offering was prescribed for each day, the details of which are given with a minuteness suited to the infant state of the church. Two things are deserving of notice: First, that this feast was distinguished by a greater amount and variety of sacrifices than any other&#8212;partly because, occurring at the end of the year, it might be intended to supply any past deficiencies&#8212;partly because, being immediately after the ingathering of the fruits, it ought to be a liberal acknowledgment&#8212;and partly, perhaps, because God consulted the weakness of mankind, who naturally grow weary both of the charge and labor of such services when they are long-continued, and made them every day less toilsome and expensive [Patrick]. Secondly, it will be remarked that the sacrifices varied in a progressive ratio of decrease every day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The feast of booths; of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/23-34.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:34</a>,35 Deu 16:13</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Seven days; </span> not by abstaining so long from all servile works, but by offering extraordinary sacrifices each day. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an holy convocation,....
