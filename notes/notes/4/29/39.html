It appears by this account that there were every year sacrificed at the tabernacle and temple, at the stated national charge, the following number of beasts, namely; lambs, one thousand one hundred and one; bullocks, one hundred and thirty-two; rams, seventy-two; kids, twenty-one; goats, two; in all, one thousand three hundred and twenty- eight. Besides which, there was a vast number of voluntary, vow, and trespass-offerings, which, could they be computed, would swell the account to a much greater degree. We may learn from all this, three important lessons: 1st, That the expiation of sin, and reconciliation with God, for which this multitude of sacrifices was appointed, are not such trivial things as many would make them, but matters of infinite moment. 2d, That the sacrifice of Christ, which these sacrifices were intended to prefigure and typify, is of unspeakable worth and importance, and should never be thought of without reverence and gratitude. 3d, That we ought to be very thankful that by the coming of the Messiah, and the oblation of his blessed body for the expiation of sin, the necessity and use of these legal and typical sacrifices have been superseded, and the church of God freed from the intolerable yoke and burden of such numerous, expensive, and continually repeated offerings.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/numbers/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:12-40 Soon after the day of atonement, the day in which men were to afflict their souls, followed the feast of Tabernacles, in which they were to rejoice before the Lord. Their days of rejoicing were to be days of sacrifices. A disposition to be cheerful does us good, when it encourages our hearts in the duties of God's service. All the days of dwelling in booths they must offer sacrifices; while we are here in a tabernacle state, it is our interest, as well as our duty, constantly to keep up communion with God. The sacrifices for each of the seven days are appointed. Every day there must be a sin-offering, as in the other feasts. Our burnt-offerings of praise cannot be accepted of God, unless we have an interest in the great sacrifice which Christ offered, when he made himself a Sin-offering for us. And no extraordinary services should put aside stated devotions. Every thing here reminds us of our sinfulness. The life that we live in the flesh must be by the faith of the Son of God; until we go to be with him, to behold his glory, and praise his mercy, who hath loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. To whom be honour and glory for ever.

These things ye shall do unto the Lord in your set feasts&#8212;From the statements made in this and the preceding chapter, it appears that the yearly offerings made to the altar at the public expense, without taking into account a vast number of voluntary vow and trespass offerings, were calculated at the following amount:&#8212;goats, fifteen; kids, twenty-one; rams, seventy-two; bullocks, one hundred thirty-two; lambs, 1,101; sum-total of animals sacrificed at public cost, 1,241. This, of course, is exclusive of the prodigious addition of lambs slain at the passover, which in later times, according to Josephus, amounted in a single year to the immense number of 255,600.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Your free-will offerings; </span> your ordinary sacrifices shall not be omitted because of the extraordinary, which ye offer on special occasions. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These things ye shall do to the Lord, in your set feasts,....

On the seven feast-days, the first of which was to be celebrated with sabbatical rest and a holy meeting, there were to be offered, in addition to the daily burnt-offering, every day a he-goat for a sin-offering, and seventy oxen in all for a burnt-offering during the seven days, as well as every day two rams and fourteen yearling lambs, with the requisite meat-offerings and drink-offerings. Whilst, therefore, the number of rams and lambs was double the number offered at the Passover and feast of Pentecost, the number of oxen was fivefold; for, instead of fourteen, there were seventy offered during the seven days. This multiplication of the oxen was distributed in such a way, that instead of there being ten offered every day, there were thirteen on the first day, twelve on the second, and so on, deducting one every day, so that on the seventh day there were exactly seven offered; the arrangement being probably made for the purpose of securing the holy number seven for this last day, and indicating at the same time, through the gradual diminution in the number of sacrificial oxen, the gradual decrease in the festal character of the seven festal days. The reason for this multiplication in the number of burnt-offerings is to be sought for in the nature of the feast itself. Their living in booths had already visibly represented to the people the defence and blessing of their God; and the foliage of these booths pointed out the glorious advantages of the inheritance received from the Lord. But this festival followed the completion of the ingathering of the fruits of the orchard and vineyard, and therefore was still more adapted, on account of the rich harvest of splendid and costly fruits which their inheritance had yielded, and which they were about to enjoy in peace now that the labour of agriculture was over, to fill their hearts with the greatest joy and gratitude towards the Lord and Giver of them all, and to make this festival a speaking representation of the blessedness of the people of God when resting from their labours. This blessedness which the Lord had prepared for His people, was also expressed in the numerous burnt-offerings that were sacrificed on every one of the seven days, and in which the congregation presented itself soul and body to the Lord, upon the basis of a sin-offering, as a living and holy sacrifice, to be more and more sanctified, transformed, and perfected by the fire of His holy love (see my Archol. i. p. 416). </body></html>
