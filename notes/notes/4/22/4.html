He had a false notion, that if he could get some prophet to pray for evil upon them, and to pronounce a blessing upon himself and his forces, that then he should be able to deal with them. None had so great a reputation as Balaam; and Balak will employ him, though he send a great way for him. It is not known whether the Lord had ever spoken to Balaam, or by him, before this; though it is probable he had, and it is certain he did afterwards. Yet we have abundant proof that he lived and died a wicked man, an enemy to God and his people. And the curse shall not come upon us if there is not a cause, even though men utter it. To prevail with Balaam, they took the wages of unrighteousness, but God laid restraint upon Balaam, forbidding him to curse Israel. Balaam was no stranger to Israel's cause; so that he ought to have answered the messengers at once, that he would never curse a people whom God had blessed; but he takes a night's time to consider what he should do. When we parley with temptations, we are in great danger of being overcome. Balaam was not faithful in returning God's answer to the messengers. Those are a fair mark for Satan's temptation, who lessen Divine restraints; as if to go against God's law were only to go without his leave. The messengers also are not faithful in returning Balaam's answer to Balak. Thus many are abused by the flatteries of those about them, and are prevented from seeing their own faults and follies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Balak the son of Zippor - The comparison of <a href="/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4</a> with <a href="/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a> suggests that Balak was not the hereditary king but a Midianite, and that a change of dynasty had taken place. His father's name, Zippor, "Bird," reminds us of those of other Midianites, e. g., Oreb, "Crow," Zeeb, "Wolf."

The Midianites may be supposed to have made common cause with the Moabites in fear of the formidable enemy. But if so, it is surprising that they are not named in Balaam’s utterances in ch. 24. Behind the present narrative there may lie some unknown tradition in J which formed the basis of P’s narrative in 31:161 [Note: Notice that Midian is geographically connected with the territory of Moab in <a href="/genesis/36-35.htm" title="And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.">Genesis 36:35</a> (J).] .

They lived a semi-nomadic life on the steppes to the east of Moab and Ammon (cf. <a href="/genesis/36-35.htm">Genesis 36:35</a>), supporting themselves partly by grazing, and partly by the caravan trade (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>). Their institutions were no doubt patriarchal, like those of the modern Bedawin, and the "elders" were the sheiks of their tribes. <span class="cmt_word">As the ox licketh up the grass of the field.</span> The strong, scythe-like sweep of the ox's tongue was a simile admirable in itself, and most suitable to pastoral Moab and Midian. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Israelites then turned towards the north, and took the road to Bashan, where king Og came against them with his people, to battle at Edrei. From what point it was that the Israelites entered upon the expedition against Bashan, is not stated either here or in <a href="/deuteronomy/3-1.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1</a>., where Moses recapitulates these events, and gives a more detailed account of the conquests than he does here, simply because it was of no importance in relation to the main object of the history. We have probably to picture the conquest of the kingdoms of Sihon and Og as taking place in the following manner: namely, that after Sihon had been defeated at Jahza, and his capital had been speedily taken in consequence of this victory, Moses sent detachments of his army from the places of encampment mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-16.htm">Numbers 21:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-18.htm">Numbers 21:18-20</a>, into the different divisions of his kingdom, for the purpose of taking possession of their towns. After the conquest of the whole of the territory of Sihon, the main army advanced to Bashan and defeated king Og in a great battle at Edrei, whereupon certain detachments of the army were again despatched, under courageous generals, to secure the conquest of the different parts of his kingdom (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-39.htm">Numbers 32:39</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41-42</a>). The kingdom of Og embraced the northern half of Gilead, i.e., the country between the Jabbok and the Mandhur (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-13.htm">Deuteronomy 3:13</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>), the modern Jebel Ajlun, and "all Bashan," or "all the region of Argob" (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-13.htm">Deuteronomy 3:13-14</a>), the modern plain of Jaulan and Hauran, which extended eastwards to Salcah, north-eastwards to Edrei (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>), and northwards to Geshur and Maacha (<a href="/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>). For further remarks, see <a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>. There were two towns in Bashan of the name of Edrei. One of them, which is mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-4.htm">Deuteronomy 1:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>, along with Ashtaroth, as a second residence of king Og, is described in the Onom. (s. v. Ashtaroth and Edrei) as six Roman miles, i.e., fully two hours, from Ashtaroth, and twenty-four or twenty-five miles from Bostra, and called Adraa or Adara. This is the modern Der or Dra (in Burckhardt, p. 385; Seetzen, i. pp. 363, 364), and Draah, Idderat (in Buckingham, Syr. ii. p. 146), a place which still exists, consisting of a number of miserable houses, built for the most part of basalt, and standing upon a small elevation in a treeless, hilly region, with the ruins of an old church and other smaller buildings, supposed to belong to the time when Draa, Adraa (as urbs Arabiae), was an episcopal see, on the east of the pilgrim-road between Remtha and Mezareib, by the side of a small wady (see Ritter, Erdk. xv. pp. 838ff.). The other Edrei, which is mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a> as the north-western frontier of Bashan, was farther towards the north, and is still to be seen in the ruins of Zorah or Ethra (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>). In the present instance the southern town is intended, which was not far from the south-west frontier of Bashan, as Og certainly did not allow the Israelites to advance to the northern frontier of his kingdom before he gave them battle.</body></html>
