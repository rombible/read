He had a false notion, that if he could get some prophet to pray for evil upon them, and to pronounce a blessing upon himself and his forces, that then he should be able to deal with them. None had so great a reputation as Balaam; and Balak will employ him, though he send a great way for him. It is not known whether the Lord had ever spoken to Balaam, or by him, before this; though it is probable he had, and it is certain he did afterwards. Yet we have abundant proof that he lived and died a wicked man, an enemy to God and his people. And the curse shall not come upon us if there is not a cause, even though men utter it. To prevail with Balaam, they took the wages of unrighteousness, but God laid restraint upon Balaam, forbidding him to curse Israel. Balaam was no stranger to Israel's cause; so that he ought to have answered the messengers at once, that he would never curse a people whom God had blessed; but he takes a night's time to consider what he should do. When we parley with temptations, we are in great danger of being overcome. Balaam was not faithful in returning God's answer to the messengers. Those are a fair mark for Satan's temptation, who lessen Divine restraints; as if to go against God's law were only to go without his leave. The messengers also are not faithful in returning Balaam's answer to Balak. Thus many are abused by the flatteries of those about them, and are prevented from seeing their own faults and follies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Balaam the son of Beor was from the first a worshipper in some sort of the true God; and had learned some elements of pure and true religion in his home in the far East, the cradle of the ancestors of Israel. But though prophesying, doubtless even before the ambassadors of Balak came to him, in the name of the true God, yet prophecy was still to him as before a mere business, not a religion. The summons of Balak proved to be a crisis in his career: and he failed under the trial. When the gold and honors of Balak seemed to be finally lost, he became reckless and desperate; and, as if in defiance, counseled the evil stratagem by which he hoped to compass indirectly that ruin of God's people which he had been withheld from working otherwise. He thus, like Judas and Ahithophel, set in motion a train of events which involved his own destruction.<p>The name Balaam signifies "destroyer," or "glutton," and is in part identical with "Bela, son of Beor," the first king of Edom <a href="/genesis/36-32.htm">Genesis 36:32</a>.

In consequence of the consultation held by the king of Moab with the elders of Midian; and very probably through a motion of theirs, and by advice they gave, Balak dispatched messengers of both people to the person here described by his name and parentage; but who he was is not easy to say: the Jews sometimes make him to be a magician in Pharaoh's court, at the time when Moses was born (z), which is not probable; and it is still more improbable that he should be Laban the Syrian, as the Targum of Jonathan here, and the Targum on <a href="/1_chronicles/1-44.htm">1 Chronicles 1:44</a> though others say (a) he was the son of Beor, the son of Laban, and so was the grandson of Laban; and with as little probability is he said to be Elihu, that answered Job according to a tradition of the Jews, mentioned by Jerom (b); nor is there any reason to believe that he was ever a good man, and a true prophet of the Lord; he is expressly said to be a diviner or a soothsayer, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-22.htm">Joshua 13:22</a>, a sort of men abhorred of God, and not to be suffered to be among his people, <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a> but were of great credit and esteem among the Heathens, for their pretensions to foretell things to come, or to discover lost goods, and the like; and by their enchantments to drive away evils, or bring on curses, for which Balaam was famous: and therefore, by the advice of the Midianites, Balak sent for him <p>to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people; the land of his people, of his birth or habitation, was Aram or Syria, <a href="/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a> that is, Aram Naharaim, which lay between the two rivers Tigris and Euphrates, or what is sometimes called Mesopotamia, as is clear from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>, and the river of that land, which was eminently so called, is the river Euphrates, as the Targum of Jonathan expresses it here, and by that river was Pethor, where Balaam now lived; and is by some thought to be the same with the Pacoria of Ptolemy (c), which was by that river: the messengers were sent <p>to call him: to invite him to Balak's court: <p>saying, behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; Balak speaks of them, as if he knew not who they were, only that they were come from Egypt, and were seeking a new habitation to settle in, and so were in danger from them, lest they should invade his country, and settle there: <p>behold, they cover the face of the earth; not the face of the whole earth, unless an hyperbolical expression is supposed, to set forth the greatness of their numbers; but a large part of the earth, all within sight almost, even the plains of Moab: <p>and they abide over against me; were very near him, lay encamped before his country, and his metropolis, and so he thought himself in great danger, and threatened with an invasion, as the pitching of their tents so near made him surmise. <p>(z) Dibre Hayamim Shekmoaseh, fol. 3. 2.

The former derivation receives some support from <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14, 15</a>, where "Nicolaitans" are thought by many to be only a Greek form of" Balaamites" <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Beor (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>) has a similar signification, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, to burn, or consume. Both names have probable reference to the supposed effect of their maledictions, for successful cursing was an hereditary profession in many. lands, as it still is in some. Beer appears in <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a> as Bosor, which is called a Chaldeeism, but the origin of the change is really unknown. A "Bela son of Beer" is named in <a href="/genesis/36-32.htm">Genesis 36:32</a> as reigning in Edom, but the coincidence is of no importance: kings and magicians have always loved to give themselves names of fear, and their vocabulary was not extensive. <span class="cmt_word">To Pother, which</span> is by <span class="cmt_word">the river of the land of the children of his people.</span> Rather, "which is on the river," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the great river Euphrates, "in the land of the children of his people," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in his native land. The situation of Pethor (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) is unknown. <span class="cmt_word">Here is a people come out of Egypt.</span> Forty years had passed since their fathers had left Egypt. Yet Balak's words expressed a great truth, for this people was no wandering desert tribe, but for all intents the same great organized nation which had spoiled Egypt, and left Pharaoh's host dead behind them. <span class="cmt_word">They abide over against me</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. This would hardly have been said when Israel was encamped thirty miles north of Arnon, opposite to Jericho. The two embassies to Balaam must have occupied some time, and in the mean while Israel would have gone further on his way. We may naturally conclude that the first message was sent immediately after the defeat of Sihon, at a time when Israel was encamped very near the border of Moab. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Just as in the case of Sihon, the Lord had also promised the Israelites a victory over Og, and had given him into their power, so that they smote him, with his sons and all his people, without leaving any remnant, and executed the ban, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-34.htm">Deuteronomy 2:34</a>, upon both the kings.
