All the things were delivered them by name. It intimates the care God takes of his church and every member of it. The death of the saints is represented as the taking down of the tabernacle, 2Co 5:1, and the putting it off, 2Pe 1:14.

As for the sons of Merari&#8212;They carried the coarser and heavier appurtenances, which, however, were so important and necessary, that an inventory was kept of them&#8212;not only on account of their number and variety, but of their comparative commonness and smallness, which might have led to their being lost or missing through carelessness, inadvertency, or neglect. It was a useful lesson, showing that God disregards nothing pertaining to His service, and that even in the least and most trivial matters, He requires the duty of faithful obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,....
