These "instruments" comprised the heavier parts of the tabernacle; and the order seems intended to prevent individual Merarites choosing their own burden, and so throwing more than the proper share on others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29-33. As for the sons of Merari&#8212;They carried the coarser and heavier appurtenances, which, however, were so important and necessary, that an inventory was kept of them&#8212;not only on account of their number and variety, but of their comparative commonness and smallness, which might have led to their being lost or missing through carelessness, inadvertency, or neglect. It was a useful lesson, showing that God disregards nothing pertaining to His service, and that even in the least and most trivial matters, He requires the duty of faithful obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Every part and parcel therefore shall be put in an inventory; which is required here rather than in the foregoing particulars, partly, because these were much more numerous than the former; partly, because being meaner things, and such as might easily be supplied, they might otherwise have been neglected; and partly, to teach us that God esteems nothing small in his worship and service, and that he expects his will should be observed in the minutest circumstances. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,  <p>and their pins, and their cords,....
