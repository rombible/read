It would therefore be natural to suppose that the staves had all been taken out while the various coverings were put on. On the other hand, it is expressly directed in <a href="/exodus/25-15.htm">Exodus 25:15</a> that the staves of the ark shall "not be taken from it." Two explanations are possible. Either the former command does not contemplate the necessity of wrapping up the ark, and only applies to all times when it was at rest, or in movement; or else the latter direction only means, in the case of the ark, that the staves should be adjusted for the purpose of bearing. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Service of the Kohathites, and the number qualified for service. - <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-2.htm">Numbers 4:2</a>, <a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>.
