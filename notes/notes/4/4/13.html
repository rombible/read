No mention is made of the sacred fire; but as, by divine command, it was to be kept constantly burning, it must have been transferred to some pan or brazier under the covering, and borne by the appointed carriers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">From the altar of burnt-offerings; </span> whereby it may seem probable, though it be denied by most, that they did offer some sacrifices in the wilderness, though it may not be so frequently nor orderly as afterwards they did.

Having cleared the holy of holies, and the holy place, they were to come forth from thence into the court of the tabernacle, where stood the altar of burnt offering, which is here meant, and on which sacrifices being daily burnt, there were always ashes to be removed; and which at this time was highly necessary to be done, when the tabernacle was taken down, and all belonging to it to be carried away; and though no mention is made of the fire, which was always burning on it, it was doubtless preserved, and care was taken for the carrying it along with the altar, or in a separate vessel from it. Bishop Patrick supposes it might be carried upon the grate. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they shall take away the ashes from the <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon:</span><p>(g) Of the burnt offering.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take away the ashes.</span> This is omitted by the Septuagint. The Hebrew word for "ashes is of somewhat doubtful meaning, being only used here and in <a href="/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a> (see margin). Being connected with the word "fat," it may perhaps mean the grease or dripping from the burnt offerings. The Targum of Palestine renders it "cinders." As the altar was hollow, and was filled with earth or stones when used, there would be no need to cleanse it from ashes; if this be the meaning of the word, the command would rather have been to collect the living embers before the altar was removed, in order to keep alive the sacred fire. That this fire was never allowed to go out may be looked upon as certain. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Over the table of shew-bread (<a href="/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23</a>) they were to spread a hyacinth cloth, to place the plates, bowls, wine-pitchers, and drink-offering bowls (<a href="/exodus/25-29.htm">Exodus 25:29</a>) upon the top of this, and to lay shew-bread thereon; and then to spread a crimson cloth over these vessels and the shew-bread, and cover this with a sea-cow skin, and lastly to put the bearing poles in their places. </body></html>
