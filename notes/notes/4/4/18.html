The meaning of the command is plainly this, "Take care that the Kohathites are not cut off through any negligence or want of consideration on your part; and the form of the command, "cut ye not off," conveyed most emphatically the warning, that if any mischief befell the Kohathites which the priests could have prevented, they would be responsible for it in the sight of God. No doubt, as a fact, the Kohathites would take their cue from the conduct of the priests: if <span class="accented">they</span> were irreverent and careless, the Levites would be the same, and would sooner or later presume, and, presuming, would die. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>So again they were to wrap up the altar of incense (<a href="/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>), to adjust its bearing poles; and having wrapped it up in such coverings, along with the vessels belonging to it, to lay it upon the frame. </body></html>
