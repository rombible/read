Take the sum of the prey that was taken&#8212;that is, of the captives and cattle, which, having been first lumped together according to ancient usage (Ex 15:9; Jud 5:30), were divided into two equal parts: the one to the people at large, who had sustained a common injury from the Midianites and who were all liable to serve: and the other portion to the combatants, who, having encountered the labors and perils of war, justly received the largest share. From both parts, however, a certain deduction was taken for the sanctuary, as a thank offering to God for preservation and for victory. The soldiers had greatly the advantage in the distribution; for a five-hundredth part only of their half went to the priest, while a fiftieth part of the congregation's half was given to the Levites.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.

Of the half that came to the warriors, one person and one head of cattle were to be handed over to Eleazar the priest out of every 500 (i.e., one-fifth per cent.), as a heave-offering for Jehovah; and of the other half that was set apart for the children of Israel, i.e., for the congregation, one out of every fifty (i.e., 2 per cent.) was to be taken for the Levites. &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;, laid hold of, i.e., snatched out of the whole number during the process of counting; not seized or touched by the lot, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-6.htm">1 Chronicles 24:6</a>, as there was no reason for resorting to the lot in this instance. The division of the booty into two equal halves, one of which was given to the warriors, and the other to the congregation that had taken no part in the war, was perfectly reasonable and just. As the 12,000 warriors had been chosen out of the whole congregation to carry on the war on their behalf, the congregation itself could properly lay claim to its share of the booty. But as the 12,000 had had all the trouble, hardships, and dangers of the war, they could very properly reckon upon some reward for their service; and this was granted them by their receiving quite as much as the whole of the congregation which had taken no part in the war-in fact, more, because the warriors only gave one-fifth per cent. of their share as a thank-offering for the victory that had been granted them, whilst those who remained at home had to give 2 per cent. of their share to Jehovah for the benefit of the priests and Levites. The arrangement, however, was only made for this particular case, and not as a law for all times, although it was a general rule that those who remained at home received a share of the booty brought back by the warriors (cf. <a href="/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24-25</a>; 2 Macc. 8:28, 30). </body></html>
