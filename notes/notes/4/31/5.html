But if God, instead of sending an earthquake, a pestilence, or a famine, be pleased to authorize and command any people to avenge his cause, such a commission surely is just and right. The Israelites could show such a commission, though no persons now can do so. Their wars were begun and carried on expressly by Divine direction, and they were enabled to conquer by miracles. Unless it can be proved that the wicked Canaanites did not deserve their doom, objectors only prove their dislike to God, and their love to his enemies. Man makes light of the evil of sin, but God abhors it. This explains the terrible executions of the nations which had filled the measure of their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Were delivered - Or, "were told off." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. there were delivered&#8212;that is, drafted, chosen, an equal amount from each tribe, to prevent the outbreak of mutual jealousy or strife.

Several thousands very probably offered themselves voluntarily to go to the war, or however were summoned together on this account, and out of them the following number was delivered of picked and chosen men: <p>a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war; which was but a small number to go against so considerable a nation and people; but this was done to show that the war was of the Lord, he would fight the battle, and give them victory, it being the same to him to do it with few as with many; and to encourage the people of Israel to believe the Lord would give them success against their many and powerful enemies in the land of Canaan, on the borders of which they now were. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="bld">and</span> <span class="ital">there were delivered</span>] The use of this verb <span class="greekheb">וַיִמָּסְרוּ</span> would, if the reading were certain, mark the chapter as a late composition.

The first case (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/30-3.htm">Numbers 30:3-5</a>) is that of a woman in her youth, while still unmarried, and living in her father's house. If she made a vow of performance or abstinence, and her father heard of it and remained silent, it was to stand, i.e., to remain in force. But if her father held her back when he heard of it, i.e., forbade her fulfilling it, it was not to stand or remain in force, and Jehovah would forgive her because of her father's refusal. Obedience to a father stood higher than a self-imposed religious service. - The second case (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/30-6.htm">Numbers 30:6-8</a>) was that of a vow of performance or abstinence, made by a woman before her marriage, and brought along with her (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;, "upon herself") into her marriage. In such a case the husband had to decide as to its validity, in the same way as the father before her marriage. In the day when he heard of it he could hold back his wife, i.e., dissolve her vow; but if he did not do this at once, he could not hinder its fulfilment afterwards. &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1488;, gossip of her lips, that which is uttered thoughtlessly or without reflection (cf. <a href="/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>). This expression implies that vows of abstinence were often made by unmarried women without thought or reflection. - The third case (<a href="/numbers/30-9.htm">Numbers 30:9</a>) was that of a vow made by a widow or divorced woman. Such a vow had full force, because the woman was not dependent upon a husband. - The fourth case (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/30-10.htm">Numbers 30:10-12</a>) was that of a vow made by a wife in her married state. Such a vow was to remain in force if her husband remained silent when he heard of it, and did not restrain her. On the other hand, it was to have no force if her husband dissolved it at once. After this there follows the general statement (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/30-13.htm">Numbers 30:13-16</a>), that a husband could establish or dissolve every vow of performance or abstinence made by his wife. If, however, he remained silent "from day to day," he confirmed it by his silence; and if afterwards he should declare it void, he was to bear his wife's iniquity. &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, the sin which the wife would have had to bear if she had broken the vow of her own accord. This consisted either in a sin-offering to expiate her sin (<a href="/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>.); or if this was omitted, in the punishment which God suspended over the sin (<a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). </body></html>
