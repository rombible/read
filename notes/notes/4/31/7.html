As a nation they had forfeited their lives to the laws of God, and he, as judge of all the earth, had given command that the sentence of his laws should be executed on the guilty. Le Clerc properly observes, that there was this material difference between the wars of other nations and those of the Jews, that the former followed the bent of their own passions; whereas the Jews were only the ministers or executioners of divine justice, most evidently appointed to this work by God himself, as he manifested by a train of miracles wrought among and for them, such as had never been known on the earth before.

Had he himself rightly believed what he had said of the happy state of Israel, he would not have thus herded with the enemies of Israel. The Midianites' wicked wiles were Balaam's projects: it was just that he should perish with them, Ho 4:5. They took the women and children captives.

Whether the Midianites came out against them with an army, and there was a pitched battle between them, is not certain; however the Israelites committed acts of hostility upon them, by entering their cities, plundering their houses, and slaying the inhabitants of them; the Targum of Jonathan is,"they warred against Midian, and surrounded it in the three corners of it, as the Lord commanded Moses;''for, as Maimonides (b) observes from tradition,"when they besiege a city to take it, they do not surround it in the four corners of it, but in the three corners of it, and leave a place to flee out, that everyone that would might escape for his life, as it is said, "and they warred against Midian, as the Lord commanded Moses"; by report, or from tradition, it is learnt that so he commanded him;''that is, in such a manner to besiege a city; but for this there is only tradition, for it is not mentioned among the rules after directed to in such a case, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10</a>, <p>and they slew all the males; which fell into their hands; for, no doubt, there were multitudes that made their escape, since in later times we read of the Midianites, as a very powerful people, and very distressing to Israel, <a href="/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1</a> these, as Aben Ezra observes, they slew, were such as were grown up, for as for their little ones, them they spared and carried captive, <a href="/numbers/31-9.htm">Numbers 31:9</a>. <p>(b) Hilchot Melacim, c. 6. sect. 7. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">they slew every male</span>] An imaginative description of success.

Moses was to revenge (i.e., to execute) the revenge of the children of Israel upon the Midianites, and then to be gathered to his people, i.e., to die, as had already been revealed to him (<a href="/numbers/27-13.htm">Numbers 27:13</a>). "The revenge of the children of Israel" was revenge for the wickedness which the tribes of the Midianites who dwelt on the east of Moab (see at <a href="/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4</a>) had practised upon the Israelites, by seducing them to the idolatrous worship of Baal Peor. This revenge is called the "revenge of Jehovah" in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/31-3.htm">Numbers 31:3</a>, because the seduction had violated the divinity and honour of Jehovah. The daughters of Moab had also taken part in the seduction (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-2</a>); but they had done so at the instigation of the Midianites, and not of their own accord, and therefore the Midianites only were to atone for the wickedness. </body></html>
