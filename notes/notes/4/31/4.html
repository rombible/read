But if God, instead of sending an earthquake, a pestilence, or a famine, be pleased to authorize and command any people to avenge his cause, such a commission surely is just and right. The Israelites could show such a commission, though no persons now can do so. Their wars were begun and carried on expressly by Divine direction, and they were enabled to conquer by miracles. Unless it can be proved that the wicked Canaanites did not deserve their doom, objectors only prove their dislike to God, and their love to his enemies. Man makes light of the evil of sin, but God abhors it. This explains the terrible executions of the nations which had filled the measure of their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Avenge the Lord of Midian - The war against the Midianites was no ordinary war. It was indeed less a war than the execution of a divine sentence against a most guilty people.<p>Doubtless there were many among the Midianites who were personally guiltless as regards Israel. But the rulers deliberately adopted the counsel of Balaam against Israel, and their behests had been but too readily obeyed by their subjects. The sin therefore was national, and the retribution could be no less so.<p>But the commission of the Israelites in the text must not be conceived as a general license to slay. They had no discretion to kill or to spare. They were bidden to exterminate without mercy, and brought back to their task <a href="/numbers/31-14.htm">Numbers 31:14</a> when they showed signs of flinching from it. They had no alternarive in this and similar matters except to fulfill the commands of God; an awful but doubtless salutary manifestation, as was afterward the slaughter of the Canaanites, of God's wrath against sin; and a type of the future extermination of sin and sinners from His kingdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

The first case (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/30-3.htm">Numbers 30:3-5</a>) is that of a woman in her youth, while still unmarried, and living in her father's house. If she made a vow of performance or abstinence, and her father heard of it and remained silent, it was to stand, i.e., to remain in force. But if her father held her back when he heard of it, i.e., forbade her fulfilling it, it was not to stand or remain in force, and Jehovah would forgive her because of her father's refusal. Obedience to a father stood higher than a self-imposed religious service. - The second case (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/30-6.htm">Numbers 30:6-8</a>) was that of a vow of performance or abstinence, made by a woman before her marriage, and brought along with her (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;, "upon herself") into her marriage. In such a case the husband had to decide as to its validity, in the same way as the father before her marriage. In the day when he heard of it he could hold back his wife, i.e., dissolve her vow; but if he did not do this at once, he could not hinder its fulfilment afterwards. &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1488;, gossip of her lips, that which is uttered thoughtlessly or without reflection (cf. <a href="/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>). This expression implies that vows of abstinence were often made by unmarried women without thought or reflection. - The third case (<a href="/numbers/30-9.htm">Numbers 30:9</a>) was that of a vow made by a widow or divorced woman. Such a vow had full force, because the woman was not dependent upon a husband. - The fourth case (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/30-10.htm">Numbers 30:10-12</a>) was that of a vow made by a wife in her married state. Such a vow was to remain in force if her husband remained silent when he heard of it, and did not restrain her. On the other hand, it was to have no force if her husband dissolved it at once. After this there follows the general statement (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/30-13.htm">Numbers 30:13-16</a>), that a husband could establish or dissolve every vow of performance or abstinence made by his wife. If, however, he remained silent "from day to day," he confirmed it by his silence; and if afterwards he should declare it void, he was to bear his wife's iniquity. &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, the sin which the wife would have had to bear if she had broken the vow of her own accord. This consisted either in a sin-offering to expiate her sin (<a href="/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>.); or if this was omitted, in the punishment which God suspended over the sin (<a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). </body></html>
