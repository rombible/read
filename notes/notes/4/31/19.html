The question in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/31-15.htm">Numbers 31:15</a>, "Have ye left all the women alive?" is an expression of dissatisfaction, and reproof for their having done this. &#1500;&#1502;&#1505;&#1512;&#1470;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;...&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, "they have become to the Israelites to work unfaithfulness towards Jehovah," i.e., they have induced them to commit an act of unfaithfulness towards Jehovah.

On the fact itself, see <a href="/numbers/25-6.htm">Numbers 25:6</a>. The object of the command to put all the male children to death, was to exterminate the whole nation, as it could not be perpetuated in the women. Of the female sex, all were to be put to death who had known the lying with a man, and therefore might possibly have been engaged in the licentious worship of Peor (<a href="/numbers/25-2.htm">Numbers 25:2</a>), to preserve the congregation from all contamination from that abominable idolatry. </body></html>
