The case of a daughter in her father's house. When her vow comes to his knowledge, it is in his power either to confirm it or do it away. The law is plain in the case of a wife. If her husband allows her vow, though only by silence, it stands. If he disallows it, her obligation to her husband takes place of it; for to him she ought to be in subjection, as unto the Lord. The Divine law consults the good order of families. It is fit that every man should bear rule in his own house, and have his wife and children in subjection; rather than that this great rule should be broken, or any encouragement be given to inferior relations to break those bonds asunder, God releases the obligation even of a solemn vow. So much does religion secure the welfare of all societies; and in it the families of the earth have a blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, And if she shall at all be an husband's, and her vows shall be upon her, or a rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul, etc. The "at all" intimates that the case of a girl betrothed but not yet actually married is here especially contemplated. After betrothal, a woman continued to reside, until the period of her marriage arrived, in her father's house; but her property was from that time forward vested in her husband, and she was so far regarded as personally his, that an act of faithlessness to him was, like adultery, punishable with death <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23-24</a>. Hence, his right to control her vows even before he actually took her home as his wife. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth&#8212;Girls only are specified; but minors of the other sex, who resided under the parental roof, were included, according to Jewish writers, who also consider the name "father" as comprehending all guardians of youth. We are also told that the age at which young people were deemed capable of vowing was thirteen for boys and twelve for girls. The judgment of a father or guardian on the vow of any under his charge might be given either by an expressed approval or by silence, which was to be construed as approval. But in the case of a husband who, after silence from day to day, should ultimately disapprove or hinder his wife's vow, the sin of non-performance was to be imputed to him and not to her [Nu 30:15].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">An husband, </span> to whose will and authority she was thereby made subject. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When she vowed, </span> to wit, when she was in her father’s house, as is evident by comparing <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/30-10.htm" title="And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;">Numbers 30:10</a></span>; and this clause seems to be added by way of exception to that which was said <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/30-3.htm" title="If a woman also vow a vow to the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth;">Numbers 30:3</a>,4</span>, to signify, that though she were in her father’s house, yet if she were married, her husband only, and not her father, could disoblige her from her vow. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Or uttered ought; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Case second, of a married or betrothed woman. As far as the legal status of the woman was concerned, there was little difference under Jewish law whether she were married or only betrothed. In either case she was accounted as belonging to her husband, with all that she had (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23, 24</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When</span> <span class="cmt_word">she vowed.</span> Rather, "and her vows be upon her."

The vows might have been made before her betrothal, and not disallowed by her father; yet upon her coming under the power of her husband he had an absolute right to dissolve the obligation of them; otherwise it is evident that he might suffer loss through an act of which he had no notice. <span class="cmt_word">Or</span> <span class="cmt_word">uttered ought out of her lips.</span> Rather, "or the rash utterance of her lips."

Such a vow made by a young girl as would be disallowed by her husband when he knew of it would presumably be a "rash utterance." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/numbers/29-40.htm">Numbers 29:40</a> forms the conclusion of the list of sacrifices in ch. 28 and 29. </body></html>
