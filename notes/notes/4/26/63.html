There was not one man numbered now, who was numbered then, but Caleb and Joshua. Here appeared the righteousness of God, and his faithfulness to his threatenings. Especially observe the truth of God, in performing his promise to Caleb and Joshua. Death makes awful havoc of the human species, and causes surprising changes in families and nations; yet all is appointed in perfect wisdom, justice, and truth, by the Lord himself. This should stir us up to think upon the hateful nature of sin, the cause of all these devastations. We should renew our repentance, seek forgiveness, value the salvation of Christ, remember how frail we are, prepare for the summons of death, and fill up our days in serving our generation according to the will of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The total number of male Levites, 23,000, shows an increase of 1,000 on the number at Sinai <a href="/numbers/3-39.htm">Numbers 3:39</a>.

And after this the whole is concluded with a notice of the total number of those who were mustered of the tribe of Levi (<a href="/numbers/26-62.htm">Numbers 26:62</a>). - Of the different families mentioned, Libni belonged to Gershon (cf. <a href="/numbers/3-21.htm">Numbers 3:21</a>), Hebroni to Kohath (<a href="/numbers/3-27.htm">Numbers 3:27</a>), Machli and Mushi to Merari (<a href="/numbers/3-33.htm">Numbers 3:33</a>), and Korchi, i.e., the family of Korah (according to ch. <a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a>; cf. <a href="/exodus/6-21.htm">Exodus 6:21</a> and <a href="/exodus/6-24.htm">Exodus 6:24</a>), to Kohath. Moses and Aaron were descendants of Kohath (see at <a href="/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a> and <a href="/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1</a>). Some difficulty is caused by the relative clause, "whom (one) had born to Levi in Egypt" (<a href="/numbers/26-59.htm">Numbers 26:59</a>), on account of the subject being left indefinite. It cannot be Levi's wife, as Jarchi, Abenezra, and others suppose; for Jochebed, the mother of Moses, was not a daughter of Levi in the strict sense of the word, but only a Levitess or descendant of Levi, who lived about 300 years after Levi; just as her husband Amram was not actually the son of Amram, who bore that name (<a href="/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18</a>), but a later descendant of this older Amram. The missing subject must be derived from the verb itself, viz., either &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514; or &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; (her mother), as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-6.htm">1 Kings 1:6</a>, another passage in which "his mother" is to be supplied (cf. Ewald, 294, b.). </body></html>
