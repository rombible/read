We have here the families registered, as well as the tribes. The total was nearly the same as when numbered at mount Sinai. Notice is here taken of the children of Korah; they died not, as the children of Dathan and Abiram; they seem not to have joined even their own father in rebellion. If we partake not of the sins of sinners, we shall not partake of their plagues.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Following The tribes are mentioned in the same order as in the earlier census <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, except that Manasseh here precedes Ephraim; probably as being now the larger tribe.<p>The following table shows the numbers of the tribes at each census; at Sinai, and in the Plains of Moab:<p> At Sinai Plains of Moab  Reuben 46,500 43,730  Simeon 9,300 22,200  Gad 45,650 40,500  Judah 74,600 76,500  Issachar 54,400 64,300  Zebulun 57,400 60,500  Ephraim 40,500 32,500  Manasseh 32,200 52,700  Benjamin 35,400 45,600  <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/62.htm">Daniel 62</a>,700 64,400  Asher 41,500 53,400  Naphtali 53,400 45,400  Totals 603, 550 601, 730  <p>Seven of the tribes, of which three are tribes belonging to the camp of Judah, show an increase of numbers; and five, among whom are the three belonging to the camp of Reuben, show a decrease. The greatest increase of any one tribe is in Manasseh. The most remarkable decrease is in Simeon, which now shows less than half its former strength. To this tribe Zimri, the chief offender in the recent transgression, belonged <a href="/numbers/25-14.htm">Numbers 25:14</a>. Probably his tribesmen generally had followed his example, and had accordingly suffered most severely in the plague. In the parting blessing of Moses, uttered at no great interval from this date, the tribe of Simeon alone is omitted.<p>The families of all the tribes, excluding the Levites, number 57. The ancestral heads after whom these families are named correspond nearly with the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Jacob, enumerated in <a href="/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8</a> ff. Both lists consist mainly of grandchildren of Jacob, both contain also the same two grandchildren of Judah, and the same two grandchildren of Asher. The document in Genesis should be regarded as a list, not of those who went down in their own persons with Jacob into Egypt, but of those whose names were transmitted to their posterity at the date of the Exodus as the heads of Israelite houses, and wire may thus be reckoned the early ancestors of the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. These are the families of the Reubenites&#8212;the principal households, which were subdivided into numerous smaller families.

Of Nemuel we nowhere else read either he died without children, or he and his family perished with his brethren, being concerned with them in the conspiracy; or the family of the Palluite was in his line; one of the same name may be observed in the tribe of Simeon: <p>this is that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation; either before their rebellion, for their power and authority, being heads of their fathers' houses; or for their parts and abilities, being men of great wisdom and sense; or for their zeal, activity, and usefulness; or after it, and became famous, or rather infamous, on account of it, see <a href="/numbers/16-2.htm">Numbers 16:2</a>. <p>who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the Lord; who joined with Korah and his company, and quarrelled with Moses and Aaron about the priesthood; with Moses for putting Aaron into it, and with Aaron for accepting it, and officiating in it; and so with the Lord himself, by whose orders he was invested with it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram.

The mention of Dathan and Abiram leads the writer, or a later editor, to add a note recalling the incidents of ch. 16.

The pronoun refers to "the children of Israel," or more correctly, to the heads of the nation as the representatives of the congregation, who were to carry out the numbering. On the Arboth-Moab, see at <a href="/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a>. Only the leading point in their words is mentioned, viz., "from twenty years old and upwards" (sc., shall ye take the number of the children of Israel), since it was very simple to supply the words "take the sum" from <a href="/numbers/26-2.htm">Numbers 26:2</a>.<p>(Note: This is, at all events, easier and simpler than the alterations of the text which have been suggested for the purpose of removing the difficulty.
