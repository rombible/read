By doing this he had averted destruction from the Israelites, and restrained the working of Jehovah's zeal, which had manifested itself in the plague.

The covenant granted to Phinehas consisted in the fact, that an "eternal priesthood" (i.e., the eternal possession of the priesthood) was secured to him, not for himself alone, but for his descendants also, as a covenant, i.e., in a covenant, or irrevocable form, since God never breaks a covenant that He has made. In accordance with this promise, the high-priesthood which passed from Eleazar to Phinehas (<a href="/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>) continued in his family, with the exception of a brief interruption in Eli's days (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1.htm">1 Samuel 1-3</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>), until the time of the last gradual dissolution of the Jewish state through the tyranny of Herod and his successors (see my Archologie, 38). - In <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-14.htm">Numbers 25:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-15.htm">Numbers 25:15</a>, the names of the two daring sinners are given.
