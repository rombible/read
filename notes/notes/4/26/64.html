There was not one man numbered now, who was numbered then, but Caleb and Joshua. Here appeared the righteousness of God, and his faithfulness to his threatenings. Especially observe the truth of God, in performing his promise to Caleb and Joshua. Death makes awful havoc of the human species, and causes surprising changes in families and nations; yet all is appointed in perfect wisdom, justice, and truth, by the Lord himself. This should stir us up to think upon the hateful nature of sin, the cause of all these devastations. We should renew our repentance, seek forgiveness, value the salvation of Christ, remember how frail we are, prepare for the summons of death, and fill up our days in serving our generation according to the will of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It appears from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-14.htm">Deuteronomy 2:14-15</a> that the generation numbered at the former census had perished before the host crossed the brook Zered. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>64. among these there was not a man &#8230; numbered &#8230; in the wilderness of Sinai&#8212;The statement in this verse must not be considered absolute. For, besides Caleb and Joshua, there were alive at this time Eleazar and Ithamar, and in all probability a considerable number of Levites, who had no participation in the popular defections in the wilderness. The tribe of Levi, having neither sent a spy into Canaan, nor being included in the enumeration at Sinai, must be regarded as not coming within the range of the fatal sentence; and therefore it would exhibit a spectacle not to be witnessed in the other tribes of many in their ranks above sixty years of age.<p> Tribes  Chap. 1 Chap. 26 Increase Decrease Reuben    46,500   43,730    &#8212;        2,770 Simeon    59,300   22,200    &#8212;       37,100 Gad       45,650   40,500    &#8212;        5,150 Judah     74,600   76,500    1,900    &#8212; Issachar  54,400   64,300    9,900    &#8212; Zebulun   57,400   60,500    3,100    &#8212; Ephraim   40,500   32,500    &#8212;        8,000 Manasseh  32,200   52,700   20,500    &#8212; Benjamin  35,400   45,600   10,200    &#8212; Dan       62,700   64,400    1,700    &#8212; Asher     41,500   53,400   11,900    &#8212; Naphtali  53,400   45,400    &#8212;        8,000 Total    603,550  601,730   59,200   61,020          Total decrease               1,820   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered..... About thirty eight years before this time: this, as Aben Ezra observes, respects the numbering of the Israelites, not of the Levites; for there were some of the tribe of Levi numbered then who were living, as Eleazar, and very probably Ithamar, and perhaps some few more, though it may be Eleazar, being now a numberer, was not reckoned among the numbered: <p>when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai; see <a href="/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1</a> for as there were none of the tribe of Levi among the spies, there might be but few of them among the murmurers. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But among these there was not a man of them <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.</span><p>(g) In which appears the great power of God, that so wonderfully increased his people.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Mustering of the Levites. - The enumeration of the different Levitical families into which the three leading families of Levi, that were founded by his three sons Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, were divided, is not complete, but is broken off in <a href="/numbers/26-58.htm">Numbers 26:58</a> after the notice of five different families, for the purpose of tracing once more the descent of Moses and Aaron, the heads not of this tribe only, but of the whole nation, and also of giving the names of the sons of the latter (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-59.htm">Numbers 26:59-61</a>). And after this the whole is concluded with a notice of the total number of those who were mustered of the tribe of Levi (<a href="/numbers/26-62.htm">Numbers 26:62</a>). - Of the different families mentioned, Libni belonged to Gershon (cf. <a href="/numbers/3-21.htm">Numbers 3:21</a>), Hebroni to Kohath (<a href="/numbers/3-27.htm">Numbers 3:27</a>), Machli and Mushi to Merari (<a href="/numbers/3-33.htm">Numbers 3:33</a>), and Korchi, i.e., the family of Korah (according to ch. <a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a>; cf. <a href="/exodus/6-21.htm">Exodus 6:21</a> and <a href="/exodus/6-24.htm">Exodus 6:24</a>), to Kohath. Moses and Aaron were descendants of Kohath (see at <a href="/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a> and <a href="/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1</a>). Some difficulty is caused by the relative clause, "whom (one) had born to Levi in Egypt" (<a href="/numbers/26-59.htm">Numbers 26:59</a>), on account of the subject being left indefinite. It cannot be Levi's wife, as Jarchi, Abenezra, and others suppose; for Jochebed, the mother of Moses, was not a daughter of Levi in the strict sense of the word, but only a Levitess or descendant of Levi, who lived about 300 years after Levi; just as her husband Amram was not actually the son of Amram, who bore that name (<a href="/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18</a>), but a later descendant of this older Amram. The missing subject must be derived from the verb itself, viz., either &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514; or &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; (her mother), as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-6.htm">1 Kings 1:6</a>, another passage in which "his mother" is to be supplied (cf. Ewald, 294, b.). </body></html>
