For instance, it was determined by lot which of the tribes were to inherit in the south, which in the north, &c. But in that quarter where their lot fell a larger or smaller portion of land was appointed them, according to the goodness of the soil, and in proportion as they were more or less numerous. By these means all ground of quarrel among the several tribes was removed, and each acquiesced in his portion, as assigned by God himself, to whom the appeal was made by lot.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/numbers/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:52-56 In distributing these tribes, the general rule of equity is prescribed; that to many should be given more, and to fewer less.

The manner in which the lot was taken has not been recorded. But it is evident that the lot was cast for determining the section of the country in which each tribe should be located&#8212;not the quantity of their possessions. In other words, when the lot had decided that a particular tribe was to be settled in the north or the south, the east or the west, the extent of territory was allocated according to the rule (Nu 26:54).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By lot; </span> which lots seem to have been cast only for the tribes, not, as some would have it, for the several families, for the distribution of it to them was left to the ruler’s wisdom, according to the rule now given, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/26-54.htm" title="To many you shall give the more inheritance, and to few you shall give the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him.">Numbers 26:54</a></span>.

That the division might appear to be according to the determination and will of God, and not left to the judgment and discretion of the chief magistrate, though bound by the above rule: <p>according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit; that is, according as to whatsoever name of a tribe such a part or portion of the land comes up by lot, that shall their inheritance be: Jarchi says, the names of the twelve tribes were written on twelve scrolls of parchment, and twelve borders or limits of land on twelve others, and they were mixed together in an urn, and the prince put his hand into it and took two scrolls; a scroll came up with the name of a tribe, and a scroll with a border or limit expressed on it; and the lot, he says, was by the Holy Ghost, for Eleazar, at the same time, was clothed with Urim and Thummim (s); so that the people were certain that the disposition and division of the land was of God; but there were but nine tribes and a half, among whom the land of Canaan was divided, two tribes and a half settled on the other side Jordan, namely, the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh. <p>(s) Maimon. &amp; Bartenora in Misn.

The lot would also remove any suspicion that the more numerous tribes, such as Judah or Dan, were unfairly favoured (verse 56). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The families of Naphtali tally with the sons of Naphtali in <a href="/genesis/46-24.htm">Genesis 46:24</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/7-30.htm">1 Chronicles 7:30</a>.</body></html>
