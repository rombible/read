There was no water for the congregation. We live in a wanting world, and wherever we are, must expect to meet with something to put us out. It is a great mercy to have plenty of water, a mercy which, if we found the want of, we should more own the worth of. Hereupon they murmured against Moses and Aaron. They spake the same absurd and brutish language their fathers had done. It made their crime the worse, that they had smarted so long for the discontent and distrusts of their fathers, yet they venture in the same steps. Moses must again, in God's name, command water out of a rock for them; God is as able as ever to supply his people with what is needful for them. But Moses and Aaron acted wrong. They took much of the glory of this work of wonder to themselves; Must we fetch water? As if it were done by some power or worthiness of their own. They were to speak to the rock, but they smote it. Therefore it is charged upon them, that they did not sanctify God, that is, they did not give to him alone that glory of this miracle which was due unto his name. And being provoked by the people, Moses spake unadvisedly with his lips. The same pride of man would still usurp the office of the appointed Mediator; and become to ourselves wisdom, righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. Such a state of sinful independence, such a rebellion of the soul against its Saviour, the voice of God condemns in every page of the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The language of the murmurers is noteworthy.

Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly&#8212;Here is a fresh ebullition of the untamed and discontented spirit of the people.

Like fugitives, as Aben Ezra; they fled from them through fear, lest they should rise and fall upon them, and stone them, as their fathers were ready to do in a like case, <a href="/exodus/17-4.htm">Exodus 17:4</a>. It is very likely this assembly gathered about the tents of Moses and Aaron, who went from thence unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; where the Lord had promised to meet Moses, and speak unto him, <a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42</a>. <p>and they fell upon their faces; to pray, as Aben Ezra, that God would forgive the sin, of the people, and not break forth in his wrath against them, as he sometimes had done, and as their sin deserved, and that he would grant them what was needful for them. In the Vulgate Latin version the following words are added as their prayer,"and they cried unto the Lord, and said, Lord God, hear the cry of this people, and open to them thy treasure, the fountain of living water, that they being satiated, their murmuring may cease.''But they are not neither in the Hebrew text, nor in the Greek version, nor the Chaldee paraphrases: <p>and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them; either to Moses and Aaron, to encourage them to expect their prayers would be answered; or to the people, to terrify them, and silence their murmurings; see <a href="/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/numbers/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They fell</span> <span class="cmt_word">upon their faces.</span> See note on chapter Numbers 14:5. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This also was to be an everlasting statute, that he who sprinkled the water of purification, or even touched it (see at <a href="/numbers/19-7.htm">Numbers 19:7</a>.), and he who was touched by a person defiled (by a corpse), and also the person who touched him, should be unclean till the evening, - a rule which also applied to other forms of uncleanness. </body></html>
