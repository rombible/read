They would foster vipers in their own bosoms. The remnant of the Canaanites, if they made any peace with them, though but for a time, would be pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their sides. We must expect trouble and affliction from whatever sin we indulge; that which we are willing should tempt us, will vex us. It was intended that the Canaanites should be put out of the land; but if the Israelites learned their wicked ways, they also would be put out. Let us hear this and fear.

But the word seems to have acquired a more general force, and to have been used for any sanctuaries, even in valleys and by the gates of cities (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-8.htm" title="And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and broke down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.">2 Kings 23:8</a>). In the present passage the word cannot refer to hills, for the Israelites are bidden to ‘demolish them.’ Some think that the <span class="ital">bâmôth</span> of later times may have been small artificial mounds, to represent the hills of the ancient worship; but there is no certain evidence of this.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall drive out.</span> The Hebrew word (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) is the same which is translated "dispossess" in the next verse.

The Targums of Onkelos and Palestine have "the houses of their worship;" the Targum of Jerusalem has "their idols."

As a fact, it would seem that the Jews, instead of obeying this command, appropriated the Bamoth to their own religious uses (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-58.htm">Psalm 78:58</a>, &c.). The natural result was, as in all similar cases, that not only the Bamoth, but very many of the superstitions and idolatries connected with them, were taken over into the service of the Lord. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The places of encampment on the journey of the fortieth year from Kadesh to Mount Hor, and round Edom and Moab into the steppes of Moab, have been discussed at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a> and 21.
