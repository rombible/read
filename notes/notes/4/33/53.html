They would foster vipers in their own bosoms. The remnant of the Canaanites, if they made any peace with them, though but for a time, would be pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their sides. We must expect trouble and affliction from whatever sin we indulge; that which we are willing should tempt us, will vex us. It was intended that the Canaanites should be put out of the land; but if the Israelites learned their wicked ways, they also would be put out. Let us hear this and fear. If we do not drive out sin, sin will drive us out. If we are not the death of our lusts, our lusts will be the death of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The expulsion of the Canaanites and the destruction of their monuments of idolatry had been already enjoined (see the marginal references); and <a href="/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a> is substantially a repetition from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-53.htm">Exodus 26:53-55</a>.

But while the whole earth was the Lord's, it is clear that he assumed a special relation towards the land of Canaan, as to which he chose to exercise directly the rights and duties of landlord (see on Deuteronomy 22:8 for a small but striking instance). The first duty of a landlord is to see that the occupancy of his property is not abused for illegal or immoral ends; and this duty excuses, because it necessitates, eviction under certain circumstances. It is not, therefore, necessary to argue that the Canaanites were more infamous than many others; it is enough to remember that God had assumed towards the land which they occupied (apparently by conquest) a relation which did not allow him to overlook their enormities, as he might those of other nations (see on Exodus 23:23-33; 34:11-17, and cf. <a href="/acts/14-16.htm">Acts 14:16</a>; <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>). It was (if we like to put it so) the misfortune of the Canaanites that they alone of "all nations" could not be suffered to "walk in their own ways," because they had settled in a land which the Lord had chosen to administer directly as his own earthly kingdom. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The places of encampment on the journey of the fortieth year from Kadesh to Mount Hor, and round Edom and Moab into the steppes of Moab, have been discussed at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a> and 21.
