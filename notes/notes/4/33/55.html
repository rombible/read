They would foster vipers in their own bosoms. The remnant of the Canaanites, if they made any peace with them, though but for a time, would be pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their sides. We must expect trouble and affliction from whatever sin we indulge; that which we are willing should tempt us, will vex us. It was intended that the Canaanites should be put out of the land; but if the Israelites learned their wicked ways, they also would be put out. Let us hear this and fear. If we do not drive out sin, sin will drive us out. If we are not the death of our lusts, our lusts will be the death of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The expulsion of the Canaanites and the destruction of their monuments of idolatry had been already enjoined (see the marginal references); and <a href="/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a> is substantially a repetition from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-53.htm">Exodus 26:53-55</a>.

But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you&#8212;No associations were to be formed with the inhabitants; otherwise, "if ye let remain, they will be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides"&#8212;that is, they would prove troublesome and dangerous neighbors, enticing to idolatry, and consequently depriving you of the divine favor and blessing. The neglect of the counsel against union with the idolatrous inhabitants became fatal to them. This earnest admonition given to the Israelites in their peculiar circumstances conveys a salutary lesson to us to allow no lurking habits of sin to remain in us. That spiritual enemy must be eradicated from our nature; otherwise it will be ruinous to our present peace and future salvation.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Pricks in your eyes, </span> i.e. both vexatious and pernicious, for the eye is a tender part, and a wound there is very mischievous. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you,....
