In regard to the number of stations, the diversity may probably be explained on the supposition that Numbers 21 mentions those stations only which were of historical importance—as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>those from which any military expedition was made—whilst Numbers 33 appears to mention every place in which an organised camp was erected, and in which the Tent of Meeting was formally set up. If this supposition be correct, no difficulty is involved in the fact that fewer stations are named between Mount Hor and Ije-abarim in Numbers 21 than in Numbers 33, whilst more stations are. named between Ije-abarim and Arboth-Moab in Numbers 33 than in Numbers 21. There is a further diversity, however, in the two accounts as regards the names of the intermediate stations between Ije-abarim and the plains of Moab. In respect of the stations between Mount Hor and Ije-abarim, if we suppose Zalmonah to have been the station at which the brazen serpent was set up (see <a href="/numbers/21-10.htm" title="And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.">Numbers 21:10</a>, and Note), the difference between the two accounts consists only in the insertion in Numbers 33 of the station at Punon, between Zalmonah and Oboth. In respect of the stations, however, between Ije-abarim and Arboth-Moab there is not only a difference in the number, but also in the names of the stations. But this difference is easily accounted for when it is remembered that a host consisting of 600,000 men, with their wives, children, and cattle, must have extended over a large area, and, in the case of an inhabited country in which towns and villages abounded, may have occupied more than one of these at the same time. (Comp. <a href="/numbers/33-49.htm" title="And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even to Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.">Numbers 33:49</a>, where the Israelites are represented as encamping “from Beth-jesimoth even unto Abel-shittim.”) Hence there is no difficulty in connecting the formal encampment at Dibon of Gad (<a href="/numbers/33-45.htm" title="And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.">Numbers 33:45</a>) with some one or more of the stations on the north of the Arnon mentioned in <a href="/context/numbers/23-13.htm" title="And Balak said to him, Come, I pray you, with me to another place, from from where you may see them: you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there.">Numbers 23:13-19</a>, or in connecting Almon-diblathaim, which appears to have been situated on the north or north-west of Dibon (Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/48-22.htm" title="And on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Bethdiblathaim,">Jeremiah 48:22</a>, where Beth-diblathaim is mentioned in conjunction with Dibon and Nebo) with Bamoth—<span class= "ital">i.e., heights</span>—which, if identical with Bamoth-Baal (<a href="/numbers/22-4.htm" title="And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.">Numbers 22:4</a>), is mentioned by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/13-17.htm" title="Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,">Joshua 13:17</a>) in immediate connection with Dibon. In regard to the last station named in this chapter before the encampment in the plains of Moab—viz., “the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo”—there can be no doubt as to the identity of the station with that in “the valley in the country (or, field) of Moab, at the top of Pisgah,” in <a href="/numbers/21-20.htm" title="And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward Jeshimon.">Numbers 21:20</a>. According to <a href="/deuteronomy/34-1.htm" title="And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>, Mount Nebo was a peak of Pisgah, which, as we learn from <a href="/deuteronomy/32-49.htm" title="Get you up into this mountain Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession:">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>, was one of the mountains of Abarim; and the place of the burial of Moses, who died upon the top of Pisgah, is described as “the valley”—i.e., the well-known valley—“in the land of Moab” (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-6.htm" title="And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knows of his sepulcher to this day.">Deuteronomy 34:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In Dibon-gad.—</span>Or, <span class= "ital">Dibon of Gad. </span>The reference is probably to the fact which has already been mentioned in <a href="/numbers/32-34.htm" title="And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,">Numbers 32:34</a>, that the children of Gad rebuilt or fortified Dibon, which stood on the northern side of the river Arnon, and which is one of the towns named in <a href="/numbers/32-3.htm" title="Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,">Numbers 32:3</a> as situated in that portion of the country which the Reubenites and the Gadites desired to possess.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/numbers/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:1-49 This is a brief review of the travels of the children of Israel through the wilderness. It is a memorable history. In their travels towards Canaan they were continually on the remove. Such is our state in this world; we have here no continuing city, and all our removes in this world are but from one part a desert to another. They were led to and fro, forward and backward, yet were all the while under the direction of the pillar of cloud and fire. God led them about, yet led them the right way. The way God takes in bringing his people to himself is always the best way, though it does not always seem to us the nearest way. Former events are mentioned. Thus we ought to keep in mind the providences of God concerning us and families, us and our land, and the many instances of that Divine care which has led us, and fed us, and kept us all our days hitherto. Few periods of our lives can be thought upon, without reminding us of the Lord's goodness, and our own ingratitude and disobedience: his kindness leaves us without excuse for our sins. We could not wish to travel over again the stages we have passed, unless we could hope, by the grace of God, to shun the sins we then committed, and to embrace such opportunities of doing good as we have let slip. Soon will our wanderings end, and our eternal state be fixed beyond recall; how important then is the present moment! Happy are those whom the Lord now guides with his counsel, and will at length receive to his glory. To this happiness the gospel calls us. Behold now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation. Let sinners seize the opportunity, and flee for refuge to the hope set before them. Let us redeem our time, to glorify God and serve our generation; and he will carry us safely through all, to his eternal kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Zalmonah and Punon are stations on the Pilgrim's road; and the general route is fairly ascertained by a comparison of these verses with <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>, etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.
