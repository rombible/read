It is a memorable history. In their travels towards Canaan they were continually on the remove. Such is our state in this world; we have here no continuing city, and all our removes in this world are but from one part a desert to another. They were led to and fro, forward and backward, yet were all the while under the direction of the pillar of cloud and fire. God led them about, yet led them the right way. The way God takes in bringing his people to himself is always the best way, though it does not always seem to us the nearest way. Former events are mentioned. Thus we ought to keep in mind the providences of God concerning us and families, us and our land, and the many instances of that Divine care which has led us, and fed us, and kept us all our days hitherto. Few periods of our lives can be thought upon, without reminding us of the Lord's goodness, and our own ingratitude and disobedience: his kindness leaves us without excuse for our sins. We could not wish to travel over again the stages we have passed, unless we could hope, by the grace of God, to shun the sins we then committed, and to embrace such opportunities of doing good as we have let slip. Soon will our wanderings end, and our eternal state be fixed beyond recall; how important then is the present moment! Happy are those whom the Lord now guides with his counsel, and will at length receive to his glory. To this happiness the gospel calls us. Behold now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation. Let sinners seize the opportunity, and flee for refuge to the hope set before them. Let us redeem our time, to glorify God and serve our generation; and he will carry us safely through all, to his eternal kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This list was written out by Moses at God's command <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-2.htm">Numbers 33:2</a>, doubtless as a memorial of God's providential care for His people throughout this long and trying period.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-3.htm">Numbers 33:3-6</a>.

Two and Forty Journeys of the Israelites&#8212;from Egypt to Sinai.<p>1. These are the journeys of the children of Israel&#8212;This chapter may be said to form the winding up of the history of the travels of the Israelites through the wilderness; for the three following chapters relate to matters connected with the occupation and division of the promised land. As several apparent discrepancies will be discovered on comparing the records here given of the journeyings from Sinai with the detailed accounts of the events narrated in the Book of Exodus and the occasional notices of places that are found in that of Deuteronomy, it is probable that this itinerary comprises a list of only the most important stations in their journeys&#8212;those where they formed prolonged encampments, and whence they dispersed their flocks and herds to pasture on the adjacent plains till the surrounding herbage was exhausted. The catalogue extends from their departure out of Egypt to their arrival on the plains of Moab.<p>went forth &#8230; with their armies&#8212;that is, a vast multitude marshalled in separate companies, but regular order.A relation of the marches and campings of the Israelites from Egypt to Canaan, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/numbers/33-1.htm" title="These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron....">Numbers 33:1-49</a></span>.

It stood almost in the centre between the Arnon and Jabbok, opposite to Jericho, and, according to the Onomast., twenty Roman miles from the Jordan, where the ruins of a large town of about a mile in circumference are still to be seen, with deep bricked wells, and a large reservoir, bearing the ancient name of Hesban or H&#1516;sban (Seetzen; Burckhardt, p. 623; Robinson, Pal. ii. 278; cf. v. Raumer, Pal. p. 262; and Ritter's Erdkunde, xv. p. 1176). - Elealeh: half-an-hour's journey to the north-east of Heshbon, now called el Aal, i.e., the height, upon the top of a hill, from which you can see the whole of southern Belka; it is now in ruins with many cisterns, pieces of wall, and foundations of houses (Burckhardt, p. 523). - Kirjathaim, probably to the south-west of Medeba, where the ruins of el Teym are not to be found (see at <a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>). Nebo, on Mount Nebo (see at <a href="/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12</a>). The Onomast. places the town eight Roman miles to the south of Heshbon, whilst the mountain is six Roman miles to the west of that town. Baal-Meon, called Beon in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a>, Beth-Meon in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-23.htm">Jeremiah 48:23</a>, and more fully Beth-Baal-Meon in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>, is probably to be found, not in the ruins of Maein discovered by Seetzen and Legh, an hour's journey to the south-west of Tueme (Teim), and the same distance to the north of Habbis, on the north-east of Jebel Attarus, and nine Roman miles to the south of Heshbon, as most of the modern commentators from Rosenm&#1516;ller to Knobel suppose; but in the ruins of Myun, mentioned by Burckhardt (p. 624), three-quarters of an hour to the south-east of Heshbon, where we find it marked upon Kiepert's and Van de Velde's maps.<p>(Note: Although Baal-Meon is unquestionably identified with Maein in the Onom. (see v. Raumer, Pal. p. 259), <a href="/1_chronicles/5-8.htm">1 Chronicles 5:8</a> is decidedly at variance with this. It is stated there that "Bela dwelt in Aroer, and even unto Nebo and Baal-Meon," a statement which places Baal-Meon in the neighbourhood of Nebo, like the passage before us, and is irreconcilable with the supposition that it was identical with Maein in the neighbourhood of Attarus. In the case of Seetzen, however, the identification of Maein with Baal-Meon is connected with the supposition, which is now generally regarded as erroneous, namely, that Nebo is the same as the Jebel Attarus. (See, on the other hand, Hengstenberg, Balaam; and Ritter's Erdkunde, xv. pp. 1187ff.))<p>Shibmah (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a>, Shebam), which was only 500 paces from Heshbon, according to Jerome (on <a href="/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>), has apparently disappeared, without leaving a trace behind.<p>(Note: The difference in the forms Shibmah, Baal-Meon (<a href="/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>), and Beth-Nimrah (<a href="/numbers/32-36.htm">Numbers 32:36</a>), instead of Shebam, Beon, and Nimrah (<a href="/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a>), is rendered useless as a proof that <a href="/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a> is Jehovistic, and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-36.htm">Numbers 32:36-38</a> Elohistic, from the simple fact that Baal-Meon itself is a contraction of Beth-Baal-Meon (<a href="/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>). If the Elohist could write this name fully in one place and abbreviated in another, he could just as well contract it still further, and by exchanging the labials call it Beon; and so also he could no doubt omit the Beth in the case of Nimrah, and use the masculine form Shebam in the place of Shibmah. The contraction of the names in <a href="/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a> is especially connected with the fact, that diplomatic exactness was not required for an historical account, but that the abbreviated forms in common use were quite sufficient.)<p>Thus all the places built by the Reubenites were but a short distance from Heshbon, and surrounded this capita; whereas those built by the Gadites were some of them to the south of it, on the Arnon, and others to the north, towards Rabbath-Ammon. It is perfectly obvious from this, that the restoration of these towns took place before the distribution of the land among these tribes, without any regard to their possession afterwards. In the distribution, therefore, the southernmost of the towns built by the Gadites, viz., Aroer, Dibon, and Ataroth, fell to the tribe of Reuben; and Heshbon, which was built by the Reubenites, fell to the tribe of Gad. The words &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, "changed of name," are governed by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;: "they built the towns with an alteration of their names," mutatis nominibus (for &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;, in the sense of changing, see <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>). There is not sufficient ground for altering the text, &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (Knobel), according to the &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; of the lxx, or the &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; of Symmachus. The Masoretic text is to be found not only in the Chaldee, the Syriac, the Vulgate, and the Saadic versions, but also in the Samaritan. The expression itself, too, cannot be justly described as "awkward," nor is it a valid objection that the naming is mentioned afterwards; for altering the name of a town and giving it a new name are not tautological. The insertion of the words, "their names being changed," before Shibmah, is an indication that the latter place did not receive any other name. Moreover, the new names which the builders gave to these towns did not continue in use long, but were soon pressed out by the old ones again. "And they called by names the names of the towns:" this is a roundabout way of saying, they called the towns by (other, or new) names: cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/6-50.htm">1 Chronicles 6:50</a>. </body></html>
