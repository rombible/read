It was a token of God's gracious presence. Yet they were to pitch their tents afar off, in reverence to the sanctuary. The children of Israel put themselves in their posts, without murmuring or disputing; and as it was their safety, so it was their beauty. It is our duty and interest to be contented with the place allotted to us, and to endeavour to occupy it in a proper manner, without envying or murmuring; without ambition or covetousness. Thus the gospel church ought to be compact, according to the Scripture model, every one knowing and keeping his place; and then all that wish well to the church rejoice, beholding their order, Col 2:5.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The following plan shows the general arrangement of the camp, which would vary in different places according to local exigencies.
