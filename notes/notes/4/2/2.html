Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun were the three youngest sons of Leah, and Issachar and Zebulun would not grudge to be under Judah, their elder brother.

It was a token of God's gracious presence. Yet they were to pitch their tents afar off, in reverence to the sanctuary. The children of Israel put themselves in their posts, without murmuring or disputing; and as it was their safety, so it was their beauty. It is our duty and interest to be contented with the place allotted to us, and to endeavour to occupy it in a proper manner, without envying or murmuring; without ambition or covetousness. Thus the gospel church ought to be compact, according to the Scripture model, every one knowing and keeping his place; and then all that wish well to the church rejoice, beholding their order, Col 2:5.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/numbers/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>standard ... ensign - The "standard" marked the division, or camp (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1-9.htm">Numbers 1:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1-16.htm">Numbers 1:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1-24.htm">Numbers 1:24</a>, <a href="/numbers/1-31.htm">Numbers 1:31</a>); the "ensign" the family. There would thus be four "standards" only, one for each "camp" of three tribes. The "standard" was probably a solid figure or emblem mounted on a pole, such as the Egyptians used. Tradition appropriates the four cherubic forms (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5-12</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a> ff), the lion, man, ox, and eagle, to the camps of Judah, Reuben, Ephraim, and Dan respectively; and this, as to the first, has a certain support from <a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a> (compare <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>), and as to the third, from <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>.<p>Far off - See the margin, over against; i. e. facing the tabernacle on every side.

Every man &#8230; shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house&#8212;Standards were visible signs of a certain recognized form for directing the movements of large bodies of people. As the Israelites were commanded to encamp "each by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house," the direction has been considered as implying that they possessed three varieties: (1) the great tribal standards, which served as rallying points for the twelve large clans of the people; (2) the standards of the subdivided portions; and, (3) those of families or houses. The latter must have been absolutely necessary, as one ensign only for a tribe would not have been visible at the extremities of so large a body. We possess no authentic information as to their forms, material, colors, and devices. But it is probable that they might bear some resemblance to those of Egypt, only stripped of any idolatrous symbols. These were of an umbrella or a fanlike form, made of ostrich feathers, shawls, &c., lifted on the points of long poles, which were borne, either like the sacred central one, on a car, or on men's shoulders, while others might be like the beacon lights which are set on poles by Eastern pilgrims at night. Jewish writers say that the standards of the Hebrew tribes were symbols borrowed from the prophetic blessing of Jacob&#8212;Judah's being a lion, Benjamin's a wolf, &c. [Ge 49:3-24]; and that the ensigns or banners were distinguished by their colors&#8212;the colors of each tribe being the same as that of the precious stone representing that tribe in the breastplate of the high priest [Ex 28:17-21].<p>far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch&#8212;that is, "over against," at a reverential distance. The place of every tribe is successively and specifically described because each had a certain part assigned both in the order of march and the disposition of the encampment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By his own standard, </span> or <span class="ital">ensign</span>, by that to which he is allotted by the following order.
