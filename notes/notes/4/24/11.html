Thus the metaphor would import that Israel should have his own exuberant and unfailing channels of blessing and plenty. Some take the word to be predictive of the future benefits which, through the means of Israel, were to accrue to the rest of the world.<p>Agag - The name, apparently hereditary (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>) to the chieftains of Amalek, means "high." The words point to the Amalekite kingdom as highly prosperous and powerful at the time (compare <a href="/numbers/24-20.htm">Numbers 24:20</a>); but also to be far excelled by the future glories of Israel. The Amalekites never in fact recovered their crushing defeat by Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2</a> ff), though they appear again as foes to Israel in the reign of David (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1-12</a> and 30).

Like valleys are they spread out, like gardens by the stream, like aloes which Jehovah has planted, like cedars by the waters. Water will flow out of his buckets, and his seed is by many waters. And loftier than Agag be his king, and his kingdom will be exalted." What Balaam had seen before his ecstasy with his bodily eyes, formed the substratum for his inward vision, in which the dwellings of Israel came before his mental eye adorned with the richest blessing from the Lord. The description starts, it is true, from the time then present, but it embraces the whole future of Israel. In the blessed land of Canaan the dwellings of Israel will spread out like valleys. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean brooks here, but valleys watered by brooks. &#1504;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, to extend oneself, to stretch or spread out far and wide. Yea, "like gardens by the stream," which are still more lovely than the grassy and flowery valleys with brooks. This thought is carried out still further in the two following figures. &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; are aloe-trees, which grow in the East Indies, in Siam, in Cochin China, and upon the Moluccas, and from which the aloe-wood was obtained, that was so highly valued in the preparation of incense, on account of its fragrance. As the aloes were valued for their fragrant smell, so the cedars were valued on account of their lofty and luxuriant growth, and the durability of their wood. The predicate, "which Jehovah hath planted," corresponds, so far as the actual meaning is concerned, to &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, "by water;" for this was "an expression used to designate trees that, on account of their peculiar excellence, were superior to ordinary trees" (Calvin; cf. <a href="/psalms/104-16.htm">Psalm 104:16</a>). </body></html>
