That knowledge which puffs men up with pride, will but serve to light them to hell, whither many go with their eyes open. The blessing is nearly the same as those given before. He admires in Israel, their beauty. The righteous, doubtless, is more excellent than his neighbour. Their fruitfulness and increase. Their honour and advancement. Their power and victory. He looks back upon what had been done for them. Their power and victory. He looks back upon what had been done for them. Their courage and security. The righteous are bold as a lion, not when assaulting others, but when at rest, because God maketh them to dwell in safety. Their influence upon their neighbours.

Thus the metaphor would import that Israel should have his own exuberant and unfailing channels of blessing and plenty.

And it is probably thought by the Jewish and other interpreters, that the Amalekitish kings, as Abimelech was of the Philistines, and Pharaoh of the Egyptians, and Caesar of the Romans. But though this king only be instanced in, yet other kings, to wit, such as did or should border upon the Israelites, are doubtless to be understood, above whom the kings and people of Israel sometimes were advanced, and oftener should have been, if they had not been their own hinderance by their sins.

The first two lines are difficult and perhaps corrupt. Some explain them as a description of the luxuriance of Israel’s future home. Israel is pictured as a man carrying buckets to water his crop; and his seed, i.e. his corn, will be grown in well-watered ground. Cf. <a href="/psalms/65-9.htm" title="You visit the earth, and water it: you greatly enrich it with the river of God, which is full of water: you prepare them corn, when you have so provided for it.">Psalm 65:9</a> f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And</span> <span class="bld">may</span> <span class="ital">his king</span> <span class="bld">be</span> <span class="ital">higher than Agag</span>] <span class="ital"><a href="/numbers/24-20.htm" title="And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.">Numbers 24:20</a></span> seems to shew that in Heb. tradition the Amalekites were once a mighty nation of the first rank, though there is no historical evidence that they ever were so. Agag their king would thus be a symbol of might. If Agag is the man who was captured by Saul, the present poem must be at least as late as the monarchy. Some indeed have supposed, from the present passage, that Agag was a title applied to all Amalekite kings, like the title Pharaoh in Egypt. But the text may be corrupt. LXX. and Samar. read ‘Gog,’ which is found only in Ezekiel 38 f., as a name belonging to the region north of Assyria. Cheyne suggests Og. The passage is at present an unsolved problem.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall pour the water,</span> or, "the water shall overflow." <span class="cmt_word">Out of his buckets.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> is the dual, "his two buckets." The image, familiar enough to one who lived in an irrigated land, is of one carrying two buckets on the ends of a pole which are so full as to run over as he goes. <span class="cmt_word">And his seed... in many waters.</span> It is uncertain in what sense the word "seed" issued. It may be an image as simple as the last, of seed sown either by or actually upon many waters (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:1</a>), and so securing a plentiful and safe return; or it may stand for the seed, i.e., the posterity, of Israel, which should grow up amidst many blessings (<a href="/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a>). The former seems most in keeping here. His king shall be higher than Agag. Rather, "let his king be higher than Agag." The name Agag (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span>, the fiery one) does not occur again except as the name of the king of Amalek whom Saul conquered and Samuel slew (<a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.); yet it may safely be assumed that it was the official title of all the kings of Amalek, resembling in this "Abimelech" and "Pharaoh." Here it seems to stand for the dynasty and the nation of the Amalekites, and there is no reason to suppose that any reference was intended to any particular individual or event in the distant future. The "king" of Israel here spoken of is certainly not Saul or any other of the kings, but God himself in his character as temporal Ruler of Israel; and the "kingdom" is the kingdom of heaven as set forth by way of anticipation in the polity and order of the chosen race. As a fact, Israel had afterwards a visible king who overthrew Agag, but their having such a king was alien to the mind of God, and due to a distinct falling away from national faith, and therefore could find no place in this prophecy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The third saying. - <a href="/numbers/24-1.htm">Numbers 24:1</a> and <a href="/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a>. From the two revelations which he had received before, Balaam, saw, i.e., perceived, that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel. This induced him not to go out for auguries, as on the previous occasions. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1506;&#1501;, "as time after time," i.e., as at former times (<a href="/numbers/23-3.htm">Numbers 23:3</a> and <a href="/numbers/23-15.htm">Numbers 23:15</a>). He therefore turned his face to the desert, i.e., to the steppes of Moab, where Israel was encamped (<a href="/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a>). And when he lifted up his eyes, "he saw Israel encamping according to its tribes; and the Spirit of God came over him." The impression made upon him by the sight of the tribes of Israel, served as the subjective preparation for the reception of the Spirit of God to inspire him. Of both the earlier utterances it is stated that "Jehovah put a word into his mouth" (<a href="/numbers/23-5.htm">Numbers 23:5</a> and <a href="/numbers/23-16.htm">Numbers 23:16</a>); but of this third it is affirmed that "the Spirit of God came over him." The former were communicated to him, when he went out for a divine revelation, without his being thrown into an ecstatic state; he heard the voice of God within him telling him what he was to say. But this time, like the prophets in their prophesyings, he was placed by the Spirit of God in a state of ecstatic sight; so that, with his eyes closed as in clairvoyance, he saw the substance of the revelation from God with his inward mental eye, which had been opened by the Spirit of God. Thus not only does he himself describe his own condition in <a href="/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4</a>, but his description is in harmony with the announcement itself, which is manifestly the result both in form and substance of the intuition effected within him by the Spirit of God. </body></html>
