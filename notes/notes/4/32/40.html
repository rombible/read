They changed the names of them; probably they were idolatrous, therefore they should be forgotten. A spirit of selfishness, of seeking our own, not the things of Christ, when each one ought to assist others, is as dangerous as it is common. It is impossible to be sincere in the faith, sensible of the goodness of God, constrained by the love of Christ, sanctified by the power of the Holy Ghost, and yet be indifferent to the progress of religion, and the spiritual success of others, through love of ease, or fear of conflict.

Dibon, also called Dibon Gad, an hour's journey to the north of the central Arnon. Ataroth, probably preserved in the extensive ruins of Attarus, on Jebel Attarus, between el Krriath (Kureyat) and Makur, i.e., Machaerus (see Seetzen, ii. p. 342). Aroer, not the Aroer before Rabbah, which was allotted to the Gadites (<a href="/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), as v. Raumer supposes; but the Aroer of Reuben in the centre of the valley of the Arnon (<a href="/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>, <a href="/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a>), which is still to be seen in the ruins of Araayr, on the edge of the lofty rocky wall which bounds the Modjeb (Burckhardt, p. 633). Atroth Shophan: only mentioned here; situation unknown. Jaezer: probably to be sought for in the ruins of es Szir, to the west of Ammn (see at <a href="/numbers/21-32.htm">Numbers 21:32</a>). Jogbehah: only mentioned again in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/8-11.htm">Judges 8:11</a>, and preserved in the ruins of Jebeiha, about two hours to the north-west of Ammn (Burckhardt, p. 618; Robinson, App. p. 168). Beth-nimrah, contracted into Nimrah (<a href="/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a>), according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a>, in the valley of the Jordan, and according to the Onomast.

Beth-Haran, or Beth-Haram (<a href="/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a>): Beth-ramphtha, according to Josephus, Ant. 18:2, 1, which was called Julias, in honour of the wife of Augustus. According to the Onomast. it was called Beth-Ramtha by the Syrians (&#1512;&#1502;&#1514;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, the form of the Aramaean stat. emphat.), and was named Livias by Herod Antipas, in honour of Livia, the wife of Augustus.
