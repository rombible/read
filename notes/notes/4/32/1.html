This district, although included in the land of Gilead, seems to have had special attractions for the Israelite settlers. All travelers in Gilead, the modern Belka, bear witness to its richness as compared with the country to the west of the Jordan. Its general character is that of an upland pasture, undulating and thickly timbered. In the last respect its northern portions excel its southern; but for fertility of soil the southern province is preferred by the Arabs, in whose lips it has passed into a proverb: "Thou canst not find a country like the Belka." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/numbers/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 32<p>Nu 32:1-42. The Reubenites and Gadites Ask for an Inheritance.<p>1-5. the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead&#8212;A complete conquest had been made of the country east of the Jordan, comprising "the land of Jazer," which formed the southern district between the Arnon and Jabbok and "the land of Gilead," the middle region between the Jabbok and Jarmouk, or Hieromax, including Bashan, which lay on the north of that river. The whole of this region is now called the Belka. It has always been famous for its rich and extensive pastures, and it is still the favorite resort of the Bedouin shepherds, who frequently contend for securing to their immense flocks the benefit of its luxuriant vegetation. In the camp of ancient Israel, Reuben and Gad were pre-eminently pastoral; and as these two tribes, being placed under the same standard, had frequent opportunities of conversing and arranging about their common concerns, they united in preferring a request that the trans-jordanic region, so well suited to the habits of a pastoral people, might be assigned to them.The Reubenites and Gadites sue for their inheritance on that side Jordan, as being fit for cattle, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/numbers/32-1.htm" title="Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;...">Numbers 32:1-5</a></span>.

Once more, these two tracts are sometimes treated as the two halves of Gilead (cf. <a href="/joshua/12-2.htm" title="Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelled in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;">Joshua 12:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-5.htm" title="And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.">Joshua 12:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-31.htm" title="And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining to the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.">Joshua 13:31</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm" title="And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.">Deuteronomy 3:12</a> f.), so that the name could be used in the widest sense of all the land occupied by Israel on the east of the Jordan (cf. <a href="/joshua/22-9.htm" title="And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.">Joshua 22:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/22-13.htm" title="And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,">Joshua 22:13</a>). Its borders on the north, east and south would vary from time to time, according as the neighbouring nations were weak or powerful; for example, at least ten of the fourteen towns in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/numbers/32-34.htm" title="And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,...">Numbers 32:34-38</a></span> were at times in possession not of Israel but of Moab. The northern half of Gilead, in the wide sense, is an agricultural territory, its hills covered with forests, and its valleys and plains with orchards, vineyards and cornfields. But the southern half consists of moorland, useless for agriculture but affording rich pasture for flocks. See G. A. Smith, <span class="ital">Hist. Geog.</span> ch. xxvii.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Reuben and the children of Gad.</span> Reuben and Gad had both been camped on the same (southern) side of the tabernacle, but had not apparently been neighbours, since Simeon intervened on the march (see on Numbers 2:10-14). Simeon, however, was at this time enfeebled and disgraced, and was not likely to assert himself in any way. The "great multitude of cattle" belonging to the two tribes probably point to pastoral habits of long standing, since the cattle of the Amorites and Midianites would be equally divided among all. <span class="cmt_word">The land of Jazer.</span> Jazer, or Jaazer, probably stood near the northern source of the Wady Hesban, which enters the Jordan not far from its mouth. The "land of Jazer" would seem to mean the Mishor, or plateau, of Heshbon, over which the Israelites had passed on their way to the plains of Moab (see on Deuteronomy 3:10, "all the cities of the Mishor"). <span class="cmt_word">The land of Gilead.</span> Gilead as the name of a district only previously occurs in <a href="/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>. It is used with a considerable latitude of meaning in this and the following books. In its widest sense it stands for the whole territory to the east of Jordan (see on verses 26, 29), including even the rugged, volcanic districts of Bashan (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a>); but more properly it denoted the  lands on both sides the Jabbok, from the Wady Hesban on the south, to the Yermuk and lake of Tiberias on the north, now known as the provinces of Belka and Jebel Ajlun. These lands are by no means uniformly flat, as the name "Mount Gilead" testifies, but include mountains and hills covered with fine open forests of oak (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/18-8.htm">2 Samuel 18:8, 9</a>) as well as rolling downs and treeless plains. The soil is almost everywhere of great fertility, and the water supply, although very scanty in summer, is sufficient if carefully husbanded. Even now these provinces produce great store of grain, and are depastured by vast flocks of sheep. In Roman times, as the innumerable ruins testify, they were filled with a large and opulent population. Indeed there could be no comparison in point of agricultural and pastoral value between these open and fertile lands and the broken, stony country of Southern Palestine. If they ever enjoy again the blessing of a strong government and continuous peace they will again justify the choice of Reuben and Gad. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">place for cattle.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is used here in the broader sense of district (cf. <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>), and is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e6;</span> in verse 4. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Sacred Oblations of the Officers. - When the officers reviewed the men of war who were "in their hand," i.e., who had fought the battle under their command, and found not a single man missing, they felt constrained to give a practical expression to their gratitude for this miraculous preservation of the whole of the men, by presenting a sacrificial gift to Jehovah; they therefore brought all the golden articles that they had received as booty, and offered them to the Lord "for the expiation of their souls" (see at <a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>), namely, with the feeling that they were not worthy of any such grace, and not "because they had done wrong in failing to destroy all the enemies of Jehovah" (Knobel). This gift, which was offered as a heave-offering for Jehovah, consisted of the following articles of gold: &#1488;&#1510;&#1506;&#1491;&#1492;, "arm-rings," according to <a href="/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a> (lxx &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;; Suidas: &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;); &#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, bands, generally armlets (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>, etc.); &#1496;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, signet-rings; &#1506;&#1490;&#1497;&#1500;, hoops, - according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-12.htm">Ezekiel 16:12</a>, ear-rings; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1494;, gold balls (<a href="/exodus/35-22.htm">Exodus 35:22</a>). They amounted in all to 16,750 shekels; and the men of war had received their own booty in addition to this. This gift, presented on the part of the officers, was brought into the tabernacle "as a memorial of the children of Israel before Jehovah" (cf. <a href="/exodus/30-16.htm">Exodus 30:16</a>); that is to say, it was placed in the treasury of the sanctuary.<p>The fact that the Israelites did not lose a single man in the battle, is certainly a striking proof of the protection of God; but it is not so marvellous as to furnish any good ground for calling in question the correctness of the narrative.<p>(Note: Rosenmller has cited an example from Tacitus (Ann. xiii. 39), of the Romans having slaughtered all the foe without losing a single man on the capture of a Parthian castle; and another from Strabo (xvi. 1128), of a battle in which 1000 Arabs were slain, and only 2 Romans. And Hvernick mentions a similar account from the life of Saladin in his Introduction (i. 2, p. 452).)<p>The Midianites were a nomad tribe, who lived by rearing flocks and herds, and therefore were not a warlike people. Moreover, they were probably attacked quite unawares, and being unprepared, were completely routed and cut down without quarter. The quantity of booty brought home is also not so great as to appear incredible. Judging from the 32,000 females who had never lain with a man, the tribes governed by the five kings may have numbered about 130,000 or 150,000, and therefore not have contained much more than 35,000 fighting men, who might easily have been surprised by 12,000 brave warriors, and entirely destroyed. And again, there is nothing in the statement that 675,000 sheep and goats, 72,000 oxen, and 61,000 asses were taken as booty from these tribes, to astonish any one who has formed correct notions of the wealth of nomad tribes in flocks and herds. The only thing that could appear surprising is, that there are no camels mentioned.<p>But it is questionable, in the first place, whether the Midianites were in the habit of rearing camels; and, in the second place, if they did possess them, it is still questionable whether the Israelitish army took them away, and did not rather put to death all that they found, as being of no value to the Israelites in their existing circumstances. Lastly, the quantity of jewellery seized as booty is quite in harmony with the well-known love of nomads, and even of barbarous tribes, for ornaments of this kind; and the peculiar liking of the Midianites for such things is confirmed by the account in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, according to which Gideon took as much as 1700 shekels in weight of golden rings from the Midianites alone, beside ornaments of other kinds. If we take the golden shekel at 10 thalers (30 shillings), the value of the ornaments taken by the officers under Moses would be about 167,500 thalers (L.25,125). It is quite possible that the kings and other chiefs, together with their wives, may have possessed as much as this. </body></html>
