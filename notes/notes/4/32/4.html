The Reubenites and Gadites Ask for an Inheritance.<p>1-5. the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead&#8212;A complete conquest had been made of the country east of the Jordan, comprising "the land of Jazer," which formed the southern district between the Arnon and Jabbok and "the land of Gilead," the middle region between the Jabbok and Jarmouk, or Hieromax, including Bashan, which lay on the north of that river. The whole of this region is now called the Belka. It has always been famous for its rich and extensive pastures, and it is still the favorite resort of the Bedouin shepherds, who frequently contend for securing to their immense flocks the benefit of its luxuriant vegetation. In the camp of ancient Israel, Reuben and Gad were pre-eminently pastoral; and as these two tribes, being placed under the same standard, had frequent opportunities of conversing and arranging about their common concerns, they united in preferring a request that the trans-jordanic region, so well suited to the habits of a pastoral people, might be assigned to them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/numbers/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which the Lord smote before the congregation, </span> and gave to them for a possession, in the same manner as he will give the land of Canaan. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/numbers/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Even the county which the Lord smote before the congregation of Israel,....

This gift, which was offered as a heave-offering for Jehovah, consisted of the following articles of gold: &#1488;&#1510;&#1506;&#1491;&#1492;, "arm-rings," according to <a href="/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a> (lxx &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;; Suidas: &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;); &#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, bands, generally armlets (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>, etc.); &#1496;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, signet-rings; &#1506;&#1490;&#1497;&#1500;, hoops, - according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-12.htm">Ezekiel 16:12</a>, ear-rings; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1494;, gold balls (<a href="/exodus/35-22.htm">Exodus 35:22</a>). They amounted in all to 16,750 shekels; and the men of war had received their own booty in addition to this. This gift, presented on the part of the officers, was brought into the tabernacle "as a memorial of the children of Israel before Jehovah" (cf. <a href="/exodus/30-16.htm">Exodus 30:16</a>); that is to say, it was placed in the treasury of the sanctuary.<p>The fact that the Israelites did not lose a single man in the battle, is certainly a striking proof of the protection of God; but it is not so marvellous as to furnish any good ground for calling in question the correctness of the narrative.<p>(Note: Rosenmller has cited an example from Tacitus (Ann. xiii. 39), of the Romans having slaughtered all the foe without losing a single man on the capture of a Parthian castle; and another from Strabo (xvi. 1128), of a battle in which 1000 Arabs were slain, and only 2 Romans. And Hvernick mentions a similar account from the life of Saladin in his Introduction (i. 2, p. 452).)<p>The Midianites were a nomad tribe, who lived by rearing flocks and herds, and therefore were not a warlike people. Moreover, they were probably attacked quite unawares, and being unprepared, were completely routed and cut down without quarter. The quantity of booty brought home is also not so great as to appear incredible. Judging from the 32,000 females who had never lain with a man, the tribes governed by the five kings may have numbered about 130,000 or 150,000, and therefore not have contained much more than 35,000 fighting men, who might easily have been surprised by 12,000 brave warriors, and entirely destroyed. And again, there is nothing in the statement that 675,000 sheep and goats, 72,000 oxen, and 61,000 asses were taken as booty from these tribes, to astonish any one who has formed correct notions of the wealth of nomad tribes in flocks and herds. The only thing that could appear surprising is, that there are no camels mentioned.<p>But it is questionable, in the first place, whether the Midianites were in the habit of rearing camels; and, in the second place, if they did possess them, it is still questionable whether the Israelitish army took them away, and did not rather put to death all that they found, as being of no value to the Israelites in their existing circumstances. Lastly, the quantity of jewellery seized as booty is quite in harmony with the well-known love of nomads, and even of barbarous tribes, for ornaments of this kind; and the peculiar liking of the Midianites for such things is confirmed by the account in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, according to which Gideon took as much as 1700 shekels in weight of golden rings from the Midianites alone, beside ornaments of other kinds. If we take the golden shekel at 10 thalers (30 shillings), the value of the ornaments taken by the officers under Moses would be about 167,500 thalers (L.25,125). It is quite possible that the kings and other chiefs, together with their wives, may have possessed as much as this. </body></html>
