The best computations fix it at about 220 grains, and this would make the allowance of twenty shekels equal to something less than eleven ounces, scarcely enough to sustain life. “Meat” is here used, as often in Scripture, of any kind of food. The extreme scarcity of food is also denoted by its being weighed rather than measured. “From time to time” means at set intervals of time (see <a href="/1_chronicles/9-25.htm" title="And their brothers, which were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them.">1Chronicles 9:25</a>), here doubtless once a day.

According to Dathius, quoted by Bishop Newcome, the dung of camels, as well as that of cows or oxen, was also “often used by the easterns as fuel for preparing their food.” But the command here given to the prophet, to use human dung, expressed the greatest necessity, and was terribly significant of the extremities which the inhabitants of Jerusalem should undergo during the siege, no nation making use of that offensive kind of fuel.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:9-17 The bread which was Ezekiel's support, was to be made of coarse grain and pulse mixed together, seldom used except in times of urgent scarcity, and of this he was only to take a small quantity. Thus was figured the extremity to which the Jews were to be reduced during the siege and captivity. Ezekiel does not plead, Lord, from my youth I have been brought up delicately, and never used to any thing like this; but that he had been brought up conscientiously, and never had eaten any thing forbidden by the law. It will be comfortable when we are brought to suffer hardships, if our hearts can witness that we have always been careful to keep even from the appearance of evil. See what woful work sin makes, and acknowledge the righteousness of God herein. Their plenty having been abused to luxury and excess, they were justly punished by famine.

Taking the shekel at about 220 grains, the twenty shekels would be about 10 or 12 ounces. The common allowance in England for prison or pauper dietaries gives, I believe from 24 to 32 ounces, Besides other food.

And there came upon me there the hand of Jehovah, and He said to me, Up! go into the valley, there will I speak to thee. <a href="/ezekiel/3-23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23</a>. And I arose, and went into the valley: and, lo, there stood the glory of Jehovah, like the glory which I had seen at the river Chebar: and I fell upon my face. <a href="/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24</a>. And spirit came into me, and placed me on my feet, and He spake with me, and said to me, Go, and shut thyself in thy house. - &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1492; is, without doubt, the valley situated near Tel-abib. Ezekiel is to go out from the midst of the exiles - where, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>, he had found himself-into the valley, because God will reveal Himself to him only in solitude. When he had complied with this command, there appears to him there the glory of Jehovah, in the same form in which it had appeared to him at the Chaboras (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>); before it he falls, a second time, on his face; but is also, as on the first occasion, again raised to his feet, cf. 1:28-2:2. Hereupon the Lord commands him to shut himself up in his house - which doubtless he inhabited in Tel-Abib - not probably "as a sign of his future destiny," as a realistic explanation of the words, "Thou canst not walk in their midst (<a href="/ezekiel/3-25.htm">Ezekiel 3:25</a>); they will prevent thee by force from freely exercising thy vocation in the midst of the people." For in that case the "shutting of himself up in the house" would be an arbitrary identification with the "binding with fetters" (<a href="/ezekiel/3-25.htm">Ezekiel 3:25</a>); and besides, the significance of the address &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1503; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, and its repetition in <a href="/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-1.htm">Ezekiel 5:1</a>, would be misconceived. For as in <a href="/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/5-1.htm">Ezekiel 5:1</a> there are introduced with this address the principal parts of the duty which Ezekiel was to perform, so the proper divine instruction may also first begin with the same in <a href="/ezekiel/3-25.htm">Ezekiel 3:25</a>; consequently the command "to shut himself up in his house" can only have the significance of a preliminary divine injunction, without possessing any significance in itself; but only "serve as a means for carrying out what the prophet is commissioned to do in the following chapters" (Kliefoth), i.e., can only mean that he is to perform in his own house what is commanded him in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4</a> and 5, or that he is not to leave his house during their performance. More can hardly be sought in this injunction, nor can it at all be taken to mean that, having shut himself up from others in his house, he is to allow no one to approach him; but only that he is not to leave his dwelling. For, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-3.htm">Ezekiel 4:3</a>, the symbolical representation of the siege of Jerusalem is to be a sign for the house of Israel; and according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>, Ezekiel is, during this symbolical action, to bake his bread before their eyes. From this it is seen that his contemporaries might come to him and observe his proceedings.</body></html>
