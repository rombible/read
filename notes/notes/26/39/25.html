The representation is to be explained from the profound sense which the prophet, and other prophets, had of the Godhead of Jehovah, with all that Godhead meant. Cf. <a href="/ezekiel/20-9.htm" title="But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 20:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-14.htm" title="But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.">Ezekiel 20:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-22.htm" title="Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.">Ezekiel 20:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-44.htm" title="And you shall know that I am the LORD when I have worked with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O you house of Israel, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 20:44</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-29.</span> - This section Hengstenberg regards as the close of the whole system of prophecies of a predominantly comforting character from <a href="/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a> onwards;" Keil views it as the proper conclusion to the prophecy concerning Gog and the series of predictions from <a href="/ezekiel/35-1.htm">Ezekiel 35:1</a> onwards. It is in substance a recapitulation of God's gracious promise to bring again the captivity of Israel, of which the prophet had just been reminded in ver. 23, and to which accordingly he now in thought goes back. It traces the whole course of the Divine dealings with the nation from the point of the exile onwards. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will bring again the captivity of Jacob</span>. (For the use of "Jacob" as a designation of the people, see <a href="/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>.) The promise goes back to <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-3.htm">Jeremiah 30:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-23.htm">Jeremiah 31:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>; and other passages. That its fulfillment began with the return from Babylon is not inconsistent with the view that its fulfillment will terminate with the final ingathering of Israel out of the nations by her conversion to Christianity, and her consequent admission to the Church. That its first cause will be "mercy" to the whole house of Israel will not prevent that cause from being at the same time a jealous regard for the Divine holiness (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21, 22</a>). </body></html>
