Though sinners escape one judgment, another is waiting for them. When God's professing people rebel against him, they may justly expect all his judgments. The faith, obedience, and prayers of Noah prevailed to the saving of his house, but not of the old world. Job's sacrifice and prayer in behalf of his friends were accepted, and Daniel had prevailed for the saving his companions and the wise men of Babylon. But a people that had filled the measure of their sins, was not to expect to escape for the sake of any righteous men living among them; not even of the most eminent saints, who could be accepted in their own case only through the sufferings and righteousness of Christ. Yet even when God makes the greatest desolations by his judgments, he saves some to be monuments of his mercy. In firm belief that we shall approve the whole of God's dealings with ourselves, and with all mankind, let us silence all rebellious murmurs and objections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Noah, Daniel, and Job - Three striking instances of men who, for their integrity, were delivered from the ruin which fell upon others. Some have thought it strange that Daniel, a contemporary, and still young, should have been classed with the two ancient worthies. But the account of him <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> shows, that by this time Daniel was a very remarkable man (compare <a href="/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3</a>), and the introduction of the name of a contemporary gives force and life to the illustration. There is in the order in which the names occur a kind of climax. Noah did not rescue the guilty world, but did carry forth with him his wife, sons, and sons' wives. Daniel raised only a few, but he did raise three of his countrymen with him to honor. To Job was spared neither son nor daughter.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-21. The argument is cumulative. He first puts the case of the land sinning so as to fall under the judgment of a famine (Eze 14:13); then (Eze 14:15) "noisome beasts" (Le 26:22); then "the sword"; then, worst of all, "pestilence." The three most righteous of men should deliver only themselves in these several four cases. In Eze 14:21 he concentrates the whole in one mass of condemnation. If Noah, Daniel, Job, could not deliver the land, when deserving only one judgment, "how much more" when all four judgments combined are justly to visit the land for sin, shall these three righteous men not deliver it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Though these three men were in it,....

Son of man, these men have let their idols rise up in their heart, and have set the stumbling-block to guilt before their face: shall I allow myself to be inquired of by them? <a href="/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4</a>. Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Every man of the house of Israel who lifteth up his idols in his heart, and setteth the stumbling-block to his sin before his face, and cometh to the prophet, to him do I, Jehovah, show myself, answering according thereto, according to the multitude of his idols; <a href="/ezekiel/14-5.htm">Ezekiel 14:5</a>. To grasp the house of Israel by their heart, because they have turned away from me, all of them through their idols. - We have not to picture these elders to ourselves as given up to gross idolatry. &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1489; means, to allow anything to come into the mind, to permit it to rise up in the heart, to be mentally busy therewith. "To set before one's face" is also to be understood, in a spiritual sense, as relating to a thing which a man will not put out of his mind. &#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500; , stumbling-block to sin and guilt (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>), i.e., the idols. Thus the two phrases simply denote the leaning of the heart and spirit towards false gods. God does not suffer those whose heart is attached to idols to seek and find Him. The interrogative clause '&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; contains a strong negation. The emphasis lies in the infinitive absolute &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; et placed before the verb, in which the &#1492; is softened into &#1488;, to avoid writing &#1492; twice. &#1504;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to allow oneself to be sought, involves the finding of God; hence in <a href="/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a> we have &#1504;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; as parallel to &#1504;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-5.htm">Ezekiel 14:5</a>, there follows a positive declaration of the attitude of God towards those who are devoted to idolatry in their heart. Every such Israelite will be answered by God according to the measure of the multitude of his idols. The Niphal &#1504;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;  has not the signification of the Kal, and does not mean "to be answerable," as Ewald supposes, or to converse; but is generally used in a passive sense, "to be answered," i.e., to find or obtain a hearing (<a href="/job/11-2.htm">Job 11:2</a>; <a href="/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a>). It is employed here in a reflective sense, to hold or show oneself answering. &#1489;&#1492;, according to the Chetib &#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, for which the Keri suggests the softer gloss &#1489;&#1488;, refers to '&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489; &#1490;&#1500; which follows; the nominative being anticipated, according to an idiom very common in Aramaean, by a previous pronoun. It is written here for the sake of emphasis, to bring the following object into more striking prominence. &#1489; is used here in the sense of secundum, according to, not because, since this meaning is quite unsuitable for the &#1489; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-7.htm">Ezekiel 14:7</a>, where it occurs in the same connection (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;). The manner in which God will show Himself answering the idolatry according to their idols, is reserved till <a href="/ezekiel/14-8.htm">Ezekiel 14:8</a>. Here, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-5.htm">Ezekiel 14:5</a>, the design of this procedure on the part of God is given: viz., to grasp Israel by the heart; i.e., not merely to touch and to improve them, but to bring down their heart by judgments (cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>), and thus move them to give up idolatry and return to the living God. &#1504;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>, to recede, to draw away from God. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; is an emphatic repetition of the subject belonging to &#1504;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;.</body></html>
