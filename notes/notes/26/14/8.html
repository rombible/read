And ye profane me with my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay souls which should not die, and to keep alive which should not live, by your lying to my people who hearken to lying. - Like the prophets in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a>, the prophetesses are here described as prophesying out of their own heart (<a href="/ezekiel/13-17.htm">Ezekiel 13:17</a>); and in <a href="/ezekiel/13-18.htm">Ezekiel 13:18</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a> their offences are more particularly described. The meaning of these verses is entirely dependent upon the view to be taken of &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, which the majority of expositors, following the lead of the lxx, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, have regarded as identical with &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1497;&#1491;, and understood as referring to the hands of the women or prophetesses. But there is nothing to justify the assumption that &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; is an unusual form for &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, which even Ewald takes it to be (Lehrbuch, 177a). Still less can it stand for the singular &#1497;&#1491;. And we have not sufficient ground for altering the text, as the expression &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; in <a href="/ezekiel/13-20.htm">Ezekiel 13:20</a> (I will tear the &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; from your arms) does not require the assumption that the prophetesses had hidden their arms in &#1499;&#1505;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;; and such a supposition is by no means obviously in harmony with the facts.<p>The word &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;, with &#1514; fem. treated as a radical letter (cf. Ewald, 186e), means a covering or concealment  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;. The meaning "cushion" or "pillow" (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, Vulg. pulvilli) is merely an inference drawn from this passage, and is decidedly erroneous; for the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; (to sew together) is inapplicable to cushions, as well as the phrase &#1506;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, inasmuch as cushions are not placed upon the joints of the hands, and still less are they sewed together upon them. The latter is also a decisive reason for rejecting the explanation given by Hvernick, namely, that the kesa&#770;tho&#772;th were carpets, which were used as couches, and upon which these voluptuous women are represented as reclining. For cushions or couches are not placed upon, but under, the arm-joints (or elbows) and the shoulders, which Hvernick understands by &#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;. This also overthrows another explanation given of the words, namely, that they refer to carpets, which the prophetesses had sewed together for all their arm-joints, so as to form comfortable beds upon splendid carpets, that they may indulge in licentiousness thereon. The explanation given by Ephraem Syrus, and adopted by Hitzig, namely, that the kesa&#770;tho&#772;th were amulets or straps, which they would round their arm-joints when they received or delivered their oracles, is equally untenable. For, as Kliefoth has observed, "it is evident that there is not a word in the text about adultery, or amulets, or straps used in prayer." And again, when we proceed to the next clause, the traditional rendering of &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, as signifying either pillows (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, Symm.; cervicalia, Vulg.) or broad cloaks  equals  &#1502;&#1496;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (Hitzig, Hvernick, etc.), is neither supported by the usage of the language, nor in harmony with &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;. Mispa&#770;cho&#772;th, from sa&#770;phach, to join, cannot have any other meaning in the present context than a cap fitting close to the head; and &#1506;&#1500; must denote the pattern which was followed, as in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="/esther/9-26.htm">Esther 9:26</a> : they make the caps after (answering to) the head of every stature. The words of both clauses are figurative, and have been correctly explained by Kliefoth as follows: "A double charge is brought against the prophetesses. In the first place, they sew coverings together to wrap round all the joints of the hand of God, so that He cannot touch them; i.e., they cover up and conceal the word of God by their prophesying, more especially its rebuking and threatening force, so that the threatening and judicial arm of God, which ought above all to become both manifest and effective through His prophetic word, does not become either one or the other. In the second place, they make coverings upon the heads of men, and construct them in such a form that they exactly fit the stature or size or every individual, so that the men neither hear nor see; i.e., by means of their flattering lies, which adapt themselves to the subjective inclinations of their hearers at the time, they cover up the senses of the men, so that they retain neither ear nor eye for the truth." They do both of these to catch souls. The inevitable consequence of their act is represented as having been intended by them; and this intention is then still further defined as being to catch the souls of the people of God; i.e., to allure them to destruction, and take care of their own souls. The clause &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492; is not to be taken as a question, "Will ye catch the souls?" implying a doubt whether they really thought that they could carry on such conduct as theirs with perfect impunity (Hvernick). It contains a simple statement of what really took place in their catching of souls, namely, "they catch the souls of the people of God, and preserve their own souls;" i.e., they rob the people of God of their lives, and take care of their own (Kliefoth). &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; is used instead of the genitive (stat. constr.) to show that the accent rests upon &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;. And in the same way we have &#1500;&#1499;&#1504;&#1492; instead of the suffix. The construction is the same as in <a href="/1_samuel/14-16.htm">1 Samuel 14:16</a>. <a href="/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a> shows how great their sin had been. They profane God among His people; namely, by delivering the suggestions of their own heart to the people as divine revelations, for the purpose of getting their daily bread thereby (cf. <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>); by hurling into destruction, through their lies, those who are only too glad to listen to lying; by slaying the souls of the people which ought to live, and by preserving those which ought not to live, i.e., their own souls (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>). The punishment for this will not fail to come. </body></html>
