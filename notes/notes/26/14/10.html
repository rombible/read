Men's corruptions are idols in their hearts, and are of their own setting up; God will let them take their course. Sin renders the sinner odious in the eyes of the pure and holy God; and in his own eyes also, whenever conscience is awakened. Let us seek to be cleansed from the guilt and pollution of sins, in that fountain which the Lord has opened.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I the Lord hare deceived that prophet - A deep truth lies beneath these words, namely, that evil as well as good is under God's direction. He turns it as He will, employing it to test the sincerity of men, and thus making it ultimately contribute to the purification of His people, to the confirmation of the righteous, to the increase of their glory and felicity. The case of the false prophets who deceived Ahab <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a> is a striking representation of this principle. The Lord sends forth an evil spirit to persuade Ahab to his ruin. Toward the close of the kingdom of Judah false prophets were especially rife. The thoughts of men's hearts were revealed, the good separated from the bad, and the remnant of the people purged from the sins by which of late years the whole nation had been defiled. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. As they dealt deceitfully with God by seeking answers of peace without repentance, so God would let them be dealt with deceitfully by the prophets whom they consulted. God would chastise their sin with a corresponding sin; as they rejected the safe directions of the true light, He would send the pernicious delusions of a false one; prophets would be given them who should re-echo the deceitfulness that already wrought in their own bosom, to their ruin [Fairbairn]. The people had themselves alone to blame, for they were long ago forewarned how to discern and to treat a false prophet (De 13:3); the very existence of such deceivers among them was a sign of God's judicial displeasure (compare in Saul's case, 1Sa 16:14; 28:6, 7).

That the principles of the constitution of Israel are known, and the fundamental one is, thou shalt have no other gods before Me. Probably Ezekiel interpreted this first principle as Hosea did, including among “other gods” not only gods different from Jehovah, but images or representations of Jehovah himself (<a href="/hosea/8-6.htm" title="For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.">Hosea 8:6</a>). Men’s first duty was to be true to this principle; cf. the summary proceeding advocated in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-2.htm" title="And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spoke to you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you have not known, and let us serve them;">Deuteronomy 13:2</a>. To those who sin against this fundamental article of religion all other religious offices and ordinances, so far from being beneficial, are made by God a means of destruction. The preaching of the true prophets only hardens (Isaiah 6); or prophecy may be turned into false prophecy. The man who wittingly commits sin had better keep clear of religious ordinances and performances. And the “prophet” (even the modern one) had better keep clear of wicked men, lest he should be used as the instrument of their punishment and perish with them. See on <a href="/ezekiel/3-20.htm" title="Again, When a righteous man does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.">Ezekiel 3:20</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Punishment of the False Prophetesses<p><a href="/ezekiel/13-20.htm">Ezekiel 13:20</a>.

In the first place, the Lord will tear in pieces the coverings and caps, i.e., the tissue of lies woven by the false prophetesses, and rescue the people from their snares (<a href="/ezekiel/13-20.htm">Ezekiel 13:20</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/13-21.htm">Ezekiel 13:21</a>); and, secondly, He will entirely put an end to the pernicious conduct of the persons addressed (<a href="/ezekiel/13-22.htm">Ezekiel 13:22</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/13-23.htm">Ezekiel 13:23</a>). The words from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; to &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="/ezekiel/13-20.htm">Ezekiel 13:20</a>), when taken as one clause, as they generally are, offer insuperable difficulties, since it is impossible to get any satisfactory meaning from &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, and &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; will not fit in. Whether we understand by kesa&#770;tho&#772;th coverings or cushions, the connection of &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (where ye catch the souls), which the majority of commentators prefer, is untenable; for coverings and cushions were not the places where the souls were caught, but could only be the means employed for catching them. Instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; we should expect &#1489;&#1468;&#1501; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;; and Hitzig proposes to amend it in this way. Still less admissible is the proposal to take &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; as referring to Jerusalem ("wherewith ye catch souls there"); as &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; would not only contain a perfectly superfluous definition of locality, but would introduce a limitation altogether at variance with the context. It is not affirmed either of the prophets or of the prophetesses that they lived and prophesied in Jerusalem alone. In <a href="/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/13-17.htm">Ezekiel 13:17</a> reference is made in the most general terms to the prophets of Israel and the daughters of thy people; and in <a href="/ezekiel/13-16.htm">Ezekiel 13:16</a> it is simply stated that the false prophets prophesied peace to Jerusalem when there was no peace at all. Consequently we must regard the attempt to find in &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; an allusion to Jerusalem (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/13-16.htm">Ezekiel 13:16</a>) as a mere loophole, which betrays an utter inability to get any satisfactory sense for the word. Moreover, if we construe the words in this manner, &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; is also incomprehensible. Commentators have for the most part admitted that &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495; taht  is used here in the Aramaean sense of volare, to fly. In the second half of the verse there is no doubt about its having this meaning. For &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; is used in <a href="/deuteronomy/22-7.htm">Deuteronomy 22:7</a> for liberating a bird, or letting it fly; and the combination &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;  is supported by the expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; &#1500;&#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-26.htm">Exodus 21:26</a>, while the comparison of souls to birds is sustained by <a href="/psalms/11-1.htm">Psalm 11:1</a> and <a href="/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>. Hence the true meaning of the whole passage &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;... &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; is, I send away (set free) the souls, which ye have caught, as flying ones, i.e., so that they shall be able to fly away at liberty. And in the first half also we must not adopt a different rendering for &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, since &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; is also connected with it there.<p>But if the words in question are combined into one clause in the first hemistich, they will give us a sense which is obviously wrong, viz., "wherewith ye catch the souls to let them fly." As the impossibility of adopting this rendering has been clearly seen, the attempt has been made to cloak over the difficulty by means of paraphrases. Ewald, for example, renders &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; in both cases "as if they were birds of passage;" but in the first instance he applies it to birds of passage, for which nets are spread for the purpose of catching them; and in the second, to birds of passage which are set at liberty. Thus, strictly speaking, he understands the first &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; as signifying the catching of birds; and the second, letting them fly: an explanation which refutes itself, as pa&#770;rach, to fly, cannot mean "to catch" as well. The rendering adopted by Kimchi, Rosenmller, and others, who translate &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; ut advolent ad vos in the first hemistich, and ut avolent in the second, is no better. And the difficulty is not removed by resorting to the dialects, as Hvernick, for the purpose of forcing upon &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; the meaning dissoluteness of licentiousness, for which there is no authority in the Hebrew language itself. If, therefore, it is impossible to obtain any satisfactory meaning from the existing text, it cannot be correct; and no other course is open to us than to alter the unsuitable &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; into &#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, and divide the words from &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; to &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; into two clauses, as we have done in our translation above. There is no necessity to supply anything to the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; is construed with a double accusative (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>, &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;, to catch with a net), and the object to &#1502;&#1510;&#1491;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, viz., the souls, can easily be supplied from the next clause. &#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, as a participle, can either be connected with &#1492;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, "behold, I make," or taken as introducing an explanatory clause: "making the souls into flying ones," i.e., so that they are able to fly (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>, etc.). The two clauses of the first hemistich would then exactly correspond to the two clauses of the second half of the verse. &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; is explanatory of &#1492;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500; &#1499;&#1505;&#1514;, I will tear off the coverings from their arms. These words do not require the assumption that the prophetesses wore the &#1500;&#1505;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; on their arms, but may be fully explained from the supposition that the persons in question prepared them with their own hands. '&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; corresponds to '&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;; and &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; is governed by &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. The insertion of &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is to be accounted for from the copious nature of Ezekiel's style; at the same time, it is not merely a repetition of &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, which is separated from &#1500;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; by the relative clause '&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1502;&#1495;, but as the unusual plural form &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; shows, is intended as a practical explanation of the fact, that the souls, while compared to birds, are regarded as living beings, which is the meaning borne by &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; in other passages. The omission of the article after &#1488;&#1514; may be explained, however, from the fact that the souls had been more precisely defined just before; just as, for example, in <a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>, where the more precise definition follows immediately afterwards (cf. Ewald, 277a, p. 683). - The same thing is said in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-21.htm">Ezekiel 13:21</a>, with regard to the caps, as has already been said of the coverings in <a href="/ezekiel/13-20.htm">Ezekiel 13:20</a>. God will tear these in pieces also, to deliver His people from the power of the lying prophetesses. In what way God will do this is explained in <a href="/ezekiel/13-22.htm">Ezekiel 13:22</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-23.htm">Ezekiel 13:23</a>, namely, not only by putting their lying prophecies to shame through His judgment, but by putting an end to soothsaying altogether, and exterminating the false prophetesses by making them an object of ridicule and shame. The reason for this threat is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-22.htm">Ezekiel 13:22</a>, where a further description is given of the disgraceful conduct of these persons; and here the disgracefulness of their conduct is exhibited in literal terms and without any figure. They do harm to the righteous and good, and strengthen the hands of the wicked. &#1492;&#1499;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, Hiphil of &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, in Syriac, to use harshly or depress; so here in the Hiphil, connected with &#1500;&#1489;, to afflict the heart. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; is used adverbially: with lying, or in a lying manner; namely, by predicting misfortune and divine punishments, with which they threatened the godly, who would not acquiesce in their conduct; whereas, on the contrary, they predicted prosperity and peace to the ungodly, who were willing to be ensnared by them, and thus strengthened them in their evil ways. For this God would put them to shame through His judgments, which would make their deceptions manifest, and their soothsaying loathsome. </body></html>
