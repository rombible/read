Though sinners escape one judgment, another is waiting for them. When God's professing people rebel against him, they may justly expect all his judgments. The faith, obedience, and prayers of Noah prevailed to the saving of his house, but not of the old world. Job's sacrifice and prayer in behalf of his friends were accepted, and Daniel had prevailed for the saving his companions and the wise men of Babylon. But a people that had filled the measure of their sins, was not to expect to escape for the sake of any righteous men living among them; not even of the most eminent saints, who could be accepted in their own case only through the sufferings and righteousness of Christ. Yet even when God makes the greatest desolations by his judgments, he saves some to be monuments of his mercy. In firm belief that we shall approve the whole of God's dealings with ourselves, and with all mankind, let us silence all rebellious murmurs and objections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye shall be comforted ... - By a truer estimate of the dispensations of the Almighty.

But if a prophet allow himself to be persuaded, and give a word, I have persuaded this prophet, and will stretch out my hand against him, and cut him off out of my people Israel. <a href="/ezekiel/14-10.htm">Ezekiel 14:10</a>. They shall bear their guilt: as the guilt of the inquirer, so shall the guilt of the prophet be; <a href="/ezekiel/14-11.htm">Ezekiel 14:11</a>. In order that the house of Israel may no more stray from me, and may no more defile itself with all its transgressions; but they may be my people, and I their God is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - The prophet who allows himself to be persuaded is not a prophet &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; (<a href="/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a>), but one who really thinks that he has a word of God. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, to persuade, to entice by friendly words (in a good sense, <a href="/hosea/2-16.htm">Hosea 2:16</a>); but generally sensu malo, to lead astray, or seduce to that which is unallowable or evil. "If he allow himself to be persuaded:" not necessarily "with the hope of payment from the hypocrites who consult him" (Michaelis). This weakens the thought. It might sometimes be done from unselfish good-nature. And "the word" itself need not have been a divine oracle of his own invention, or a false prophecy. The allusion is simply to a word of a different character from that contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-6.htm">Ezekiel 14:6-8</a>, which either demands repentance or denounces judgment upon the impenitent: every word, therefore, which could by any possibility confirm the sinner in his security. - By &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (<a href="/ezekiel/14-9.htm">Ezekiel 14:9</a>) the apodosis is introduced in an emphatic manner, as in <a href="/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/14-7.htm">Ezekiel 14:7</a>; but &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; cannot be taken in a future sense ("I will persuade"). It must be a perfect; since the persuading of the prophet would necessarily precede his allowing himself to be persuaded. The Fathers and earlier Lutheran theologians are wrong in their interpretation of &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, which they understand in a permissive sense, meaning simply that God allowed it, and did not prevent their being seduced. Still more wrong are Storr and Schmieder, the former of whom regards it as simply declaratory, "I will declare him to have gone astray from the worship of Jehovah;" the latter, "I will show him to be a fool, by punishing him for his disobedience." The words are rather to be understood in accordance with <a href="/1_kings/22-20.htm">1 Kings 22:20</a>., where the persuading (pitta&#770;h) is done by a lying spirit, which inspires the prophets of Ahab to predict success to the king, in order that he may fall. As Jehovah sent the spirit in that case, and put it into the mouth of the prophets, so is the persuasion in this instance also effected by God: not merely divine permission, but divine ordination and arrangement; though this does not destroy human freedom, but, like all "persuading," presupposes the possibility of not allowing himself to be persuaded. See the discussion of this question in the commentary on <a href="/1_kings/22-20.htm">1 Kings 22:20</a>. The remark of Calvin on the verse before us is correct: "it teaches that neither impostures nor frauds take place apart from the will of God" (nisi Deo volente). But this willing on the part of God, or the persuading of the prophets to the utterance of self-willed words, which have not been inspired by God, only takes place in persons who admit evil into themselves, and is designed to tempt them and lead them to decide whether they will endeavour to resist and conquer the sinful inclinations of their hearts, or will allow them to shape themselves into outward deeds, in which case they will become ripe for judgment. It is in this sense that God persuades such a prophet, in order that He may then cut him off out of His people. But this punishment will not fall upon the prophet only. It will reach the seeker or inquirer also, in order if possible to bring Israel back from its wandering astray, and make it into a people of God purified from sin (<a href="/ezekiel/14-10.htm">Ezekiel 14:10</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/14-11.htm">Ezekiel 14:11</a>). It was to this end that, in the last times of the kingdom of Judah, God allowed false prophecy to prevail so mightily, - namely, that it might accelerate the process of distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked; and then, by means of the judgment which destroyed the wicked, purify His nation and lead it on to the great end of its calling. </body></html>
