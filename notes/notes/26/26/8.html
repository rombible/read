The explanation of this is doubtless partly in the fact that Palæotyrus, Old Tyre, upon the mainland, was approached in the ordinary way, and partly that Nebuchadnezzar must have contrived a bridge of boats, or some other method of approaching the island across the shoal and narrow channel (1,200 yards), which at that time separated it from the mainland. That if he built a mole it was afterwards removed, is plain from the fact that when Alexander built one, 250 years later, sand accumulated upon it, until the island has now become a peninsula, connected with the shore by a beach of considerable width.<p><span class= "bld">The buckler </span>is that sort of roof made with shields used in ancient warfare by besiegers to defend themselves from the missiles of the besieged.

But it comes from a selfish, covetous principle, and from that love of the world as our happiness, which the love of God expressly forbids. He often blasts the projects of those who would raise themselves on the ruin of others. The maxims most current in the trading world, are directly opposed to the law of God. But he will show himself against the money-loving, selfish traders, whose hearts, like those of Tyre, are hardened by the love of riches. Men have little cause to glory in things which stir up the envy and rapacity of others, and which are continually shifting from one to another; and in getting, keeping, and spending which, men provoke that God whose wrath turns joyous cities into ruinous heaps.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lift up the buckler - i. e., set a wall of shields, under cover of which the walls could be approached.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. from the north&#8212;the original locality of the Chaldeans; also, the direction by which they entered Palestine, taking the route of Riblah and Hamath on the Orontes, in preference to that across the desert between Babylon and Judea.<p>king of kings&#8212;so called because of the many kings who owned allegiance to him (2Ki 18:28).

Ezekiel's prophecy was not based on conjecture from the past, for Shalmaneser, with all the might of the Assyrian empire, had failed in his siege of Tyre. Yet Nebuchadnezzar was to succeed. Josephus tells us that Nebuchadnezzar began the siege in the seventh year of Ithobal's reign, king of Tyre.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/26-6.htm" title="And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 26:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Make a fort against thee:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/4-2.htm" title="And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.">Ezekiel 4:2</a> 17:17</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cast a mount against thee:</span> he shall draw a line round about thee, and build bastions, raise sconces to defend the lines, to keep in the besieged, and secure the besiegers; or he shall pour out the shot, mighty stones or the like, out of the engines framed and placed on the forts before mentioned; for so did they of old build mighty wooden towers, and there placed engines, out of which they could fling mighty stones or darts against the besieged, who were much annoyed from these high towers, overlooking their walls and streets that none could stir out. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Lift up the buckler:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/23-24.htm" title="And they shall come against you with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against you buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.">Ezekiel 23:24</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field,....

The cities and villages, dependencies of Tyre in the mainland, naturally are the first to suffer. Then the siege of the insular city itself is taken in hand. The order is precise: first the “fort” or moveable tower from which the archers shot so as to counteract the defensive efforts of the besieged (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/4-2.htm" title="And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.">Ezekiel 4:2</a>); then the “mount” or embankment, which in this case was a dam thrown across the narrow strait, in order to gain access to the walls; then the “buckler” or shield, i.e. probably the testudo or roof of shields under cover of which the besiegers operated, and finally (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/26-9.htm" title="And he shall set engines of war against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers.">Ezekiel 26:9</a></span>) the battering engines.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - (For the usual operations of a siege, see notes on Ezekiel 4:1, 2.)

Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because Edom acteth revengefully towards the house of Judah, and hath been very guilty in avenging itself upon them, <a href="/ezekiel/25-13.htm">Ezekiel 25:13</a>. Therefore, thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand over Edom, and cut off man and beast from it, and make it a desert from Teman, and unto Dedan they shall fall by the sword. <a href="/ezekiel/25-14.htm">Ezekiel 25:14</a>. And I will inflict my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, that they may do to Edom according to my anger and my wrath; and they shall experience my vengeance, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - Whilst the Ammonites and the Moabites are charged with nothing more than malicious pleasure at the fall of Israel, and disregard of its divine calling, the Edomites are reproached with revengeful acts of hostility towards the house of Judah, and threatened with extermination in consequence. The &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, doing or acting of Edom, is more precisely defined as '&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, i.e., as consisting in the taking of vengeance, and designated as very guilty, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1501;. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, followed by &#1489;&#1468; with an infinitive, as in <a href="/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>. Edom had sought every opportunity of acting thus revengefully towards Israel (vid., <a href="/obadiah/1-11.htm">Obadiah 1:11</a>; <a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>), so that in <a href="/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a> Ezekiel speaks of the "eternal enmity" of Edom against Israel. For this reason we must not restrict the reproach in <a href="/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12</a> to particular outbreaks of this revenge at the time of the devastation and destruction of Judah by the Chaldeans, of which the Psalmist complains in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1-9</a>, and for which he invokes the vengeance of God upon Edom. Man and beast are to be cut off from Edom in consequence, and the land to become a desert from Teman to Dedan. These names denote not cities, but districts. Teman is the southern portion of Idumaea (see the comm. on <a href="/amos/1-12.htm">Amos 1:12</a>); and Dedan is therefore the northern district. Dedan is probably not the Cushite tribe mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>, but the tribe of the same name which sprang from the sons of Abraham by Keturah (<a href="/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>), and which is also mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/49-8.htm">Jeremiah 49:8</a> in connection with Edom. &#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492; has &#1492; local with Seghol instead of Kametz, probably on account of the preceding a (vid., Ewald, 216c). There is no necessity to connect &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503; with the following clause, as Hitzig and Kliefoth have done, in opposition to the accents. The two geographical names, which are used as a periphrasis for Idumaea as a whole, are distributed equally through the parallelismus membrorum between the two clauses of the sentence, so that they belong to both clauses, so far as the sense is concerned. Edom is to become a desert from Teman to Dedan, and its inhabitants from Teman to Dedan are to fall by the sword. This judgment of vengeance will be executed by God through His people Israel. The fulfilment of this threat, no doubt, commenced with the subjugation of the Edomites by the Maccabees; but it is not to be limited to that event, as Rosenmller, Kliefoth, and others suppose, although the foundation was thereby laid for the disappearance of the national existence of Edom. For it is impossible with this limitation to do justice to the emphatic expression, "my people Israel." On the ground, therefore, of the prophecies in <a href="/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-17.htm">Obadiah 1:17</a>, that the people of God are to take possession of Edom, when the fallen tabernacle of David is raised up again, i.e., in the Messianic times, which prophecies point back to that of Balaam in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>, and have their roots, as this also has, in the promise of God concerning the twin sons of Isaac, "the elder shall serve the younger" (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>), we must seek for the complete fulfilment in the victories of the people of God over all their foes, among whom Edom from time immemorial had taken the leading place, at the time when the kingdom of God is perfected. For even here Edom is not introduced merely as a single nation that was peculiarly hostile to Judah, but also as a type of the implacable enmity of the heathen world towards the people and kingdom of God, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-1.htm">Ezekiel 35:1-15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34-63.htm">Isaiah 34:63</a>, etc. The vengeance, answering to the anger and wrath of Jehovah, which Israel, as the people of God, is to execute upon Edom, consists not merely in the annihilation of the national existence of Edom, which John Hyrcanus carried into effect by compelling the subjugated Edomites to adopt circumcision (see the comm. on <a href="/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>), but chiefly in the wrathful judgment which Israel will execute in the person of Christ upon the arch-enemy of the kingdom of God by its complete extinction. </body></html>
