By omitting all the words in italics in this verse a better idea is obtained of the exultation of Tyre over the fall of Jerusalem.<p>This exultation is described as of a purely selfish and commercial character, and shows nothing of the spitefulness and religious animosity of the nations mentioned in the previous chapter. Jerusalem had been made in the days of Solomon the great commercial emporium of the inland trade from Arabia, and even from India, as well as the negotiator of products between Egypt and the Hittites and other northern nations. Doubtless something of this commercial importance still remained to Jerusalem in her decay, of which we have already seen evidence in Ezekiel 16; but however this may have been, a considerable city, situated as Jerusalem was, must of necessity have been the centre of many of those transactions between the surrounding nations which Tyre would gladly have monopolised for herself.

But it comes from a selfish, covetous principle, and from that love of the world as our happiness, which the love of God expressly forbids. He often blasts the projects of those who would raise themselves on the ruin of others. The maxims most current in the trading world, are directly opposed to the law of God. But he will show himself against the money-loving, selfish traders, whose hearts, like those of Tyre, are hardened by the love of riches. Men have little cause to glory in things which stir up the envy and rapacity of others, and which are continually shifting from one to another; and in getting, keeping, and spending which, men provoke that God whose wrath turns joyous cities into ruinous heaps.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gates - i. e., one gate of two leaves.<p>The people - Or, the peoples (and in <a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a>), the plural expressing the fact that many peoples passed through Jerusalem, as the central place on the highway of commerce, e. g., in the reign of Solomon.

Tyre&#8212;(Jos 19:29; 2Sa 24:7), literally, meaning "the rock-city," Zor; a name applying to the island Tyre, called New Tyre, rather than Old Tyre on the mainland. They were half a mile apart. "New Tyre," a century and a half before the fall of Jerusalem, had successfully resisted Shalmaneser of Assyria, for five years besieging it (Menander, from the Tyrian archives, quoted by Josephus, Antiquities, 9.14. 2). It was the stronger and more important of the two cities, and is the one chiefly, though not exclusively, here meant. Tyre was originally a colony of Zidon. Nebuchadnezzar's siege of it lasted thirteen years (Eze 29:18; Isa 23:1-18). Though no profane author mentions his having succeeded in the siege, Jerome states he read the fact in Assyrian histories.<p>Aha!&#8212;exultation over a fallen rival (Ps 35:21, 25).<p>she &#8230; that was the gates&#8212;that is, the single gate composed of two folding doors. Hence the verb is singular. "Gates" were the place of resort for traffic and public business: so here it expresses a mart of commerce frequented by merchants. Tyre regards Jerusalem not as an open enemy, for her territory being the narrow, long strip of land north of Philistia, between Mount Lebanon and the sea, her interest was to cultivate friendly relations with the Jews, on whom she was dependent for corn (Eze 27:17; 1Ki 5:9; Ac 12:20). But Jerusalem had intercepted some of the inland traffic which she wished to monopolize to herself; so, in her intensely selfish worldly-mindedness, she exulted heartlessly over the fall of Jerusalem as her own gain. Hence she incurred the wrath of God as pre-eminently the world's representative in its ambition, selfishness, and pride, in defiance of the will of God (Isa 23:9).<p>she is turned unto me&#8212;that is, the mart of corn, wine, oil, balsam, &c., which she once was, is transferred to me. The caravans from Palmyra, Petra, and the East will no longer be intercepted by the market ("the gates") of Jerusalem, but will come to me.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Tyrus; </span> the city for the people; it is probable it was a universal joy, therefore ascribed to the whole city, built on a rock and island of the same name, not far distant from the continent, a very great traded port and city. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hath said; </span> either God revealed this to the prophet so soon as these insulting Tyrians spoke it, or else Ezekiel speaks of it prophetically, and as if it were done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Said against Jerusalem, </span> Aha; showed great joy at the fall of Jerusalem, and triumphed over her. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">She is broken</span> by Nebuchadnezzar’s army. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The gates of the people; </span> near to the gates of the cities were usually, the great merchants, and so here Jerusalem is called the great mart of nations and people from all parts resorting to her for trade or religion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">She is turned unto me; </span> trading interest will turn to me, they that did carry merchandise to Jerusalem will now bring it to me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I shall be replenished; </span> have full trade, my haven full of ships, streets full of buyers and sellers, ships full of wares, houses full of lodgers, and purses full of money. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">She is laid waste; </span> she reflected on wasted Jerusalem with joy, which was impious, injurious, and inhuman, to rejoice in the ruin of her neighbour. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, aha,....

The idea appears to be that Jerusalem or Judah was a door barring the entrance to Tyre, which being broken and turned or opened towards Tyre the nations would stream with their commerce towards her. The kingdom of Judah lay across the great commercial routes from the south, and no doubt intercepted much of the merchandise that otherwise would have reached Tyre, and probably exacted custom on that which was allowed to pass. The natural sense of “door of the nations” would be door <span class="ital">into</span> the nations (<a href="/nahum/3-13.htm" title="Behold, your people in the middle of you are women: the gates of your land shall be set wide open to your enemies: the fire shall devour your bars.">Nahum 3:13</a>; <a href="/zechariah/11-1.htm" title="Open your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars.">Zechariah 11:1</a>), and the idea would be that the door was now opened for Tyre to enter. The sense remains the same: that which stood between Tyre and the nations is removed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">2</span>. Prophecy is always ideal in its delineations. Its threats and promises are alike hyperbolical whether they concern Israel or the nations. And in regard to fulfilment the same general principles must be applied to all prophecies, those of redemption and those of calamity alike. The former are not fulfilled at once, nor at all literally, neither need we expect immediate or literal fulfilment of the latter. At the same time in regard to both it must be maintained that the prophets <span class="ital">imagined</span> the fulfilment as they describe it. This, however, is part of their idealism; the moral element is always the main thing in their prophecies. What they predict is the exhibition of Jehovah’s moral rule of the world; the <span class="ital">form</span> in which they clothe this exhibition may not be quite that given in history.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because that Tyrus</span>, etc. As the nearest great commercial city, the Venice of the ancient world, Tyre, from the days of David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>) and Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>) onward, had been prominent in the eyes of the statesmen and prophets of Judah; and Ezekiel follows in the footsteps of <a href="/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>; <a href="/amos/1-9.htm">Amos 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>, in dealing with it.

The extent of her commerce will meet us in <a href="/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>. Here, too, as in the case of the nations in <a href="/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25</a>, Ezekiel's indignation is roused by the exulting selfishness with which Tyre had looked on the downfall (actual or imminent, as before) of Jerusalem. "Now," her rulers seem to have said, "we shall be the only power in the land of Canaan." Jerusalem, that had been <span class="cmt_word">the gate of the peoples</span>, was now broken. The name thus given may imply either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Jerusalem was regarded as to a considerable extent a commercial city, carrying on much intercourse with the nations with which she was in alliance, (<a href="/ezekiel/23-40.htm">Ezekiel 23:40, 41</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26-28</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>; Herod., 3:5, of Cadytis, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably Jerusalem); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that its temple had, under Hezekiah and Josiah, drawn many proselytes from the neighboring nations, as in <a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4-6</a>, and was looking forward to a yet fuller confluence of men of all races, as in the prophecies of <a href="/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1, 2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2, 3</a> - expectations which may well have become known to a city like Tyro, in frequent intercourse with Judah. "Now," the Tyrians might say, "that hope is shattered." <span class="cmt_word">I shall be replenished</span>.

Therefore, behold, I will stretch out my hand against thee, and give thee to the nations for booty, and cut thee off from the peoples, and exterminate thee from the lands; I will destroy thee, that thou mayst learn that I am Jehovah. - In <a href="/ezekiel/21-28.htm">Ezekiel 21:28</a>., when predicting the expedition of Nebuchadnezzar against Jerusalem, Ezekiel had already foretold the destruction of the Ammonites, so that these verses are simply a resumption and confirmation of the earlier prophecy. In the passage referred to, Ezekiel, like Zephaniah before him (<a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>), mentions their reviling of the people of God as the sin for which they are to be punished with destruction. This reviling, in which their hatred of the divine calling of Israel found vent, was the radical sin of Ammon. On the occasion of Judah's fall, it rose even to contemptuous and malicious joy at the profanation of the sanctuary of Jehovah by the destruction of the temple (a comparison with <a href="/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a> will show that this is the sense in which &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is to be understood), at the devastation of the land of Israel, and at the captivity of Judah, - in other words, at the destruction of the religious and political existence of Israel as the people of God. The profanation of the sanctuary is mentioned first, to intimate that the hostility to Israel, manifested by the Ammonites on every occasion that presented itself (for proofs, see the comm. on <a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a>), had its roots not so much in national antipathies, as in antagonism to the sacred calling of Israel. As a punishment for this, they are not only to lose their land (<a href="/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/25-5.htm">Ezekiel 25:5</a>), but to be cut off from the number of the nations (<a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a>). The Lord will give up their land, with its productions, for a possession to the sons of the east, i.e., according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13-18</a>, to the Arabs, the Bedouins (for &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, see the comm. on <a href="/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a> and <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). The Piel &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, although only occurring here, is not to be rejected as critically suspicious, and to be changed into Kal, as Hitzig proposes. The Kal would be unsuitable, because the subject of the sentence can only be &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, and not &#1496;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; in the Kal has an intransitive sense.

In the last clauses of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4</a>, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is repeated for the sake of emphasis; and Hitzig's opinion, that the first &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; corresponds to the subject in the clause '&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, the second to that in &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, is to be rejected as a marvellous flight of imagination, which approaches absurdity in the assertion that &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; signifies the folds, i.e., the animals, of the land. Along with the fruit of the land, i.e., the produce of the soil, milk is also mentioned as a production of pastoral life, and the principal food of nomads. On the wealth of the Ammonites in flocks and herds, see <a href="/judges/6-5.htm">Judges 6:5</a>. The words are addressed to Ammon, as a land or kingdom, and hence the feminine suffix. The capital will also share the fate of the land. Rabbah (see the comm. on <a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>) will become a camel-ground, a waste spot where camels lie down and feed. This has been almost literally fulfilled. The ruins of Ammn are deserted by men, and Seetzen found Arabs with their camels not far off (vid., von Raumer, Palestine, p. 268). In the parallel clause, the sons of Ammon, i.e., the Ammonites, are mentioned instead of their land.<p>In <a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a>, the Lord announces to the nation of the Ammonites the destruction that awaits them, and reiterates with still stronger emphasis the sin which occasioned it, namely, the malicious delight they had manifested at Israel's fall. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1496;&#1498; is strengthened by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;: with all thy contempt in the soul, i.e., with all the contempt which thy soul could cherish. In <a href="/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a> the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.. &#1500;&#1489;&#1490; occasions some difficulty. The Keri has substituted &#1500;&#1489;&#1494;, for booty for the nations (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/26-5.htm">Ezekiel 26:5</a>); and all the ancient versions have adopted this. Consequently &#1489;&#1468;&#1490; might be a copyist's error for &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;; and in support of this the circumstance might be adduced, that in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>, where &#1490;&#1468;&#1492; stands for &#1494;&#1492;, we have unquestionably a substitution of &#1490; for &#1494;. But if the Chetib &#1489;&#1494; be correct, the word is to be explained - as it has been by Benfey (Die Montasnamen, p. 194) and Gildemeister (in Lassen's Zeitschrift fr die Kunde des Morgenlandes, iv. 1, p. 213ff.) - from the Sanscrit bha equals ga, pars, portio, and has passed into the Semitic languages from the Aryan, like the Syriac bagaa', esca, which P. Boetticher (Horae aram. p. 21) has correctly traced to the Sanscrit bhaj, conquere. - The executors of the judgment are not named; for the threat that God will give up the land of the Ammonites to the Bedouins for their possession, does not imply that they are to exterminate the Ammonites. On the contrary, a comparison of this passage with <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13-15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1-5</a>, where the Ammonites are threatened not only with the devastation of their land, but also with transportation into exile, will show that the Chaldeans are to be thought of as executing the judgment.
