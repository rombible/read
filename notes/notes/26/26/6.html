But it comes from a selfish, covetous principle, and from that love of the world as our happiness, which the love of God expressly forbids. He often blasts the projects of those who would raise themselves on the ruin of others. The maxims most current in the trading world, are directly opposed to the law of God. But he will show himself against the money-loving, selfish traders, whose hearts, like those of Tyre, are hardened by the love of riches. Men have little cause to glory in things which stir up the envy and rapacity of others, and which are continually shifting from one to another; and in getting, keeping, and spending which, men provoke that God whose wrath turns joyous cities into ruinous heaps.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Her daughters ... - The subject states upon the mainland, on which she at this time relied for supplies. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. her daughters &#8230; in the field&#8212;The surrounding villages, dependent on her in the open country, shall share the fate of the mother city.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Her daughters; </span> either the lesser cities, which were as daughters to Tyre, a phrase most familiar to the Scriptures; or else their virgins, and daughters of the family. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the field; </span> on the firm land, if you mean cities; or surprised in the fields, whether taking the air, or seeking to escape, if you mean daughters in the latter sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall be slain by the sword; </span> barbarous soldiers shall spare none. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They shall know that I am the Lord:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/25-17.htm" title="And I will execute great vengeance on them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance on them.">Ezekiel 25:17</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword,....

Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because Moab, like Seir, saith, Behold, like all other nations is the house of Judah: <a href="/ezekiel/25-9.htm">Ezekiel 25:9</a>. Therefore, behold, I will open the shoulder of Moab from the cities, from its cities even to the last, the ornament of the land, Beth-hayeshimoth, Baal-meon, and as far as Kiryathaim, <a href="/ezekiel/25-10.htm">Ezekiel 25:10</a>. To the sons of the east, together with the sons of Ammon, and will give it for a possession, that the sons of Ammon may no more be remembered among the nations. <a href="/ezekiel/25-11.htm">Ezekiel 25:11</a>. Upon Moab will I execute judgments; and they shall learn that I am Jehovah. - Moab has become guilty of the same sin against Judah, the people of God, as Ammon, namely, of misunderstanding and despising the divine election of Israel. Ammon gave expression to this, when Judah was overthrown, in the malicious assertion that the house of Judah was like all the heathen nations, - that is to say, had no pre-eminence over them, and shared the same fate as they. There is something remarkable in the allusion to Seir, i.e., Edom, in connection with Moab, inasmuch as no reference is made to it in the threat contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-9.htm">Ezekiel 25:9-11</a>; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12-13</a>, there follows a separate prediction concerning Edom. Hitzig therefore proposes to follow the example of the lxx, and erase it from the text as a gloss, but without being able in the smallest degree to show in what way it is probable that such a gloss could have found admission into an obviously unsuitable place. Seir is mentioned along with Moab to mark the feeling expressed in the words of Moab as springing, like the enmity of Edom towards Israel, from hatred and envy of the spiritual birthright of Israel, i.e., of its peculiar prerogatives in sacred history. As a punishment for this, Moab was to be given up, like Ammon, to the Bedouins for their possession, and the people of the Moabites were to disappear from the number of the nations. <a href="/ezekiel/25-9.htm">Ezekiel 25:9</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/25-10.htm">Ezekiel 25:10</a> form one period, &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501; in <a href="/ezekiel/25-10.htm">Ezekiel 25:10</a> being governed by &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; in <a href="/ezekiel/25-9.htm">Ezekiel 25:9</a>. The shoulder of Moab is the side of the Moabitish land. In the application of the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507; to lands or provinces, regard is had to the position of the shoulder in relation to the whole body, but without reference to the elevation of the district. We find an analogy to this in the use of &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507; in connection with the sides of a building. In '&#1502;&#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;'  , the &#1502;&#1503; cannot be taken, in a privative sense, for &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;; for neither the article &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, nor the more emphatic &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, allows this; but &#1502;&#1503; indicates the direction, "from the cities onwards," "from its cities onwards, reckoning to the very last," - that is to say, in its whole extent. &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>, etc. This tract of land is first of all designated as a glorious land, with reference to its worth as a possession on account of the excellence of its soil for the rearing of cattle (see the comm. on <a href="/numbers/32-4.htm">Numbers 32:4</a>), and then defined with geographical minuteness by the introduction of the names of some of its cities. Beth-Hayeshimoth, i.e., house of wastes (see the comm. on <a href="/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a>), has probably been preserved in the ruins of Suaime, which F. de Saulcy discovered on the north-eastern border of the Dead Sea, a little farther inland (vid., Voyage en terre sainte, Paris 1865, t. i. p. 315). Baal-meon, - when written fully, Beth-Baal-Meon (<a href="/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>) - contracted into Beth-Meon in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-23.htm">Jeremiah 48:23</a>, is to be sought for to the south-east of this, in the ruins of Myun, three-quarters of an hour's journey to the south of Heshbon (see the comm. on <a href="/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>). Kiryathaim was still farther south, probably on the site of the ruins of El Teym (see the comm. on <a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a> and <a href="/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37</a>). The Chetib &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1492; is based upon the form &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501;, a secondary form of &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; , like &#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1503;, a secondary form of &#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1503;, in <a href="/2_kings/6-13.htm">2 Kings 6:13</a>. The cities named were situated to the north of the Arnon, in that portion of the Moabitish land which had been taken from the Moabites by the Amorites before the entrance of the Israelites into Canaan (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>, <a href="/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a>), and was given to the tribe of Reuben for its inheritance after the defeat of the Amoritish kings by the Israelites; and then, still later, when the tribes beyond the Jordan were carried into captivity by the Assyrians, came into the possession of the Moabites again, as is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1-9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1-14</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-23.htm">Jeremiah 48:23</a>, where these cities are mentioned once more among the cities of the Moabites. This will explain not only the naming of this particular district of the Moabitish country, but the definition, "from its cities." For the fact upon which the stress is laid in the passage before us is, that the land in question rightfully belonged to the Israelites, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37-38</a>; <a href="/numbers/33-49.htm">Numbers 33:49</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2-3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-20.htm">Joshua 13:20-21</a>, and that it was therefore unlawfully usurped by the Moabites after the deportation of the trans-Jordanic tribes; and the thought is this, that the judgment would burst upon Moab from this land and these cities, and they would thereby be destroyed (Hvernick and Kliefoth). &#1506;&#1500;, not "over the sons of Ammon," but "in addition to the sons of Ammon." They, that is to say, their land, had already been promised to the sons of the east (<a href="/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4</a>). In addition to this, they are now to receive Moab for their possession (Hitzig and Kliefoth). Thus will the Lord execute judgments upon Moab. <a href="/ezekiel/25-11.htm">Ezekiel 25:11</a> sums up what is affirmed concerning Moab in <a href="/ezekiel/25-9.htm">Ezekiel 25:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-10.htm">Ezekiel 25:10</a>, in the one idea of the judgments of God upon this people.<p>The execution of these judgments commenced with the subjugation of the Ammonites and Moabites by Nebuchadnezzar, five years after the destruction of Jerusalem (vid., Josephus, Antt. x. 9. 7, and M. von Niebuhr, Gesch. Assurs, etc., p. 215). Nevertheless the Ammonites continued to exist as a nation for a long time after the captivity, so that Judas the Maccabaean waged war against them (1 Macc. 5:6, 30-43); and even Justin Martyr speaks of  &#787;&#x391;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Dial. Tryph. p. 272). - But Origen includes their land in the general name of Arabia (lib. i. in Job). The name of the Moabites appears to have become extinct at a much earlier period. After the captivity, it is only in <a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-41.htm">Daniel 11:41</a>, that we find any notice of them as a people. Their land is mentioned by Josephus in the Antiq. xiii. 14. 2, and xv. 4, and in the Bell. <a href="//biblehub.com/jude/3.htm">Jude 3</a>.3. 3. - A further fulfilment by the Messianic judgment, which is referred to in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>, is not indicated in these words of Ezekiel; but judging from the prophecy concerning the Edomites (see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/25-14.htm">Ezekiel 25:14</a>), it is not to be excluded. </body></html>
