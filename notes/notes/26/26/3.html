He has in mind not merely the conquest by Nebuchadnezzar, of which he will speak more particularly presently (<a href="/context/ezekiel/26-7.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring on Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.">Ezekiel 26:7-11</a>), but all the successive conquests until the proud city should be reduced to utter desolation. Most appropriate to the situation and habits of Tyre is the illustration, “as the sea causeth his waves to come up”: God will bring nation after nation to the destruction of Tyre as the sea throws wave after wave against her rock.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:1-14 To be secretly pleased with the death or decay of others, when we are likely to get by it; or with their fall, when we may thrive upon it, is a sin that easily besets us, yet is not thought so bad as really it is. But it comes from a selfish, covetous principle, and from that love of the world as our happiness, which the love of God expressly forbids. He often blasts the projects of those who would raise themselves on the ruin of others. The maxims most current in the trading world, are directly opposed to the law of God. But he will show himself against the money-loving, selfish traders, whose hearts, like those of Tyre, are hardened by the love of riches. Men have little cause to glory in things which stir up the envy and rapacity of others, and which are continually shifting from one to another; and in getting, keeping, and spending which, men provoke that God whose wrath turns joyous cities into ruinous heaps.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gates - i. e., one gate of two leaves.<p>The people - Or, the peoples (and in <a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a>), the plural expressing the fact that many peoples passed through Jerusalem, as the central place on the highway of commerce, e. g., in the reign of Solomon.

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/25-2.htm">Ezekiel 25:2</a>. Son of man, direct thy face towards the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them, <a href="/ezekiel/25-3.htm">Ezekiel 25:3</a>. And say to the sons of Ammon, Hear ye the word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thou sayest, Aha! concerning my sanctuary, that it is profaned; and concerning the land of Israel, that it is laid waste; and concerning the house of Judah, that they have gone into captivity; <a href="/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4</a>. Therefore, behold, I will give thee to the sons of the east for a possession, that they may pitch their tent-villages in thee, and erect their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruits, and they shall drink thy milk. <a href="/ezekiel/25-5.htm">Ezekiel 25:5</a>. And Rabbah will I make a camel-ground, and the sons of Ammon a resting-place for flocks; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. <a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a>. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thou hast clapped thy hand, and stamped with thy foot, and hast rejoiced in soul with all thy contempt concerning the house of Israel, <a href="/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a>. Therefore, behold, I will stretch out my hand against thee, and give thee to the nations for booty, and cut thee off from the peoples, and exterminate thee from the lands; I will destroy thee, that thou mayst learn that I am Jehovah. - In <a href="/ezekiel/21-28.htm">Ezekiel 21:28</a>., when predicting the expedition of Nebuchadnezzar against Jerusalem, Ezekiel had already foretold the destruction of the Ammonites, so that these verses are simply a resumption and confirmation of the earlier prophecy. In the passage referred to, Ezekiel, like Zephaniah before him (<a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>), mentions their reviling of the people of God as the sin for which they are to be punished with destruction. This reviling, in which their hatred of the divine calling of Israel found vent, was the radical sin of Ammon. On the occasion of Judah's fall, it rose even to contemptuous and malicious joy at the profanation of the sanctuary of Jehovah by the destruction of the temple (a comparison with <a href="/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a> will show that this is the sense in which &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is to be understood), at the devastation of the land of Israel, and at the captivity of Judah, - in other words, at the destruction of the religious and political existence of Israel as the people of God. The profanation of the sanctuary is mentioned first, to intimate that the hostility to Israel, manifested by the Ammonites on every occasion that presented itself (for proofs, see the comm. on <a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a>), had its roots not so much in national antipathies, as in antagonism to the sacred calling of Israel. As a punishment for this, they are not only to lose their land (<a href="/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/25-5.htm">Ezekiel 25:5</a>), but to be cut off from the number of the nations (<a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a>). The Lord will give up their land, with its productions, for a possession to the sons of the east, i.e., according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13-18</a>, to the Arabs, the Bedouins (for &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, see the comm. on <a href="/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a> and <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). The Piel &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, although only occurring here, is not to be rejected as critically suspicious, and to be changed into Kal, as Hitzig proposes. The Kal would be unsuitable, because the subject of the sentence can only be &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, and not &#1496;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; in the Kal has an intransitive sense. For &#1496;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, tent-villages of nomads, see the comm. on <a href="/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, dwellings, are the separate tents of the shepherds. In the last clauses of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4</a>, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is repeated for the sake of emphasis; and Hitzig's opinion, that the first &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; corresponds to the subject in the clause '&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, the second to that in &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, is to be rejected as a marvellous flight of imagination, which approaches absurdity in the assertion that &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; signifies the folds, i.e., the animals, of the land. Along with the fruit of the land, i.e., the produce of the soil, milk is also mentioned as a production of pastoral life, and the principal food of nomads. On the wealth of the Ammonites in flocks and herds, see <a href="/judges/6-5.htm">Judges 6:5</a>. The words are addressed to Ammon, as a land or kingdom, and hence the feminine suffix. The capital will also share the fate of the land. Rabbah (see the comm. on <a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>) will become a camel-ground, a waste spot where camels lie down and feed. This has been almost literally fulfilled. The ruins of Ammn are deserted by men, and Seetzen found Arabs with their camels not far off (vid., von Raumer, Palestine, p. 268). In the parallel clause, the sons of Ammon, i.e., the Ammonites, are mentioned instead of their land.<p>In <a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a>, the Lord announces to the nation of the Ammonites the destruction that awaits them, and reiterates with still stronger emphasis the sin which occasioned it, namely, the malicious delight they had manifested at Israel's fall. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1496;&#1498; is strengthened by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;: with all thy contempt in the soul, i.e., with all the contempt which thy soul could cherish. In <a href="/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a> the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.. &#1500;&#1489;&#1490; occasions some difficulty. The Keri has substituted &#1500;&#1489;&#1494;, for booty for the nations (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/26-5.htm">Ezekiel 26:5</a>); and all the ancient versions have adopted this. Consequently &#1489;&#1468;&#1490; might be a copyist's error for &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;; and in support of this the circumstance might be adduced, that in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>, where &#1490;&#1468;&#1492; stands for &#1494;&#1492;, we have unquestionably a substitution of &#1490; for &#1494;. But if the Chetib &#1489;&#1494; be correct, the word is to be explained - as it has been by Benfey (Die Montasnamen, p. 194) and Gildemeister (in Lassen's Zeitschrift fr die Kunde des Morgenlandes, iv. 1, p. 213ff.) - from the Sanscrit bha equals ga, pars, portio, and has passed into the Semitic languages from the Aryan, like the Syriac bagaa', esca, which P. Boetticher (Horae aram. p. 21) has correctly traced to the Sanscrit bhaj, conquere. - The executors of the judgment are not named; for the threat that God will give up the land of the Ammonites to the Bedouins for their possession, does not imply that they are to exterminate the Ammonites. On the contrary, a comparison of this passage with <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13-15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1-5</a>, where the Ammonites are threatened not only with the devastation of their land, but also with transportation into exile, will show that the Chaldeans are to be thought of as executing the judgment. (See the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/25-11.htm">Ezekiel 25:11</a>.) </body></html>
