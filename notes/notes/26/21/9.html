It is <span class="ital">sharpened, </span>that it may cut, and wound, and make sore slaughter.

It shall be a kind of <span class="ital">flaming sword. </span>Though the glory of God’s justice may seem to have been eclipsed for a while, (like a sword rusting in the scabbard,) during the day of his patience, and the delay of his judgments; yet it will shine out again, and be made to glitter. 3. It is a victorious sword, nothing shall stand before it. <span class="ital">It contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree — </span>It makes no distinction between the sceptre and common wood; between the branches of the royal family, descended from David and Solomon, (who were honoured with the title of <span class="ital">God’s sons,</span>) and the meanest of the people. This seems to be the meaning of the clause, provided our translation be just; but it is rendered very differently in some other versions. The Vulgate reads, <span class="ital">Qui moves sceptrum filii mei, succidisti omne lignum, Thou who removest the sceptre of my son, hast cut down every tree; </span>which Capellus understands of Nebuchadnezzar, who took away the sceptre, and overturned the kingdom.

It is declared that the Lord was about to cut off Jerusalem and the whole land, that all might know it was his decree against a wicked and rebellious people. It behoves those who denounce the awful wrath of God against sinners, to show that they do not desire the woful day. The example of Christ teaches us to lament over those whose ruin we declare. Whatever instruments God uses in executing his judgments, he will strengthen them according to the service they are employed in. The sword glitters to the terror of those against whom it is drawn. It is a sword to others, a rod to the people of the Lord.

Deliver out the following prophecy in the name of the Lord: <p>say, a sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished; it is not only drawn out of its sheath, as before, but is made sharp and bright, and ready for use. It is repeated, either to show the certainty of it, or to express the terror and anguish of mind on account of it; persons in distress generally repeating that which is the occasion of it. The Targum interprets it of two swords, the sword of the Babylonians, and the sword of the Ammonites; first the one was to be used, and then the other: this latter, Jarchi and Kimchi observe, was fulfilled by Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slaying Gedaliah, sent for that purpose by Baalis king of the Ammonites, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-14.htm">Jeremiah 40:14</a>, but if two distinct swords are meant, I should rather think the sword of the Chaldeans, and the sword of the Romans, are intended. Cocceius, before observed, interprets it only of the latter; but Abendana both of the sword of the king of Babylon, and of the sword of the Romans. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Burning Forest<p><a href="/ezekiel/20-45.htm">Ezekiel 20:45</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/20-46.htm">Ezekiel 20:46</a>. Son of man, direct thy face toward the south, and trickle down towards the south, and prophesy concerning the forest of the field in the south land; <a href="/ezekiel/20-47.htm">Ezekiel 20:47</a>. And say to the forest of the south land, Hear the word of Jehovah; Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I kindle a fire in thee, which will consume in thee every green tree, and every dry tree: the blazing flame will not be extinguished, and all faces from the south to the north will be burned thereby. <a href="/ezekiel/20-48.htm">Ezekiel 20:48</a>. And all flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it: it shall not be extinguished. <a href="/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>. And I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! they say of me, Does he not speak in parables? - The prophet is to turn his face toward the south, and prophesy concerning the forest of the field there. &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507; is used for prophesying, as in <a href="/amos/7-16.htm">Amos 7:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a>, <a href="/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>. The distinction between the three epithets applied to the south is the following: &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503; is literally that which lies on the right hand, hence the south is a particular quarter of the heavens; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, which only occurs in Ezekiel and Ecclesiastes, with the exception of <a href="/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-17.htm">Job 37:17</a>, is derived from &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;, to shine or emit streams of light, and probably signifies the brilliant quarter; &#1504;&#1490;&#1489;, the dry, parched land, is a standing epithet for the southern district of Palestine and the land of Judah (see the comm. on <a href="/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>). - The forest of the field in the south is a figure denoting the kingdom of Judah (&#1504;&#1490;&#1489; is in apposition to &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, and is appended to it as a more precise definition). &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; is not used here for a field, as distinguished from a city or a garden; but for the fields in the sense of country or territory, as in <a href="/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a> and <a href="/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-47.htm">Ezekiel 20:47</a>, &#1497;&#1506;&#1512; , forest of the south land, is the expression applied to the same object (&#1492;&#1504;&#1490;&#1489;, with the article, is a geographical term for the southern portion of Palestine). The forest is a figure signifying the population, or the mass of people. Individual men are trees. The green tree is a figurative representation of the righteous man, and the dry tree of the ungodly (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a>, compare <a href="/luke/23-31.htm">Luke 23:31</a>). The fire which Jehovah kindles is the fire of war. The combination of the synonyms &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;, flame of the flaming brightness, serves to strengthen the expression, and is equivalent to the strongest possible flame, the blazing fire. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, all faces are not human faces or persons, in which case the prophet would have dropped the figure; but pa&#770;nim denotes generally the outside of things, which is the first to feel the force of the flame. "All the faces" of the forest are every single thing in the forest, which is caught at once by the flame. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-4.htm">Ezekiel 21:4</a>, ko&#774;l-pa&#770;nim (all faces) is interpreted by ko&#774;l&#775;-ba&#770;sar (all flesh). From south to north, i.e., through the whole length of the land. From the terrible fierceness of the fire, which cannot be extinguished, every one will know that God has kindled it, that it has been sent in judgment. The words of the prophet himself, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>, presuppose that he has uttered these parabolic words in the hearing of the people, and that they have ridiculed them as obscure (ma&#770;sha&#770;l is used here in the sense of obscure language, words difficult to understand, as &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; also is in <a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10</a>). At the same time, it contains within itself request that they may be explained. This request is granted; and the simile is first of all interpreted in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-1.htm">Ezekiel 21:1-7</a>, and then still further expanded in <a href="/ezekiel/21-8.htm">Ezekiel 21:8</a>. </body></html>
