The actual separation in God’s sight between the righteous and the wicked has already been plainly set forth in 9:4-6.

It is declared that the Lord was about to cut off Jerusalem and the whole land, that all might know it was his decree against a wicked and rebellious people. It behoves those who denounce the awful wrath of God against sinners, to show that they do not desire the woful day. The example of Christ teaches us to lament over those whose ruin we declare. Whatever instruments God uses in executing his judgments, he will strengthen them according to the service they are employed in. The sword glitters to the terror of those against whom it is drawn. It is a sword to others, a rod to the people of the Lord. God is in earnest in pronouncing this sentence, and the prophet must show himself in earnest in publishing it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The first word of judgment <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-1.htm">Ezekiel 21:1-7</a>.

Ezekiel here views the mere outward aspect of the indiscriminate universality of the national calamity. But really the same captivity to the "righteous" would prove a blessing as a wholesome discipline, which to the "wicked" would be an unmitigated punishment. The godly were sealed with a mark (Eze 9:4), not for outward exemption from the common calamity, but as marked for the secret interpositions of Providence, overruling even evil to their good. The godly were by comparison so few, that not their salvation but the universality of the judgment is brought into view here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Publish it to all the people of the land, if any will consider it; it is not the severe and morose conjecture of a disturbed and injured man, let them know God the Lord speaks it.

The Targum is, <p>"I will remove out of thee thy righteous ones, that I may destroy thy wicked ones.'' <p>Some think that only such who were righteous in appearance, or in their own sight, are here meant.

Ye then, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Go ye, serve every one his idols! but afterwards - truly ye will hearken to me, and no longer desecrate my holy name with your sacrificial gifts and your idols, <a href="/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a>. But upon my holy mountain, upon the high mountain of Israel, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, there will all the house of Israel serve me, the whole of it in the land; there will I accept them gladly; there will I ask for your heave-offerings and the first-fruits of your gifts in all that ye make holy. <a href="/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41</a>. As a pleasant odour will I accept you gladly, when I bring you out from the nations, and gather you out of the lands, in which you have been scattered, and sanctify myself in you before the eyes of the heathen nations. <a href="/ezekiel/20-42.htm">Ezekiel 20:42</a>. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land which I lifted up my hand to give to your fathers; <a href="/ezekiel/20-43.htm">Ezekiel 20:43</a>. And there ye will think of your ways and your deeds, with which ye have defiled yourselves, and will loathe yourselves (lit., experience loathing before yourselves) on account of all your evil deeds. which ye have performed; <a href="/ezekiel/20-44.htm">Ezekiel 20:44</a>. And ye will know that I am Jehovah, when I deal with you for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways and according to your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, is the saying of Jehovah. - After the Lord has declared to the people that He will prevent its being absorbed into the heathen world, and will exterminate the ungodly by severe judgments, the address passes on, with the direction henceforth to serve idols only, to a prediction of the eventual conversion, and the restoration to Canaan of the purified nation. The direction, "Go ye, serve every one his idols," contains, after what precedes it, a powerful appeal to repent. God thereby gives up the impenitent to do whatever they will, having first of all told them that not one of them will come into the land of Canaan. Their opposition will not frustrate His plan of salvation. The words which follow from &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512; onwards have been interpreted in different ways. It is opposed to the usage of the language to connect &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512; with &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, serve ye hereafter also (De Wette, etc.), for &#1493; has not the force of the Latin et  equals  etiam, and still less does it signify "afterwards just as before." Nor is it allowable to connect &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512; closely with what follows, in the sense of "and hereafter also, if ye will hearken to me, profane ye my name no more" (Rosenmller, Maurer). For if &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; were used as an imperative, either it would have to stand at the beginning of the sentence, or it would be preceded by &#1488;&#1500; instead of &#1500;&#1488;. Moreover, the antithesis between not being willing to hear and not profaning the name of God, is imported arbitrarily into the text. The name of the Lord is profaned not only by sacrifices offered in external form to Jehovah and in the heart to idols, but also by disobedience to the word and commandments of God. It is much better to take &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512; by itself, and to render the following particle, &#1488;&#1501;, as the ordinary sign of an oath: "but afterwards (i.e., in the future)...verily, ye will hearken to me;" that is to say, ye will have been converted from your idolatry through the severe judgments that have fallen upon you. The ground for this thought is introduced in <a href="/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a> by a reference to the fact that all Israel will then serve the Lord upon His holy mountain. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is not "used emphatically before a direct address" (Hitzig), but has a causal signification. For '&#1492;&#1512; &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;, see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>. In the expression "all Israel," which is rendered more emphatic by the addition of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, there is an allusion to the eventual termination of the severance of the people of God (compare <a href="/ezekiel/37-22.htm">Ezekiel 37:22</a>). Then will the Lord accept with delight both them and their sacrificial gifts. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, heave-offerings (see the comm. on <a href="/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a> and <a href="/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>), used here in the broader sense of all the sacrificial gifts, along with which the gifts of first-fruits are specially named. &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, as applied to holy offerings in the sense of &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, belongs to the later usage of the language. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, consisting of all your consecrated gifts. &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="/leviticus/22-15.htm">Leviticus 22:15</a>. This promise includes implicite the bringing back of Israel from its banishment. This is expressly mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41</a>; but even there it is only introduced as self-evident in the subordinate clause, whereas the cheerful acceptance of Israel on the part of God constitutes the leading thought.<p>&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1495;, as an odour of delight (&#1489;, the so-called Beth essentiae), will God accept His people. &#1512;&#1497;&#1495; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1495;, odour of satisfaction, is the technical expression for the cheerful (well-pleased) acceptance of the sacrifice, or rather of the feelings of the worshipper presenting the sacrifice, which ascend to God in the sacrificial odour (see the comm. on <a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>). The thought therefore is the following: When God shall eventually gather His people out of their dispersion, He will accept them as a sacrifice well-pleasing to Him, and direct all His good pleasure towards them. &#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1499;&#1501; does not mean, I shall be sanctified through you, and is not to be explained in the same sense as <a href="/leviticus/22-32.htm">Leviticus 22:32</a> (Rosenmller), for &#1489; is not equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498;; but it signifies "I will sanctify myself on you," as in <a href="/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>, and other passages, where &#1504;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; is construed with &#1489; pers. (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/39-27.htm">Ezekiel 39:27</a>), in the sense of proving oneself holy, mostly by judgment, but here through having made Israel into a holy nation by the refining judgment, and one to which He can therefore grant the promised inheritance. - <a href="/ezekiel/20-42.htm">Ezekiel 20:42</a>. Then will Israel also recognise its God in His grace, and be ashamed of its former sins. For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-43.htm">Ezekiel 20:43</a>, compare <a href="/ezekiel/6-9.htm">Ezekiel 6:9</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/16-61.htm">Ezekiel 16:61</a>. - With regard to the fulfilment, as Kliefoth has correctly observed, "in the prediction contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32-38</a>, the whole of the searching judgments, by which God would lead Israel to conversion, are summed up in one, which includes not only the Babylonian captivity, the nearest and the first, but the still more remote judgment, namely, the present dispersion; for it is only in the present dispersion of Israel that God has really taken it into the wilderness of the nations, just as it was only in the rejection of Christ that its rebellious attitude was fully manifested. And as the prophecy of the state of punishment combines in this way both the nearer and more remote; so are both the nearer and more distant combined in what <a href="/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a> to 44 affirm with regard to the ultimate fate of Israel." The gathering of Israel from among the heathen will be fulfilled in its conversion to Christ, and hitherto it has only taken place in very small beginnings. The principal fulfilment is still to come, when Israel, as a nation, shall be converted to Christ. With regard to the bringing back of the people into "the land of Israel," see the comm. on <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37</a>, where this promise is more fully expanded. </body></html>
