Gebal, the ancient Byblos, the modern Gébeil, and the Gu-ba-lu of the Assyrian inscriptions, was a famous Phœnician town just north of Beirût. Its site is still rich in ruins. Its people were famous builders, and according to the margin of <a href="/1_kings/5-18.htm" title="And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.">1Kings 5:18</a> (so also the Septuagint and Vulgate) were employed by Solomon on the work of the Temple. The representation is that the whole widely-dispersed Phœnician race were tributary to the works of Tyre. At this point the figure of the ship gives place for a time to plain language, the better to set forth the military resources and power of this great city.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they are not prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gebal - i. e., Byblos (modern Gebeil) in Phoenicia, the chief seat of the worship of Adonis, and situated on an eminence over-looking the river Adonis, north of Beirut, not far from the Mediterranean sea.

A promontory of the Phoenicians, the same with the Gabale of Pliny (n), and with the land of the Giblites, <a href="/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>. It was by the Greeks called Byblus; and so the Septuagint here render the words, the elders of Bybli or Byblus, a place once famous for the birth and temple of Adonis; it is now called Gibyle. Mr. Maundrell (o) says it is pleasantly situated by the seaside, and that at present it contains but a little extent of ground, yet more than enough for the small number of its inhabitants; it is compassed with a dry ditch, and a wall with square towers in it, at about every forty yards' distance; on its south side it has an old castle; within it is a church; besides which it has nothing remarkable; though anciently it was a place of no mean extent, as well as beauty, as may appear from the many heaps of ruins, and the fine pillars that are scattered up and down in the gardens near the town. The old experienced workmen of this place were employed by the Tyrians in mending and refitting their ships, and in the caulking of them, as follows: <p>the wise men thereof were in thee thy caulkers; or, "the strengtheners of thy breaches" (p), or "chinks"; the seams and commissures of the planks; which they stopped with tow, oakum, or such like stuff; at least this is what is used now, whatever might be by those wise men; and it seems by this that it was reckoned a very great art and mystery, and which only wise men were masters of, at least such the Tyrians employed. The Targum renders it, <p>"providing thy necessaries;'' <p>as if they were the ships' husbands: <p>all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise; ships from all parts were in her harbours, which brought goods into her, and carried goods out of her, by way of merchandise. So the Targum, <p>"all that go down into the sea, and the ships; they were rowers, and they brought merchandise into the midst of thee;'' <p>the goods of merchants from divers places; and carried back commodities again they traded for at Tyre; see <a href="/revelation/18-19.htm">Revelation 18:19</a>. <p>(n) Nat.

The word is used in the sense of "elders" or "senators," the governing body. Gebal, for which the LXX. gives <span class="accented">Biblii</span>, is identified with the Greek Byblus.

The work of the <span class="cmt_word">caulkers</span> was to stop the chinks of the ship, and the men of Gebal appear to have been especially skilful in this.

Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Tyre, Will not the islands tremble at the noise of thy fall, at the groaning of the wounded, at the slaughter in the midst of thee? <a href="/ezekiel/26-16.htm">Ezekiel 26:16</a>. And all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and will lay aside their robes and take off their embroidered clothes, and dress themselves in terrors, sit upon the earth, and they will tremble every moment, and be astonished at thee. <a href="/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a>. They will raise a lamentation for thee, and say to thee: How hast thou perished, thou who wast inhabited from out of the sea, thou renowned city, she who was mighty upon the sea, she and her inhabitants, who inspired all her inhabitants with fear of her! <a href="/ezekiel/26-18.htm">Ezekiel 26:18</a>. Now do the islands tremble on the day of thy fall, and the islands in the sea are confounded at thy departure. - &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, nonne, has the force of a direct affirmation. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, the noise of the fall, stands for the tidings of the noise, since the noise itself could not be heard upon the islands. The fall takes place, as is added for the purpose of depicting the terrible nature of the event, at or amidst the groaning of the wounded, and the slaughter in the midst of thee. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1490; is the infinitive Niphal, with the accent drawn back on account of the following Milel, and should be pointed &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1490; . The word &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, islands, is frequently used so as to embrace the coast lands of the Mediterranean Sea; we have therefore to understand it here as applied to the Phoenician colonies on the islands and coasts of that sea. The "princes of the sea" are not kings of the islands, but, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-8.htm">Isaiah 23:8</a>, the merchants presiding over the colonies of Tyre, who resembled princes. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, not royal thrones, but chairs, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-13.htm">1 Samuel 4:13</a>, etc. The picture of their mourning recalls the description in <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>; it is not derived from that passage, however, but is an independent description of the mourning customs which commonly prevailed among princes. The antithesis introduced as a very striking one: clothing themselves in terrors, putting on terrors in the place of the robes of state which they have laid aside (see the similar trope in <a href="/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a>). The thought is rendered still more forcible by the closing sentences of the verse: they tremble &#1500;&#1512;&#1504;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, by moments, i.e., as the moments return - actually, therefore, "every moment" (vid., <a href="/isaiah/27-3.htm">Isaiah 27:3</a>). - In the lamentation which they raise (<a href="/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a>), they give prominence to the alarming revolution of all things, occasioned by the fact that the mistress of the seas, once so renowned, has now become an object of horror and alarm. &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, inhabited from the seas. This is not to be taken as equivalent to "as far as the seas," in the sense of, whose inhabitants spread over the seas and settle there, as Gesenius (Thes.) and Hvernick suppose; for being inhabited is the very opposite of sending the inhabitants abroad. If &#1502;&#1503; were to be taken in the geographical sense of direction or locality, the meaning of the expression could only be, whose inhabitants spring from the seas, or have migrated thither from all seas; but this would not apply to the population of Tyre, which did not consists of men of all nations under heaven. Hitzig has given the correct interpretation, namely, from the sea, or out of the seas, which had as it were ascended as an inhabited city out of the bosom of the sea. It is not easy to explain the last clause of <a href="/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a> : who inspired all her inhabitants with their terror, or with terror of them (of themselves); for if the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is taken in connection with the preceding &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;, the thought arises that the inhabitants of Tyre inspired her inhabitants, i.e., themselves, with their terror, or terror of themselves. Kimchi, Rosenmller, Ewald, Kliefoth, and others, have therefore proposed to take the suffix in the second &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; as referring to &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; ot gnirre, all the inhabitants of the sea, i.e., all her colonies. But this is open to the objection, that not only is &#1497;&#1501; of the masculine gender, but it is extremely harsh to take the same suffix attached to the two &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; as referring to different subjects. We must therefore take the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; and the suffix in &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; as both referring to &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;: the city with its population inspired all its several inhabitants with fear or itself. This is not to be understood, however, as signifying that the inhabitants of Tyre kept one another in a state of terror and alarm; but that the city with its population, through its power upon the sea, inspired all the several inhabitants with fear of this its might, inasmuch as the distinction of the city and its population was reflected upon every individual citizen. This explanation of the words is confirmed by the parallel passages in <a href="/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a>. - This city had come to so appalling an end, that all the islands trembled thereat. The two hemistichs in <a href="/ezekiel/26-18.htm">Ezekiel 26:18</a> are synonymous, and the thought returns by way of conclusion to <a href="/ezekiel/26-15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15</a>. &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; has the Aramaean form of the plural, which is sometimes met with even in the earlier poetry (vid., Ewald, 177a). &#1510;&#1488;&#1514;, departure, i.e., destruction. </body></html>
