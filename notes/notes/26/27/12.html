Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The thread broken at <a href="/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8</a> is taken up, and the various nations are enumerated which traded with Tyre.<p><a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a><p>Tarshish - Tartessus in Spain (marginal references).

Some understand this of the sea, which is sometimes called Tarshish; so Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it here: and the Targum, <p>"from the sea, or they of the sea bring merchandise into the midst of thee:'' <p>that is, those who lived upon the coasts, or on the isles, of the Mediterranean sea. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions, render it the Carthaginians, who were a colony of the Tyrians, and no doubt traded with them; but it seems most likely, with others, to intend Tartessus in Spain, a place not far from that where Cadiz now stands; a country which abounded with riches, and with the following things: <p>with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs; Pliny (t) says, that almost all Spain abounded in metals of lead, iron, brass, silver, and gold; which takes in the several things here mentioned, excepting tin; and that the Spaniards might have from our Cornwall, which they might import into Tyre: though the Phoenicians carried on a commerce with our isle of Britain themselves, whither they came for tin, and disposed of other goods they brought with them. Gussetius (u) observes, that the word does not signify the place of trade and traffic, as it is commonly rendered; but respects the goods traded in, and the manner of trafficking with them, by way of "exchange", as the word should be rendered; and the sense is, that the things before mentioned were what they gave in exchange, battered, and "left", with the Tyrians, for other goods they took of them; and so it is to be understood in all the following places where the word is used. So Ben Melech says it is expressive of merchandise. <p>(t) Nat. Hist. l. 3. c. 3.((u) Ebr.

The name Tarshish (Tartessus) was given to the district of country lying outside the Straits of Gibraltar on the lower Baetis, the Guadalquiver (Wadi el Kebîr, great river).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with silver … in thy fairs</span>] Rather apparently: <span class="bld">silver … they brought as thy wares.</span> There is no evidence that the word means “fairs;” in <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-27.htm" title="Your riches, and your fairs, your merchandise, your mariners, and your pilots, your caulkers, and the occupiers of your merchandise, and all your men of war, that are in you, and in all your company which is in the middle of you, shall fall into the middle of the seas in the day of your ruin.">Ezekiel 27:27</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-34.htm" title="In the time when you shall be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters your merchandise and all your company in the middle of you shall fall.">Ezekiel 27:34</a></span> the things so named fall into the waters of the sea. The representation is that all things brought to Tyre were hers, the nations offered them to her as tribute (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm" title="The men of Dedan were your merchants; many isles were the merchandise of your hand: they brought you for a present horns of ivory and ebony.">Ezekiel 27:15</a></span>). Spain was famous for the metals mentioned; cf. for silver, <a href="/jeremiah/10-9.htm" title="Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.">Jeremiah 10:9</a>. Probably Tarshish served as an entrepôt for such products found further north, as in the Cassiterides (Scilly Islands) and Cornwall.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">12–25</span>. The market of Tyre<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Several things are to be observed in this passage: 1. The representation is not that Tyre is traded with by the nations, though this is the fact lying under the figures employed. The nations are not customers of Tyre. Tyre neither buys nor sells, nor does she exchange one article for another. The nations are <span class="ital">her</span> merchants, who bring to her wares from every land; or they are her dependents, and the merchandise which they bring is a tribute which they render her (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm" title="The men of Dedan were your merchants; many isles were the merchandise of your hand: they brought you for a present horns of ivory and ebony.">Ezekiel 27:15</a></span>). They are her subjects, ministering to her luxury, bringing wares to her, and enriching her. The counterpart to this idea is that she enriches many peoples by bestowing her wealth upon them (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-33.htm" title="When your wares went forth out of the seas, you filled many people; you did enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise.">Ezekiel 27:33</a></span>). 2. The passage is artistic. Two words are employed for “to trade,” “to be a merchant.” The words have little difference of sense and are generally used alternately, e.g. one word in <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm" title="Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in your fairs.">Ezekiel 27:12</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/27-15.htm" title="The men of Dedan were your merchants; many isles were the merchandise of your hand: they brought you for a present horns of ivory and ebony....">Ezekiel 27:15-16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-18.htm" title="Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.">Ezekiel 27:18</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-21.htm" title="Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with you in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they your merchants.">Ezekiel 27:21</a></span>, the other in <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-13.htm" title="Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in your market.">Ezekiel 27:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm" title="The men of Dedan were your merchants; many isles were the merchandise of your hand: they brought you for a present horns of ivory and ebony.">Ezekiel 27:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-17.htm" title="Judah, and the land of Israel, they were your merchants: they traded in your market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.">Ezekiel 27:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-20.htm" title="Dedan was your merchant in precious clothes for chariots.">Ezekiel 27:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-22.htm" title="The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants: they occupied in your fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.">Ezekiel 27:22</a></span> <span class="ital">seq</span>. Two words also are used in the sense of <span class="ital">wares</span> or goods, though hardly differing in meaning. These also are used alternately so as to diversify the phraseology, e.g. the one in <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm" title="Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in your fairs.">Ezekiel 27:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-14.htm" title="They of the house of Togarmah traded in your fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.">Ezekiel 27:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-16.htm" title="Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of your making: they occupied in your fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.">Ezekiel 27:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-18.htm" title="Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.">Ezekiel 27:18</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-22.htm" title="The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants: they occupied in your fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.">Ezekiel 27:22</a></span>, the other in <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-13.htm" title="Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in your market.">Ezekiel 27:13</a></span> (15), 17, 19, with other variants of the same sense. Gesen. attributed various senses to these words, as: 1, traffic, trading, 2, fair, market-place, and 3, gain, wealth. The words do not appear to differ in meaning, and neither of the two probably has any other sense than the general one of wares. 3. Again, the language is diversified by the adoption of a variety of constructions. The word “give,” which receives an extraordinary extension of usage in Ez. and in later Heb. in general (cf. its use in the Apocalypse), is employed in the sense of put, bring, render, &c. That it ever means to “sell” (Ges.) is without evidence. The various constructions employed are seen in <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm" title="Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in your fairs.">Ezekiel 27:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-22.htm" title="The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants: they occupied in your fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.">Ezekiel 27:22</a></span> (acc. and prep. <span class="ital">b</span>, cf <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-13.htm" title="Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in your market.">Ezekiel 27:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-17.htm" title="Judah, and the land of Israel, they were your merchants: they traded in your market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.">Ezekiel 27:17</a></span>); in <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-16.htm" title="Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of your making: they occupied in your fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.">Ezekiel 27:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-18.htm" title="Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.">Ezekiel 27:18</a></span> (double prep. <span class="ital">b</span>), and in <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-14.htm" title="They of the house of Togarmah traded in your fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.">Ezekiel 27:14</a></span> (double accus.). These different constructions probably all express the same general meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is much uncertainty in the text, e.g. for “sons of Dedan,” <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm" title="The men of Dedan were your merchants; many isles were the merchandise of your hand: they brought you for a present horns of ivory and ebony.">Ezekiel 27:15</a></span>, LXX. reads, sons of the Rhodians, and for Aram (Syria) <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-16.htm" title="Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of your making: they occupied in your fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.">Ezekiel 27:16</a></span>, Syriac reads Edom (so LXX. “man”), in both cases by interchange of the similar letters <span class="ital">d</span> and <span class="ital">r</span>. <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-19.htm" title="Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in your fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in your market.">Ezekiel 27:19</a></span> is certainly out of order, and <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/27-24.htm" title="These were your merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among your merchandise.">Ezekiel 27:24</a></span> exceedingly obscure. Owing to these obscurities the precise order followed in the enumeration of the nations is involved in some uncertainty. 1. <span class="ital">vv</span>, 12–14, the prophet names the nations lying in the widest circle around Tyre, beginning with the furthest west, Tarshish (Spain), and pursuing a line along the north, Javan (Ionia), Tubal (N. of Asia Minor), and Togarmah (Armenia). 2.

The description of the city is followed by a <span class="accented">catalogue raisonnee</span> of the countries with which she traded. Here we are on more certain ground, there being a general consensus that Tarshish, the Greek Tartessus, indicates the coast of Spain, which was pre-eminent in the ancient world for the metals named (<a href="/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>). The ships of Tarshish (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-16.htm">Isaiah 2:16</a>) were the larger merchant-vessels that were made for this distant traffic.

For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, When I make thee a desolate city, like the cities which are no longer inhabited, when I cause the deep to rise over thee, so that the many waters cover thee, <a href="/ezekiel/26-20.htm">Ezekiel 26:20</a>. I cast thee down to those who have gone into the grave, to the people of olden time, and cause thee to dwell in the land of the lower regions, in the ruins from the olden time, with those who have gone into the grave, that thou mayest be no longer inhabited, and I create that which is glorious in the land of the living. <a href="/ezekiel/26-21.htm">Ezekiel 26:21</a>. I make thee a terror, and thou art no more; they will seek thee, and find thee no more for ever, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - Not only will ruin and desolation come upon Tyre, but it will sink for ever into the region of the dead. In this concluding thought the whole threat is summed up. The infinitive clauses of <a href="/ezekiel/26-19.htm">Ezekiel 26:19</a> recapitulate the leading thoughts of the previous strophes, for the purpose of appending the closing thought of banishment to the under-world. By the rising of the deep we are to understand, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-12.htm">Ezekiel 26:12</a>, that the city in its ruins will be sunk into the depths of the sea. &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; , those who go down into the pit or grave, are the dead. They are described still further as &#1506;&#1501; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, not "those who are sleeping the long sleep of death," or the generation of old whom all must join; but the people of the "old world" before the flood (<a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>), who were buried by the waters of the flood, in accordance with <a href="//biblehub.com/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15</a>, where &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; denotes the generations of the primeval world, and after the analogy of the use of &#1506;&#1501; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-7.htm">Isaiah 44:7</a>, to describe the human race as existing from time immemorial.<p>In harmony with this, &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;  are the ruins of the primeval world which perished in the flood. As &#1506;&#1501; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; adds emphasis to the idea of &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, so also does &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; to that of &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;. Tyre shall not only descend to the dead in Sheol, but be thrust down to the people of the dead, who were sunk into the depths of the earth by the waters of the flood, and shall there receive its everlasting dwelling-place among the ruins of the primeval world which was destroyed by the flood, beside that godless race of the olden time. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, land of the lowest places (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-18.htm">Ezekiel 32:18</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>), is a periphrasis for Sheol, the region of the dead (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>, "the lower parts of the earth"). On '&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1510;&#1489;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; Hitzig has observed with perfect correctness: "If we retain the pointing as the first person, with which the place assigned to the Athnach (-) coincides, we must at any rate not regard the clause as still dependent upon &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, and the force of the &#1500;&#1488; as continued. We should then have to take the clause as independent and affirmative, as the accentuators and the Targum have done." But as this would give rise to a discrepancy between the two halves of the verse, Hitzig proposes to alter &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; retla ot seso into the second person &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, so that the clause would still be governed by &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1500;&#1488;. But the want of agreement between the two halves of the verse does not warrant an alteration of the text, especially if it lead to nothing better than the forced rendering adopted by Hitzig, "and thou no longer shinest with glory in the land of the living," which there is nothing in the language to justify. And even the explanation proposed by Hvernick and Kliefoth, "that I no longer produce anything glorious from thee (Tyre) in the land of the living," is open to this objection, that "from thee" is arbitrarily interpolated into the text; and if this were what Ezekiel meant, he would either have added &#1500;&#1498; or written &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498;. Moreover, the change of the person is a sufficient objection to our taking &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; as dependent upon &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, and supplying &#1500;&#1488;. &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is evidently a simple continuation of &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498;. And nothing but the weightiest objections should lead us to give up a view which so naturally suggests itself. But no such objections exist. Neither the want of harmony between the two halves of the verse, nor the context, - according to which Tyre and its destruction are referred to both before and immediately after, - forces us to the adoption of explanations at variance with the simple meaning of the words. We therefore adhere to the natural interpretation of the words, "and I set (establish) glory in the land of the living;" and understand by the land of the living, not the theocracy especially, but the earth, in contrast to the region of the dead. The words contain the general thought, that on and after the overthrow of the glory of the ungodly power of the world, He will create that which is glorious on the earth to endure for ever; and this He really does by the establishing of His kingdom. - Tyre, on the contrary, shall become, through its fate, an object of terror, or an example of sudden destruction, and pass away with all its glory, not leaving a trace behind.
