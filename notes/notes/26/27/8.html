Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Arvad - See <a href="/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>.

Mr. Maundrell (g) says it is about a league distant from the shore; and is now called by the Turks Ruad. It seemed to the eye to be not above four to six hundred yards long, and wholly filled up with tall buildings like castles: its ancient inhabitants, he observes, were famous for navigation, and had a command upon the continent as far as Gabale later mentioned, Dr. Shaw (h) says it is at present called Rouwadde; and that the prospect of it from the continent is wonderfully magnificent; promising at a distance a continued train of fine buildings and impregnable fortifications; but this is entirely owing to the height and rockiness of its situation; for at present all the strength and beauty it can boast of lies in a weak unfortified castle, with a few small cannon to defend it; so that the prophecy of Jeremiah appears to be fulfilled, <p>Arpad is confounded, <a href="/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>.

Now do the islands tremble on the day of thy fall, and the islands in the sea are confounded at thy departure. - &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, nonne, has the force of a direct affirmation. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, the noise of the fall, stands for the tidings of the noise, since the noise itself could not be heard upon the islands. The fall takes place, as is added for the purpose of depicting the terrible nature of the event, at or amidst the groaning of the wounded, and the slaughter in the midst of thee. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1490; is the infinitive Niphal, with the accent drawn back on account of the following Milel, and should be pointed &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1490; . The word &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, islands, is frequently used so as to embrace the coast lands of the Mediterranean Sea; we have therefore to understand it here as applied to the Phoenician colonies on the islands and coasts of that sea. The "princes of the sea" are not kings of the islands, but, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-8.htm">Isaiah 23:8</a>, the merchants presiding over the colonies of Tyre, who resembled princes. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, not royal thrones, but chairs, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-13.htm">1 Samuel 4:13</a>, etc. The picture of their mourning recalls the description in <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>; it is not derived from that passage, however, but is an independent description of the mourning customs which commonly prevailed among princes. The antithesis introduced as a very striking one: clothing themselves in terrors, putting on terrors in the place of the robes of state which they have laid aside (see the similar trope in <a href="/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a>). The thought is rendered still more forcible by the closing sentences of the verse: they tremble &#1500;&#1512;&#1504;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, by moments, i.e., as the moments return - actually, therefore, "every moment" (vid., <a href="/isaiah/27-3.htm">Isaiah 27:3</a>). - In the lamentation which they raise (<a href="/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a>), they give prominence to the alarming revolution of all things, occasioned by the fact that the mistress of the seas, once so renowned, has now become an object of horror and alarm. &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, inhabited from the seas. This is not to be taken as equivalent to "as far as the seas," in the sense of, whose inhabitants spread over the seas and settle there, as Gesenius (Thes.) and Hvernick suppose; for being inhabited is the very opposite of sending the inhabitants abroad. If &#1502;&#1503; were to be taken in the geographical sense of direction or locality, the meaning of the expression could only be, whose inhabitants spring from the seas, or have migrated thither from all seas; but this would not apply to the population of Tyre, which did not consists of men of all nations under heaven. Hitzig has given the correct interpretation, namely, from the sea, or out of the seas, which had as it were ascended as an inhabited city out of the bosom of the sea. It is not easy to explain the last clause of <a href="/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a> : who inspired all her inhabitants with their terror, or with terror of them (of themselves); for if the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is taken in connection with the preceding &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;, the thought arises that the inhabitants of Tyre inspired her inhabitants, i.e., themselves, with their terror, or terror of themselves. Kimchi, Rosenmller, Ewald, Kliefoth, and others, have therefore proposed to take the suffix in the second &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; as referring to &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; ot gnirre, all the inhabitants of the sea, i.e., all her colonies. But this is open to the objection, that not only is &#1497;&#1501; of the masculine gender, but it is extremely harsh to take the same suffix attached to the two &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; as referring to different subjects. We must therefore take the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; and the suffix in &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; as both referring to &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;: the city with its population inspired all its several inhabitants with fear or itself. This is not to be understood, however, as signifying that the inhabitants of Tyre kept one another in a state of terror and alarm; but that the city with its population, through its power upon the sea, inspired all the several inhabitants with fear of this its might, inasmuch as the distinction of the city and its population was reflected upon every individual citizen. This explanation of the words is confirmed by the parallel passages in <a href="/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a>. - This city had come to so appalling an end, that all the islands trembled thereat. The two hemistichs in <a href="/ezekiel/26-18.htm">Ezekiel 26:18</a> are synonymous, and the thought returns by way of conclusion to <a href="/ezekiel/26-15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15</a>. &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; has the Aramaean form of the plural, which is sometimes met with even in the earlier poetry (vid., Ewald, 177a). &#1510;&#1488;&#1514;, departure, i.e., destruction. </body></html>
