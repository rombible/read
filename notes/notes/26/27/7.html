Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God.

From whence came the finest and whitest linen; and which they embroidered with needlework, which looked very beautiful. Pliny (x) says there were four sorts of linen in Egypt, called Tanitic, Pelusiac, Butic, and Tentyritic, from the names and provinces where they were produced; of the second sort the garments of the high priest among the Jews were made; for they say (y), on the day of atonement he was in the morning clothed with Pelusiac garments; that is, with garments made of linen which came from Pelusium, a well known city in Egypt; and which Jarchi (z) says was the best, and in the greatest esteem; and one of the Misnic commentators says (a) that the linen from Pelusium is fine and beautiful, and comes from the land of Raamses; and observes, that, in the Jerusalem Targum, Raamses is said to be Pelusium; but though they are not one and the same place, yet they are both in the same country, Egypt, and near one another; and with this sort of linen the priests of Hercules were clothed, according to Silius (b); and so the  "shesh", or linen, of which the garments of the Jewish priests in common were made, was linen from Egypt; and which their Rabbins (c) say is the best, and is only found there. The Phoenicians, of which Tyre was a principal city, took linen of Egypt, and traded with other nations with it, as well as made use of it for themselves; particularly with the Ethiopians, the inhabitants of the isle of Cernes, now called the Canaries, who took of them Egyptian goods, as linen, &amp;c.; in lieu of which they had of them elephants' teeth, the skins of lions, leopards, deer, and other creatures (d): now such fine linen as this <p>was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail: not content with canvass or coarse linen, which would have done as well, they must have the finest Egyptian linen, and this very curiously embroidered, to make their sails of they spread upon their masts, to receive the wind; at least this they spread "for a flag" (e), standard or ensign, as, the word may be rendered; when they hoisted up their colours on any occasion, they were such as these: "blue and purple, from the isles of Elishah, was that which covered thee"; meaning not garments made of cloth of these colours, which the master of the vessel or mariners wore; but the tilts, or tents, or canopies erected on the decks, where they sat sheltered from the rain, wind, or sun; these were made of stuff died of a violet and purple colour, the best they could get; and which they fetched from the isles of Elishah, or the Aegean sea, from Coa, Rhodia, Nisyrus, and other places famous for purple, as Tyre itself afterwards was.

Sidon is the firstborn of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/10-15.htm" title="And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,">Genesis 10:15</a>), and is called Great Sidon in <a href="/joshua/19-28.htm" title="And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Zidon;">Joshua 19:28</a>. It is frequently referred to in Homer (e.g. <span class="ital">Il</span>. 7. 290), who does not mention Tyre. At a later time Tyre eclipsed her mother in power and wealth. Arvad (Aradus) lay greatly more to the N. It was built on a small island, over two miles from the mainland, and, being without natural harbours, piers were laboriously constructed of huge blocks of stone, 16 feet long by 7 broad, quarried on the island. It was dependent for water upon the mainland, but when its supply was cut off recourse was had to a powerful spring of fresh water which was known to rise under the sea in the channel between the town and the mainland. This spring was isolated and the water brought by a tube to the surface. The spring is said still to exist. Arvad, now Ruwâd, or, Ruweideh, is often mentioned in the Assyrian Annals. Tiglath-pileser I.

The Targum gives Italy. Sicily also has been conjectured. The murex is common all over the Mediterranean, but Cythera and Abydos are named as having been specially famous for it. Probably, as in the case of "Chittim," the word was used with considerable latitude. The latter clause of the verse describes the awning over the deck of the queenly ship.

Now do the islands tremble on the day of thy fall, and the islands in the sea are confounded at thy departure. - &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, nonne, has the force of a direct affirmation. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, the noise of the fall, stands for the tidings of the noise, since the noise itself could not be heard upon the islands. The fall takes place, as is added for the purpose of depicting the terrible nature of the event, at or amidst the groaning of the wounded, and the slaughter in the midst of thee. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1490; is the infinitive Niphal, with the accent drawn back on account of the following Milel, and should be pointed &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1490; . The word &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, islands, is frequently used so as to embrace the coast lands of the Mediterranean Sea; we have therefore to understand it here as applied to the Phoenician colonies on the islands and coasts of that sea. The "princes of the sea" are not kings of the islands, but, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-8.htm">Isaiah 23:8</a>, the merchants presiding over the colonies of Tyre, who resembled princes. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, not royal thrones, but chairs, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-13.htm">1 Samuel 4:13</a>, etc. The picture of their mourning recalls the description in <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>; it is not derived from that passage, however, but is an independent description of the mourning customs which commonly prevailed among princes. The antithesis introduced as a very striking one: clothing themselves in terrors, putting on terrors in the place of the robes of state which they have laid aside (see the similar trope in <a href="/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a>). The thought is rendered still more forcible by the closing sentences of the verse: they tremble &#1500;&#1512;&#1504;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, by moments, i.e., as the moments return - actually, therefore, "every moment" (vid., <a href="/isaiah/27-3.htm">Isaiah 27:3</a>). - In the lamentation which they raise (<a href="/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a>), they give prominence to the alarming revolution of all things, occasioned by the fact that the mistress of the seas, once so renowned, has now become an object of horror and alarm. &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, inhabited from the seas. This is not to be taken as equivalent to "as far as the seas," in the sense of, whose inhabitants spread over the seas and settle there, as Gesenius (Thes.) and Hvernick suppose; for being inhabited is the very opposite of sending the inhabitants abroad. If &#1502;&#1503; were to be taken in the geographical sense of direction or locality, the meaning of the expression could only be, whose inhabitants spring from the seas, or have migrated thither from all seas; but this would not apply to the population of Tyre, which did not consists of men of all nations under heaven. Hitzig has given the correct interpretation, namely, from the sea, or out of the seas, which had as it were ascended as an inhabited city out of the bosom of the sea. It is not easy to explain the last clause of <a href="/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a> : who inspired all her inhabitants with their terror, or with terror of them (of themselves); for if the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is taken in connection with the preceding &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;, the thought arises that the inhabitants of Tyre inspired her inhabitants, i.e., themselves, with their terror, or terror of themselves. Kimchi, Rosenmller, Ewald, Kliefoth, and others, have therefore proposed to take the suffix in the second &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; as referring to &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; ot gnirre, all the inhabitants of the sea, i.e., all her colonies. But this is open to the objection, that not only is &#1497;&#1501; of the masculine gender, but it is extremely harsh to take the same suffix attached to the two &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; as referring to different subjects. We must therefore take the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; and the suffix in &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; as both referring to &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;: the city with its population inspired all its several inhabitants with fear or itself. This is not to be understood, however, as signifying that the inhabitants of Tyre kept one another in a state of terror and alarm; but that the city with its population, through its power upon the sea, inspired all the several inhabitants with fear of this its might, inasmuch as the distinction of the city and its population was reflected upon every individual citizen. This explanation of the words is confirmed by the parallel passages in <a href="/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a>. - This city had come to so appalling an end, that all the islands trembled thereat. The two hemistichs in <a href="/ezekiel/26-18.htm">Ezekiel 26:18</a> are synonymous, and the thought returns by way of conclusion to <a href="/ezekiel/26-15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15</a>. &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; has the Aramaean form of the plural, which is sometimes met with even in the earlier poetry (vid., Ewald, 177a). &#1510;&#1488;&#1514;, departure, i.e., destruction. </body></html>
