(Comp. <a href="/context/matthew/9-5.htm" title="For whether is easier, to say, Your sins be forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and walk?">Matthew 9:5-6</a>.) It was precisely this teaching which the people needed. As they had formerly refused to believe his announcements of impending judgment, so now that this had come, they were utterly incredulous in regard to his declarations of future blessing. It seemed to them impossible, and what they needed to be taught was that “what is impossible with man is possible with God.”<p><span class= "bld">Thou knowest.</span>—The prophet sees the natural impossibility, yet perceives that there must be some deeper reason for the question, and therefore replies in these words. It may be, too, that the question thus asked, before its object is suggested, connected itself in his mind with the thought of the literal resurrection of the dead and the difficulties it suggests.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:1-14 No created power could restore human bones to life. God alone could cause them to live. Skin and flesh covered them, and the wind was then told to blow upon these bodies; and they were restored to life. The wind was an emblem of the Spirit of God, and represented his quickening powers. The vision was to encourage the desponding Jews; to predict both their restoration after the captivity, and also their recovery from their present and long-continued dispersion. It was also a clear intimation of the resurrection of the dead; and it represents the power and grace of God, in the conversion of the most hopeless sinners to himself. Let us look to Him who will at last open our graves, and bring us forth to judgment, that He may now deliver us from sin, and put his Spirit within us, and keep us by his power, through faith, unto salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The valley - The same word as "the plain" <a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>.

To the question, Can these bones live? the prophet, looking at them, could not answer Yea (even to the Apostle attainment unto the resurrection of the dead was something ineffably lofty, <a href="/philippians/3-11.htm" title="If by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.">Php 3:11</a>), and yet in the presence of him who put the question he could not answer No (<a href="/context/romans/4-17.htm" title="(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who vivifies the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were....">Romans 4:17-21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-19.htm" title="Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from where also he received him in a figure.">Hebrews 11:19</a>).

The extreme improbability, if not absolute impossibility, of the occurrence, at least to human reason and power, is perhaps pointed at in the designation "Son of man" here given to the prophet. The prophet's answer, <span class="cmt_word">O Lord God, thou knowest</span>, is not to be interpreted as proving that to the prophet hitherto the thought of a resurrection had been unfamiliar, if not completely absent, or as giving a direct reply either affirmative or negative to the question proposed to him, but merely as expressing the prophet's sense of the greatness of the wonder suggested to his mind, with perhaps a latent acknowledgment that God alone had the power by which such a wonder could, and therefore alone also the knowledge whether it would, be accomplished (comp. <a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). </body></html>
