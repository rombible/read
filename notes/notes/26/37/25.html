Events yet to come will further explain this prophecy. Nothing has more hindered the success of the gospel than divisions. Let us study to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; let us seek for Divine grace to keep us from detestable things; and let us pray that all nations may be obedient and happy subjects of the Son of David, that the Lord may be our God, and we may be his people for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An enlargement of the promises.

But possibly the point whether the king would be one person living for ever is not before the prophet’s mind. It is the quality of the new people and the new ruler that he specially refers to; the point whether generation after generation of the people shall dwell in the land and prince succeed prince is hardly in his mind. The unity of the people and the unity of the ruler, one such as David; the character of the people (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24</a></span>) and their perpetual possession of the land—these are the elements of the prophet’s idea, and further questions are not touched. In <a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the middle of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places.">Ezekiel 43:7</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/45-8.htm" title="In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.">Ezekiel 45:8</a>, a succession of princes appears presupposed, but the idea hardly belongs to the present passage.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - The phrase, <span class="cmt_word">my servant David</span> (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23, 24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-21.htm">Jeremiah 33:21, 22, 26</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3, 20</a>; <a href="/psalms/144-10.htm">Psalm 144:10</a>), goes back to the Messianic promise of <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, and cannot be satisfactorily explained as signifying the Davidic house (Smend), or as pointing to "a line of true rulers, each faithfully representing the ideal David as the faithful Ruler, the true Shepherd of his people" (Plumptre, on Ezekiel 34:23), inasmuch as Israel, after Ezekiel's day, never possessed any such line of rulers, and certainly no such line continued <span class="cmt_word">forever</span>.
