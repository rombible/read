God alone could cause them to live. Skin and flesh covered them, and the wind was then told to blow upon these bodies; and they were restored to life. The wind was an emblem of the Spirit of God, and represented his quickening powers. The vision was to encourage the desponding Jews; to predict both their restoration after the captivity, and also their recovery from their present and long-continued dispersion. It was also a clear intimation of the resurrection of the dead; and it represents the power and grace of God, in the conversion of the most hopeless sinners to himself.

The destruction and dissolution of the nation appeared to them final. It could no more be revived than the dry bones could be made to live. This feeling often appears in exile writings, e.g. Isaiah 40-56 (<a href="/isaiah/49-14.htm" title="But Zion said, The LORD has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me.">Isaiah 49:14</a> &c.) cf. the singular struggling against the idea, <a href="/lamentations/3-20.htm" title="My soul has them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.">Lamentations 3:20</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for our parts</span>] A rendering of the ethical dat., which merely gives vividness to the words “we are cut off,” or expresses the feeling of those who speak by reflecting the action back upon the subject. The term “cut off” (otherwise uncommon) is used also of the servant of the Lord, <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm" title="He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.">Isaiah 53:8</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-14</span> contain, according to most commentators, the Divine interpretation of the vision, Kliefoth alone contending that they furnish, not so much an exposition of the vision - which, he thinks, must be explained independently, and which he regards as teaching the future resurrection of God's people - as an application to Israel's ease of the doctrine contained in the vision. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These bones are the whole house of Israel</span>. On the principle that "God is his own best interpreter," it should not be difficult to see that, whatever foreshadowings of the final resurrection of the just may be contained in the vision, its primary intention was to depict the political and national restoration of Israel (Ephraim and Judah) whose condition at the time the field of withered bones appropriately represented. That Hitzig errs in supposing the "bones" alluded to in this verse symbolized the portions of Ephraim and Judah then dead, instead of the portions still living (in exile), who considered themselves as practically dead, is apparent from the words that follow. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, they say</span>. The complaint was manifestly taken from the popular sayings current among the people of the exile. Broken up, dispersed, expatriated, and despairing, the members of what had once been "the whole house of Israel" felt there was no hope more of recovering national life and unity. The cheerless character of the outlook they expressed by saying, Our bones (not the bones of the dead, but of the living) are dried - meaning, "The vital force of our nation is gone" (the bones being regarded in Scripture as the seat of the vital force comp. <a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">our hope is lost</span> -  our hope, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of ever again returning to our own land or regaining national existence - and <span class="cmt_word">we are out off for our parts</span>; literally, <span class="accented">we are cut off for ourselves</span>; which Gesenius explains to mean, "We are <span class="accented">lost</span>," taking <span class="hebrew">&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5e2;&#x5da;&#x5ea;&#x5ea;&#x5e1;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5da;&#x5dc;&#x5e4;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>; Hitzig, "We are reduced to ourselves;" Delitzsch and Keil, "We are cut off from the land of the living," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is all over with us; Hengstenberg, "We are cut off - a sad fact for us;" Revised Version, "We are clean cut off;" any one of which renders the force of the words (scrap. <a href="/lamentations/3-54.htm">Lamentations 3:54</a>). </body></html>
