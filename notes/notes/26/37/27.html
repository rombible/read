Christ is the true David, Israel's King of old; and those whom he makes willing in the day of his power, he makes to walk in his judgments, and to keep his statutes. Events yet to come will further explain this prophecy. Nothing has more hindered the success of the gospel than divisions. Let us study to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; let us seek for Divine grace to keep us from detestable things; and let us pray that all nations may be obedient and happy subjects of the Son of David, that the Lord may be our God, and we may be his people for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This gives a final blessing reserved for God's accepted servants. The tabernacle and temple were outward symbols of His presence. The re-erection of the temple by Zerubbabel was the first step to a restoration of the presence of God. The second step was the presence of Christ, first in the flesh, then in His Church, and finally the eternal presence of God and of the Lamb in the New Jerusalem <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27.

The last words of the Book are, “The Lord is there.” The phrase <span class="ital">with</span> them, i.e. by or beside them (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/2-6.htm" title="And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 2:6</a>), might mean <span class="ital">over</span> them, reference being to the situation of the temple, high above the city (<a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm" title="In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.">Ezekiel 40:2</a>), but this has little probability. It would be more natural to take <span class="ital">over</span> in the ideal sense of a “protection” to them. The sanctuary, however, does not protect, it sanctifies, although being sanctified Jehovah will protect them (ch. 38–39). The expression “I will be their God” varies the idea of his dwelling place being with them, <a href="/ezekiel/11-20.htm" title="That they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.">Ezekiel 11:20</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/14-11.htm" title="That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 14:11</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/36-28.htm" title="And you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.">Ezekiel 36:28</a>.</body></html>
