Applied to the Jews, released and returning from captivity, the words signify that they should amount to a great multitude, when they should be gathered from their several dispersions, and should be united in one body.

God alone could cause them to live. Skin and flesh covered them, and the wind was then told to blow upon these bodies; and they were restored to life. The wind was an emblem of the Spirit of God, and represented his quickening powers. The vision was to encourage the desponding Jews; to predict both their restoration after the captivity, and also their recovery from their present and long-continued dispersion. It was also a clear intimation of the resurrection of the dead; and it represents the power and grace of God, in the conversion of the most hopeless sinners to himself. Let us look to Him who will at last open our graves, and bring us forth to judgment, that He may now deliver us from sin, and put his Spirit within us, and keep us by his power, through faith, unto salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bone to his bone - i. e., to its proper place in the frame. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. noise&#8212;of the bones when coming in mutual collision.

The prophet was not disobedient to the heavenly vision; he was right to observe the orders and instructions given, whatever were the issue and success of them; that he was to leave with the Lord, and did. So Gospel ministers prophesy or preach according to the commission given them, and leave their work with the Lord: this was the first prophesying; for there is another after mentioned: these two are carefully to be observed and distinguished, different effects following the one and the other: this was a prophesying to the dry bones, upon them, over them, and concerning them; and what is next related was the consequence of it; <p>and as I prophesied, there was a noise; or, "a voice" (w); this, in the literal sense, was the proclamation by Cyrus, giving the Jews leave to return to their own land, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>, at the revival of the interest of Christ, a great voice will be heard from heaven, saying to the witnesses, come up hither, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/11-12.htm">Revelation 11:12</a>, and at the descent of Christ to raise his dead first, there will be the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>, and, as while the prophet was prophesying, there was not only his voice heard, but the voice of God, perhaps a thunder clap: so in the ministry of the Gospel there is a voice heard, which, at first, is only externally heard; men hear a noise, a voice, but it is a confused one; they do not know what to make of it, and yet it has some effect upon them; it causes a noise in them, an outcry about sin, and hell, and damnation; and yet, at present, no spiritual life or breath is in them: <p>and behold a shaking; of the bones; a rattling among them, as may be conceived must be where there is, as here, a tumbling of dry bones one over another, to get to their proper bone: so in the first effect of the word upon the conscience of a sinner, which works wrath there, there is a shaking and trembling through fear of damnation; which in some issues in real conversion, as in Saul and the jailer, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/9-6.htm">Acts 9:6</a>, but in others it goes off again, and comes to nothing, as in Felix, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a>, <p>and the bones came together, bone to his bone: so the Jews scattered up and down in the provinces of Babylon gathered together upon the proclamation of Cyrus, and went up in a body to their own land; as they will do also at the time of their conversion, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/1-11.htm">Hosea 1:11</a>, thus, when persons are only under slight convictions, they may gather together, and have their religious meetings and societies, and yet be only a parcel of dry bones, without any spiritual life and breath in them. <p>(w)  "et exstitit vox", Cocceius, Starckius; "et fuit vox", Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">behold a shaking</span>] The word is rendered “rushing” (<a href="/ezekiel/3-12.htm" title="Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.">Ezekiel 3:12</a>).

The words uttered were without doubt those of vers. 4-6. The effect produced is depicted in its various steps. First, there resulted a noise - literally, a <span class="accented">voice</span> - which the Revisers take to have been "a thundering;" and Havernick, Keil, Smend, and others, "a sound" in general; but which Ewald, Hengstenberg, and Schroder, with more propriety, regard as having been an audible voice, if not, as Kliefoth supposes, the trumpet-blast or "voice of God," which, according to certain New Testament passages, shall precede the resurrection and awaken the dead (<a href="/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25, 28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>); perhaps, as Plumptre suggests, the "counterpart" thereof. <span class="cmt_word">Next, a shaking</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.); which the Revisers, following Klie-foth, understand to have been an earthquake, as in <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a> (comp. <a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), and Ewald explains as "a peal of thunder running through the entire announcement," as in <a href="/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12, 13</a> and Ezekiel 38:19, 20; but which is better interpreted by Keil, Smend, and others as a rustling proceeding from a movement among the bones. Thirdly, <span class="cmt_word">the bones came together</span> in the body as a whole, and in particular bone to his bone; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> each <span class="cmt_word">bone to the bone</span> with which it was designed to be united, as e.g. "the upper to the lower part of the arm" (Schroder). <span class="cmt_word">Lastly, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above</span>; or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">there were sinews upon them</span>, <span class="accented">and flesh came up and skin covered them above</span>; precisely as Jehovah had announced to the prophet would take place (ver. 6). Yet, though the external framework of the bodies was finished, there was <span class="cmt_word">no breath in them</span> - <span class="accented">ruach</span> having still the same import as in ver. 5. With this the preliminary stage in the reanimating process terminated. </body></html>
