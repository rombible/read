When God is leaving a people in displeasure, angels above, and all events below, further his departure. The Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, directs all creatures, in heaven and on earth, so as to make them serve the Divine purpose. God removes by degrees from a provoking people; and, when ready to depart, would return to them, if they were a repenting, praying people. Let this warn sinners to seek the Lord while he may be found, and to call on him while he is near, and cause us all to walk humbly and watchfully with our God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According to the marginal rendering the present verse refers back to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-6.htm">Ezekiel 10:6</a>, and tells us that the name "galgal, a rolling thing" (compare <a href="/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>), was given to the wheels in the seer's hearing. But taking <a href="/ezekiel/10-14.htm">Ezekiel 10:14</a> as a description, and reading <a href="/ezekiel/10-15.htm">Ezekiel 10:15</a> immediately after <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-13.htm">Ezekiel 10:13</a>, the meaning is clear. In the hearing Of the seer a voice calls upon the wheels, and, obedient to the call, the cherubim are lifted up and the wheels roll on. The word "galgal" would be better rendered "chariot" instead of "wheel;" "chariot" representing very well the collection of "wheels." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

Galgal here used for "wheel," is different from ophan, the simple word for "wheel." Galgal is the whole wheelwork machinery with its whirlwind-like rotation.

And it came to pass when they smote and I remained, I fell upon my face, and carried, and said: Alas! Lord Jehovah, wilt Thou destroy all the remnant of Israel, by pouring out Thy wrath upon Jerusalem? <a href="/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>. And He said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is immeasurably great, and the land is full of blood-guiltiness, and the city full of perversion; for they say Jehovah hath forsaken the land, and Jehovah seeth not. <a href="/ezekiel/9-10.htm">Ezekiel 9:10</a>. So also shall my eye not look with pity, and I will not spare; I will give their way upon their head. <a href="/ezekiel/9-11.htm">Ezekiel 9:11</a>. And, behold, the man clothed in white linen, who had the writing materials on his hip, brought answer, and said: I have done as thou hast commanded me. - The Chetib &#1504;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; is an incongruous form, composed of participle and imperfect fused into one, and is evidently a copyist's error. It is not to be altered into &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;, however (the 1st pers. imperf. Niph.), but to be read as a participle &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;, and taken with &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; as a continuation of the circumstantial clause. For the words do not mean that Ezekiel alone was left, but that when the angels smote and he was left, i.e., was spared, was not smitten with the rest, he fell on his face, to entreat the Lord for mercy. These words and the prophet's intercession both apparently presuppose that among the inhabitants of Jerusalem there was no one found who was marked with the sign of the cross, and therefore could be spared. But this is by no means to be regarded as established. For, in the first place, it is not stated that all had been smitten by the angels; and, secondly, the intercession of the prophet simply assumes that, in comparison with the multitude of the slain, the number of those who were marked with the sign of the cross and spared was so small that it escaped the prophet's eye, and he was afraid that they might all be slain without exception, and the whole of the remnant of the covenant nation be destroyed. The &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; of Israel and Judah is the covenant nation in its existing state, when it had been so reduced by the previous judgments of God, that out of the whole of what was once so numerous a people, only a small portion remained in the land. Although God has previously promised that a remnant shall be preserved (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-3.htm">Ezekiel 5:3-4</a>), He does not renew this promise to the prophet, but begins by holding up the greatness of the iniquity of Israel, which admits of no sparing, but calls for the most merciless punishment, to show him that, according to the strict demand of justice, the whole nation has deserved destruction. &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>) is not equivalent to &#1502;&#1493;&#1492;&#1496;, oppression (<a href="/isaiah/58-9.htm">Isaiah 58:9</a>), but signifies perversion of justice; although &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; is not mentioned, since this is also omitted in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>, where &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; occurs in the same sense. For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>, vid., <a href="/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>. For &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; '&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; &#1489;&#1512; (<a href="/ezekiel/9-10.htm">Ezekiel 9:10</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-21.htm">Ezekiel 11:21-22</a>, 31), vid., <a href="/1_kings/8-32.htm">1 Kings 8:32</a>. While God is conversing with the prophet, the seven angels have performed their work; and in <a href="/ezekiel/9-11.htm">Ezekiel 9:11</a> their leader returns to Jehovah with the announcement that His orders have been executed. He does this, not in his own name only, but in that of all the rest. The first act of the judgment is thus shown to the prophet in a figurative representation. The second act follows in the next chapter. </body></html>
