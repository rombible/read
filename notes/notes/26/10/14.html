The lion, being on the east part, was toward his right hand; the ox, being placed toward the west, was on his left; and the eagle was toward the north. This interpretation is justified from the situation of the standards of the several tribes of Israel in the wilderness, (<a href="/numbers/2-2.htm" title="Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.">Numbers 2:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/2-10.htm" title="On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their armies: and the captain of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.">Numbers 2:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/2-18.htm" title="On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.">Numbers 2:18</a>; <a href="/numbers/2-25.htm" title="The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.">Numbers 2:25</a>,) where Judah, whose standard was a lion, was placed on the east side; Reuben, whose standard was a man, was placed on the south; Ephraim, whose standard was an ox, was placed on the west; and Dan, whose standard was an eagle, was placed on the north side.

The Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, directs all creatures, in heaven and on earth, so as to make them serve the Divine purpose. God removes by degrees from a provoking people; and, when ready to depart, would return to them, if they were a repenting, praying people.

Of the four faces of each cherub, the seer names only one - the face looking in the direction in which that cherub leads the motion of the chariot. The face of the cherub which presented itself to the seer was that of "an ox." When he looking northward first saw the chariot the "ox-face" was on the left side <a href="/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>.

The chief of the four cherubic forms was not the ox, but man. Therefore "cherub" cannot be synonymous with "ox." Probably Ezekiel, standing in front of one of the cherubim (namely, that which handed the coals to the man in linen), saw of him, not merely the ox-form, but the whole fourfold form, and therefore calls him simply "cherub"; whereas of the other three, having only a side view, he specifies the form of each which met his eye [Fairbairn]. As to the likelihood of the lower animals sharing in "the restoration of all things," see Isa 11:6; 65:25; Ro 8:20, 21; this accords with the animal forms combined with the human to typify redeemed man.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Every one, </span> of the living creatures, <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/1-6.htm" title="And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.">Ezekiel 1:6</a></span>, the cherubims in this chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The first face, </span> which each had. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The face of a cherub:</span> in Babylon, at the river Chebar, he saw somewhat a different face; in the temple he seeth a cherub, one of the faces, which leads us to look on angels employed in those revolutions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The second face, </span> the second which each cherubim had, was a man’s face, &c.: see <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/1-6.htm" title="And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.">Ezekiel 1:6</a>,10</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And everyone had four faces,....

The verse, which LXX. omits, is difficult. The words rendered “first face” might have that sense or the sense “one face” at a pinch, but mean naturally “face of the first;” and those rendered “the second face” can hardly mean anything but “the face of the second,” for it is precarious to extend constructions like <a href="/jeremiah/46-2.htm" title="Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.">Jeremiah 46:2</a> “the year of the fourth” (year) = the fourth year, to other words than “year.” The easiest course would be to omit the word “face” before “first” and “second,” as in fact it does not stand before “third” and “fourth;” or perhaps it might be enough to omit it before “second” and assume that the anomalous constr. “one face” (<a href="/leviticus/24-22.htm" title="You shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 24:22</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-10.htm" title="And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD.">2 Kings 12:10</a>) had led to the insertion of “face” before “the second.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">face of a cherub</span>] Of <span class="bld">the</span> cherub. As the other faces were those of a man, a lion, and an eagle, this face must be that of the ox (ch. <a href="/ezekiel/1-10.htm" title="As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 1:10</a>). Why should this be called the face of the cherub? It is said that the winged bulls at the portals of Assyrian temples are called cherubs in Assyrian (Fried. Del. <span class="ital">Paradies</span>, p. 153, Lenormant, <span class="ital">Les origines de l’histoire</span>, p. 118), but these winged bulls have not the face of an ox but that of a man, and there is no probability that in Israel the cherubs in the temple were ox-faced.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It seems possible to explain the verse only by making some suppositions which may appear rather artificial, viz. first that the prophet looking at the phenomenon of the chariot and four creatures as a whole saw four faces presented to him, one (and a different one) by each of the creatures, and that he named the faces which were thus presented to him. We should then translate “the face of the first,” “the face of the second” &c., though this seems opposed to the meaning of the first words of the verse. And secondly, that he assumes the side of the chariot presented to him not to be the front, but regards the side looking in another direction as the front or head. His view of the chariot is taken when it rose and proceeded eastward (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/10-19.htm" title="And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.">Ezekiel 10:19</a></span>); and he regards the side of the chariot turned to the east as the front, and he calls the cherub which led the movement to the east <span class="ital">the</span> cherub. Further at this moment the chariot and cherubim were standing on the south side of the house (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/10-3.htm" title="Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.">Ezekiel 10:3</a></span>), and the prophet’s position was probably near the house and thus to the north or left of the phenomenon. Now the ox-face of all the cherubs was on their left (ch. <a href="/ezekiel/1-10.htm" title="As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 1:10</a>), that is, in the case of a cherub leading the movement eastward, toward the north where the prophet presumably was standing. Thus he would see the ox-face of the first cherub (whose human face was eastward, leading the whole chariot). He would also see the man’s face of the cherub on the side of the chariot facing himself, the lion’s face of the cherub who stood on the west side of the chariot, and the eagle’s face of the cherub on the south side of the chariot, for all the eagle-faces looked inward to the centre of the chariot. This is the order followed in the verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The first face was the face of a cherub,</span> etc.; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">of the cherub.</span> This takes the place of "the face of an ox" in <a href="/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>, and it is first in order instead of being, as there, the third.

And he took it, and went out. <a href="/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8</a>. And there appeared by the cherubim the likeness of a man's hand under their wings. - <a href="/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a> introduces the description of the second act of the judgment. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>, Jehovah had come down from His throne above the cherubim to the threshold of the temple to issue His orders thence for the judgment upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and according to <a href="/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a> He goes thither once more. Consequently He had resumed His seat above the cherubim in the meantime. This is expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>, not indeed in so many words, but indirectly or by implication. Ezekiel sees the theophany; and on the firmament above the cherubim, like sapphire-stone to look at, he beholds the likeness of a throne on which Jehovah appeared. To avoid giving too great prominence in this appearance of Jehovah to the bodily or human form, Ezekiel does not speak even here of the form of Jehovah, but simply of His throne, which he describes in the same manner as in <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>. &#1488;&#1500; stands for &#1506;&#1500; according to the later usage of the language. It will never do to take &#1488;&#1500; in its literal sense, as Kliefoth does, and render the words: "Ezekiel saw it move away to the firmament;" for the object to &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is not &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; or &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; , but the form of the throne sparkling in sapphire-stone; and this throne had not separated itself from the firmament above the cherubim, but Jehovah, or the glory of Jehovah, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>, had risen up from the cherubim, and moved away to the temple threshold. The &#1499;&#1468; before &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is not to be erased, as Hitzig proposes after the lxx, on the ground that it is not found in <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; it is quite appropriate here. For the words do not affirm that Ezekiel saw the likeness of a throne like sapphire-stone; but that he saw something like sapphire-stone, like the appearance of the form of a throne. Ezekiel does not see Jehovah, or the glory of Jehovah, move away to the firmament, and then return to the throne. He simply sees once more the resemblance of a throne upon the firmament, and the Lord appearing thereon. The latter is indicated in &#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;. These words are not to be taken in connection with '&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, so as to form one sentence; but have been very properly separated by the athnach under &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;, and treated as an independent assertion. The subject to &#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; might, indeed, be &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;, "the likeness of a throne appeared above the cherubim;" but in that case the words would form a pure tautology, as the fact of the throne becoming visible has already been mentioned in the preceding clause. The subject must therefore be Jehovah, as in the case of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>, where there can be no doubt on the matter. Jehovah has resumed His throne, not "for the purpose of removing to a distance, because the courts of the temple have been defiled by dead bodies" (Hitzig), but because the object for which He left it has been attained.<p>He now commands the man clothed in white linen to go in between the wheels under the cherubim, and fill his hands with fire-coals from thence, and scatter them over the city (Jerusalem). This he did, so that Ezekiel could see it. According to this, it appears as if Jehovah had issued the command from His throne; but if we compare what follows, it is evident from <a href="/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a> that the glory of Jehovah had risen up again from the throne, and removed to the threshold of the temple, and that it was not till after the man in white linen had scattered the coals over the city that it left the threshold of the temple, and ascended once more up to the throne above the cherubim, so as to forsake the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>.). Consequently we can only understand <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2-7</a> as implying that Jehovah issued the command in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>, not from His throne, but from the threshold of the temple, and that He had therefore returned to the threshold of the temple for this purpose, and for the very same reason as in <a href="/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>. The possibility of interpreting the verses in this way is apparent from the fact that <a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a> contains a summary of the whole of the contents of this section, and that <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3-7</a> simply furnish more minute explanations, or contain circumstantial clauses, which throw light upon the whole affair. This is obvious in the case of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3</a>, from the form of the clause; and in <a href="/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-5.htm">Ezekiel 10:5</a>, from the fact that in <a href="/ezekiel/10-6.htm">Ezekiel 10:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/10-7.htm">Ezekiel 10:7</a> the command (<a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>) is resumed, and the execution of it, which was already indicated in &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; &#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>), more minutely described and carried forward in the closing words of the seventh verse, &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495; . &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; in <a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a> signifies the whirl or rotatory motion, i.e., the wheel-work, or the four o&#772;phannim under the cherubim regarded as moving. The angel was to go in between these, and take coals out of the fire there, and scatter them over the city. "In the fire of God, the fire of His wrath, will kindle the fire for consuming the city" (Kliefoth). To depict the scene more clearly, Ezekiel observes in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3</a>, that at this moment the cherubim were standing to the right of the house, i.e., on the south or rather south-east of the temple house, on the south of the altar of burnt-offering. According to the Hebrew usage the right side as the southern side, and the prophet was in the inner court, whither, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, the divine glory had taken him; and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>, the seven angels had gone to the front of the altar, to receive the commands of the Lord. Consequently we have to picture to ourselves the cherubim as appearing in the neighbourhood of the altar, and then taking up their position to the south thereof, when the Lord returned to the threshold of the temple. The reason for stating this is not to be sought, as Calvin supposes, in the desire to show "that the way was opened fore the angel to go straight to God, and that the cherubim were standing there ready, as it were, to contribute their labour." The position in which the cherubim appeared is more probably given with prospective reference to the account which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-9.htm">Ezekiel 10:9-22</a> of the departure of the glory of the Lord from the temple. As an indication of the significance of this act to Israel, the glory which issued from this manifestation of divine doxa is described in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3-5</a>. The cloud, as the earthly vehicle of the divine doxa, filled the inner court; and when the glory of the Lord stood upon the threshold, it filled the temple also, while the court became full of the splendour of the divine glory. That is to say, the brilliancy of the divine nature shone through the cloud, so that the court and the temple were lighted by the shining of the light-cloud. The brilliant splendour is a symbol of the light of the divine grace. The wings of the cherubim rustled, and at the movement of God (<a href="/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>) were audible even in the outer court.<p>After this picture of the glorious manifestation of the divine doxa, the fetching of the fire-coals from the space between the wheels under the cherubim is more closely described in <a href="/ezekiel/10-6.htm">Ezekiel 10:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/10-7.htm">Ezekiel 10:7</a>. One of the cherub's hands took the coals out of the fire, and put them into the hands of the man clothed in white linen. To this a supplementary remark is added in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8</a>, to the effect that the figure of a hand was visible by the side of the cherubim under their wings. The word &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;, "and he went out," indicates that the man clothed in white linen scattered the coals over the city, to set it on fire and consume it. </body></html>
