It would scarcely be in the sense of the prophet to suppose that he learned that the living creatures were cherubim from hearing them so called by the divine speaker (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm" title="And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.

And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;">Ezekiel 9:3</a>). The meaning is rather that this third vision of them (ch. 1 and ch. <a href="/ezekiel/3-23.htm" title="Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.">Ezekiel 3:23</a>) with its details and movements revealed to him that the creatures were cherubim. But admitting that the prophet had visions we can hardly escape the conclusion that the details of the phenomenon of the cherubim repose upon reflection. This reflection may have preceded the visions and been reproduced in them, but where did he find the elements that entered into his combination? Were they not derived from the temple largely, though also from the storm-cloud? Could he be unaware of the source whence he derived them? It is possible that in the excitation of the vision he did not recall the processes of his own reflection. Or may it be that we are straining the word “knew” when we understand it in the sense of <span class="ital">learned</span>, came to know? This is the natural sense to put upon it in this Book, and up to this time the prophet has not used the name cherubim.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The derivation of the word cherub is obscure. If Assyrian scholars are right the name is Babylonian, and is found given to the colossal winged bulls (called at other times shidu, Heb. <span class="ital">shçd</span>) which guard the portals of palaces and temples in Babylonia. The word (Kirubu) is said to have the sense of “great” (Schrader, <span class="ital">KAT</span>. on <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm" title="So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.">Genesis 3:24</a>, Del. <span class="ital">Paradies</span>, p. 150 seq.). But though the name be common to Babylonian and Hebrew, and though originally the idea expressed by the name may have been the same in both, the usage as known from Babylonian literature marks the end of a long development, and that in Hebrew marks the end of another long and independent development, and any attempt to control or explain the one by the other must be made with caution.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The narrative and essential part of Ch. 10 lies in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/ezekiel/10-2.htm" title="And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight....">Ezekiel 10:2-4</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/10-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels....">Ezekiel 10:6-7</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/10-18.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim....">Ezekiel 10:18-19</a></span>; the rest is annotation suggested by points in the narrative, in which ch. 1 is repeated without anything essential being added to it. A second description of the cherubim after ch. 1 looks unnecessary, and Cornill would excide <span class="ital"><a href="/context/ezekiel/10-8.htm" title="And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings....">Ezekiel 10:8-17</a></span> entirely.

The whole description of the divine chariot has an appearance of artificiality to us now, but in Ezekiel we have a peculiar mind, and it is safer to content ourselves with saying that we do not altogether understand the importance which he attaches to the phenomenon of the chariot and the living creatures.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Once more the prophet asserts, with fresh emphasis, the identity of the two visions which it had been given him to see. Now, as it were, he understands why the first vision was seen as coming from the north. He does not tell us whether the journey of which he saw the beginning was to end. For the present there was a halt, as we learn from <a href="/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>, "over the midst of the city." Even when the vision ended, it had not gone further than the Mount of Olives. We may conjecture, however, that he thought of its goal as that more sacred region of the heavens in which it had at first manifested itself (see note on Ezekiel 1:4). It was, at any rate, no longer in the temple. The banks of Chebar or any other place might become, as Bethel had been to Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>), as "the house of God" and "the gate of heaven." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The angel scatters coals of fire over Jerusalem. - <a href="/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>. And I saw, and behold upon the firmament, which was above the cherubim, it was like sapphire-stone, to look at as the likeness of a throne; He appeared above them. <a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>.

That the cherub stretched out his hand between the cherubim to the fire, which was between the cherubim, and lifted (some) off and gave it into the hands of the man clothed in white linen. And he took it, and went out. <a href="/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8</a>. And there appeared by the cherubim the likeness of a man's hand under their wings. - <a href="/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a> introduces the description of the second act of the judgment. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>, Jehovah had come down from His throne above the cherubim to the threshold of the temple to issue His orders thence for the judgment upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and according to <a href="/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a> He goes thither once more. Consequently He had resumed His seat above the cherubim in the meantime. This is expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>, not indeed in so many words, but indirectly or by implication. Ezekiel sees the theophany; and on the firmament above the cherubim, like sapphire-stone to look at, he beholds the likeness of a throne on which Jehovah appeared. To avoid giving too great prominence in this appearance of Jehovah to the bodily or human form, Ezekiel does not speak even here of the form of Jehovah, but simply of His throne, which he describes in the same manner as in <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>. &#1488;&#1500; stands for &#1506;&#1500; according to the later usage of the language. It will never do to take &#1488;&#1500; in its literal sense, as Kliefoth does, and render the words: "Ezekiel saw it move away to the firmament;" for the object to &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is not &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; or &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; , but the form of the throne sparkling in sapphire-stone; and this throne had not separated itself from the firmament above the cherubim, but Jehovah, or the glory of Jehovah, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>, had risen up from the cherubim, and moved away to the temple threshold. The &#1499;&#1468; before &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is not to be erased, as Hitzig proposes after the lxx, on the ground that it is not found in <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; it is quite appropriate here. For the words do not affirm that Ezekiel saw the likeness of a throne like sapphire-stone; but that he saw something like sapphire-stone, like the appearance of the form of a throne. Ezekiel does not see Jehovah, or the glory of Jehovah, move away to the firmament, and then return to the throne. He simply sees once more the resemblance of a throne upon the firmament, and the Lord appearing thereon. The latter is indicated in &#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;. These words are not to be taken in connection with '&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, so as to form one sentence; but have been very properly separated by the athnach under &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;, and treated as an independent assertion. The subject to &#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; might, indeed, be &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;, "the likeness of a throne appeared above the cherubim;" but in that case the words would form a pure tautology, as the fact of the throne becoming visible has already been mentioned in the preceding clause. The subject must therefore be Jehovah, as in the case of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>, where there can be no doubt on the matter. Jehovah has resumed His throne, not "for the purpose of removing to a distance, because the courts of the temple have been defiled by dead bodies" (Hitzig), but because the object for which He left it has been attained.<p>He now commands the man clothed in white linen to go in between the wheels under the cherubim, and fill his hands with fire-coals from thence, and scatter them over the city (Jerusalem). This he did, so that Ezekiel could see it. According to this, it appears as if Jehovah had issued the command from His throne; but if we compare what follows, it is evident from <a href="/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a> that the glory of Jehovah had risen up again from the throne, and removed to the threshold of the temple, and that it was not till after the man in white linen had scattered the coals over the city that it left the threshold of the temple, and ascended once more up to the throne above the cherubim, so as to forsake the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>.). Consequently we can only understand <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2-7</a> as implying that Jehovah issued the command in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>, not from His throne, but from the threshold of the temple, and that He had therefore returned to the threshold of the temple for this purpose, and for the very same reason as in <a href="/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>. The possibility of interpreting the verses in this way is apparent from the fact that <a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a> contains a summary of the whole of the contents of this section, and that <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3-7</a> simply furnish more minute explanations, or contain circumstantial clauses, which throw light upon the whole affair. This is obvious in the case of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3</a>, from the form of the clause; and in <a href="/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-5.htm">Ezekiel 10:5</a>, from the fact that in <a href="/ezekiel/10-6.htm">Ezekiel 10:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/10-7.htm">Ezekiel 10:7</a> the command (<a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>) is resumed, and the execution of it, which was already indicated in &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; &#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>), more minutely described and carried forward in the closing words of the seventh verse, &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495; . &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; in <a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a> signifies the whirl or rotatory motion, i.e., the wheel-work, or the four o&#772;phannim under the cherubim regarded as moving. The angel was to go in between these, and take coals out of the fire there, and scatter them over the city. "In the fire of God, the fire of His wrath, will kindle the fire for consuming the city" (Kliefoth). To depict the scene more clearly, Ezekiel observes in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3</a>, that at this moment the cherubim were standing to the right of the house, i.e., on the south or rather south-east of the temple house, on the south of the altar of burnt-offering. According to the Hebrew usage the right side as the southern side, and the prophet was in the inner court, whither, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, the divine glory had taken him; and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>, the seven angels had gone to the front of the altar, to receive the commands of the Lord. Consequently we have to picture to ourselves the cherubim as appearing in the neighbourhood of the altar, and then taking up their position to the south thereof, when the Lord returned to the threshold of the temple. The reason for stating this is not to be sought, as Calvin supposes, in the desire to show "that the way was opened fore the angel to go straight to God, and that the cherubim were standing there ready, as it were, to contribute their labour." The position in which the cherubim appeared is more probably given with prospective reference to the account which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-9.htm">Ezekiel 10:9-22</a> of the departure of the glory of the Lord from the temple. As an indication of the significance of this act to Israel, the glory which issued from this manifestation of divine doxa is described in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3-5</a>. The cloud, as the earthly vehicle of the divine doxa, filled the inner court; and when the glory of the Lord stood upon the threshold, it filled the temple also, while the court became full of the splendour of the divine glory. That is to say, the brilliancy of the divine nature shone through the cloud, so that the court and the temple were lighted by the shining of the light-cloud. The brilliant splendour is a symbol of the light of the divine grace. The wings of the cherubim rustled, and at the movement of God (<a href="/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>) were audible even in the outer court.<p>After this picture of the glorious manifestation of the divine doxa, the fetching of the fire-coals from the space between the wheels under the cherubim is more closely described in <a href="/ezekiel/10-6.htm">Ezekiel 10:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/10-7.htm">Ezekiel 10:7</a>. One of the cherub's hands took the coals out of the fire, and put them into the hands of the man clothed in white linen. To this a supplementary remark is added in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-8.htm">Ezekiel 10:8</a>, to the effect that the figure of a hand was visible by the side of the cherubim under their wings. The word &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;, "and he went out," indicates that the man clothed in white linen scattered the coals over the city, to set it on fire and consume it. </body></html>
