These are the confederates or auxiliaries of the Turks, which shall join with them in this expedition. Persia is a neighbouring kingdom to the Turks, and may fall into their hands before this comes to pass; and is in a fair way for it at this time, through the internal divisions in it; however, it will be confederate with them. Ethiopia or Cush does not design the country of the Abyssines in the dominions of the Great Mogul, but Arabia Chusea, which lay between Judea and Egypt, and is now in the hands of the Turks; and Lybia or Phut is the name of one of the sons of Ham, <a href="/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a> who, according to Josephus (g), founded Lybia; and from him the inhabitants of it were called Phuteans (as they are here by the Targum); and he observes that there is a river of his name in Mauritania. Lybia is a country in Africa, to the west of Egypt and subject to the Turks: <p>all of them with shield and helmet; the Lybians are described by Jeremiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>, as <p>those that handle the shield; and the Egyptians, to whom the Lybians were near neighbours, and whom they might imitate in their warlike arms, as in other things, wore shields down to the feet, as Xenophon (h) relates. <p>(g) Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 2.((h) Cyropaedia, l. 6. c. 14. &amp; l. 7. c. 11. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Persia, Cush, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:</span><p>(c) The Persians, Ethiopians and men of Africa.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.

The LXX. translation, with which Hitzig agrees, "And thou shalt be to me for a guard," is manifestly wrong. </body></html>
