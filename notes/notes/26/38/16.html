The rendering “shew myself holy” is less natural, though the meaning is virtually the same.

He gets him sanctifying “in” or through Gog, as the object on whom his great operations of power are manifested.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In these verses Jehovah is represented on the one hand as bringing up Gog in order that he may be sanctified in him in the sight of the nations; and on the other hand Gog is represented as coming up of his own will, prompted by evil purposes, by the hope of an easy conquest and by lust of spoil. The first representation must not be pressed as if this case of Gog were something special, as if Jehovah for no object but to shew his power brought up against his people a leader and nation from the ends of the earth, who otherwise would have remained in peace in their distant abodes. Because such a view of the episode of Gog forgets in the first place the other side of the representation, viz. that Gog comes up of his own will, and with evil intent. It is the hope of an easy conquest and lust of spoil that animates him as well as the merchant peoples who follow in his train. This spirit of irreligious traffic on the part of these peoples is reprobated by the prophet and represented as antagonistic to the religion of Jehovah, just as it is in the case of Tyre (26–28). And secondly the view forgets the general teaching of the prophet, to the effect that Jehovah is in truth the author of all the great movements in the world, and that his operations have one great end in view, to reveal himself as that which he is to the nations of the world. His raising up Gog with this view is not a special thing, but one among many other similar things. To signalize it as something distinct and lift it out of the general current of the prophet’s conceptions creates an untrue impression of his teaching.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will be sanctified in thee, O Gog</span>.

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a>. Son of man, the house of Israel dwelt in its land, and defiled it with its way and its doings; like the uncleanness of the unclean woman, was its way before me. <a href="/ezekiel/36-18.htm">Ezekiel 36:18</a>. Then I poured out my fury upon them on account of the blood which they had shed in the land, and because they had defiled it through their idols, <a href="/ezekiel/36-19.htm">Ezekiel 36:19</a>. And scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed in the land; according to their way and their doings I judge them. <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a>. And they came to the nations whither they came, and profaned my holy name, for men said of them, "These are Jehovah's people, and they have come out of His land." <a href="/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21</a>. And so I had pity upon my holy name, which the house of Israel profaned among the nations whither they came. - The address commences with a description of the reasons why God had thrust out His people among the heathen, namely, on account of their sins and idolatrous abominations, by which the Israelites had defiled the land (cf. <a href="/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a> and <a href="/numbers/35-34.htm">Numbers 35:34</a>). Their conduct resembled the most offensive uncleanness, namely, the uncleanness of a woman in her menstruation (<a href="/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>), to which the moral depravity of the people had already been compared in <a href="/isaiah/64-5.htm">Isaiah 64:5</a>. - In <a href="/ezekiel/36-18.htm">Ezekiel 36:18</a> the consequence of the defiling of the land by the people is introduced with the impression &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498;. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a>, &#1493;&#1497;&#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is the continuation of the participle &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;; and the participle is expressive of the condition in the past, as we may see from the words '&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The simile in <a href="/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a> is an explanatory, circumstantial clause. For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-18.htm">Ezekiel 36:18</a>, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-8.htm">Ezekiel 7:8</a>, and for '&#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-3.htm">Ezekiel 22:3</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>. The last clause, "and through their idols they have defiled it," is loosely appended; but it really contains a second reason for the pouring out of the wrath of God upon the people. For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-19.htm">Ezekiel 36:19</a>, compare <a href="/ezekiel/22-15.htm">Ezekiel 22:15</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; in <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a> refers to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;; but there is no necessity to read &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; on that account. It is perfectly arbitrary to supply the subject proposed by Kliefoth, viz., "the report of what had happened to Israel" came to the heathen, which is quite foreign to the connection; for it was not the report concerning Israel, but Israel itself, which came to the heathen, and profaned the sacred name of God. This is not only plainly expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21</a>, but has been already stated in <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a>. The fact that the words of the heathen, by which the name of God was profaned, are quoted here, does not prove that it is the heathen nations who are to be regarded as those who profaned the name of God, as Kliefoth imagines. The words, "these are Jehovah's people, and have come out of His (Jehovah's) land," could only contain a profanation of the holy name of God, if their coming out was regarded as involuntary, i.e., as an exile enforced by the power of the heathen; or, on the other hand, if the Israelites themselves had denied the holiness of the people of God through their behaviour among the heathen. Most of the commentators have decided in favour of the former view. Vatablus, for example, gives this explanation: "if their God whom they preach had been omnipotent, He would not have allowed them to be expelled from His land." And we must decide in favour of this exposition, not only because of the parallel passages, such as <a href="/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-24.htm">Jeremiah 33:24</a>, which support this view; but chiefly on account of the verses which follow, according to which the sanctification of the name of God among the nations consists in the fact that God gathers Israel out of its dispersion among the nations, and leads them back into His own land (vid., <a href="/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a>). Consequently the profanation of His name can only have consisted in the fact that Israel was carried away out of its own land, and scattered in the heathen lands. For, since the heathen acknowledged only national gods, and regarded Jehovah as nothing more than such a national god of Israel, they did not look upon the destruction of the kingdom of Judah and the carrying away of the people as a judgment of the almighty and holy God upon His people, but concluded that that catastrophe was a sign of the inability of Jehovah to defend His land and save His people. The only way in which God could destroy this delusion was by manifesting Himself to the heathen as the almighty God and Lord of the whole world through the redemption and glorification of His people. &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1511;: so I had pity, compassion upon my holy name. The preterite is prophetic, inasmuch as the compassion consists in the gathering of Israel out of the nations, which is announced in <a href="/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22</a>. as still in the future. The rendering, "I spared (them) for my holy name's sake" (lxx, Hvernick), is false; for &#1495;&#1502;&#1500; is construed with &#1506;&#1500;, governing the person or the thing toward which the compassion is shown (vid., <a href="/ezekiel/16-5.htm">Ezekiel 16:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>).</body></html>
