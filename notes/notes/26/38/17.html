This concurs with many other indications in the prophecy to show that it does not relate to any particular event, but that Gog and his allies represent the enemies of the Church in general, and that the prophet is here depicting the same great and prolonged struggle between evil and good, between the powers of the world and the kingdom of God, which has formed the burden of so much of both earlier and later prophecy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/38.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/38-17.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Are you he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring you against them?">Ezekiel 38:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">Art thou he? — </span>This would be better translated, <span class="ital">Art thou not he? </span>a sense which the Hebrew particle of interrogation often imports; <span class="ital">of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets — </span>“It is doubtful by what prophets God foretold the irruption of Gog; but though nothing of this kind be found in the prophets that remain, it is enough that Ezekiel did not first foretel these things.

The question gives vividness to the fact of Gog’s invasion having been long predicted, and identifies him with the subject of these predictions. These former prophecies had not named Gog; the identification is matter of inference.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">those days</span> many <span class="ital">years</span>] The construction is peculiar, but this is probably the sense. Gog, though not by name, had formed the subject of repeated predictions by many prophets. The prophecies referred to are probably such as Zephaniah 1 (<a href="/ezekiel/3-8.htm" title="Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.">Ezekiel 3:8</a>), which agrees with Ezek. <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/38-20.htm" title="So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep on the earth, and all the men that are on the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.">Ezekiel 38:20</a></span> in mentioning the fishes of the sea (again only <a href="/hosea/4-3.htm" title="Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwells therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yes, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.">Hosea 4:3</a>), and Jeremiah 3-6 (<a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm" title="Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!">Isaiah 17:12</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.). The age of Joel may be later than Ezek., and passages like Joel 3, Zechariah 14, possibly repose rather on him, or at all events shew the continued prevalence of the same ideas, which indeed passed as current conceptions into the Apocalyptic prophecy dating from this age. The passage <a href="/micah/4-11.htm" title="Now also many nations are gathered against you, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look on Zion.">Micah 4:11</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>. is also of uncertain date. It is possible that the invasion of the Scythians may have suggested the prophecies of Zeph. and Jer., though the supposition is less necessary in the case of the latter prophet. It is not likely, however, that Ezekiel’s renewal of the prophecy was occasioned by any fresh movements among these northern nations occurring in his time (Sm. Kuen.), because he regards the inroad of Gog as an event to happen in the far distant future.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">17–23</span>. This invasion of Gog has been long predicted. It shall be the occasion of a final manifestation of himself by Jehovah to creation and the nations, which shall inspire universal awe, and leave in the minds of all mankind the knowledge of Jehovah, and that which he is.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time</span>? As no existing prophecy, prior to Ezekiel's time, mentions Cog by name, it must be concluded either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Ezekiel refers to prophecies known in his day, though no longer extant; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that his words simply mean that earlier prophets had predicted such an invasion of Israel in the last times as that which he announces under the leadership of Gog. The former opinion, though countenanced by Ewald, Kuenen, and Smend, is less probable than the latter, which expositors both ancient and modern favor. Schroder considers the hypothesis that earlier prophets had spoken of Gog by name as excluded by the interrogatory form of the sentence, since, had Cog been thus explicitly pointed out, there would, he thinks, have been no need to ask, "Art thou he?" But it is doubtful if the interrogatory form of the words had any other intention than to lend emphasis to the assertion that Gog was he to whom the earlier prophets had unconsciously referred. As to which earlier prophets he alluded opinions vary. Ewald cites <a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4</a>; Smend adding <a href="/micah/5-11.htm">Micah 5:11</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>; Keil, <a href="/isaiah/25-5.htm">Isaiah 25:5, 10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-23.htm">Jeremiah 30:23</a>, 25; Joel 4:2, 11, etc.; Hengstenberg, <a href="/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24-27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>; and Fairbairn, <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17-24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-28.htm">Isaiah 14:28-32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/18.htm">Isaiah 18</a>; <a href="/joel/3.htm">Joel 3</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44, 45</a>; though Schroder is probably correct in holding that all should be included which represent the hostility of the heathen world as culminating in the latter days in a grand concentrated attack upon Israel. Smend sees in the unusual phenomenon that Ezekiel reflects upon earlier prophecies an indication of the declining spirit of prophetism; it should, however, rather be regarded as a sign of superior spiritual insight on the part of Ezekiel, who could discern that from the first the prophets had been guided in their utterances by One who was intimately acquainted with the whole world-program, and knew the end from the beginning, so that however dark and enigmatical their predictions might be when taken separately, when viewed in connection they were recognized as forming parts of a harmonious whole. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Salvation of Israel Founded upon Its Sanctification<p>Because Israel has defiled its land by its sins, God has scattered the people among the heathen; but because they also profaned His name among the heathen, He will exercise forbearance for the sake of His holy name (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-16.htm">Ezekiel 36:16-21</a>), will gather Israel out of the lands, cleanse it from its sins, and sanctify it by the communication of His Spirit, so that it will walk in His ways (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22-28</a>), and will so bless and multiply it, that both the nations around and Israel itself will know that He is the Lord (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-29.htm">Ezekiel 36:29-38</a>). - This promise is shown by the introductory formula in <a href="/ezekiel/36-16.htm">Ezekiel 36:16</a> and by the contents to be an independent word of God; but it is substantially connected in the closest manner with the preceding word of God, showing, on the one hand, the motive which prompted God to restore and bless His people;, and, on the other hand, the means by which He would permanently establish the salvation predicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-1.htm">Ezekiel 36:1-15</a>. - The kernel of this promise is formed by <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-28</a>, for which the way is prepared in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17-24</a>, whilst the further extension is contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-29.htm">Ezekiel 36:29-38</a>.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-16.htm">Ezekiel 36:16-21</a><p>The Lord will extend His forbearance, for the sake of His holy name, to the people who have been rejected on account of their sins. - <a href="/ezekiel/36-16.htm">Ezekiel 36:16</a>.

Then I poured out my fury upon them on account of the blood which they had shed in the land, and because they had defiled it through their idols, <a href="/ezekiel/36-19.htm">Ezekiel 36:19</a>.

And so I had pity upon my holy name, which the house of Israel profaned among the nations whither they came. - The address commences with a description of the reasons why God had thrust out His people among the heathen, namely, on account of their sins and idolatrous abominations, by which the Israelites had defiled the land (cf. <a href="/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a> and <a href="/numbers/35-34.htm">Numbers 35:34</a>). Their conduct resembled the most offensive uncleanness, namely, the uncleanness of a woman in her menstruation (<a href="/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>), to which the moral depravity of the people had already been compared in <a href="/isaiah/64-5.htm">Isaiah 64:5</a>. - In <a href="/ezekiel/36-18.htm">Ezekiel 36:18</a> the consequence of the defiling of the land by the people is introduced with the impression &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498;.

The simile in <a href="/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a> is an explanatory, circumstantial clause. For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-18.htm">Ezekiel 36:18</a>, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-8.htm">Ezekiel 7:8</a>, and for '&#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-3.htm">Ezekiel 22:3</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>. The last clause, "and through their idols they have defiled it," is loosely appended; but it really contains a second reason for the pouring out of the wrath of God upon the people. For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-19.htm">Ezekiel 36:19</a>, compare <a href="/ezekiel/22-15.htm">Ezekiel 22:15</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; in <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a> refers to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;; but there is no necessity to read &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; on that account. It is perfectly arbitrary to supply the subject proposed by Kliefoth, viz., "the report of what had happened to Israel" came to the heathen, which is quite foreign to the connection; for it was not the report concerning Israel, but Israel itself, which came to the heathen, and profaned the sacred name of God. This is not only plainly expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21</a>, but has been already stated in <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a>. The fact that the words of the heathen, by which the name of God was profaned, are quoted here, does not prove that it is the heathen nations who are to be regarded as those who profaned the name of God, as Kliefoth imagines. The words, "these are Jehovah's people, and have come out of His (Jehovah's) land," could only contain a profanation of the holy name of God, if their coming out was regarded as involuntary, i.e., as an exile enforced by the power of the heathen; or, on the other hand, if the Israelites themselves had denied the holiness of the people of God through their behaviour among the heathen. Most of the commentators have decided in favour of the former view. Vatablus, for example, gives this explanation: "if their God whom they preach had been omnipotent, He would not have allowed them to be expelled from His land." And we must decide in favour of this exposition, not only because of the parallel passages, such as <a href="/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-24.htm">Jeremiah 33:24</a>, which support this view; but chiefly on account of the verses which follow, according to which the sanctification of the name of God among the nations consists in the fact that God gathers Israel out of its dispersion among the nations, and leads them back into His own land (vid., <a href="/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a>). Consequently the profanation of His name can only have consisted in the fact that Israel was carried away out of its own land, and scattered in the heathen lands. For, since the heathen acknowledged only national gods, and regarded Jehovah as nothing more than such a national god of Israel, they did not look upon the destruction of the kingdom of Judah and the carrying away of the people as a judgment of the almighty and holy God upon His people, but concluded that that catastrophe was a sign of the inability of Jehovah to defend His land and save His people. The only way in which God could destroy this delusion was by manifesting Himself to the heathen as the almighty God and Lord of the whole world through the redemption and glorification of His people. &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1511;: so I had pity, compassion upon my holy name. The preterite is prophetic, inasmuch as the compassion consists in the gathering of Israel out of the nations, which is announced in <a href="/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22</a>. as still in the future. The rendering, "I spared (them) for my holy name's sake" (lxx, Hvernick), is false; for &#1495;&#1502;&#1500; is construed with &#1506;&#1500;, governing the person or the thing toward which the compassion is shown (vid., <a href="/ezekiel/16-5.htm">Ezekiel 16:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>).</body></html>
