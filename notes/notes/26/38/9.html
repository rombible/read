It is supposed these enemies will come together to invade the land of Judea, and God will defeat them.

It is a description of the actual condition at the time of Gog's invasion (compare <a href="/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>). Such was the condition of the restored Jews in their prosperous days, after which came invasion.

Taken together, the images suggest that Gog's invasion should burst forth suddenly, rage violently, spread quickly, alarm greatly, but cease finally. Storms roar and crash, alarm and destroy, but do not continue. Clouds diffuse gloom and fear, but ultimately disperse. </body></html>
