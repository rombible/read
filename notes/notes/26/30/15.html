Sin&#8212;that is, Pelusium, the frontier fortress on the northeast, therefore called "the strength (that is, the key) of Egypt."

If we read as the margin, it is plain, God does threaten Pelusium after No is cut off; if we retain our own translation, we must think of another city of that name, which God threatens with Sin. Now this may be Thebe Egyptiacae or this city may be Hamon No, called Diospolis, the city of Jupiter; possibly it may be the same mentioned already, and the threat repeated to confirm it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I will pour out my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt,.... Either the city Sais, as the Septuagint and Arabic versions; or rather Pelusium, as the Vulgate Latin version, so called from "pelos" which signifies "clay" in the Greek language; and the same "Sin" signifies in the Chaldee, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a>, and as now called Tineh, from  "clay": it had a very fine haven, and may be called the strength of Egypt, it lying at the entrance of it; and having a strong fortified tower, it was difficult to enter into it; but could not stand before the wrath and fury of the Lord of hosts, when he sent the Chaldeans to it. It is thought by some to be the same with Pithom, built by the first of the pastor kings of Egypt, and fortified by him, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>, according to Manetho (z), he put into it a garrison of two hundred and forty thousand men; and the same writer says it contained ten thousand acres of land; according to Adrichomius (a), it was two and a half miles in compass, and near it was a vast hollow, which extended to Mount Cassius, and which made the way into Egypt on that side difficult; and is now, as he says, called "campus de Gallo"; in which he is mistaken, as well as Thevenot, and others, who take it to be the same with Damieta: <p>and I will cut off the multitude of No; the numerous inhabitants of it; hence called "populous No", <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-8.htm">Nahum 3:8</a>, or "Hamon No"; See Gill on <a href="/ezekiel/30-14.htm">Ezekiel 30:14</a>; here, as before observed, the Septuagint version renders it Memphis; as does also the Arabic version. Some take it, as before, to be the Egyptian Thebes, where was a temple dedicated to Jupiter Hammon; and which city, Pausanias (b) says, was reduced to nothing in his time. <p>(z) Apud Joseph. contr.

The remains of an old fortress near the town are still known as <span class="accented">Tineh</span>, the "clay" of <a href="/daniel/2-41.htm">Daniel 2:41</a>. The fortress stood on the eastern branch of the Nile, surrounded by swamps, and its position made it, in modern phrase, the "key" of Egypt. Suidas and Strabo (<span class="accented">ut supra</span>) describe it as an obstacle to invaders from the East.
