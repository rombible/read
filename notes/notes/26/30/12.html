Egypt was a country that abounded with rivers; however, with canals cut from the river Nile; its wealth and riches very much depended here on, partly on account of the multitude of fishes taken out of them, and the paper reeds that grew upon their banks; but chiefly because the whole land, was watered by them, and made exceeding fruitful, rain being not so common in it; so that to dry up the riven was in effect to take away their substance and dependence; besides, hereby the way was made easy and passable for the enemy; there was nothing to obstruct him, he could overrun and ravage the land at pleasure: <p>and sell the land into the hand of the wicked; the Chaldeans under Nebuchadnezzar, who were wicked idolaters, men of flagitious lives, and of merciless and cruel dispositions; who would show no favour to the inhabitants of the land, when delivered up to them, which is called a selling it; for, as things sold are delivered to the buyer, so should this land be to them; which though they had no right to it before, yet by the event of war, and disposal of divine Providence, came to have a property in it, given them by him who is the proprietor of all lands; and after them into the hands of the Persians, under Cambyses, and Ochus; who were very wicked and cruel princes, and may be reckoned among the terrible or violent ones of the nations in the preceding verse; and then into the hands of the Grecian, Romans, Saracen, Mamaluck, and now the Turks, all very wicked people: <p>and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers; the Babylonians, people of another country and distant, of another language, and with whom they had no commerce, alliance, and friendship, and so would not spare them, and their land, when in their possession; and so all the rest above mentioned, into whose hands they successively fell: <p>I the Lord have spoken it; determined it, prophesied of it; and it shall come to pass, as it did accordingly. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">make the rivers dry</span>] Cf. <a href="/context/isaiah/19-5.htm" title="And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up....">Isaiah 19:5-6</a>.

The <span class="accented">rivers</span> are the Nile-blanches of the Delta, and their being <span class="accented">dried</span> up points, perhaps, literally to a failure in the inundation of the Nile on which its fertility depended; figuratively to a like failure of all its sources of prosperity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Prophecy Against Sidon and Promise for Israel<p>The threatening word against Sidon is very brief, and couched in general terms, because as a matter of fact the prophecy against Tyre involved the announcement of the fall of Sidon, which was dependent upon it; and, as we have already observed, Sidon received a special word of God simply for the purpose of making up the number of the heathen nations mentioned to the significant number seven. The word of God against Sidon brings to a close the cycle of predictions of judgment directed against those heathen nations which had given expression to malicious pleasure at the overthrow of the kingdom of Judah. There is therefore appended a promise for Israel (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/28-26.htm">Ezekiel 28:26</a>), which is really closely connected with the threatening words directed against the heathen nations, and for which the way is prepared by <a href="/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a>. The correspondence of &#1504;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1492;&#1468; (I shall be sanctified in her) in <a href="/ezekiel/28-22.htm">Ezekiel 28:22</a> to &#1504;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1501; (I shall be sanctified in them) in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>, serves to place the future fate of Israel in antithesis not merely to the future fate of Sidon, but, as <a href="/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/28-26.htm">Ezekiel 28:26</a> clearly show, to that of all the heathen nations against which the previous threats have been directed.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-20.htm">Ezekiel 28:20-24</a><p>And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/28-21.htm">Ezekiel 28:21</a>. Son of man, direct thy face towards Sidon, and prophesy against it, <a href="/ezekiel/28-22.htm">Ezekiel 28:22</a>. And say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will be against thee, O Sidon, and will glorify myself in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I execute judgments upon it, and sanctify myself upon it. <a href="/ezekiel/28-23.htm">Ezekiel 28:23</a>. I will send pestilence into it, and blood into its streets; slain will fall in the midst of it by the sword, which cometh upon it from every side; and they shall learn that I am Jehovah. <a href="/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a>. And there shall be no more to the house of Israel a malignant thorn and smarting sting from all round about them, who despise them; but they shall learn that I am the Lord Jehovah. - Jehovah will glorify Himself as the Lord upon Sidon, as He did before upon Pharaoh (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16-17</a>, to which the word &#1504;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-22.htm">Ezekiel 28:22</a>, an unusual expression for Ezekiel, evidently points). The glorification is effected by judgments, through which He proves Himself to be holy upon the enemies of His people. He executes the judgments through pestilence and blood (vid., <a href="/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>), i.e., through disease and bloodshed occasioned by war, so that men fall, slain by the sword (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>). Instead of &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; we have the intensive form &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1500;, which is regarded by Ewald and Hitzig as a copyist's error, because it is only met with here. Through these judgments the Lord will liberate His people Israel from all round about, who increase its suffering by their contempt. These thoughts sum up in <a href="/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a> the design of God's judgments upon all the neighbouring nations which are threatened in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25-28</a>, and thus prepare the way for the concluding promise in <a href="/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/28-26.htm">Ezekiel 28:26</a>. The figure of the sting and thorn points back to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>, where it is said that the Canaanites whom Israel failed to exterminate would become thorns in its eyes and stings in its sides. As Israel did not keep itself free from the Canaanitish nature of the heathen nations, God caused it to fell these stings of heathenism. Having been deeply hurt by them, it was now lying utterly prostrate with its wounds. The sins of Canaan, to which Israel had given itself up, had occasioned the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>). But Israel is not to succumb to its wounds. On the contrary, by destroying the heathen powers, the Lord will heal His people of the wounds which its heathen neighbours have inflicted upon it. &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, synonymous with &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-6.htm">Ezekiel 2:6</a>, a word only found in Ezekiel. &#1502;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512;, on the contrary, is taken from <a href="/leviticus/13-51.htm">Leviticus 13:51</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/14-44.htm">Leviticus 14:44</a>, where it is applied to malignant leprosy (see the comm. on the former passage). - For &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, see <a href="/ezekiel/16-57.htm">Ezekiel 16:57</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a>.</body></html>
