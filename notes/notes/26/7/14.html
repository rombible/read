Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all.

There may possibly be an allusion to the trumpet blowing with which the jubilee year (see ver. 13) was ushered in. The trumpet should sound, not for each man's return to his own estate, but for the alarm of war. and even then the consciousness of guilt will hinder men from arming themselves for battle (comp. <a href="/leviticus/26-36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The End Cometh<p><a href="/ezekiel/7-1.htm">Ezekiel 7:1</a>.

And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An end to the land of Israel! the end cometh upon the four borders of the land. <a href="/ezekiel/7-3.htm">Ezekiel 7:3</a>.

It commences with an emphatic utterance of the thought, that the end is coming to the land of Israel, i.e., to the kingdom of Judah, with its capital Jerusalem. Desecrated as it has been by the abominations of its inhabitants, it will cease to be the land of God's people Israel. '&#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474; (to the land of Israel) is not to be taken with &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (thus saith the Lord) in opposition to the accents, but is connected with qeets &#1511;&#1509; (an end), as in the Targ. and Vulgate, and is placed first for the sake of greater emphasis. In the construction, compare <a href="/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>. &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is limited by the parallelism to the four extremities of the land of Israel. It is used elsewhere for the whole earth (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>). The Chetib &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; is placed, in opposition to the ordinary rule, before a noun in the feminine gender. The Keri gives the regular construction (vid., Ewald, 267c). In <a href="/ezekiel/7-3.htm">Ezekiel 7:3</a> the end is explained to be a wrathful judgment. "Give (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503;) thine abominations upon thee;" i.e., send the consequences, inflict punishment for them. The same thought is expressed in the phrase, "thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee;" in other words, they would discern them in the punishments which the abominations would bring in their train. For <a href="/ezekiel/7-4.htm">Ezekiel 7:4</a> compare <a href="/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a>. </body></html>
