Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is at hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The morning - Rather, "The conclusion:" a whole series (literally circle) of events is being brought to a close.

The connection with '&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is analogous to the construction of &#1492;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;, in the sense of "giving a superabundance," with &#1489;&#1468; rei, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-11.htm">Deuteronomy 28:11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-9.htm">Deuteronomy 30:9</a>, and is not to be rejected, with Ewald and Hitzig, as inadmissible. For &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; is supported by the old versions, and the change of &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; into &#1493;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, which would have to be referred to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>, is in opposition to the twofold repetition of the &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1503; (&#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;), <a href="/ezekiel/6-10.htm">Ezekiel 6:10</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a>, as this repetition shows that the thought in <a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a> is different from that in 17, 21, not "they shall know that Jehovah has spoken," but "they shall know that He who has done this is Jehovah, the God of Israel." The preservation of a remnant will be shown in this, that they shall have some who have escaped the sword. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; is infin. Niph. with a plural form of the suffix, as occurs elsewhere only with the plural ending &#1493;&#1514; of nouns, while Ezekiel has extended it to the &#1493;&#1514; of the infinitive of &#1492;''&#1500; verbs; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-31.htm">Ezekiel 16:31</a>, and Ewald, 259b. The remembrance of Jehovah (<a href="/ezekiel/6-9.htm">Ezekiel 6:9</a>) is the commencement of conversion to Him. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is not to be connected as relative pronoun with &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, but is a conjunction, though not used conditionally, "if," as in <a href="/leviticus/4-22.htm">Leviticus 4:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-27.htm">Deuteronomy 11:27</a>, and elsewhere, but of time, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;, "when," as <a href="/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20</a>, and &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in the signification of the futur. exact. The Niphal &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; here is not to be taken as passive, but middle, sibi frangere, i.e., &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, poenitenti conterere animum eorum ut ad ipsum (Deum) redeant (Maurer, Hvernick). Besides the heart, the eyes also are mentioned, which God is to smite, as the external senses which allure the heart to whoredom. &#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468; corresponds to &#1493;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; at the beginning of the verse. &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, "the later form for &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, "to feel a loathing," Hiphil, "to be filled with loathing;" cf. <a href="/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a> with &#1489; object., "in (on) their &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, faces," i.e., their persons or themselves: so also in <a href="/ezekiel/20-43.htm">Ezekiel 20:43</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-31.htm">Ezekiel 36:31</a>. &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, in allusion to the evil things; '&#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1489;, in reference to all their abominations. This fruit, which is produced by chastisement, namely, that he idolaters are inspired with loathing for themselves, and led to the knowledge of Jehovah, will furnish the proof that God has not spoken in vain. </body></html>
