There are many whose wealth is their snare and ruin; and the gaining the world is the losing of their souls. Riches profit not in the day of wrath. The wealth of this world has not that in it which will answer the desires of the soul, or be any satisfaction to it in a day of distress. God's temple shall stand them in no stead.

The description returns from the condition of the fugitives to that of the besieged. Prostration and despair seizes them. The figures of the hands “hanging down,” and the knees becoming “water” are expressive of complete paralysis of strength. LXX. Hitz. interpret the latter phrase literally. Cf. ch. <a href="/ezekiel/21-7.htm" title="And it shall be, when they say to you, Why sigh you? that you shall answer, For the tidings; because it comes: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it comes, and shall be brought to pass, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 21:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-7.htm" title="Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:">Isaiah 13:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm" title="We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.">Jeremiah 6:24</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All knees shall be weak as water</span>; literally, <span class="accented">shall flow with water.</span> So the Vulgate. The LXX. is yet stronger, <span class="accented">shall be defiled</span>, etc. The words may point to the cold sweat of terror which paralyzes men's power to act. The phrase is peculiar to Ezekiel, and meets us again in <a href="/ezekiel/21-7.htm">Ezekiel 21:7</a>. The thought finds a parallel in <a href="/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The End Cometh<p><a href="/ezekiel/7-1.htm">Ezekiel 7:1</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me thus: <a href="/ezekiel/7-2.htm">Ezekiel 7:2</a>. And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An end to the land of Israel! the end cometh upon the four borders of the land. <a href="/ezekiel/7-3.htm">Ezekiel 7:3</a>. Now (cometh) the end upon thee, and I shall send my wrath upon thee, and judge thee according to thy ways, and bring upon thee all thine abominations. <a href="/ezekiel/7-4.htm">Ezekiel 7:4</a>. And my eye shall not look with pity upon thee, and I shall not spare, but bring thy ways upon thee; and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee, that ye may know that I am Jehovah. - &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; - .havoheJ ma I, with the copula, connects this word of God with the preceding one, and shows it to be a continuation. It commences with an emphatic utterance of the thought, that the end is coming to the land of Israel, i.e., to the kingdom of Judah, with its capital Jerusalem. Desecrated as it has been by the abominations of its inhabitants, it will cease to be the land of God's people Israel. '&#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474; (to the land of Israel) is not to be taken with &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (thus saith the Lord) in opposition to the accents, but is connected with qeets &#1511;&#1509; (an end), as in the Targ. and Vulgate, and is placed first for the sake of greater emphasis. In the construction, compare <a href="/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>. &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is limited by the parallelism to the four extremities of the land of Israel. It is used elsewhere for the whole earth (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>). The Chetib &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; is placed, in opposition to the ordinary rule, before a noun in the feminine gender. The Keri gives the regular construction (vid., Ewald, 267c). In <a href="/ezekiel/7-3.htm">Ezekiel 7:3</a> the end is explained to be a wrathful judgment. "Give (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503;) thine abominations upon thee;" i.e., send the consequences, inflict punishment for them. The same thought is expressed in the phrase, "thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee;" in other words, they would discern them in the punishments which the abominations would bring in their train. For <a href="/ezekiel/7-4.htm">Ezekiel 7:4</a> compare <a href="/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a>. </body></html>
