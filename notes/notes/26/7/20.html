Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Misfortune, a singular misfortune, behold, it cometh. <a href="/ezekiel/7-6.htm">Ezekiel 7:6</a>. End cometh: there cometh the end; it waketh upon thee; behold, it cometh. <a href="/ezekiel/7-7.htm">Ezekiel 7:7</a>. The fate cometh upon thee, inhabitants of the land: the time cometh, the day is near; tumult and not joy upon the mountains. <a href="/ezekiel/7-8.htm">Ezekiel 7:8</a>. Now speedily will I pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger on thee; and judge thee according to thy ways, and bring upon thee all thine abominations. <a href="/ezekiel/7-9.htm">Ezekiel 7:9</a>. My eye shall not look with pity upon thee, and I shall not spare; according to thy ways will I bring it upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee, that ye may know that I, Jehovah, am smiting. - Misfortune of a singular kind shall come. &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is made more emphatic by &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, in which &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; is placed first for the sake of emphasis, in the sense of unicus, singularis; a calamity singular (unique) of its kind, such as never had occurred before (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/5-9.htm">Ezekiel 5:9</a>). In <a href="/ezekiel/7-6.htm">Ezekiel 7:6</a> the poetical &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1509;, it (the end) waketh upon thee, is suggested by the paronomasia with &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509;. The force of the words is weakened by supplying Jehovah as the subject to &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1509;, in opposition to the context. And it will not do to supply &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; (evil) from <a href="/ezekiel/7-5.htm">Ezekiel 7:5</a> as the subject to  &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1488;&#1492; (behold, it cometh). &#1489;&#1488;&#1492; is construed impersonally: It cometh, namely, every dreadful thing which the end brings with it. The meaning of tzephira&#770;h is doubtful. The only other passage in which it occurs is <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-5.htm">Isaiah 28:5</a>, where it is used in the sense of diadem or crown, which is altogether unsuitable here. Raschi has therefore had recourse to the Syriac and Chaldee &#1510;&#1508;&#1512;&#1488;, aurora, tempus matutinum, and Hvernick has explained it accordingly, "the dawn of an evil day." But the dawn is never used as a symbol or omen of misfortune, not even in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>, but solely as the sign of the bursting forth of light or of salvation. Abarbanel was on the right track when he started from the radical meaning of &#1510;&#1508;&#1512;, to twist, and taking tzephira&#770;h in the sense of orbis, ordo, or periodical return, understood it as probably denoting rerum fatique vicissitudinem in orbem redeuntem (Ges. Thes. p. 1188). But it has been justly observed, that the rendering succession, or periodical return, can only give a forced sense in <a href="/ezekiel/7-10.htm">Ezekiel 7:10</a>. Winer has given a better rendering, viz., fatum, malum fatale, fate or destiny, for which he refers to the Arabic tsabramun, intortum, then fatum haud mutandum inevitabile. Different explanations have also been given of &#1492;&#1491; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. But the opinion that it is synonymous with &#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1491;, the joyous vintage cry (<a href="/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>), is a more probable one than that it is an unusual form of &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;, splendor, gloria. So much at any rate is obvious from the context, that the hapax legomenon dh&#768; is the antithesis of &#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, tumult, or the noise of war. The shouting of the mountains, is shouting, a rejoicing upon the mountains. &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;, from the immediate vicinity, in a temporal not a local sense, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a> ( equals  immediately). For &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; , see <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-1.htm">Ezekiel 6:1-14</a>;12. The remainder of the strophe (<a href="/ezekiel/7-8.htm">Ezekiel 7:8</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/7-9.htm">Ezekiel 7:9</a>) is a repetition of <a href="/ezekiel/7-3.htm">Ezekiel 7:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/7-4.htm">Ezekiel 7:4</a>; but &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; is added in the last clause. They shall learn that it is Jehovah who smites. This thought is expanded in the following strophe. </body></html>
