Ezekiel wishes to awaken them from their lethargy, whereby they were promising to themselves an uninterrupted night (1Th 5:5-7), as if they were never to be called to account [Calvin]. The expression, "morning," refers to the fact that this was the usual time for magistrates giving sentence against offenders (compare Eze 7:10, below; Ps 101:8; Jer 21:12).

Or it may allude to the music with which their idol worship was celebrated in mountains, high places, in valleys, & C, whence the sound was heard and echoed from hill to hill.

That is, early ruin was come, or was coming, upon the inhabitants of Judea, which before is said to be awake, and to watch for them; and now the day being broke, the morning come, it hastened to them. Some, because this word (g) is used in <a href="/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>; for a crown or diadem, think a crowned head, a king, is here meant; particularly Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the instrument of the destruction of Jerusalem.

The term occurs in <a href="/isaiah/28-5.htm" title="In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people,">Isaiah 28:5</a> in the sense of crown or chaplet, probably from the idea of encircling, going a round or circuit (<a href="/judges/7-3.htm" title="Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead.

Dukes quotes a Chaldee proverb of Sirach in which another form of the word has the sense of <span class="ital">times</span> (a hundred times, <span class="ital">Blumenlese</span>, p. 80).

Here the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span>, something twirled, out of which may come the meaning of the changes of fortune. Possibly, as in the familiar "wheel of fortune," that thought was involved in the circular form by itself. In the Tahnud it appears as the name of the goddess of fate at Ascalon (Furst). On the whole, I follow the Revised Version, Keil, and Ewald, in giving "thy doom." The "morning" of the Authorized Version probably rises from the thought that the dawn is, as it were, the glory and diadem of the day.

Not that, the prophet says, shall be heard on the mountains, but in its place the cry of battle and the noise of war. The LXX.
