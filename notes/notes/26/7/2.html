(Comp. <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm" title="And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1</a>.) The origin of the expression is to be sought, not in any supposed popular belief that the earth was square, but in the fact that so many common things had just four sides or four corners (see <a href="/exodus/25-12.htm" title="And you shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.">Exodus 25:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/27-2.htm" title="And you shall make the horns of it on the four corners thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and you shall overlay it with brass.">Exodus 27:2</a>; <a href="/job/1-19.htm" title="And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.">Job 1:19</a>; <a href="/acts/10-11.htm" title="And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending on him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:">Acts 10:11</a>, &c), that the phrase came naturally to be a common expression of universality. “An end, the end,” is a repetition for the sake of emphasis. It occurs again in <a href="/ezekiel/7-6.htm" title="An end is come, the end is come: it watches for you; behold, it is come.">Ezekiel 7:6</a>, and, in varied words, also in <a href="/ezekiel/7-10.htm" title="Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.">Ezekiel 7:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/7-12.htm" title="The time is come, the day draws near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is on all the multitude thereof.">Ezekiel 7:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/7-26.htm" title="Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.">Ezekiel 7:26</a>.<p><a href="/context/ezekiel/7-3.htm" title="Now is the end come on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways, and will recompense on you all your abominations.">Ezekiel 7:3-4</a> are repeated almost exactly in <a href="/context/ezekiel/7-8.htm" title="Now will I shortly pour out my fury on you, and accomplish my anger on you: and I will judge you according to your ways, and will recompense you for all your abominations.">Ezekiel 7:8-9</a>. The frequent repetitions of this chapter are designed, and give great force to the denunciation of woe. “Thine abominations are in the midst of thee,” in the sense of calling down punishment upon them, as appears from the parallel in <a href="/ezekiel/7-9.htm" title="And my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense you according to your ways and your abominations that are in the middle of you; and you shall know that I am the LORD that smites.">Ezekiel 7:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ezekiel/7-2.htm" title="Also, you son of man, thus said the Lord GOD to the land of Israel; An end, the end is come on the four corners of the land....">Ezekiel 7:2-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord unto the land of Israel — </span>Unto the inhabitants of the land.

Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is at hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A dirge.

Son of man, turn thy face towards the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them. <a href="/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3</a>. And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, and to the hills, to the valleys, and to the low grounds, Behold, I bring the sword upon you, and destroy your high places. <a href="/ezekiel/6-4.htm">Ezekiel 6:4</a>. Your altars shall be made desolate, and your sun-pillars shall be broken; and I shall make your slain fall in the presence of your idols. <a href="/ezekiel/6-5.htm">Ezekiel 6:5</a>.

In all your dwellings shall the cities be made desolate, and the high places waste; that your altars may be desolate and waste, and your idols broken and destroyed, and your sun-pillars hewn down, and the works of your hands exterminated. <a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>. And the slain will fall in your midst; that you may know that I am Jehovah. - With <a href="/ezekiel/6-1.htm">Ezekiel 6:1</a> cf. <a href="/ezekiel/3-16.htm">Ezekiel 3:16</a>. The prophet is to prophesy against the mountains of Israel. That the mountains are mentioned (<a href="/ezekiel/6-2.htm">Ezekiel 6:2</a>) as pars pro toto, is seen from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3</a>, when to the mountains and hills are added also the valleys and low grounds, as the places where idolatry was specially practised; cf. <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>; see on Hos. l.c. and <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>. &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, in the older writings, denotes the "river channels," "the beds of the stream;" but Ezekiel uses the word as equivalent to valley, i.e., &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, a valley with a brook or stream, like the Arabic wady. &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;, properly "deepening," "the deep ground," "the deep valley;" on the form &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, cf. Ewald, 186da. The juxtaposition of mountains and hills, of valleys and low grounds, occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-6.htm">Ezekiel 36:6</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/35-8.htm">Ezekiel 35:8</a>; the opposition between mountains and valleys also, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-5.htm">Ezekiel 32:5-6</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/24-13.htm">Ezekiel 24:13</a>. The valleys are to be conceived of as furnished with trees and groves, under the shadow of which the worship of Astarte especially was practised; see on v. 15. On the mountains and in the valleys were sanctuaries erected to Baal and Astarte. The announcement of their destruction is appended to the threatening in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>, which Ezekiel takes up and describes at greater length. Beside the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the places of sacrifice and worship, and the &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, pillars or statues of Baal, dedicated to him as the sun-god, he names also the altars, which, in Lev. l.c. and other places, are comprehended along with the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; eht htiw; see on <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a> and <a href="/1_kings/3-3.htm">1 Kings 3:3</a>. With the destruction of the idol temples, altars, and statues, the idol-worshippers are also to be smitten, so as to fall down in the presence of their idols. The fundamental meaning of the word &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, "idols," borrowed from Lev. l.c., and frequently employed by Ezekiel, is uncertain; signifying either "logs of wood," from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, "to roll" (Gesen.), or stercorei, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, "dung;" not "monuments of stone" (Hvernick). <a href="/ezekiel/6-5.htm">Ezekiel 6:5</a> is taken quite literally from <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>. The ignominy of the destruction is heightened by the bones of the slain idolaters being scattered round about the idol altars. In order that the idolatry may be entirely rooted out, the cities throughout the whole land, and all the high places, are to be devastated, <a href="/ezekiel/6-6.htm">Ezekiel 6:6</a>. The forms &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; are probably not to be derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501; (Ewald, 138b), but to be referred back to a stem-form &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, with the signification of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;, the existence of which appears certain from the old name &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68.htm">Psalm 68</a> and elsewhere. The &#1488; in &#1497;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; is certainly only mater lectonis. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>, the singular &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; stands as indefinitely general. The thought, "slain will fall in your midst," involves the idea that not all the people will fall, but that there will survive some who are saved, and prepares for what follows. The falling of the slain - the idolaters with their idols - leads to the recognition of Jehovah as the omnipotent God, and to conversion to Him. </body></html>
