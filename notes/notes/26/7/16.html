Some few should escape the pestilence, famine, and sword, and flee to the mountains, where they should live a very miserable and uncomfortable life; so that this is no contradiction to the wrath of God being upon the whole multitude, <a href="/ezekiel/7-12.htm">Ezekiel 7:12</a>; as it follows: <p>and shall be on the mountains; whither they shall flee, when the city is broken up and taken; and so the Syriac version reads it, in connection with the preceding words, "and they that escape of them shall escape to the mountains"; barren and desert places, where they shall find no subsistence, nor have any agreeable company and conversation, but live in solitude and distress: <p>like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, everyone for his iniquity: like doves that live in valleys, or gather together there, and hide themselves in the holes of the rocks, on the sides of the valleys, from birds of prey; or are so called, to distinguish them from wild doves, which, when they have lost their mates, make a very mournful noise, though not loud and clamorous. So those Jews that escaped, being in such an uncomfortable condition, turned out of house and home, and deprived of their substance, should lament their fate; not in loud cries, lest they should be heard by the enemy and taken, but in secret sighs, and in a mournful tone; acknowledging to God, and to one another, their sins; they now became sensible of, which brought these calamities upon them. So God's people, the remnant according to the election of grace, who "escape" the general ruin sin has brought on mankind, are for the most part "upon the mountains", in an afflicted and persecuted state; they are like "doves" for their harmlessness, amiableness, cleanness, modesty chastity, sociableness, and timorous disposition; and like doves "of the valleys", in a low estate, through corruption, temptation, desertion, affliction, and persecution; and "mourn" over their own "iniquity", the sin of their nature, their unbelief and various transgressions being committed against a God of love, contrary to his grace, grieving to his Spirit, and dishonourable to his Gospel; and being what break their bereave them of comfort, and deprive them of communion with God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>.

And the word of Jehovah came to me thus: <a href="/ezekiel/7-2.htm">Ezekiel 7:2</a>. And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An end to the land of Israel! the end cometh upon the four borders of the land. <a href="/ezekiel/7-3.htm">Ezekiel 7:3</a>. Now (cometh) the end upon thee, and I shall send my wrath upon thee, and judge thee according to thy ways, and bring upon thee all thine abominations. <a href="/ezekiel/7-4.htm">Ezekiel 7:4</a>. And my eye shall not look with pity upon thee, and I shall not spare, but bring thy ways upon thee; and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee, that ye may know that I am Jehovah. - &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; - .havoheJ ma I, with the copula, connects this word of God with the preceding one, and shows it to be a continuation. It commences with an emphatic utterance of the thought, that the end is coming to the land of Israel, i.e., to the kingdom of Judah, with its capital Jerusalem. Desecrated as it has been by the abominations of its inhabitants, it will cease to be the land of God's people Israel. '&#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474; (to the land of Israel) is not to be taken with &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (thus saith the Lord) in opposition to the accents, but is connected with qeets &#1511;&#1509; (an end), as in the Targ. and Vulgate, and is placed first for the sake of greater emphasis. In the construction, compare <a href="/job/6-14.htm">Job 6:14</a>. &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is limited by the parallelism to the four extremities of the land of Israel. It is used elsewhere for the whole earth (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>). The Chetib &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; is placed, in opposition to the ordinary rule, before a noun in the feminine gender. The Keri gives the regular construction (vid., Ewald, 267c). In <a href="/ezekiel/7-3.htm">Ezekiel 7:3</a> the end is explained to be a wrathful judgment. "Give (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503;) thine abominations upon thee;" i.e., send the consequences, inflict punishment for them. The same thought is expressed in the phrase, "thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee;" in other words, they would discern them in the punishments which the abominations would bring in their train.
