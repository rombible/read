Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is at hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The end is come: it watcheth for thee - The end (personified) so long slumbering now awakes and comes upon thee. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. watcheth for thee&#8212;rather, "waketh for thee."

And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  <a href="/ezekiel/6-2.htm">Ezekiel 6:2</a>. Son of man, turn thy face towards the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them. <a href="/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3</a>. And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, and to the hills, to the valleys, and to the low grounds, Behold, I bring the sword upon you, and destroy your high places. <a href="/ezekiel/6-4.htm">Ezekiel 6:4</a>. Your altars shall be made desolate, and your sun-pillars shall be broken; and I shall make your slain fall in the presence of your idols. <a href="/ezekiel/6-5.htm">Ezekiel 6:5</a>. And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and will scatter your bones round about your altars. <a href="/ezekiel/6-6.htm">Ezekiel 6:6</a>. In all your dwellings shall the cities be made desolate, and the high places waste; that your altars may be desolate and waste, and your idols broken and destroyed, and your sun-pillars hewn down, and the works of your hands exterminated. <a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>. And the slain will fall in your midst; that you may know that I am Jehovah. - With <a href="/ezekiel/6-1.htm">Ezekiel 6:1</a> cf. <a href="/ezekiel/3-16.htm">Ezekiel 3:16</a>. The prophet is to prophesy against the mountains of Israel. That the mountains are mentioned (<a href="/ezekiel/6-2.htm">Ezekiel 6:2</a>) as pars pro toto, is seen from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3</a>, when to the mountains and hills are added also the valleys and low grounds, as the places where idolatry was specially practised; cf. <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>; see on Hos. l.c. and <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>. &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, in the older writings, denotes the "river channels," "the beds of the stream;" but Ezekiel uses the word as equivalent to valley, i.e., &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, a valley with a brook or stream, like the Arabic wady. &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;, properly "deepening," "the deep ground," "the deep valley;" on the form &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, cf. Ewald, 186da. The juxtaposition of mountains and hills, of valleys and low grounds, occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-6.htm">Ezekiel 36:6</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/35-8.htm">Ezekiel 35:8</a>; the opposition between mountains and valleys also, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-5.htm">Ezekiel 32:5-6</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/24-13.htm">Ezekiel 24:13</a>. The valleys are to be conceived of as furnished with trees and groves, under the shadow of which the worship of Astarte especially was practised; see on v. 15. On the mountains and in the valleys were sanctuaries erected to Baal and Astarte. The announcement of their destruction is appended to the threatening in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>, which Ezekiel takes up and describes at greater length. Beside the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the places of sacrifice and worship, and the &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, pillars or statues of Baal, dedicated to him as the sun-god, he names also the altars, which, in Lev. l.c. and other places, are comprehended along with the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; eht htiw; see on <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a> and <a href="/1_kings/3-3.htm">1 Kings 3:3</a>. With the destruction of the idol temples, altars, and statues, the idol-worshippers are also to be smitten, so as to fall down in the presence of their idols. The fundamental meaning of the word &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, "idols," borrowed from Lev. l.c., and frequently employed by Ezekiel, is uncertain; signifying either "logs of wood," from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, "to roll" (Gesen.), or stercorei, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, "dung;" not "monuments of stone" (Hvernick). <a href="/ezekiel/6-5.htm">Ezekiel 6:5</a> is taken quite literally from <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>. The ignominy of the destruction is heightened by the bones of the slain idolaters being scattered round about the idol altars. In order that the idolatry may be entirely rooted out, the cities throughout the whole land, and all the high places, are to be devastated, <a href="/ezekiel/6-6.htm">Ezekiel 6:6</a>. The forms &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; are probably not to be derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501; (Ewald, 138b), but to be referred back to a stem-form &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, with the signification of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;, the existence of which appears certain from the old name &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68.htm">Psalm 68</a> and elsewhere. The &#1488; in &#1497;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; is certainly only mater lectonis. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>, the singular &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; stands as indefinitely general. The thought, "slain will fall in your midst," involves the idea that not all the people will fall, but that there will survive some who are saved, and prepares for what follows. The falling of the slain - the idolaters with their idols - leads to the recognition of Jehovah as the omnipotent God, and to conversion to Him. </body></html>
