Great oppressors are, in God's account, no better than beasts of prey. Those who admire the pomp of this world, will wonder at the ruin of that pomp; which to those who know the vanity of all things here below, is no surprise. When others are ruined by sin, we have to fear, knowing ourselves guilty. The instruments of the desolation are formidable. And the instances of the desolation are frightful. The waters of Egypt shall run like oil, which signifies there should be universal sadness and heaviness upon the whole nation. God can soon empty those of this world's goods who have the greatest fulness of them. By enlarging the matters of our joy, we increase the occasions of our sorrow. How weak and helpless, as to God, are the most powerful of mankind! The destruction of Egypt was a type of the destruction of the enemies of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When I shall bring thy destruction - i. e., the news of thy destruction.

If we compare with this the date of the first prophecy against Egypt in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-1.htm">Ezekiel 29:1</a>, the prophecy before us was separated from the former by an interval of three months. But as there is no allusion whatever in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/29.htm">Ezekiel 29</a> to Pharaoh's attempt to come to the relief of the besieged city of Jerusalem, or to his repulse, the arrival of the Egyptian army in Palestine, its defeat, and its repulse by the Chaldeans, seems to have occurred in the interval between these two prophecies, towards the close of the tenth year.</body></html>
