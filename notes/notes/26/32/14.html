Great oppressors are, in God's account, no better than beasts of prey. Those who admire the pomp of this world, will wonder at the ruin of that pomp; which to those who know the vanity of all things here below, is no surprise. When others are ruined by sin, we have to fear, knowing ourselves guilty. The instruments of the desolation are formidable. And the instances of the desolation are frightful. The waters of Egypt shall run like oil, which signifies there should be universal sadness and heaviness upon the whole nation. God can soon empty those of this world's goods who have the greatest fulness of them. By enlarging the matters of our joy, we increase the occasions of our sorrow. How weak and helpless, as to God, are the most powerful of mankind!

I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them in the lands; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. - The perfect &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/ezekiel/30-21.htm">Ezekiel 30:21</a> is not a prophetic utterance of the certainty of the future, but a pure preterite. This may be seen "both from the allusion in <a href="/ezekiel/30-21.htm">Ezekiel 30:21</a> to the condition resulting from the shbr &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;, and also to the obviously antithetical relation of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-22.htm">Ezekiel 30:22</a>, in which future events are predicted" (Hitzig). The arm is a figurative expression for power, here for military power, as it wields the sword. God broke the arm of Pharaoh by the defeat which the Chaldeans inflicted upon Pharaoh Hophra, when he was marching to the relief of besieged Jerusalem. &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is a present, as is apparent from the infinitive clauses ('&#1500;&#1514;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;) which follow, altogether apart from &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;; and &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; signifies to bind up, for the purpose of healing a broken limb, that remedies may be applied and a bandage put on. &#1500;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1492;&#1468;, that it may become strong or sound, is subordinate to the preceding clause, and governs the infinitive which follows. The fact that the further judgment which is to fall upon Pharaoh is introduced with &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; (therefore) here (<a href="/ezekiel/30-22.htm">Ezekiel 30:22</a>), notwithstanding the fact that it has not been preceded by any enumeration of the guilt which occasioned it, may be accounted for on the ground that the causal &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; forms a link with the concluding clause of <a href="/ezekiel/30-21.htm">Ezekiel 30:21</a> : the arm shall not be healed, so as to be able to grasp or hold the sword. Because Pharaoh is not to attain any more to victorious power, therefore God will shatter both of his arms, the strong, i.e., the sound one and the broken one, that is to say, will smite it so completely, that the sword will fall from his hand. The Egyptians are to be scattered among the nations, as is repeated in <a href="/ezekiel/30-23.htm">Ezekiel 30:23</a> verbatim from <a href="/ezekiel/29-12.htm">Ezekiel 29:12</a>. God will give the sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and equip and strengthen him to destroy the might of Pharaoh, that the latter may groan before him like one who is pierced with the sword. This thought is repeated in <a href="/ezekiel/30-25.htm">Ezekiel 30:25</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/30-26.htm">Ezekiel 30:26</a> with an intimation of the purpose of this divine procedure. That purpose it: that men may come to recognise Jehovah as God the Lord. The subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; is indefinite; and the rendering of the lxx is a very good one, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;. </body></html>
