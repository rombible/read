But though Judah and Jerusalem were about this time ruined and laid waste, yet they are not mentioned here. Though they suffered the same affliction, and by the same hand, yet the kind design for which they were afflicted, and the mercy God reserved for them, altered its nature. It was not to them a going down to the pit, as it was to the heathen. Pharaoh shall see, and be comforted; but the comfort wicked ones have after death, is poor comfort, not real, but only in fancy. The view this prophecy gives of ruined states shows something of this present world, and the empire of death in it. Come and see the calamitous state of human life. As if men did not die fast enough, they are ingenious at finding out ways to destroy one another. Also of the other world; though the destruction of nations as such, seems chiefly intended, here is plain allusion to the everlasting ruin of impenitent sinners. How are men deceived by Satan! What are the objects they pursue through scenes of bloodshed, and their many sins? Surely man disquiets himself in vain, whether he pursues wealth, fame, power, or pleasure.

In the eleventh year, in the third (month), on the first of the month, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/31-2.htm">Ezekiel 31:2</a>. Son of man, say to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to his tumult, Whom art thou like in thy greatness? <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>. Behold, Asshur was a cedar-tree upon Lebanon, beautiful in branches, a shadowing thicket, and its top was high in growth, and among the clouds. <a href="/ezekiel/31-4.htm">Ezekiel 31:4</a>. Water brought him up, the flood made him high, its streams went round about its plantation, and it sent its channels to all the trees of the field. <a href="/ezekiel/31-5.htm">Ezekiel 31:5</a>. Therefore its growth became higher than all the trees of the field, and its branches became great, and its boughs long from many waters in its shooting out. <a href="/ezekiel/31-6.htm">Ezekiel 31:6</a>. In its branches all the birds of the heaven made their nests, and under its boughs all the beasts of the field brought forth, and in its shadow sat great nations of all kinds. <a href="/ezekiel/31-7.htm">Ezekiel 31:7</a>. And he was beautiful in his greatness, in the length of his shoots; for his root was by many waters. <a href="/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8</a>. Cedars did not obscure him in the garden of God, cypresses did not resemble his branches, and plane-trees were not like his boughs; no tree in the garden of God resembled him in his beauty. <a href="/ezekiel/31-9.htm">Ezekiel 31:9</a>. I had made him beautiful in the multitude of his shoots, and all the trees of Eden which were in the garden of God envied him. - The word of God is addressed to King Pharaoh and to &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;, his tumult, i.e., whoever and whatever occasions noise and tumult in the land. We must not interpret this, however, as Hitzig has done, as signifying the ruling classes and estates in contrast with the quiet in the land, for no such use of &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; is anywhere to be found. Nor must we regard the word as applying to the multitude of people only, but to the people with their possessions, their riches, which gave rise to luxury and tumult, as in <a href="/ezekiel/30-10.htm">Ezekiel 30:10</a>. The inquiry, whom does Pharaoh with his tumult resemble in his greatness, is followed in the place of a reply by a description of Asshur as a glorious cedar (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>). It is true that Ewald has followed the example of Meibom (vanarum in Cod. Hebr. interprett. spec. III p. 70) and J. D. Michaelis, and endeavours to set aside the allusion to Asshur, by taking the word &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; in an appellative sense, and understanding &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1488;&#1512;&#1494; as signifying a particular kind of cedar, namely, the tallest species of all. But apart altogether from there being no foundation whatever for such an explanation in the usage of the language, there is nothing in the fact to justify it. For it is not anywhere affirmed that Pharaoh resembled this cedar; on the contrary, the question, whom does he resemble? is asked again in <a href="/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a> (Hitzig). Moreover, Michaelis is wrong in the supposition that "from <a href="/ezekiel/31-10.htm">Ezekiel 31:10</a> onwards it becomes perfectly obvious that it is not Assyria but Egypt itself which is meant by the cedar-tree previously described." Under the figure of the felling of a cedar there is depicted the overthrow of a king or monarchy, which has already taken place. Compare <a href="/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a>, where the past is indicated quite as certainly as the future in <a href="/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a>. And as <a href="/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a> plainly designates the overthrow of Pharaoh and his power as still in the future, the cedar, whose destruction is not only threatened in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-10.htm">Ezekiel 31:10-17</a>, but declared to have already taken place, can only be Asshur, and not Egypt at all.<p>The picture of the glory of this cedar recalls in several respects the similar figurative description in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17.htm">Ezekiel 17</a>. Asshur is called a cedar upon Lebanon, because it was there that the most stately cedars grew. &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1510;&#1500;, a shade-giving thicket (&#1502;&#1510;&#1500; is a Hiphil participle of &#1510;&#1500;&#1500;), belongs to &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1506;&#1504;&#1507; as a further expansion of &#1506;&#1504;&#1507;, corresponding to the further expansion of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; &#1511;&#1502;&#1492; by "its top was among the clouds." If we bear this in mind, the reasons assigned by Hitzig for altering &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; into an adjective &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, and taking &#1502;&#1510;&#1500; as a substantive formation after the analogy of &#1502;&#1505;&#1489;, lose all their force. Analogy would only require an adjective in the construct state in the event of the three statements '&#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1506;, '&#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;, and '&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; &#1511; being co-ordinate with one another. But what is decisive against the proposed conjecture is the fact that neither the noun &#1502;&#1510;&#1500; nor the adjective &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; is ever met with, and that, in any case, &#1502;&#1510;&#1500; cannot signify foliage. The rendering of the Vulgate, "frondibus nemorosus," is merely guessed at, whilst the Seventy have omitted the word as unintelligible to them. For &#1506;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, thicket of clouds, see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/19-11.htm">Ezekiel 19:11</a>; and for &#1510;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, that on <a href="/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a>. The cedar grew to so large a size because it was richly watered (<a href="/ezekiel/31-4.htm">Ezekiel 31:4</a>). A flood poured its streams round about the place where the cedar was planted, and sent out brooks to all the trees of the field. The difficult words &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;' are to be taken literally thus: as for its (the flood's) streams, it (the flood) was going round about its plantation, i.e., round about the plantation belonging to the flood or the place situated near it, where the cedar was planted. &#1488;&#1514; is not to be taken as a preposition, but as a sign of the accusative, and &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; dna , as an accusative used for the more precise definition of the manner in which the flood surrounded the plantation. It is true that there still remains something striking in the masculine &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, since &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;, although of common gender, is construed throughout as a feminine, even in this very verse. But the difficulty remains even if we follow Ewald, and take &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; to be a defectively written or irregular form of the Hiphil &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;; a conjecture which is precluded by the use of &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, to cause to run  equals  to cause to flow away, in <a href="/ezekiel/32-14.htm">Ezekiel 32:14</a>. &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;&#1468;, its (the flood's) plantation, i.e., the plantation for which the flood existed. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; is used here to signify the source of starting-point of a flood, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>, where &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; are co-ordinate with &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. - While the place where the cedar was planted was surrounded by the streams of the flood, only the brooks and channels of this flood reached to the trees of the field. The cedar therefore surpassed all the trees of the field in height and luxuriance of growth (<a href="/ezekiel/31-5.htm">Ezekiel 31:5</a>). f&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1488;heb&gt;, an Aramean mode of spelling for &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1492; heb&gt;; and as&#1512;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;heb&gt;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.., an Aramean formation with &#1512; inserted, for &#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1514;, branches. For &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1514;, see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493; cannot mean "since it (the stream) sent out the water" (Ewald); for although &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; in <a href="/ezekiel/31-4.htm">Ezekiel 31:4</a> is also construed as a masculine, the suffix cannot be taken as referring to &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;, for this is much too far off. And the explanation proposed by Rosenmller, Hvernick, Kliefoth, and others, "as it (the tree) sent them (the branches) out," is open to this objection, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493; would then contain a spiritless tautology; since the stretching out of the branches is already contained in the fact of their becoming numerous and long. the tautology has no existence if the object is left indefinite, "in its spreading out," i.e., the spreading not only of the branches, but also of the roots, to which &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; is sometimes applied (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>). By the many waters which made the cedar great, we must not understand, either solely or especially, the numerous peoples which rendered Assyria great and mighty, as the Chaldee and many of the older commentators have done. It must rather be taken as embracing everything which contributed to the growth and greatness of Assyria. It is questionable whether the prophet, when describing the flood which watered the cedar plantation, had the description of the rivers of Paradise in <a href="/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>. floating before his mind. Ewald and Hvernick think that he had; but Hitzig and Kliefoth take a decidedly opposite view. There is certainly no distinct indication of any such allusion. We meet with this for the first time from <a href="/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8</a> onwards.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-6.htm">Ezekiel 31:6-9</a> the greatness and glory of Asshur are still further depicted. Upon and under the branches of the stately tree, all creatures, birds, beasts, and men, found shelter and protection for life and increase (<a href="/ezekiel/31-6.htm">Ezekiel 31:6</a>; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a> and <a href="/daniel/4-9.htm">Daniel 4:9</a>). In &#1499;&#1468;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, all kinds of great nations, the fact glimmers through the figure. The tree was so beautiful (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507; from &#1497;&#1508;&#1492;) in its greatness, that of all the trees in the garden of God not one was to be compared with it, and all envied it on that account; that is to say, all the other nations and kingdoms in God's creation were far inferior to Asshur in greatness and glory. &#1490;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; is the garden of Paradise; and consequently &#1506;&#1491;&#1503; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-9.htm">Ezekiel 31:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a> is also Paradise, as in <a href="/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>. There is no ground for Kliefoth's objection, that if &#1506;&#1491;&#1503; be taken in this sense, the words "which are in the garden of God" will contain a superfluous pleonasm, a mere tautology. In <a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a> a distinction is also made between &#1506;&#1491;&#1503; and the garden in Eden. It was not all Eden, but the garden planted by Jehovah in Eden, which formed the real paradisaical creation; so that the words "which are in the garden of God" give intensity to the idea of the "trees of Eden." Moreover, as Hvernick has correctly pointed out, there is a peculiar emphasis in the separation of &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1503; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1488;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8</a> : "cedars...even such as were found in the garden of God." Not one even of the other and most glorious trees, viz., cypresses and planes, resembled the cedar Asshur, planted by God by many waters, in its boughs and branches. It is not stated in so many words in <a href="/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/31-9.htm">Ezekiel 31:9</a> that the cedar Asshur stood in the garden of God; but it by no means follows from this, that by the garden of God we are to understand simply the world and the earth as the creation of God, as Kliefoth imagines, and in support of which he argues that "as all the nations and kingdoms of the world are regarded as trees planted by God, the world itself is quite consistently called a garden or plantation of God." The very fact that a distinction is made between trees of the field (<a href="/ezekiel/31-4.htm">Ezekiel 31:4</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/31-5.htm">Ezekiel 31:5</a>) and trees of Eden in the garden of God (<a href="/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/31-9.htm">Ezekiel 31:9</a>), shows that the trees are not all regarded here as being in the same sense planted by God. If the garden of God stood for the world, where should we then have to look for the field (&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;)? The thought of <a href="/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/31-9.htm">Ezekiel 31:9</a> is not that "not a single tree in all God's broad earth was to be compared to the cedar Asshur," but that even of the trees of Paradise, the garden in Eden, there was not one so beautiful and glorious as the cedar Asshur, planted by God by many waters. </body></html>
