As to eternity, every man was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Live ... die - In the writings of Ezekiel there is a development of the meaning of "life" and "death." In the holy land the sanctions of divine government were in great degree temporal; so that the promise of "life" for "obedience," the threatening of "death" for "disobedience," in the Books of Moses, were regarded simply as temporal and national. In their exile this could not continue in its full extent, and the universality of the misfortune necessarily made men look deeper into the words of God. The word "soul" denotes a "person" viewed as an "individual," possessing the "life" which God breathed into man when he became a "living soul" <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; i. e., it distinguishes "personality" from "nationality," and this introduces that fresh and higher idea of "life" and "death," which is not so much "life" and "death" in a future state, as "life" and "death" as equivalent to communion with or separation from God - that idea of life and death which was explained by our Lord in the Gospel of John John 8, and by Paul in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-13.

The answer is given in <a href="/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16</a> as a word of God confirmed by a solemn oath: he shall die in Babel, the capital of the king, who placed him on the throne, and Pharaoh will not render him any effectual help (<a href="/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>). &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1-8</a> :59, to act with him, that is to say, assist him, come to his help. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; refers to Zedekiah, not to Pharaoh, as Ewald assumes in an inexplicable manner. For '&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; &#1505;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; , compare <a href="/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; and for the fact itself, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-21.htm">Jeremiah 34:21-22</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>, according to which, although an Egyptian army came to the rescue of Jerusalem at the time when it was besieged by the Chaldeans, it was repulsed by the Chaldeans who marched to meet it, without having rendered any permanent assistance to the besieged.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>, the main thought that breach of faith can bring no deliverance is repeated for the sake of appending the further expansion contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19-21</a>. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, he gave his hand, i.e., as a pledge of fidelity. The oath which Zedekiah swore to the king of Babel is designated in <a href="/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19</a> as Jehovah's oath (&#1488;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;), and the covenant made with him as Jehovah's covenant, because the oath had been sworn by Jehovah, and the covenant of fidelity towards Nebuchadnezzar had thereby been made implicite with Jehovah Himself; so that the breaking of the oath and covenant became a breach of faith towards Jehovah. Consequently the very same expressions are used in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19</a>, to designate this breach of oath, which are applied in <a href="/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a> to the treacherous apostasy of Jerusalem (Israel) from Jehovah, the covenant God. And the same expressions are used to describe the punishment as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13-14</a>. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; is construed with the accusative of the thing respecting which he was to be judged, as in <a href="/1_samuel/12-7.htm">1 Samuel 12:7</a>. Jehovah regards the treacherous revolt from Nebuchadnezzar as treachery against Himself (&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;); not only because Zedekiah had sworn the oath of fidelity by Jehovah, but also from the fact that Jehovah had delivered up His people and kingdom into the power of Nebuchadnezzar, so that revolt from him really became rebellion against God. &#1488;&#1514; before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493; is nota accus., and is used in the sense of quod adtinet ad, as, for example, in <a href="/2_kings/6-5.htm">2 Kings 6:5</a>. &#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;, his fugitives, is rendered both by the Chaldee and Syriac "his brave men," or "heroes," and is therefore identified with &#1502;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493; (his chosen ones), which is the reading in some manuscripts. But neither these renderings nor the parallel passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>, where &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; apparently corresponds to it, will warrant our adopting this explanation, or making any alteration in the text. The Greek versions have &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; Theodoret: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; the Vulgate: omnes profugi ejus; and therefore they all had the reading &#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;, which also yields a very suitable meaning. The mention of some who remain, and who are to be scattered toward all the winds, is not at variance with the statement that all the fugitives in the wings of the army are to fall by the sword. The latter threat simply declares that no one will escape death by flight. But there is no necessity to take those who remain as being simply fighting men; and the word "all" must not be taken too literally. </body></html>
