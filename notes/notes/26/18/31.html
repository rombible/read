On this is grounded an exhortation to repent, and to make them a new heart and a new spirit. God does not command what cannot be done, but admonishes us to do what is in our power, and to pray for what is not. Ordinances and means are appointed, directions and promises are given, that those who desire this change may seek it from God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Equal - literally, "weighed out, balanced."

Cast away from you&#8212;for the cause of your evil rests with yourselves; your sole way of escape is to be reconciled to God (Eph 4:22, 23).<p>make you a new heart&#8212;This shows, not what men can do, but what they ought to do: what God requires of us. God alone can make us a new heart (Eze 11:19; 36:26, 27). The command to do what men cannot themselves do is designed to drive them (instead of laying the blame, as the Jews did, elsewhere rather than on themselves) to feel their own helplessness, and to seek God's Holy Spirit (Ps 51:11, 12). Thus the outward exhortation is, as it were, the organ or instrument which God uses for conferring grace. So we may say with Augustine, "Give what thou requirest, and (then) require what thou wilt." Our strength (which is weakness in itself) shall suffice for whatever He exacts, if only He gives the supply [Calvin].<p>spirit&#8212;the understanding: as the "heart" means the will and affections.

Your old heart is made up of strange notions of your innocence, and the inequality of the ways of your God, and this influenceth your spirit to pride, quarrelling with God, who might have convinced you by severer methods, which should have put you as far out of doubt about the cause of your punishment, as out of hope of deliverance from it.

As unprofitable and pernicious, to be abhorred and abstained from, and to be cast off, as loads and burdens upon them. Kimchi interprets it of the punishment of their sins, which might be cast off, or escaped, by repentance; perhaps it is best to interpret it of the casting away of their idols, by which they transgressed; see <a href="/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7</a>; <p>and make you a new heart and a new spirit; which the Lord elsewhere promises to give, and he does give to his own elect; See Gill on <a href="/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; and if here to be understood of a regenerated heart and spirit, in which are new principles of light, life, and love, grace and holiness, it will not prove that it is in the power of man to make himself such a heart and spirit; since from God's command, to man's power, is no argument; and the design of the exhortation is to convince men of their want of such a heart; of the importance of it: and which, through the efficacious grace of God, may be a means of his people having it, seeing he has in covenant promised it to them. The Targum renders it, <p>"a fearing heart, and a spirit of fear;'' <p>that is, a heart and spirit to fear, serve, and worship the Lord, and not idols; and so the amount of the exhortation is, yield a hearty reverential obedience to the living God, and not to dumb idols; or that they would be hearty and sincere in their national repentance and reformation they are here pressed unto: <p>for why will ye die, O house of Israel? which is to be understood, not of an eternal death; since the deaths here spoken of was now upon them, what they were complaining of, and from which they might be recovered, <a href="/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2</a>; but temporal calamity and affliction, as in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-10.htm">2 Corinthians 1:10</a>; and so in the following words. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which ye have transgressed; and make <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</span><p>(i) He shows that man cannot forsake his wickedness, till his heart is changed which is only the work of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">31</span>. <span class="ital">a new heart</span>] Cf. ch. <a href="/ezekiel/11-19.htm" title="And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:">Ezekiel 11:19</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm" title="A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.">Ezekiel 36:26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm" title="Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.">Jeremiah 4:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-7.htm" title="And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return to me with their whole heart.">Jeremiah 24:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm" title="Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.">Psalm 51:7</a>.

And behold, he begetteth a son, who seeth all his father's sins which he doeth; he seeth them, and doeth not such things. <a href="/ezekiel/18-15.htm">Ezekiel 18:15</a>. He eateth not upon the mountains, and lifteth not up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel; he defileth not his neighbour's wife, <a href="/ezekiel/18-16.htm">Ezekiel 18:16</a>. And oppresseth no one; he doth not withhold a pledge, and committeth not robbery; giveth his bread to the hungry, and covereth the naked with clothes. <a href="/ezekiel/18-17.htm">Ezekiel 18:17</a>. He holdeth back his hand from the distressed one, taketh not usury and interest, doeth my rights, walketh in my statutes; he will not die for the sin of his father; he shall live. <a href="/ezekiel/18-18.htm">Ezekiel 18:18</a>.

And do ye say, Why doth the son not help to bear the father's sin? But the son hath done right and righteousness, hath kept all my statutes, and done them; he shall live. <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>. The soul that sinneth, it shall die. A son shall not help to bear the father's sin, and a father shall not help to bear the sin of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. - The case supposed in these verses forms the antithesis to the preceding one; the father is the transgressor in this instance, and the son a keeper of the law. The subject to &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; in <a href="/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14</a> is not the righteous man described in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-15.htm">Ezekiel 18:15</a>, but a man who is described immediately afterwards as a transgressor of the commandments of God. The Chetib &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488; bite in the last clause of <a href="/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14</a> is not to be read &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;, et timuerit, as it has been by the translators of the Septuagint and Vulgate; nor is it to be altered into &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, as it has been by the Masoretes, to make it accord with <a href="/ezekiel/18-28.htm">Ezekiel 18:28</a>; but it is the apocopated form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, as in the preceding clause, and the object is to be repeated from what precedes, as in the similar case which we find in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>, (18). Ewald and Hitzig propose to alter &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="/ezekiel/18-17.htm">Ezekiel 18:17</a> into &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500; after <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>, but without the slightest necessity. The lxx are not to be taken as an authority for this, since the Chaldee and Syriac have both read and rendered &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;; and Ezekiel, when repeating the same sentences, is accustomed to make variations in particular words. Holding back the hand from the distressed, is equivalent to abstaining from seizing upon him for the purpose of crushing him (compare <a href="/ezekiel/18-12.htm">Ezekiel 18:12</a>); &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498;, in the midst of his countrymen  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, is adopted from the language of the Pentateuch. &#1502;&#1514; after &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is a participle. The question, "Why does the son not help to bear?" is not a direct objection on the part of the people, but is to be taken as a pretext, which the people might offer on the ground of the law, that God would visit the sin of the fathers upon the sons in justification of their proverb. Ezekiel cites this pretext for the purpose of meeting it by stating the reason why this does not occur. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1489;, to carry, near or with, to join in carrying, or help to carry (cf. <a href="/numbers/11-17.htm">Numbers 11:17</a>). This proved the proverb to be false, and confirmed the assertion made in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>, to which the address therefore returns (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). The righteousness of the righteous man will come upon him, i.e., upon the righteous man, namely, in its consequences. The righteous man will receive the blessing of righteousness, but the unrighteous man the curse of his wickedness. There is no necessity for the article, which the Keri proposes to insert before &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. </body></html>
