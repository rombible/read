God is said in Scripture to remember men’s sins when he punishes them, and not to remember them when he pardons them: see <a href="/jeremiah/14-10.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD does not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.">Jeremiah 14:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm" title="And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, said the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.">Jeremiah 31:34</a>. <span class="ital">Have I any pleasure, &c., that the wicked should die? — </span>“Is it any pleasure to me that men should be wicked; or that those who are now wicked men, should die everlastingly?

Do I not call, and cry, and sue to men, that they would return from their sins, and be saved?” — Bishop Hall. It is not in the nature of God, which is infinitely holy and gracious, to have any pleasure in the unholiness and misery of any of his creatures. It does not comport with the wisdom and rectitude of the eternal lawgiver and sovereign ruler of the world, to take delight in seeing his laws violated, the rights of his government infringed, and his subjects punished. And it cannot consist with the boundless love of the almighty Father of the universe to take pleasure in witnessing the wretchedness of his offspring; or with the infinite mercy of the Redeemer and Saviour of the fallen race of Adam, to delight in seeing those perish for whose salvation he gave his Son to die. On the contrary, <span class="ital">he willeth all men to be saved, </span>and, in order thereto, <span class="ital">to come to the knowledge of the truth, </span>and <span class="ital">is not willing that any should perish, </span><a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm" title="Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.">1 Timothy 2:4</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm" title="The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.">2 Peter 3:9</a>. It is true that God has determined to punish sinners continuing in sin; his justice calls for it; and, pursuant to that, impenitent sinners will lie for ever under his wrath and curse. This is the will of his decree, his consequent will, but it is not his antecedent will, the will of his delight and good pleasure. For though the righteousness of his government requires that sinners should die, yet the goodness of his nature causes him to choose far rather that they should <span class="ital">turn from their ways and live; </span>and he is unspeakably better pleased when his mercy is glorified in their salvation than when his justice is glorified in their damnation.

The true penitent is a true believer. None of his former transgressions shall be mentioned unto him, but in the righteousness which he has done, as the fruit of faith and the effect of conversion, he shall surely live. The question is not whether the truly righteous ever become apostates. It is certain that many who for a time were thought to be righteous, do so, while ver. 26,27 speaks the fulness of pardoning mercy: when sin is forgiven, it is blotted out, it is remembered no more. In their righteousness they shall live; not for their righteousness, as if that were an atonement for their sins, but in their righteousness, which is one of the blessings purchased by the Mediator. What encouragement a repenting, returning sinner has to hope for pardon and life according to this promise! In verse 28 is the beginning and progress of repentance. True believers watch and pray, and continue to the end, and they are saved.

Two last cases, showing the equity of God: (1) The penitent sinner is dealt with according to his new obedience, not according to his former sins. (2) The righteous man who turns from righteousness to sin shall be punished for the latter, and his former righteousness will be of no avail to him.<p>he shall surely live&#8212;Despair drives men into hardened recklessness; God therefore allures men to repentance by holding out hope [Calvin].<p>To threats the stubborn sinner oft is hard,<p>Wrapt in his crimes, against the storm prepared,<p>But when the milder beams of mercy play,<p>He melts, and throws the cumbrous cloak away.<p>Hitherto the cases had been of a change from bad to good, or vice versa, in one generation compared with another. Here it is such a change in one and the same individual. This, as practically affecting the persons here addressed, is properly put last. So far from God laying on men the penalty of others' sins, He will not even punish them for their own, if they turn from sin to righteousness; but if they turn from righteousness to sin, they must expect in justice that their former goodness will not atone for subsequent sin (Heb 10:38, 39; 2Pe 2:20-22). The exile in Babylon gave a season for repentance of those sins which would have brought death on the perpetrator in Judea while the law could be enforced; so it prepared the way for the Gospel [Grotius].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So far is God from punishing the sins of guilty parents on innocent children, as in the last instance, <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/18-14.htm" title="Now, see, if he beget a son, that sees all his father's sins which he has done, and considers, and does not such like,">Ezekiel 18:14</a></span> to the end of <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm" title="The soul that sins, it shall die.

The question is carried further into the relations between the past and the present of the same man, between his old and his new self. And in answering that question also Ezekiel becomes the preacher of a gospel. The judgment of God deals with each man according to his present state, not his past. Repentance and conversion and obedience shall cancel, as it were, the very memory of his former sins  (Ezekiel's language is necessarily that of a hold anthropopathy), and his transgressions shall not be mentioned unto him (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/33-16.htm">Ezekiel 33:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-9.htm">Isaiah 64:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>).

If a man is righteous, and doeth right and righteousness, <a href="/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>. And doth not eat upon the mountains, and doth not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and doth not defile his neighbour's wife, and doth not approach his wife in her uncleanness, <a href="/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>. Oppresseth no one, restoreth his security (lit., debt-pledge), committeth no robbery, giveth his bread to the hungry, and covereth the naked with clothes, <a href="/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>. Doth not give upon usury, and taketh not interest, withholdeth his hand from wrong, executeth judgment of truth between one and another, <a href="/ezekiel/18-9.htm">Ezekiel 18:9</a>. Walketh in my statutes, and keepeth my rights to execute truth; he is righteous, he shall live, is the saying of the Lord "Jehovah." - The exposition of the assertion, that God only punishes the sinner, not the innocent, commences with a picture of the righteousness which has the promise of life. The righteousness consists in the fulfilment of the commandments of the law: viz., (1) those relating to religious duties, such as the avoidance of idolatry, whether of the grosser kind, such as eating upon the mountains, i.e., observing sacrificial festivals, and therefore sacrificing to idols (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>.), or of a more refined description, e.g., lifting up the eyes to idols, to look to them, or make them the object of trust, and offer supplication to them (cf. <a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>), as Israel had done, and was doing still (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>); and (2) those relating to moral obligations, such as the avoidance of adultery (compare <a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>; and for &#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="/genesis/34-5.htm">Genesis 34:5</a>), and of conjugal intercourse with a wife during menstruation, which was a defilement of the marriage relation (cf. <a href="/leviticus/18-19.htm">Leviticus 18:19</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-18.htm">Leviticus 20:18</a>). All these sins were forbidden in the law on pain of death. To these there are appended duties to a neighbour (<a href="/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>.), viz., to abstain from oppressing any one (<a href="/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/15-14.htm">Leviticus 15:14</a>, <a href="/leviticus/15-17.htm">Leviticus 15:17</a>), to restore the pledge to a debtor (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10</a>.). &#1495;&#1493;&#1489; is hardly to be taken in any other sense than as in apposition to &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;, "his pledge, which is debt," equivalent to his debt-pledge or security, like &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1498; &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/ezekiel/16-27.htm">Ezekiel 16:27</a>. The supposition of Hitzig, that &#1495;&#1493;&#1489; is a participle, like &#1511;&#1493;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>, in the sense of debtor, is a far less natural one, and has no valid support in the free rendering of the lxx, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. The further duties are to avoid taking unlawful possession of the property of another (cf. <a href="/leviticus/5-23.htm">Leviticus 5:23</a>); to feed the hungry, clothe the naked (cf. <a href="/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-26.htm">Matthew 25:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a>); to abstain from practising usury (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-20.htm">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>; cf. <a href="/exodus/22-24.htm">Exodus 22:24</a>) and taking interest (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36-37</a>); in judicial sentences, to draw back the hand from wrong, and promote judgment of truth, - a sentence in accordance with the true nature of the case (see the comm. on <a href="/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9</a>); and, lastly, to walk in the statutes and rights of the Lord, - an expression which embraces, in conclusion, all that is essential to the righteousness required by the law. - This definition of the idea of true righteousness, which preserves from death and destruction, and ensures life to the possessor, is followed in <a href="/ezekiel/18-10.htm">Ezekiel 18:10</a>. by a discussion of the attitude which God sustains towards the sons. </body></html>
