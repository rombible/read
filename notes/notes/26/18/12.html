As to eternity, every man was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Live ... die - In the writings of Ezekiel there is a development of the meaning of "life" and "death." In the holy land the sanctions of divine government were in great degree temporal; so that the promise of "life" for "obedience," the threatening of "death" for "disobedience," in the Books of Moses, were regarded simply as temporal and national. In their exile this could not continue in its full extent, and the universality of the misfortune necessarily made men look deeper into the words of God. The word "soul" denotes a "person" viewed as an "individual," possessing the "life" which God breathed into man when he became a "living soul" <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; i. e., it distinguishes "personality" from "nationality," and this introduces that fresh and higher idea of "life" and "death," which is not so much "life" and "death" in a future state, as "life" and "death" as equivalent to communion with or separation from God - that idea of life and death which was explained by our Lord in the Gospel of John John 8, and by Paul in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. oppressed the poor&#8212;an aggravation to his oppressions, that they were practised against the poor; whereas in Eze 18:7 the expression is simply "oppressed any."<p>abomination&#8212;singular number referring to the particular one mentioned at the end of Eze 18:6.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/ezekiel/18-7.htm" title="And has not oppressed any, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has spoiled none by violence, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;">Ezekiel 18:7</a>"</span>.

Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, And I will take from the top of the high cedar, and will set it; from the topmost of its shoots will I pluck off a tender one, and will plant it upon a high and exalted mountain. <a href="/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>. On the high mountain of Israel will I plant it, and it will put forth branches, and bear fruit, and become a splendid cedar, so that all the birds of every plumage will dwell under it. In the shade of its branches will they dwell. <a href="/ezekiel/17-24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>. And all the trees of the field will learn that I Jehovah have lowered the lofty tree, lifted up the low tree, made the green tree wither, and the withered tree become green. I Jehovah have said it, and have done it. - Although the sprout of David, whom Nebuchadnezzar had made king, would lose the sovereignty because of his breach of faith, and bring about the destruction of the kingdom of Judah, the Lord would not let His kingdom be destroyed, but would fulfil the promise which He had given to the seed of David. The announcement of this fulfilment takes its form from the preceding parable. As Nebuchadnezzar broke off a twig from the top of the cedar and brought it to Babel (<a href="/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>), so will Jehovah Himself also pluck off a shoot from the top of the high cedar, and plant it upon a high mountain. The Vav before &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is the Vav consec., and &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; is appended to the verb for the sake of emphasis; but in antithesis to the acting of the eagle, as described in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a>, it is placed after it. The cedar, which it designated by the epithet ra&#770;ma&#770;h, as rising above the other trees, is the royal house of David, and the tender shoot which Jehovah breaks off and plants is not the Messianic kingdom or sovereignty, so that Zerubbabel could be included, but the Messiah Himself as "a distinct historical personage" (Hvernick). The predicate &#1512;&#1498;, tender, refers to Him; also the word &#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1511;, a sprout (<a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>), which indicates not so much the youthful age of the Messiah (Hitzig) as the lowliness of His origin (compare <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>); and even when applied to David and Solomon, in <a href="/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>, expresses not their youthfulness, but their want of strength for the proper administration of such a government. The high mountain, described in <a href="/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a> as the high mountain of Israel, is Zion, regarded as the seat and centre of the kingdom of God, which is to be exalted by the Messiah above all the mountains of the earth (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, etc.). The twig planted by the Lord will grow there into a glorious cedar, under which all birds will dwell. The Messiah grows into a cedar in the kingdom founded by Him, in which all the inhabitants of the earth will find both food (from the fruits of the tree) and protection (under its shadow). For this figure, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-8.htm">Daniel 4:8-9</a>. &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507;, birds of every kind of plumage (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-4.htm">Ezekiel 39:4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17</a>), is derived from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/7-14.htm">Genesis 7:14</a>, where birds of every kind find shelter in Noah's ark. The allusion is to men from every kind of people and tribe. By this will all the trees of the field learn that God lowers the lofty and lifts up the lowly. As the cedar represents the royal house of David, the trees of the field can only be the other kings or royal families of the earth, not the nations outside the limits of the covenant. At the same time, the nations are not to be entirely excluded because the figure of the cedars embraces the idea of the kingdom, so that the trees of the field denote the kingdoms of the earth together with their kings. The clauses, "I bring down the high tree," contain a purely general thought, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7-8</a>, and the perfects are not to be taken as preterites, but as statements of practical truths. It is true that the thought of the royal house of David in its previous greatness naturally suggests itself in connection with the high and green tree, and that of Jehoiachin in connection with the dry tree (compare <a href="/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>); and these are not to be absolutely set aside. At the same time, the omission of the article from &#1506;&#1509; and the objects which follow, is sufficient to show that the words are not to be restricted to these particular persons, but are applicable to every high and green, or withered and lowly tree; i.e., not merely to kings alone, but to all men in common, and furnish a parallel to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4-9</a>, "The bows of the mighty men are broken; and they that stumbled are girded with strength," etc. </body></html>
