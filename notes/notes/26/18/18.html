As to eternity, every man was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Live ... die - In the writings of Ezekiel there is a development of the meaning of "life" and "death." In the holy land the sanctions of divine government were in great degree temporal; so that the promise of "life" for "obedience," the threatening of "death" for "disobedience," in the Books of Moses, were regarded simply as temporal and national. In their exile this could not continue in its full extent, and the universality of the misfortune necessarily made men look deeper into the words of God. The word "soul" denotes a "person" viewed as an "individual," possessing the "life" which God breathed into man when he became a "living soul" <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; i. e., it distinguishes "personality" from "nationality," and this introduces that fresh and higher idea of "life" and "death," which is not so much "life" and "death" in a future state, as "life" and "death" as equivalent to communion with or separation from God - that idea of life and death which was explained by our Lord in the Gospel of John John 8, and by Paul in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. taken off his hand from the poor&#8212;that is, abstained from oppressing the poor, when he had the opportunity of doing so with impunity.The different sense of the phrase in Eze 16:49, in reference to relieving the poor, seems to have suggested the reading followed by Fairbairn, but not sanctioned by the Hebrew, "hath not turned his hand from," &c. But Eze 20:22 uses the phrase in a somewhat similar sense to English Version here, abstained from hurting.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Oppressing, he oppressed; and spoiling, spoiled; did all the mischief he could: he shall die. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As for his father,....

And doth not eat upon the mountains, and doth not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and doth not defile his neighbour's wife, and doth not approach his wife in her uncleanness, <a href="/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>.

Walketh in my statutes, and keepeth my rights to execute truth; he is righteous, he shall live, is the saying of the Lord "Jehovah." - The exposition of the assertion, that God only punishes the sinner, not the innocent, commences with a picture of the righteousness which has the promise of life. The righteousness consists in the fulfilment of the commandments of the law: viz., (1) those relating to religious duties, such as the avoidance of idolatry, whether of the grosser kind, such as eating upon the mountains, i.e., observing sacrificial festivals, and therefore sacrificing to idols (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>.), or of a more refined description, e.g., lifting up the eyes to idols, to look to them, or make them the object of trust, and offer supplication to them (cf. <a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>), as Israel had done, and was doing still (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>); and (2) those relating to moral obligations, such as the avoidance of adultery (compare <a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>; and for &#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="/genesis/34-5.htm">Genesis 34:5</a>), and of conjugal intercourse with a wife during menstruation, which was a defilement of the marriage relation (cf. <a href="/leviticus/18-19.htm">Leviticus 18:19</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-18.htm">Leviticus 20:18</a>). All these sins were forbidden in the law on pain of death. To these there are appended duties to a neighbour (<a href="/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>.), viz., to abstain from oppressing any one (<a href="/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/15-14.htm">Leviticus 15:14</a>, <a href="/leviticus/15-17.htm">Leviticus 15:17</a>), to restore the pledge to a debtor (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10</a>.). &#1495;&#1493;&#1489; is hardly to be taken in any other sense than as in apposition to &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;, "his pledge, which is debt," equivalent to his debt-pledge or security, like &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1498; &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/ezekiel/16-27.htm">Ezekiel 16:27</a>. The supposition of Hitzig, that &#1495;&#1493;&#1489; is a participle, like &#1511;&#1493;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>, in the sense of debtor, is a far less natural one, and has no valid support in the free rendering of the lxx, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. The further duties are to avoid taking unlawful possession of the property of another (cf. <a href="/leviticus/5-23.htm">Leviticus 5:23</a>); to feed the hungry, clothe the naked (cf. <a href="/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-26.htm">Matthew 25:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a>); to abstain from practising usury (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-20.htm">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>; cf. <a href="/exodus/22-24.htm">Exodus 22:24</a>) and taking interest (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36-37</a>); in judicial sentences, to draw back the hand from wrong, and promote judgment of truth, - a sentence in accordance with the true nature of the case (see the comm. on <a href="/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9</a>); and, lastly, to walk in the statutes and rights of the Lord, - an expression which embraces, in conclusion, all that is essential to the righteousness required by the law. - This definition of the idea of true righteousness, which preserves from death and destruction, and ensures life to the possessor, is followed in <a href="/ezekiel/18-10.htm">Ezekiel 18:10</a>. by a discussion of the attitude which God sustains towards the sons. </body></html>
