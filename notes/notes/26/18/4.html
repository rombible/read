Since all alike belong to God and are absolutely in His power. He has no occasion to punish one lest another should escape; and again, since all are His, He loves and would save them all, and inflicts punishment only when it is deserved and His grace is rejected. Four cases are now discussed separately: (1) That of the righteous man who honestly seeks to follow the ways of the Lord (<a href="/context/ezekiel/18-5.htm" title="But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,">Ezekiel 18:5-9</a>); (2) that of his wicked son (<a href="/context/ezekiel/18-10.htm" title="If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that does the like to any one of these things,">Ezekiel 18:10-13</a>); (3) that of the righteous son of the wicked (<a href="/context/ezekiel/18-14.htm" title="Now, see, if he beget a son, that sees all his father's sins which he has done, and considers, and does not such like,">Ezekiel 18:14-20</a>); (4) that of a change of character in the individual, whether from sin to righteousness or the reverse (<a href="/context/ezekiel/18-21.htm" title="But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.">Ezekiel 18:21-29</a>). The word “soul” throughout the chapter does not mean exclusively the immortal part of our nature, but, as so often in Scripture, is equivalent to <span class= "ital">man, </span>or <span class= "ital">person, </span>or <span class= "ital">self; </span>and the word “die” is used, as often elsewhere, in the broad sense of <span class= "ital">suffer punishment.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm" title="Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sins, it shall die.">Ezekiel 18:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, all souls are mine — </span>As they are all equally my creatures, and in my power, so my dealings with them shall be without prejudice or partiality. <span class="ital">The soul that sinneth, it shall die — </span>The very same man that committeth sin shall be punished for it. Some commentators explain this of the temporal death which was about to come on the wicked Jews by the sword, famine, and pestilence; and they would confine the whole chapter to these events. “But,” as Mr. Scott justly observes, “it cannot be proved that every righteous man escaped those temporal judgments, or that all who survived them were righteous: without which this whole interpretation must fall for want of a foundation. Many, indeed, of the pious Jews had<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘their lives given them for a prey,’ but even what Jeremiah, Baruch, and others endured in the siege, and after the taking of Jerusalem, nearly equalled the external sufferings of many wicked men among them; and none of those who survived the siege escaped captivity or exile. So that facts, in this particular, did not so fully ascertain the equality of the divine conduct toward these distinct characters, as this hypothesis requires.” Temporal death, therefore, which, as the consequence of the first transgression, passes equally upon all men, cannot be only, or even chiefly, if it be at all, intended here. But, as <span class="ital">life </span>signifies in general all that happiness which attends God’s favour, so death denotes all those punishments which are the effects of the divine displeasure, (see <a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm" title="And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said to David, The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.">2 Samuel 12:13</a>,) under which are comprehended the miseries of the next world. And these shall be allotted to men according to their deeds, (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm" title="Who will render to every man according to his deeds:">Romans 2:6</a>,) without any regard to the faults of their ancestors, which shall not then be laid to their charge, or taken into account to aggravate their guilt. This the prophets well knew, and therefore, as they instruct men in the practice of inward and evangelical righteousness, and in order to it speak slightingly of the mere external duties of religion, (see <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/7-22.htm" title="For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:...">Jeremiah 7:22-23</a>,) so they raise men’s minds to look beyond the temporal promises and threatenings of the law, to the eternal rewards and punishments of another life, <a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm" title="And they shall go forth, and look on the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.">Isaiah 66:24</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm" title="And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.">Daniel 12:2</a>.

As to eternity, every man was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All souls are mine - Man is not simply to ascribe his existence to earthly parents, but to acknowledge as his Father Him who created man in His own image, and who gave and gives him the spirit of life. The relation of father to son is merged in the common relation of all (father and son alike) as sons to their heavenly Father. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. all souls are mine&#8212;Therefore I can deal with all, being My own creation, as I please (Jer 18:6). As the Creator of all alike I can have no reason, but the principle of equity, according to men's works, to make any difference, so as to punish some, and to save others (Ge 18:25). "The soul that sinneth it shall die." The curse descending from father to son assumes guilt shared in by the son; there is a natural tendency in the child to follow the sin of his father, and so he shares in the father's punishment: hence the principles of God's government, involved in Ex 20:5 and Jer 15:4, are justified. The sons, therefore (as the Jews here), cannot complain of being unjustly afflicted by God (La 5:7); for they filled up the guilt of their fathers (Mt 23:32, 34-36). The same God who "recompenses the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children," is immediately after set forth as "giving to every man according to his ways" (Jer 32:18, 19). In the same law (Ex 20:5) which "visited the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation" (where the explanation is added, "of them that hate me," that is, the children hating God, as well as their fathers: the former being too likely to follow their parents, sin going down with cumulative force from parent to child), we find (De 24:16), "the fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither the children for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin." The inherited guilt of sin in infants (Ro 5:14) is an awful fact, but one met by the atonement of Christ; but it is of adults that he speaks here. Whatever penalties fall on communities for connection with sins of their fathers, individual adults who repent shall escape (2Ki 23:25, 26). This was no new thing, as some misinterpret the passage here; it had been always God's principle to punish only the guilty, and not also the innocent, for the sins of their fathers. God does not here change the principle of His administration, but is merely about to manifest it so personally to each that the Jews should no longer throw on God and on their fathers the blame which was their own.<p>soul that sinneth, it shall die&#8212;and it alone (Ro 6:23); not also the innocent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There can be no colour of partial judgment in the proceedings of God, who is equally God to all; who hath as great interest in the son as in the father, and as kindly would deal with the son as with the father: and how can it be thought likely I should punish the son for the father’s offence, or the father for the son’s offence? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All souls; </span> all persons, which are frequently called souls, <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/7-18.htm" title="And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him that offers it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity.">Leviticus 7:18</a>,20,21 Jos 20:3</span>; and so it is <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm" title="The soul that sins, it shall die.

And if one that is, for aught we can discern, absolutely innocent, yet suffers for another man’s sin, it is most certain such a sufferer is not absolutely innocent, but some way or other is guilty of the sin for which he suffers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, all souls are mine,....

They have, however, a pregnant meaning arising from the other conceptions of the prophet. He feels himself and the people standing immediately before that perfect kingdom of the Lord which is about to come (ch. 33, 37), and “live” implies entering into the glory of this kingdom, while “die” implies deprivation of its blessedness; for of course, like all the Old Testament writers, Ezekiel considers the kingdom, even in its perfect condition, an earthly one.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, all souls are mine</span>, etc. The words imply, not only creation, ownership, absolute authority, on the part of God, but, as even Calvin could recognize (<span class="accented">in loc.</span>), "a paternal affection towards the whole human race which he created and formed."

The answer is given in <a href="/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16</a> as a word of God confirmed by a solemn oath: he shall die in Babel, the capital of the king, who placed him on the throne, and Pharaoh will not render him any effectual help (<a href="/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>). &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1-8</a> :59, to act with him, that is to say, assist him, come to his help. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; refers to Zedekiah, not to Pharaoh, as Ewald assumes in an inexplicable manner. For '&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; &#1505;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; , compare <a href="/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; and for the fact itself, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-21.htm">Jeremiah 34:21-22</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>, according to which, although an Egyptian army came to the rescue of Jerusalem at the time when it was besieged by the Chaldeans, it was repulsed by the Chaldeans who marched to meet it, without having rendered any permanent assistance to the besieged.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>, the main thought that breach of faith can bring no deliverance is repeated for the sake of appending the further expansion contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19-21</a>. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, he gave his hand, i.e., as a pledge of fidelity. The oath which Zedekiah swore to the king of Babel is designated in <a href="/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19</a> as Jehovah's oath (&#1488;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;), and the covenant made with him as Jehovah's covenant, because the oath had been sworn by Jehovah, and the covenant of fidelity towards Nebuchadnezzar had thereby been made implicite with Jehovah Himself; so that the breaking of the oath and covenant became a breach of faith towards Jehovah. Consequently the very same expressions are used in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19</a>, to designate this breach of oath, which are applied in <a href="/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a> to the treacherous apostasy of Jerusalem (Israel) from Jehovah, the covenant God. And the same expressions are used to describe the punishment as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13-14</a>. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; is construed with the accusative of the thing respecting which he was to be judged, as in <a href="/1_samuel/12-7.htm">1 Samuel 12:7</a>. Jehovah regards the treacherous revolt from Nebuchadnezzar as treachery against Himself (&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;); not only because Zedekiah had sworn the oath of fidelity by Jehovah, but also from the fact that Jehovah had delivered up His people and kingdom into the power of Nebuchadnezzar, so that revolt from him really became rebellion against God. &#1488;&#1514; before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493; is nota accus., and is used in the sense of quod adtinet ad, as, for example, in <a href="/2_kings/6-5.htm">2 Kings 6:5</a>. &#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;, his fugitives, is rendered both by the Chaldee and Syriac "his brave men," or "heroes," and is therefore identified with &#1502;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493; (his chosen ones), which is the reading in some manuscripts. But neither these renderings nor the parallel passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>, where &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; apparently corresponds to it, will warrant our adopting this explanation, or making any alteration in the text. The Greek versions have &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; Theodoret: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; the Vulgate: omnes profugi ejus; and therefore they all had the reading &#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;, which also yields a very suitable meaning. The mention of some who remain, and who are to be scattered toward all the winds, is not at variance with the statement that all the fugitives in the wings of the army are to fall by the sword. The latter threat simply declares that no one will escape death by flight. But there is no necessity to take those who remain as being simply fighting men; and the word "all" must not be taken too literally. </body></html>
