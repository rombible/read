And oppresseth no one; he doth not withhold a pledge, and committeth not robbery; giveth his bread to the hungry, and covereth the naked with clothes. <a href="/ezekiel/18-17.htm">Ezekiel 18:17</a>.

A son shall not help to bear the father's sin, and a father shall not help to bear the sin of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. - The case supposed in these verses forms the antithesis to the preceding one; the father is the transgressor in this instance, and the son a keeper of the law. The subject to &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; in <a href="/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14</a> is not the righteous man described in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-15.htm">Ezekiel 18:15</a>, but a man who is described immediately afterwards as a transgressor of the commandments of God. The Chetib &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488; bite in the last clause of <a href="/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14</a> is not to be read &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;, et timuerit, as it has been by the translators of the Septuagint and Vulgate; nor is it to be altered into &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, as it has been by the Masoretes, to make it accord with <a href="/ezekiel/18-28.htm">Ezekiel 18:28</a>; but it is the apocopated form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, as in the preceding clause, and the object is to be repeated from what precedes, as in the similar case which we find in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>, (18). Ewald and Hitzig propose to alter &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="/ezekiel/18-17.htm">Ezekiel 18:17</a> into &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500; after <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>, but without the slightest necessity. The lxx are not to be taken as an authority for this, since the Chaldee and Syriac have both read and rendered &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;; and Ezekiel, when repeating the same sentences, is accustomed to make variations in particular words. Holding back the hand from the distressed, is equivalent to abstaining from seizing upon him for the purpose of crushing him (compare <a href="/ezekiel/18-12.htm">Ezekiel 18:12</a>); &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498;, in the midst of his countrymen  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, is adopted from the language of the Pentateuch. &#1502;&#1514; after &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is a participle. The question, "Why does the son not help to bear?" is not a direct objection on the part of the people, but is to be taken as a pretext, which the people might offer on the ground of the law, that God would visit the sin of the fathers upon the sons in justification of their proverb. Ezekiel cites this pretext for the purpose of meeting it by stating the reason why this does not occur. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1489;, to carry, near or with, to join in carrying, or help to carry (cf. <a href="/numbers/11-17.htm">Numbers 11:17</a>). This proved the proverb to be false, and confirmed the assertion made in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>, to which the address therefore returns (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). The righteousness of the righteous man will come upon him, i.e., upon the righteous man, namely, in its consequences. The righteous man will receive the blessing of righteousness, but the unrighteous man the curse of his wickedness. There is no necessity for the article, which the Keri proposes to insert before &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. </body></html>
