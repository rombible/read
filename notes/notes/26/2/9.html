All who speak from God to others, must obey his voice. The discoveries of sin, and the warnings of wrath, should be matter of lamentation.

The writing was usually on one side, but in this case it was written within and without, on both sides, the writing as it were running over, to express the abundance of the calamities in store for the devoted people. To eat the book signifies to be thoroughly possessed with its contents (compare <a href="/ezekiel/3-10.htm">Ezekiel 3:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a>).

Books were frequently written on parchment or vellum, and rolled about a stick, in form of a cylinder; and hence they were called volumes or rolls, <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a>.

The words connect themselves with the use of the hand stretched out of a cloud as the symbols of the Divine energy both in Jewish and Christian art. The writer has in his possession a Jewish brass tablet, probably of the sixteenth century, commemorating the legend of the miraculous supply of oil at the Feast of the Dedication, in which such a hand appears as pouring oil into the seven-branched candlestick, or lamp, of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Lo, a roll of a book,</span> etc. The words remind us of the volume, or roll, in <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a>; <a href="/zechariah/5-1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>; like those which are still used in Jewish synagogues. </body></html>
