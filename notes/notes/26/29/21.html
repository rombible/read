These consequences were primarily the conviction of the futility of trust in any earthly aid, and hence a turning to their neglected God, and<span class= "bld">,</span> as a result of this, the giving up of their long cherished idolatries.

There is no recorded prophecy of Ezekiel’s of later date; the expression must therefore be understood of those encouraging and helpful instructions of the prophet, as the people improved under the discipline of the captivity, which it was not seen fitting to put on permanent record.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/29-21.htm" title="In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give you the opening of the mouth in the middle of them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 29:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">In that day — </span>The phrase frequently denotes, in the prophets, not the same time which was last mentioned, but an extraordinary season, remarkable for some signal events of providence: in this sense it is to be understood here. <span class="ital">I will cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth</span> — The horns being the token of strength in beasts, and that in which their power chiefly consists; therefore the word is put to signify strength, or dominion, or a flourishing condition; and therefore to say, that <span class="ital">the horn of Israel should bud forth, </span>was as much as to say, that the Jewish nation should grow prosperous, and come to a flourishing condition again.

Not at the time of Egypt's destruction, unless it can be thought that this refers to the advancement of Daniel in the court of Babylon; or to the taking of Jehoiachin out of prison, and setting his throne above the rest of the kings; which events came to pass a little after this: but rather this respects the time of Egypt's restoration forty years after, when Cyrus came to the throne, and proclaimed liberty to the Jews to return to their own land, and build their city and temple, under the government of Zerubbabel their prince: besides, it may not be limited to either of these times, but may regard the famous day, when the kingdom of Israel, in a spiritual sense, should flourish under the Messiah, the Horn of salvation, and Branch of David, often promised to bud forth, and was fulfilled in Jesus, <a href="/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>.

The ref. is to the general time when Neb. shall have humbled Egypt. After that shall the time of Israel’s prosperity come in.

The “horn” is the symbol of power (<a href="/lamentations/4-3.htm" title="Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.">Lamentations 4:3</a>); with the budding of the horn power waxes or is exhibited. The ref. is general, to the restoration of Israel to prosperity and influence, hardly particularly to the raising up of the personal Messiah (<a href="/psalms/132-17.htm" title="There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.">Psalm 132:17</a>). On figure cf. <a href="/1_kings/22-11.htm" title="And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus said the LORD, With these shall you push the Syrians, until you have consumed them.">1 Kings 22:11</a>; <a href="/amos/6-13.htm" title="You which rejoice in a thing of nothing, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?">Amos 6:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-25.htm" title="The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 48:25</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-1.htm" title="And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoices in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in your salvation.">1 Samuel 2:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the opening</span>] <span class="bld">opening</span> of. The prophet felt his mouth closed by the incredulity of the people, and the improbability, as it seemed to them, of his predictions. His mouth was opened and he had boldness of speech when his anticipations were verified. It is the causing of a horn to bud to Israel that will give the prophet opening of the mouth. All his prophecies since the exile had been prophecies of Israel’s restoration, and Israel’s restored felicity will fulfil them. The phrase give thee opening of the mouth means little more than give verification to thy words. The idea of the prophet’s own presence when this occurs is hardly to be pressed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The horn of the house of Israel.</span> The "horn" is, as always (<a href="/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>), the symbol of power. Jeremiah's use of it (<a href="/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3</a>) may well have been present to Ezekiel's thoughts. That horn had been cut off, but it should begin to sprout again, and the prophet himself should resume his work as the teacher of his people, which had apparently been suspended for many years after the closing vision of the restoration of the temple and of Israel. The words justify the conclusion that Ezekiel resumed his labors after  <span class="date">B.C. 572</span>.
