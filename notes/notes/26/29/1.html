Why, then, do we boast? Self is the great idol which all the world worships, in contempt of God and his sovereignty. God can force men out of that in which they are most secure and easy. Such a one, and all that cleave to him, shall perish together. Thus end men's pride, presumption, and carnal security. The Lord is against those who do harm to his people, and still more against those who lead them into sin. Egypt shall be a kingdom again, but it shall be the basest of the kingdoms; it shall have little wealth and power. History shows the complete fulfilment of this prophecy.

It will be well, therefore, to begin with a Brief survey of the relations which existed at this period between Judah, Egypt, and Babylon. After the great defeat of Pharaoh-Necho by Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish ( <span class="date">B.C. 604</span>), on which Jeremiah (46.) dwells fully, he was succeeded in  <span class="date">B.C. 594</span> by his son Psammetik II. the Psammis of Herodotus 2:160, who invaded Ethiopia, and died in  <span class="date">B.C. 588</span>, leaving the throne to his son Uah-prahet, the Pharaoh Hophra of <a href="/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>, the Apries of Herod., 2:161. The Greek historian tells us that he attacked Tyre and Zidon, failed in an enterprise against Cyrene, and was deposed by Amasis ( <span class="date">B.C. 569</span>). Zedekiah and his counselors, following in the steps of Hezekiah (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30</a>.) and Jehoiakim (<a href="/jeremiah/46.htm">Jeremiah 46</a>.), had courted his alliance against the Chaldeans. As Ezekiel had prophesied (<a href="/ezekiel/17-11.htm">Ezekiel 17:11-18</a>), they found that they were once more leaning on a broken reed. We have now come to  <span class="date">B.C. 589</span>, when Jerusalem was actually besieged, but was still dreaming of being relieved by an Egyptian army.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Destruction of Tyre<p><a href="/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a>.

At the noise of the cry of thy sailors the places tremble. <a href="/ezekiel/27-29.htm">Ezekiel 27:29</a>.

When thy sales came forth out of the seas, thou didst satisfy many nations; with the abundance of thy goods and thy wares thou didst enrich kings of the earth. <a href="/ezekiel/27-34.htm">Ezekiel 27:34</a>. Now that thou art wrecked away from the seas in the depths of the water, thy wares and all thy company are fallen in thee. <a href="/ezekiel/27-35.htm">Ezekiel 27:35</a>. All the inhabitants of the islands are amazed at thee, and their kings shudder greatly; their faces quiver. <a href="/ezekiel/27-36.htm">Ezekiel 27:36</a>. The traders among the nations hiss over thee; thou hast become a terror, and art gone for ever. - The allusion to the ships of Tarshish, to which Tyre was indebted for its glory, serves as an introduction to a renewal in <a href="/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a> of the allegory of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5-9</a>; Tyre is a ship, which is wrecked by the east wind (cf. <a href="/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>). In Palestine (Arabia and Syria) the east wind is characterized by continued gusts; and if it rises into a tempest, it generally causes great damage on account of the violence of the gusts (see Wetzstein in Delitzsch's commentary on <a href="/job/27-1.htm">Job 27:1</a>). Like a ship broken in pieces by the storm, Tyre with all its glory sinks into the depths of the sea. The repetition of &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489; in <a href="/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/27-27.htm">Ezekiel 27:27</a> forms an effective contrast to <a href="/ezekiel/27-25.htm">Ezekiel 27:25</a>; just as the enumeration of all the possessions of Tyre, which fall with the ship into the heart of the sea, does to the wealth and glory in <a href="/ezekiel/27-25.htm">Ezekiel 27:25</a>. They who manned the ship also perish with the cargo, - "the seamen," i.e., sailors, rowers, repairers of leaks (calkers), also the merchants on board, and the fighting men who defended the ship and its goods against pirates, - the whole qa&#770;ha&#770;l, or gathering of people, in the ship. The difficult expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; can only be taken as an explanatory apposition to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1498;: all the men who are in thee, namely, in the multitude of people in thee. <a href="/ezekiel/27-28.htm">Ezekiel 27:28</a>. When the vessel is wrecked, the managers of the ship raise such a cry that the migresho&#772;th tremble. &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; is used in <a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2</a> for the precincts around the Levitical cities, which were set apart as pasture ground for the flocks; and in <a href="/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-17.htm">Ezekiel 48:17</a>, for the ground surrounding the holy city. Consequently &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; cannot mean the suburbs of Tyre in the passage before us, but must signify the open places on the mainland belonging to Tyre, i.e., the whole of its territory, with the fields and villages contained therein. The rendering "fleet," which Ewald follows the Vulgate in adopting, has nothing to support it.<p><a href="/ezekiel/27-29.htm">Ezekiel 27:29</a>. The ruin of this wealthy and powerful metropolis of the commerce of the world produces the greatest consternation among all who sail upon the sea, so that they forsake their ships, as if they were no longer safe in them, and leaving them for the land, bewail the fall of Tyre with deepest lamentation. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506; with &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;, as in <a href="/psalms/26-7.htm">Psalm 26:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a>, etc. For the purpose of depicting the lamentation as great and bitter in the extreme, Ezekiel groups together all the things that were generally done under such circumstances, viz., covering the head with dust (cf. <a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; and <a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>) and ashes (&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, to strew, or cover oneself, not to roll oneself: see the comm. on <a href="/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10</a>); shaving a bald place (see <a href="/ezekiel/7-18.htm">Ezekiel 7:18</a> and the comm. on <a href="/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>); putting on sackcloth; loud, bitter weeping (&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;, as in <a href="/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a> and <a href="/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a>); and singing an mournful dirge (<a href="/ezekiel/27-32.htm">Ezekiel 27:32</a>.). &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, in lamento eorum; &#1504;&#1497; contracted from &#1504;&#1492;&#1497; (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-17.htm">Jeremiah 9:17-18</a>; cf. &#1492;&#1497;, <a href="/ezekiel/2-10.htm">Ezekiel 2:10</a>). The reading adopted by the lxx, Theodot., Syr., and eleven Codd. (&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;) is unsuitable, as there is no allusion to sons, but the seamen themselves raise the lamentation. The correction proposed by Hitzig, &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, is altogether inappropriate. The exclamation, Who is like Tyre! is more precisely defined by &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, like the destroyed one in the midst of the sea. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, participle Pual, with the &#1502; dropt, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/2-10.htm">2 Kings 2:10</a>, etc. (vid., Ges. 52. 2, Anm. 6). It is quite superfluous to assume that there was a noun &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; signifying destruction. '&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; has been aptly explained by Hitzig; "inasmuch as thy wares sprang out of the sea, like the plants and field-fruits out of the soil" (the selection of the word &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; also suggested this simile); "not as being manufactured at Tyre, and therefore in the sea, but because the sea floated the goods to land for the people in the ships, and they satisfied the desire of the purchasers." Tyre satisfied peoples and enriched kings with its wares, not only by purchasing from them and paying for their productions with money or barter, but also by the fact that the Tyrians gave a still higher value to the raw material by the labour which they bestowed upon them. &#1492;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; in the plural is only met with here. - <a href="/ezekiel/27-34.htm">Ezekiel 27:34</a>. But now Tyre with its treasures and its inhabitants has sunk in the depths of the sea. The antithesis in which <a href="/ezekiel/27-34.htm">Ezekiel 27:34</a> really stands to <a href="/ezekiel/27-33.htm">Ezekiel 27:33</a> does not warrant our altering &#1506;&#1514; into &#1506;&#1514;&#1468; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;, as Ewald and Hitzig propose, or adopting a different division of the second hemistich. &#1506;&#1514; is an adverbial accusative, as in <a href="/ezekiel/16-57.htm">Ezekiel 16:57</a> : "at the time of the broken one away from the seas into the depth of the waters, thy wares and thy people have fallen, i.e., perished." &#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, tempore quo fracta es. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is intentionally selected as an antithesis to &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a>. - <a href="/ezekiel/27-35.htm">Ezekiel 27:35</a>.
