According to the so-called priest-code, the Levites were Levi's descendants, who were chosen by Jehovah for service in the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-13</a>; <a href="/numbers/16-9.htm">Numbers 16:9</a>), to minister to the priests when these sacrificed in the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-6.htm">Numbers 18:6</a>), and in particular to keep the charge of the tabernacle, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the house and all its vessels (<a href="/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>), as distinguished from the charge of the sanctuary and of the altar, which pertained to Aaron and his sons alone as priests (<a href="/numbers/18-2.htm">Numbers 18:2-6, 23</a>). The Deuteronomic code, says Wellhausen ('Geschichte Israels,' pp. 121, etc.), was unacquainted with any such distinction between Levites and priests, who, it is alleged, composed one homogeneous body, the tribe of Levi, whose members were equally empowered to officiate at the altar (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>), the lower duties of the tabernacle having been performed by the aforesaid strangers, and the subordination of Levites to priests having first been suggested by Ezekiel (comp. Smend, 'Der Prophet Ezekiel,' p. 361, "<span class="accented">Der</span> <span class="accented">unterschied zwischen Priestern und Leviten ist hier im Enstehn begriffen"</span>), and first formally carried out alter the exile. This theory, however, cannot be admitted as made out in face of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <a href="/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18</a>, which (ver. 1) recognizes "the priests" and" the Levites" as constituting "the whole tribe of Levi," and (ver. 3, 6) distinguishes between "the priest" and "the Levite;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24</a>, which associates with Zadok the priest, the Levites as carriers of the ark; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <a href="/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>, in which the same distinction between the two bodies is recognized; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> 1 and 2 Chronicles, <span class="accented">passim</span>, which attest the existence of priests and Levites as separate temple officials in pre-exilic times; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> <a href="/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a>, 62; Ezra 3:8, 10; 6:20, which show that the distinction, alleged to have been first made by Ezekiel, was well known to the first company of exiles who returned under  Zerubbabel to Jerusalem, and was by them traced back to pre-exilic times (see Keil, on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschDeuteronomy 18:1; Curtiss's 'Levitical Priests,' pp. 22, etc.; Delitzsch, in Luthardt's 'Zeit-schrift fur kirchliche Wissensehaft,' pp. 286, etc., aud in Riehm's ' Handworterbuch des Biblischen Alterthums,' art. "Leviten;" Oehler, in Herzog's 'Real-Encyclopadie,' art. "Levi"). The question, therefore, of which Levites Ezekiel speaks in this verse, whether of those whose duties were of a menial order or of those whose functions partook of a priestly character, is not difficult to resolve. It could hardly have been the former, since in vers. 11-14 Ezekiel's Levites are represented as about to be degraded by being relegated to inferior tasks than those they had formerly performed; it must have been the latter, because in the present verse they are designated the <span class="cmt_word">Levites that are gone away</span> (or, <span class="accented">went</span>) <span class="cmt_word">far from me, when Israel went astray</span>. Now, Israel's apostasy from Jehovah and declension towards idolatry began with Solomon's unfaithfulness (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-8</a>), and continued with greater or less intensity in every subsequent reign till the exile; it certainly cannot be restricted, as Keil and Currey propose, to Jeroboam's conduct in setting up rival sanctuaries in Dan and Bethel, with altars and priests, for the accommodation of the northern kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-33</a>). Nor is there room for doubting, although historical notices of the fact are not abundant, that in this apostasy the priesthood largely led the way (<a href="/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7, 11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11-16</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4</a>), becoming priests of the high places, ministering for the people at heathen altars, and so causing them to fall into iniquity (ver. 12). Hengstenberg and Plumptre suggest that the reason why these apostate priests are now called Levites was to intimate that they were no more worthy of the priesthood, and were about to be reduced to the lower ministry of the Levites so called. Consequently, under the new Torah, those among the priests (who were also Levites) who had been guilty of this flagrant wickedness (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, says Delitzsch, all the Aaronides who were not Zadokitos) would no more, either in themselves or their descendants, be suffered to retain the priestly office, but would be degraded to the status of ordinary Levites, and, like them, should be <span class="cmt_word">ministers</span> in Jehovah's <span class="cmt_word">sanctuary</span>, having <span class="cmt_word">charge</span> <span class="accented">- or</span>, <span class="accented">oversight</span> (Revised Version) - at the gates of the house, and ministering, to (or, <span class="accented">in</span>) the house, i.e. in its courts, serving as keepers of the charge of the house (ver. 14), as watchers at the gates of the house (ver. 11), as slaughterers of the sacrificial victims (ver. 11), but should not, like their brethren who had remained faithful, be allowed to do the office of a priest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> approach the altar to offer sacrifice, or to enter into the holy place (ver. 13). In this way they should bear <span class="cmt_word">their iniquity</span> (vers. 10,12) - a favorite expression in the middle books of the Pentateuch (<a href="/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38, 43</a>; <a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-19.htm">Leviticus 20:19</a>; <a href="/numbers/5-31.htm">Numbers 5:31</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>), but never occurring in Deuteronomy, and meaning "to be requited" on account of, and make expiation for, sin and <span class="cmt_word">their shame and their abominations</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the shame due to them for their abominations - a specially Ezekelian phrase (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/16-52.htm">Ezekiel 16:52, 54</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-30.htm">Ezekiel 32:30</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-7.htm">Ezekiel 36:7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The North Gate and the South Gate of the Outer Court (1 Plate IA)<p>The description of these two gate-buildings is very brief, only the principal portions being mentioned, coupled with the remark that they resembled those of the east gate. The following is the description of the north gate. -  <a href="/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20</a>. And the gate, whose direction was toward the north, touching the outer court, he measured its length and its breadth, <a href="/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>. And its guard-rooms, three on this side and three on that, and its pillars and its wall-projections. It was according to the measure of the first gate, fifty cubits its length, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. <a href="/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>. And its windows and its wall-projections and its palms were according to the measure of the gate, whose direction was toward the east; and by seven steps they went up, and its wall-projections were in front of it. <a href="/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>. And a gate to the inner court was opposite the gate to the north and to the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits. - With the measuring of the breadth of the court the measuring man had reached the north gate, which he also proceeded to measure now. In <a href="/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20</a> the words &#1493;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; to &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; are written absolutely; and in <a href="/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a> the verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; does not belong to the objects previously enumerated, viz., guard-rooms, pillars, etc., but these objects are governed by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491; yb denrevog e, and &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; points back to the principal subject of the two verses, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;: it (the gate) was according to the measure... (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/40-15.htm">Ezekiel 40:15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-13.htm">Ezekiel 40:13</a>). For the use of &#1489; in definitions of measurement, "25 &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;" (by the cubit, sc. measured), as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27-18.htm">Exodus 27:18</a>, etc., see Gesenius, 120. 4, Anm. 2. The "first gate" is the east gate, the one first measured and described. In <a href="/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a> the number of steps is given which the flight leading into the gateway had; and this of course applies to the flight of steps of the east gate also (<a href="/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; is not to be regarded as doubtful, as Hitzig supposes, or changed into &#1499;&#1468;; for even if the windows of the east gate were not measured, they had at all events a definite measurement, so that it might be affirmed with regard to the windows of the north gate that their dimensions were the same. This also applies to the palm-decorations. With regard to the &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>), however, it is simply stated that they were measured; but the measurement is not given. &#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>, end) is not to be altered in an arbitrary and ungrammatical way into &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, as Bttcher proposes. The suffix &#1492;&#1501; refers to the steps. Before the steps there were the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; of the gate-building. This "before," however, is not equivalent to "outside the flight of steps," as Bttcher imagines; for the measuring man did not go out of the inside of the gate, or go down the steps into the court, but came from the court and ascended the steps, and as he was going up he saw in front (vis--vis) of the steps the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; of the gate, i.e., the wall-projections on both sides of the threshold of the gate. In <a href="/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a> it is observed for the first time that there was a gate to the inner court opposite to the northern and the eastern gate of the outer court already described, so that the gates of the outer and inner court stood vis--vis. The distance between these outer and inner gates is then measured, viz., 100 cubits, in harmony with <a href="/ezekiel/40-19.htm">Ezekiel 40:19</a>.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-24.htm">Ezekiel 40:24-27</a> the south gate is described with the same brevity. <a href="/ezekiel/40-24.htm">Ezekiel 40:24</a>. And he led me toward the south, and behold there was a gate toward the south, and he measured its pillars and its wall-projections according to the same measures. <a href="/ezekiel/40-25.htm">Ezekiel 40:25</a>. And there were windows in it and its wall-projections round about like those windows; fifty cubits was the length, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. <a href="/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a>. And seven steps were its ascent and its wall-projections in the front of them, and it had palm-work, one upon this side and one upon that on its pillars. <a href="/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>. And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south, and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits. - This gate also was built exactly like the two others. The description simply differs in form, and not in substance, from the description of the gate immediately preceding. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;, "like those measures," is a concise expression for "like the measures of the pillars already described at the north and east gates." For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-25.htm">Ezekiel 40:25</a>, compare <a href="/ezekiel/40-16.htm">Ezekiel 40:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>; and for <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a>, vid., <a href="/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>. <a href="/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a> is clearly explained from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-16.htm">Ezekiel 40:16</a>, as compared with <a href="/ezekiel/40-9.htm">Ezekiel 40:9</a>. And lastly, <a href="/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a> answers to the 23rd verse, and completes the measuring of the breadth of the court, which was also a hundred cubits upon the south side, from the outer gate to the inner gate standing opposite, as was the case according to <a href="/ezekiel/40-19.htm">Ezekiel 40:19</a> upon the eastern side. Hvernick has given a different explanation of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>, and would take the measurement of a hundred cubits as referring to the distance between the gates of the inner court which stood opposite to each other, because in <a href="/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a> we have &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; in the text, and not &#1502;&#1503; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;; so that we should have to render the passage thus, "he measured from a gate to the gate toward the south a hundred cubits," and not "from the gate (already described) of the outer court," but from another gate, which according to the context of the verse must also be a gate of the inner court. But it is precisely the context which speaks decidedly against this explanation. For since, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-18.htm">Ezekiel 40:18</a>, the measuring man did not take the prophet into the inner court, for the purpose of measuring it before his eyes, till after he had measured from (a) gate to the south gate of the inner court, the distance which he had previously measured and found to be a hundred cubits is not to be sought for within the inner court, and therefore cannot give the distance between the gates of the inner court, which stood opposite to one another, but must be that from the south gate of the outer court to the south gate of the inner. This is the case not only here, but also in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>, where the north gate is mentioned. We may see how little importance is to be attached to the omission of the article in &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; from the expression &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; &#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>, where neither the one gate nor the other is defined, because the context showed which gates were meant. Hvernick's explanation is therefore untenable, notwithstanding the fact that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a>, the size of the inner court was a hundred cubits both in breadth and length. - From the distance between the gates of the outer court and the corresponding gates of the inner, as given in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-19.htm">Ezekiel 40:19</a>, we find that the outer court covered a space of two hundred cubits on every side, - namely, fifty cubits the distance which the outer court building projected into the court, and fifty cubits for the projection of the gate-building of the inner court into the outer court, and a hundred cubits from one gate-porch to the opposite one (50 + 50 + 100  equals  200).<p>Consequently the full size of the building enclosed by the wall (<a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>), i.e., of the temple with its two courts, may also be calculated, as it has been by many of the expositors. If we proceed, for example, from the outer north gate to the outer south gate upon the ground plan (Plate I), we have, to quote the words of Kliefoth, "first the northern breadth of the outer court (D) with its two hundred cubits; then the inner court, which measured a hundred cubits square according to <a href="/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a> (E), with its hundred cubits; and lastly, the south side of the outer court with two hundred cubits more (D); so that the sanctuary was five hundred cubits broad from north to south. And if we start from the entrance of the east gate of the court (A), we have first of all the eastern breadth of the outer court, viz., two hundred cubits; then the inner court (e) with its hundred cubits; after that the temple-buildings, which also covered a space of a hundred cubits square according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13-14</a>, including the open space around them (G), with another hundred cubits; and lastly, the &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; (J), which was situated to the west of the temple-buildings, and also covered a space of a hundred cubits square according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13-14</a>, with another hundred cubits; so that the sanctuary was also five hundred cubits long from east to west, or, in other words, formed a square of five hundred cubits." </body></html>
