The priests who were of the tribe of Levi, whom the Lord chose and separated, to minister to him, and so had a lawful call to this office, and were regularly invested with it; and design true and lawful, as well as faithful, ministers of the word; these are called the sons of Zadok, who descended from Eleazar the son of Aaron in the line of Phinehas, to whom the Lord promised the everlasting priesthood, and who was put into this office by Solomon in the room of Abiathar, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>, his name signifies "righteous", and was a type of Christ; who, as a divine Person, is essentially righteous; as man, truly and perfectly so; and, as Mediator, God's righteous servant; and who, by his obedience and sufferings, is the author of righteousness to his people; who are his spiritual seed and offspring; children given him of his Father; who have his sonship and adoption through him, and are born of him, his Spirit, and grace; and these are made righteous by him, through his righteousness imputed to them, and may be rightly called sons of Zadok: and this agrees with all the saints; and who, under the Gospel dispensation, are all priests, and offer up themselves, souls and bodies, and their spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise, unto God by Christ; though all have not a right to preach the word, and administer ordinances, as ministers lawfully called have, and who seem to be more particularly designed here; and such as are regenerated persons, and justified by Christ's righteousness, and preach the doctrine of free justification by it, are the only fit persons for such an office: <p>that kept the charge of my sanctuary, when the children of Israel went astray from me; that kept and held fast the pure doctrines of the Gospel, committed as a sacred depositum to them, without mixture, and without wavering, with courage and valour; though a greater number were on the other side, and though they were reproached and persecuted for it; and who taught the people to keep the ordinances of the Gospel as they were first delivered, in faith and love, and without sinister ends, and so administered them themselves; and such faithful ministers and members of churches, especially in a time of great declension and general defection, God takes notice of, and has promised them great and good things; see <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>. <p>they shall come near to me to minister unto me; in holy things to his people, which is called ministering unto him; as to pray to him for them; lo preach to them in his name, and administer ordinances: all the saints indeed are priests, and may draw nigh to God through Christ; men are at a distance from him, through sin; there is no coming near to him but by Christ; and this coming near is not local, but spiritual, and includes all acts of worship, particularly prayer; and is a great favour and blessing: <p>and they shall stand before me, to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God; which, under the law, were both the Lord's; the one was burnt, and the other sprinkled, on divers things, and in various places: here it may respect the administration of the ordinance of the Lord's supper, that feast of fat things, and which may be eminently called the goodness and fatness of the house of God; and in which the blood of Christ is represented as shed for the remission of sins, and as spiritual drink indeed to believers; and the sacrifice of Christ is commemorated, the feast being kept in remembrance of that. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/44.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me, and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD:</span><p>(e) Who observed the law of God and did not fall to idolatry.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/44.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15, 16</span>. The priests of the family of Zadok alone shall be priests in the new Temple. These continued faithful to Jehovah when the provincial priests went far from him. The judgment of the prophet may be to some extent a comparative one. The worship at Jerusalem never sank to the level of the licentiousness and corruption prevailing at the rural sanctuaries, though undoubtedly the record of the reform of Josiah reveals great corruptions at Jerusalem also (2 Kings 23). How far these were introduced by the kings, such as Manasseh, despite the opposition of the priests, cannot be ascertained. The reforms of Hezekiah most probably, and certainly those of Josiah, were promoted by the priests (2 Kings 22). The family of Zadok dates from Solomon, who deposed Abiathar on account of his favouring the pretensions of Adonijah and installed Zadok in his place. Since those remote times the Zadokites had served in the temple, and upon the whole the prophet’s favourable judgment of them is no doubt justified (cf. 2 Kings 11; <a href="/isaiah/8-2.htm" title="And I took to me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.">Isaiah 8:2</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">ordinance for the priests</span>. That Ezekiel derived the phrase, <span class="cmt_word">the priests</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Levites</span>, from Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 17:9; 18:1; 24:8; 27:9) may be granted without admitting that the Levites were all priests, or that the phrase had other import than that the priests were, as the Deuteronomist says, "sons of Levi" (Deuteronomy 21:5; 31:9). The priesthood, at its institution, having been entrusted to Aaron and his sons (<a href="/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20, 21</a>; <a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1-4</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9, 44</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/25-13.htm">Numbers 25:13</a>), on Aaron's death the high priesthood passed into the hands of Eleazar, his eldest (living) son (<a href="/numbers/20-26.htm">Numbers 20:26-28</a>), and after Eleazar's death into those of Phinehas, his eldest son (<a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11-13</a>). In the last days of the judges, when the ark and tabernacle stood at Shiloh, the high priesthood belonged to Eli, of the line of Ithamar (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a> and 1 Sam 22:20 with <a href="/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a>), in which line it continued till the reign of David, when it was held conjointly by Abiathar (called also Ahimelech) of the line of Ithamar, and Zadok of the line of Eleazar (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-4.htm">1 Kings 4:4</a>). This arrangement, however, Solomon eventually overturned, by deposing the former for espousing Adonijah's pretensions to the throne (<a href="/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>), and from that time forward till the exile the high priesthood remained with Zadok and his sons (<a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>). When, therefore, it is announced to Ezekiel that his vision-sanctuary should have as <span class="cmt_word">priests the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of Jehovah's sanctuary, when the children of Israel went astray from him</span>; the first question that arises is - To <span class="accented">what does this allude?</span> Kliefoth holds it cannot mean that, while Israel as a whole declined into idolatry, the Zadokite priests remained faithful to the worship of Jehovah, because the vision of Judah's idolatries granted to the prophet, in <a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, revealed quite clearly that the priesthood was as much caught in the national apostasy as were the princes or the people. Nor is the language of the text perfectly satisfied by the view of  Havernick, Keil, Delitzsch, and others, that it goes beck to Zadok's fidelity to the throne of David at the time of Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-29</a>), a fidelity exhibited also by Abiathar, or to his adherence to Solomon in preference to Adonijah (<a href="/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8, 39</a>), this time without Abiathar's concurrence, rather in the face of his opposition. In neither of these instances was Zadok's fidelity specially directed towards Jehovah's sanctuary, but concerned expressly and exclusively David's throne. Hence the commendation of the Zadokites' fidelity can only signify that, while the priesthood as a body were corrupt like the people, there were among them, as among the people, some who, like Ezekiel, continued steadfast to Jehovah's sanctuary; that these faithful few were Zadokites (see <a href="/ezekiel/48-11.htm">Ezekiel 48:11</a>), and that to these should be entrusted the priesthood in the new sanctuary. But, at this point, a second question <span class="accented">starts - Was it intended to declare that the new priesthood should be Zadokites in body</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in respect of lineal descent, or <span class="accented">only in soul</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in respect of moral and religious excellence? The former is contended by Kuenen, Wellhausen, Smend, and others, who see in the vision-sanctuary a plan of the second, or post-exilic, temple, and in its ordinances a program for the establishment of the Levitical hierarchy; but this contention shatters itself on the fact that no proof exists either that the second temple was constructed after Ezekiel's as a model, or that those who served in it were exclusively flesh and blood Zadokites. The latter opinion, favored by Kliefoth, appears the more correct, that moral and spiritual resemblance to the sons of Zadok should form the first qualification for the priesthood in this ideal sanctuary of the future (see note at the end of <a href="/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Gates of the Inner Court<p>(Vid., Plate I B and Plate II II). - <a href="/ezekiel/40-28.htm">Ezekiel 40:28</a>.

And its pillars stood toward the outer court; and palms were upon its pillars on this side and on that; and its ascent was eight steps. - In <a href="/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a> the measuring man had measured the distance from the south gate of the outer court to the south gate of the inner court, which stood opposite to it. He then took the prophet through the latter (<a href="/ezekiel/40-28.htm">Ezekiel 40:28</a>) into the inner court, and measured it as he went through, and found the same measurements as he had found in the gates of the outer court. This was also the case with the measurements of the guard-rooms, pillars, and wall-projections, and with the position of the windows, and the length and breadth of the whole of the gate-building (<a href="/ezekiel/40-29.htm">Ezekiel 40:29</a>); from which it follows, as a matter of course, that this gate resembled the outer gate in construction, constituent parts, and dimensions. This also applied to both the east gate and north gate, the description of which in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-32.htm">Ezekiel 40:32-37</a> corresponds exactly to that of the south gate, with the exception of slight variations of expression. It is true that the porch is not mentioned in the case of either of these gates; but it is evident that this was not wanting, and is simply passed over in the description, as we may see from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-39.htm">Ezekiel 40:39</a>, where the tables for the sacrifices are described as being in the porch (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;). There are only two points of difference mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-31.htm">Ezekiel 40:31</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-34.htm">Ezekiel 40:34</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-37.htm">Ezekiel 40:37</a>, by which these inner gates were distinguished from the outer. In the first place, that the flights of steps to the entrances to these gates had eight steps according to the closing words of the verses just cited, whereas those of the outer gates had only seven (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a>); whilst the expression also varies. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493; being constantly used here instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; (<a href="/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a>). &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, from &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, the ascending, are literally ascents, i.e., places of mounting, for a flight of steps or staircase. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;, the plural of &#1502;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492;, the ascent (not a singular, as Hitzig supposes), has the same meaning.<p>The second difference, which we find in the first clause of the verses mentioned, as of a more important character. It is contained in the words, "and its &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (the projecting portions of the inner side-walls of the gateway) were directed toward the outer court" (&#1488;&#1500; and &#1500; indicating the direction). The interpretation of this somewhat obscure statement is facilitated by the fact that in <a href="/ezekiel/40-37.htm">Ezekiel 40:37</a> &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; stands in the place of &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; (<a href="/ezekiel/40-31.htm">Ezekiel 40:31</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-34.htm">Ezekiel 40:34</a>). &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; are the two lofty gate-pillars by the porch of the gate, which formed the termination of the gate-building towards the inner court in the case of the outer gates. If, then, in the case of the inner gates, these pillars stood toward the outer court, the arrangement of these gates must have taken the reverse direction to that of the outer gates; so that a person entering the gate would not go from the flight of steps across the threshold to the guard-rooms, and then across the second threshold to the porch, but would first of all enter the porch by the pillars in front, and then go across the threshold to the guard-rooms, and, lastly, proceed across the second threshold, and so enter the inner court. But if this gate-building, when looked at from without, commenced with the porch-pillars and the front porch, this porch at any rate must have been situated outside the dividing wall of the two courts, that is to say, must have been within the limits of the outer court. And further, if the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, or wall-projections between the guard-rooms and by the thresholds, were also directed toward the outer court, the whole of the gate-building must have been built within the limits of that court. This is affirmed by the first clauses of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-31.htm">Ezekiel 40:31</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-34.htm">Ezekiel 40:34</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-37.htm">Ezekiel 40:37</a>, which have been so greatly misunderstood; and there is no necessity to alter &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493; in <a href="/ezekiel/40-37.htm">Ezekiel 40:37</a> into &#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, in accordance with <a href="/ezekiel/40-31.htm">Ezekiel 40:31</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-34.htm">Ezekiel 40:34</a>. For what is stated in <a href="/ezekiel/40-31.htm">Ezekiel 40:31</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-34.htm">Ezekiel 40:34</a> concerning the position or direction of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, also applies to the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;; and they are probably mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/40-37.htm">Ezekiel 40:37</a> because of the intention to describe still further in <a href="/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38</a> what stood near the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. Kliefoth very properly finds it incomprehensible, "that not a few of the commentators have been able, in spite of these definite statements in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-13.htm">Ezekiel 40:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-34.htm">Ezekiel 40:34</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-37.htm">Ezekiel 40:37</a>, to adopt the conclusion that the gate-buildings of the inner gates were situated within the inner court, just as the gate-buildings of the outer gates were situated within the outer court. As the inner court measured only a hundred cubits square, if the inner gates had stood within the inner court, the north and south gates of the inner court would have met in the middle, and the porch of the east gate of the inner court would have stood close against the porches of the other two gates. It was self-evident that the gate-buildings of the inner gates stood within the more spacious outer court, like those of the outer gates. Nevertheless, the reason why the situation of the inner gates is so expressly mentioned in the text is evidently, that this made the position of the inner gates the reverse of that of the outer gates. In the case of the outer gates, the first threshold was in the surrounding wall of the outer court, and the steps stood in front of the wall; and thus the gate-building stretched into the outer court. In that of the inner gates, on the contrary the second threshold lay between the surrounding walls of the inner court, and the gate-building stretched thence into the outer court, and its steps stood in front of the porch of the gate. Moreover, in the case of the east gates, for example, the porch of the outer gate stood toward the west, and the porch of the inner gate toward the east, so that the two porches stood opposite to each other in the outer court, as described in <a href="/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>."<p>In <a href="/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Ezekiel 40:30</a> further particulars respecting the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; are given, which are apparently unsuitable; and for this reason the verse has been omitted by the lxx, while J. D. Michaelis, Bttcher, Ewald, Hitzig, and Maurer, regard it as an untenable gloss. Hvernick has defended its genuineness; but inasmuch as he regards &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; as synonymous with &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, he has explained it in a most marvellous and decidedly erroneous manner, as Kliefoth has already proved. The expression &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, and the length and breadth of the &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; here given, both appear strange. Neither of the length of the twenty-five cubits nor the breadth of the five cubits seems to tally with the other measures of the gate-building. So much may be regarded as certain, that the twenty-five cubits' length and the five cubits' breadth of the &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; cannot be in addition to the total length of the gate-building, namely fifty cubits, or its total breadth of twenty-five cubits, but must be included in them. For the &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; were simply separate portions of the side-enclosure of the gateway, since this enclosure of fifty cubits long consisted of wall-projections (&#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;), three open guard-rooms, and a porch with pillars. The open space of the guard-rooms was 3 x 6  equals  18 cubits, and the porch was six cubits broad in the clear (<a href="/ezekiel/40-7.htm">Ezekiel 40:7</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-8.htm">Ezekiel 40:8</a>), and the pillars two cubits thick. If we deduct these 18 + 6 + 2  equals  26 cubits from the fifty cubits of the entire length, there remain twenty-four cubits for the walls by the side of the thresholds and between the guard-rooms, namely, 2 x 5  equals  10 cubits for the walls between the three guard-rooms, 2 x 6  equals  12 cubits for the walls of the threshold, and 2 cubits for the walls of the porch; in all, therefore, twenty-four cubits for the &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;; so that only one cubit is wanting to give us the measurement stated, viz., twenty-five cubits. We obtain this missing cubit if we assume that the front of the wall-projections by the guard-rooms and thresholds was a handbreadth and a half, or six inches wider than the thickness of the walls, that is to say, that it projected three inches on each side in the form of a moulding. - The breadth of the &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; in question, namely five cubits, was the thickness of their wall-work, however, or the dimension of the intervening wall from the inside to the outside on either side of the gateway. That the intervening walls should be of such a thickness will not appear strange, if we consider that the surrounding wall of the court was six cubits thick, with a height of only six cubits (<a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>). And even the striking expression &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; becomes intelligible if we take into consideration the fact that the projecting walls bounded not only the entrance to the gate, and the passage through it on the two sides, but also the inner spaces of the gate-building (the guard-rooms and porch) on all sides, and, together with the gates, enclosed the gateway on every side. Consequently <a href="/ezekiel/40-30.htm">Ezekiel 40:30</a> not only as a suitable meaning, but furnishes a definite measurement of no little value for the completion of the picture of the gate-buildings. The fact that this definite measure was not given in connection with the gates of the outer court, but was only supplemented in the case of the south gate of the inner court, cannot furnish any ground for suspecting its genuineness, as several particulars are supplemented in the same manner in this description. Thus, for example, the number of steps in front of the outer gates is first given in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>, where the north gate is described. Still less is there to surprise us in the fact that these particulars are not repeated in the case of the following gates, in which some writers have also discovered a ground for suspecting the genuineness of the verse.<p>From the south gate the measuring man led the prophet (<a href="/ezekiel/40-32.htm">Ezekiel 40:32</a>) into the inner court toward the east, to measure for him the inner east gate, the description of which (<a href="/ezekiel/40-33.htm">Ezekiel 40:33</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-34.htm">Ezekiel 40:34</a>) corresponds exactly to that of the south gate. Lastly, he led him (<a href="/ezekiel/40-35.htm">Ezekiel 40:35</a>) to the inner north gate for the same purpose; and this is also found to correspond to those previously mentioned, and is described in the same manner. The difficulty which Hitzig finds in &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-32.htm">Ezekiel 40:32</a>, and which drives him into various conjectures, with the assistance of the lxx, vanishes, if instead of taking &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; along with &#1492;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; as a further definition of the latter, we connect it with &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; as an indication of the direction taken: he led me into the inner court, the way (or direction) toward the east, and measured the gate (situated there). The words, when taken in this sense, do not warrant the conclusion that he had gone out at the south gate again. -  &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491;&#1491; in <a href="/ezekiel/40-35.htm">Ezekiel 40:35</a> is an Aramaic form for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491; in <a href="/ezekiel/40-32.htm">Ezekiel 40:32</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-28.htm">Ezekiel 40:28</a>. </body></html>
