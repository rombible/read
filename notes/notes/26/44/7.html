What is reprobated is not of course allowing foreigners to present sacrifices to Jehovah, which they might do (<a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm" title="And whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eats any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 17:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-12.htm" title="Therefore I said to the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojournes among you eat blood.">Leviticus 17:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-14.htm" title="And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD; as you do, so he shall do.">Numbers 15:14</a>), but allowing them to <span class="ital">officiate</span> in the offering, and in general in the ministry of the sanctuary. It is not ascertainable to what extent these uncircumcised heathen were permitted to fill the subordinate offices about the house, such as those of keepers of the gates and assistants to the priests, but just as the kings employed foreign mercenaries as guards (who were employed even in the temple, <a href="/2_kings/11-7.htm" title="And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.">2 Kings 11:7</a>), it appears that persons not Israelites and not incorporated in Israel by the necessary rites, were employed in the house. They were probably captives taken in war and the like (<a href="/joshua/9-27.htm" title="And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place which he should choose.">Joshua 9:27</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-13.htm" title="And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a meat hook of three teeth in his hand;">1 Samuel 2:13</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-21.htm" title="Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness to the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.">Zechariah 14:21</a>; cf. <a href="/ezra/8-20.htm" title="Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.">Ezra 8:20</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-58.htm" title="All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two.">Ezra 2:58</a>). This is regarded by the prophet as a profanation of the house and an infraction of the covenant between Jehovah and Israel. It is the latter from the nature of the case. Israel was the people of the Lord and his service must be performed by Israel. These heathen were uncircumcised both in flesh and heart, their service was purely mercenary, and without religious reality.

Ewald, Havernick, Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Currey restrict the designation "strangers" to unfaithful and unauthorized priests, who, as in the days of Israel's apostasy, notoriously under Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/11-15.htm">2 Chronicles 11:15</a>), may, in the confluence of idolatries that took place in Jerusalem during the reigns of Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3, 4, 10-15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2-4, 23-25</a>) and Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-2.htm">2 Kings 21:2-7, 11, 15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-2.htm">2 Chronicles 33:2-7</a>), have been admitted to participate in the temple services; but Kliefoth, Delitzsch, Keil, Smend, and Plumptre, with better judgment, recognize in the "strangers" foreigners who had not incorporated themselves with Israel by submitting to circumcision, but, though dwelling in the midst of Israel, were still uncircumcised heathen in both heart and flesh. With regard to these foreigners, the Law of Moses (<a href="/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8, 10</a>) enacted that, by accepting circumcision, they might become members of the Israelitish commonwealth, but that without this they could not be permitted to partake of the Passover, the highest symbol of national and religious unity (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48, 49</a>). Nevertheless, it was open to them, on giving a certain measure of obedience to the Law (<a href="/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10, 12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16, 22</a>), to enter the sanctuary and present all sorts of offerings to Jehovah (<a href="/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-14.htm">Numbers 15:14, 29</a>) Hence Israel's offence had not been the admission of such "sons of the stranger" into the sanctuary, but the admission of them without insisting on the above specified conditions, in other words, the admission of such as not only lacked the bodily mark of circumcision - which would not have excluded them - but were destitute as well of the first elements of Hebrew piety, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were as uncircumcised in heart as they were in the flesh. The sanctioning of such within the temple courts, while Jehovah's bread, the fat and the blood, was being offered, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> while sacrificial worship was being performed, was not simply a desecration of the "house," but was an express violation of the covenant Jehovah had made with Israel with reference to these very "sons of the stranger." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The North Gate and the South Gate of the Outer Court (1 Plate IA)<p>The description of these two gate-buildings is very brief, only the principal portions being mentioned, coupled with the remark that they resembled those of the east gate. The following is the description of the north gate. -  <a href="/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20</a>. And the gate, whose direction was toward the north, touching the outer court, he measured its length and its breadth, <a href="/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>. And its guard-rooms, three on this side and three on that, and its pillars and its wall-projections. It was according to the measure of the first gate, fifty cubits its length, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. <a href="/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>. And its windows and its wall-projections and its palms were according to the measure of the gate, whose direction was toward the east; and by seven steps they went up, and its wall-projections were in front of it. <a href="/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>. And a gate to the inner court was opposite the gate to the north and to the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits. - With the measuring of the breadth of the court the measuring man had reached the north gate, which he also proceeded to measure now. In <a href="/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20</a> the words &#1493;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; to &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; are written absolutely; and in <a href="/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a> the verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; does not belong to the objects previously enumerated, viz., guard-rooms, pillars, etc., but these objects are governed by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491; yb denrevog e, and &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; points back to the principal subject of the two verses, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;: it (the gate) was according to the measure... (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/40-15.htm">Ezekiel 40:15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-13.htm">Ezekiel 40:13</a>). For the use of &#1489; in definitions of measurement, "25 &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;" (by the cubit, sc. measured), as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27-18.htm">Exodus 27:18</a>, etc., see Gesenius, 120. 4, Anm. 2. The "first gate" is the east gate, the one first measured and described. In <a href="/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a> the number of steps is given which the flight leading into the gateway had; and this of course applies to the flight of steps of the east gate also (<a href="/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; is not to be regarded as doubtful, as Hitzig supposes, or changed into &#1499;&#1468;; for even if the windows of the east gate were not measured, they had at all events a definite measurement, so that it might be affirmed with regard to the windows of the north gate that their dimensions were the same. This also applies to the palm-decorations. With regard to the &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>), however, it is simply stated that they were measured; but the measurement is not given. &#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>, end) is not to be altered in an arbitrary and ungrammatical way into &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, as Bttcher proposes. The suffix &#1492;&#1501; refers to the steps. Before the steps there were the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; of the gate-building. This "before," however, is not equivalent to "outside the flight of steps," as Bttcher imagines; for the measuring man did not go out of the inside of the gate, or go down the steps into the court, but came from the court and ascended the steps, and as he was going up he saw in front (vis--vis) of the steps the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; of the gate, i.e., the wall-projections on both sides of the threshold of the gate. In <a href="/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a> it is observed for the first time that there was a gate to the inner court opposite to the northern and the eastern gate of the outer court already described, so that the gates of the outer and inner court stood vis--vis. The distance between these outer and inner gates is then measured, viz., 100 cubits, in harmony with <a href="/ezekiel/40-19.htm">Ezekiel 40:19</a>.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-24.htm">Ezekiel 40:24-27</a> the south gate is described with the same brevity. <a href="/ezekiel/40-24.htm">Ezekiel 40:24</a>. And he led me toward the south, and behold there was a gate toward the south, and he measured its pillars and its wall-projections according to the same measures. <a href="/ezekiel/40-25.htm">Ezekiel 40:25</a>. And there were windows in it and its wall-projections round about like those windows; fifty cubits was the length, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. <a href="/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a>. And seven steps were its ascent and its wall-projections in the front of them, and it had palm-work, one upon this side and one upon that on its pillars. <a href="/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>. And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south, and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits. - This gate also was built exactly like the two others. The description simply differs in form, and not in substance, from the description of the gate immediately preceding. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;, "like those measures," is a concise expression for "like the measures of the pillars already described at the north and east gates." For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-25.htm">Ezekiel 40:25</a>, compare <a href="/ezekiel/40-16.htm">Ezekiel 40:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>; and for <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a>, vid., <a href="/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>. <a href="/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a> is clearly explained from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-16.htm">Ezekiel 40:16</a>, as compared with <a href="/ezekiel/40-9.htm">Ezekiel 40:9</a>. And lastly, <a href="/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a> answers to the 23rd verse, and completes the measuring of the breadth of the court, which was also a hundred cubits upon the south side, from the outer gate to the inner gate standing opposite, as was the case according to <a href="/ezekiel/40-19.htm">Ezekiel 40:19</a> upon the eastern side. Hvernick has given a different explanation of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>, and would take the measurement of a hundred cubits as referring to the distance between the gates of the inner court which stood opposite to each other, because in <a href="/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a> we have &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; in the text, and not &#1502;&#1503; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;; so that we should have to render the passage thus, "he measured from a gate to the gate toward the south a hundred cubits," and not "from the gate (already described) of the outer court," but from another gate, which according to the context of the verse must also be a gate of the inner court. But it is precisely the context which speaks decidedly against this explanation. For since, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-18.htm">Ezekiel 40:18</a>, the measuring man did not take the prophet into the inner court, for the purpose of measuring it before his eyes, till after he had measured from (a) gate to the south gate of the inner court, the distance which he had previously measured and found to be a hundred cubits is not to be sought for within the inner court, and therefore cannot give the distance between the gates of the inner court, which stood opposite to one another, but must be that from the south gate of the outer court to the south gate of the inner. This is the case not only here, but also in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>, where the north gate is mentioned. We may see how little importance is to be attached to the omission of the article in &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; from the expression &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; &#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>, where neither the one gate nor the other is defined, because the context showed which gates were meant. Hvernick's explanation is therefore untenable, notwithstanding the fact that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a>, the size of the inner court was a hundred cubits both in breadth and length. - From the distance between the gates of the outer court and the corresponding gates of the inner, as given in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-19.htm">Ezekiel 40:19</a>, we find that the outer court covered a space of two hundred cubits on every side, - namely, fifty cubits the distance which the outer court building projected into the court, and fifty cubits for the projection of the gate-building of the inner court into the outer court, and a hundred cubits from one gate-porch to the opposite one (50 + 50 + 100  equals  200).<p>Consequently the full size of the building enclosed by the wall (<a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>), i.e., of the temple with its two courts, may also be calculated, as it has been by many of the expositors. If we proceed, for example, from the outer north gate to the outer south gate upon the ground plan (Plate I), we have, to quote the words of Kliefoth, "first the northern breadth of the outer court (D) with its two hundred cubits; then the inner court, which measured a hundred cubits square according to <a href="/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a> (E), with its hundred cubits; and lastly, the south side of the outer court with two hundred cubits more (D); so that the sanctuary was five hundred cubits broad from north to south. And if we start from the entrance of the east gate of the court (A), we have first of all the eastern breadth of the outer court, viz., two hundred cubits; then the inner court (e) with its hundred cubits; after that the temple-buildings, which also covered a space of a hundred cubits square according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13-14</a>, including the open space around them (G), with another hundred cubits; and lastly, the &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; (J), which was situated to the west of the temple-buildings, and also covered a space of a hundred cubits square according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13-14</a>, with another hundred cubits; so that the sanctuary was also five hundred cubits long from east to west, or, in other words, formed a square of five hundred cubits." </body></html>
