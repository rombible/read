When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Every little chamber - The guard-chambers (a) for the use of the Levites who kept watch in the temple.<p>The threshold of the gate by the porch - The second threshold in the easternmost gate-way (c).<p>Porch - Hebrew &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;  'u&#770;la&#770;m; the Septuagint: &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;  ailam; Vulgate: vestibulum.
