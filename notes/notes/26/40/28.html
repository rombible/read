This and the other gates of this court are essentially the same, and require the same changes of translation as in the case of the outer gates. The same plan will serve for both, remembering that it must be reversed, the porches of one set of gates facing the porches of the other set; of course the steps led to the porches of the inner gates instead of to the opposite end.

When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The gates both of the outer and of the inner court.

Having done with the outer court, east, north, and south, the prophet is brought into the inner court by the south gate, which was nearest to enter by. No mention is made of a western gate, there was one in Solomon's temple; for there were porters appointed westward by David, and fixed by Solomon, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-24.htm">1 Chronicles 9:24</a>, but Josephus (l) says, in the second temple the western part had no gate, but a continued wall; for those that came out of the captivity, as Kimchi on <a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a> observes, built it (as much as they could) according to the form of what they saw in Ezekiel's temple, which shall be in time to come. <p>And he measured the south gate according to these measures; the gate which led into the inner court; for the south gate, which led to the outward court, he had measured before, <a href="/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>. <p>(l) De Bello Jud. l. 5. c. 5. sect. 2.

Opposite to this was the S. gate of the inner court at a distance of 100 cubits (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/40-27.htm" title="And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.">Ezekiel 40:27</a></span>), and the measurement of the inner court naturally begins with the S. gate. The gates of the inner court were similar in all respects to those of the outer court, except that in the former the “porch” lay at the outer end of the gateway, looking into the outer court (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/40-31.htm" title="And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were on the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.">Ezekiel 40:31</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-34.htm" title="And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees were on the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.">Ezekiel 40:34</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-37.htm" title="And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were on the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.">Ezekiel 40:37</a></span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-47.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">inner court</span>, with its gates, chambers and slaughtering-tables: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the south gate (vers. 28-31); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the cast gate (vers. 32-34); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the north gate (vers. 35-37); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span>the arrangements for sacrifice (vers. 38-43); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the chambers for the officiating priests (vers. 44-47). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-31.</span> <span class="accented">- The south gate of the inner court</span>. The construction and measurements of this corresponded with those of the gates in the outer court, with only two points of difference, viz. that it possessed a flight of <span class="cmt_word">eight steps</span> instead of seven, and that <span class="cmt_word">the arches</span>, or wall-projections, were <span class="cmt_word">toward the outer court</span>. The difference in the number of the steps was doubtless of symbolic significance, and pointed not only to the higher sanctity in general which attached to the inner court, but to the truth that, as one approached the dwelling-place of Jehovah, an increasing measure and degree of holiness were demanded - what Plumptre styles "an ever-ascending <span class="accented">sursum corda</span>." The seven steps of the outer door added to the eight steps of this amount to fifteen, with which corresponds the number of the pilgrim-psalms (<a href="/psalms/120.htm">Psalm 120-134</a>.), which are supposed to have been sung, one upon each step, by the choir of Levites as they ascended first into the outer and then into the inner court. The statement that the wall-projections were towards the outer court showed that, in walking through the inner gateway, one would reverse the order of the outer gate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> would first pass through the porch, then cross the threshold to the guard-rooms, next step upon the second threshold, and finally enter the inner court. </body></html>
