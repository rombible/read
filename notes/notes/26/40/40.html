When we despair to be satisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that our salvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plain enough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. This chapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether the personage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is not clear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we must look with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in the midst of the earth, Ps 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On either side of the entrance of the north gate (from the inner court), were two tables on the one side and two tables on the other side of the porch. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38. chambers &#8230; entries&#8212;literally, "a chamber and its door."<p>by the posts&#8212;that is, at or close by the posts or columns.<p>where they washed the burnt offering&#8212;This does not apply to all the gates but only to the north gate.

According to this interpretation the tables would be at the sides of the gate <span class="ital">in</span> the inner court. Others think that the “shoulders” might be the front parts of the gate-building on either side of the steps leading up to it, and that thus the tables would stand in the outer court, two at each angle formed by the steps and the front of the gate. This use of “shoulder” is less natural, but cf. <a href="/context/ezekiel/47-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar....">Ezekiel 47:1-2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-39.htm" title="And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.">1 Kings 7:39</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as one goeth up … north gate</span>] For <span class="ital">as one goeth up</span> (oleh) might be read <span class="ital">at the stairs</span> (olah, as R. V. mar.). The difficulty lies in the word north or northwards. A.V. renders “the north gate” which is most natural. Others think of the E. gate and render: <span class="ital">and on the side without, on the N. as one goeth up to the entry of the gate</span>, i.e. on the left hand of the person going up. But this is extremely improbable. Such a designation of the left hand of a <span class="ital">person</span> has no examples, besides that here the word “north” is too far distant from the other word “one going up.” A possible rendering would be: by the stair, at the entry to the gate northwards, i.e. on the N. side of the entry (<a href="/leviticus/1-11.htm" title="And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about on the altar.">Leviticus 1:11</a>). On the whole “the N. gate” of A.V. is most probable, but the language hardly decides which gate is meant.
