Here, as constantly in all parts of Scripture, apostacy from God is described under the figure of unfaithfulness in the marriage relation. “They shall loathe themselves” indicates a true repentance; they shall loathe the sin and themselves for having committed it. Thus their sin has drawn down punishment; punishment has destroyed many, but brought a “remnant” to repentance; and repentance leads to a true knowledge of God, and communion with Him.

Their whorish hearts would still have forgotten God, if he had not broken their hearts with judgments; but they remembered when broken, and this breaking was the occasion or cause of their remembering God.

And I shall send hunger upon you, and evil beasts, which shall make thee childless; and pestilence and blood shall pass over thee; and the sword will I bring upon thee. I, Jehovah, have spoken it. - As a proof of the unheard-of severity of the judgment, there is immediately mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a> a most horrible circumstance, which had been already predicted by Moses (<a href="/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>) as that which should happen to the people when hard pressed by the enemy, viz., a famine so dreadful, during the siege of Jerusalem, that parents would eat their children, and children their parents; and after the capture of the city, the dispersion of those who remained "to all the winds, i.e., to all quarters of the world." This is described more minutely, as an appendix to the symbolical act in <a href="/ezekiel/5-1.htm">Ezekiel 5:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a>, in <a href="/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>, with a solemn oath, and with repeated and prominent mention of the sins which have drawn down such chastisements. As sin, is mentioned the pollution of the temple by idolatrous abominations, which are described in detail in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8.htm">Ezekiel 8</a>. The &#1488;&#1490;&#1512;&#1506;, which is variously understood by the old translators (for which some Codices offer the explanatory correction &#1488;&#1490;&#1491;&#1506;), is to be explained, after <a href="//biblehub.com/job/36-7.htm">Job 36:7</a>, of the "turning away of the eye," and the &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; following as the object; while &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1505;, "that it feel no compassion," is interjected between the verb and its object with the adverbial signification of "mercilessly." For that the words &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1505; are adverbially subordinate to &#1488;&#1490;&#1512;&#1506;, distinctly appears from the correspondence - indicated by &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; - between &#1488;&#1490;&#1512;&#1506; and &#1500;&#1488; . Moreover, the thought, "Jehovah will mercilessly withdraw His care for the people," is not to be termed "feeble" in connection with what follows; nor is the contrast, which is indicated in the clause &#1493;&#1490;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, lost, as Hvernick supposes. &#1493;&#1490;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; does not require &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; to be understood of a positive act, which would correspond to the desecration of the sanctuary. This is shown by the last clause of the verse. The withdrawal without mercy of the divine providence is, besides, in reality, equivalent to complete devotion to destruction, as it is particularized in <a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>. For <a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a> see on <a href="/ezekiel/5-1.htm">Ezekiel 5:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a>. By carrying out the threatened division of the people into three parts, the wrath of God is to be fulfilled, i.e., the full measure of the divine wrath upon the people is to be exhausted (cf. 7, 8), and God is to appear and "cool" His anger. &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, "sedavit iram," occurs again in <a href="/ezekiel/16-42.htm">Ezekiel 16:42</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-22.htm">Ezekiel 21:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/24-13.htm">Ezekiel 24:13</a>. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, Hithpael, pausal form for &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, "se consolari," "to procure satisfaction by revenge;" cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>, and for the thing, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>. In <a href="/ezekiel/5-14.htm">Ezekiel 5:14</a>. the discourse turns again from the people to the city of Jerusalem. It is to become a wilderness, as was already threatened in <a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a> and <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> to the cities of Israel, and thereby a "mockery" to all nations, in the manner described in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>. &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-15.htm">Ezekiel 5:15</a>, is not to be changed, after the lxx, Vulgate, and some MSS, into the second person; but Jerusalem is to be regarded as the subject which is to become the object of scorn and hatred, etc., when God accomplishes His judgments. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; is a warning-example. Among the judgments which are to overtake it, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-16.htm">Ezekiel 5:16</a>, hunger is again made specially prominent (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>) and first in <a href="/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a> are wild beasts, pestilence, blood, and sword added, and a quartette of judgments announced as in <a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>. For pestilence and blood are comprehended together as a unity by means of the predicate. Their connection is to be understood according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-19.htm">Ezekiel 14:19</a>, and the number four is significant, as in <a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>.
