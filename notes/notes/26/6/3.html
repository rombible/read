These sanctuaries had probably been mainly Canaanitish (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm" title="You shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which you shall possess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm" title="And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.">Leviticus 26:30</a>), but had been adopted by Israel and devoted to the service of Jehovah (ch. <a href="/ezekiel/20-28.htm" title="For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet smell, and poured out there their drink offerings.">Ezekiel 20:28</a>). Along with the sanctuaries themselves no doubt much of the native religious practice was also adopted. After a long struggle these rural high places were abolished by Josiah, and public service of Jehovah confined to the temple at Jerusalem, though they grew up again under Manasseh. Even the worship of Jehovah at such sanctuaries would be very corrupt, and in the last years of the kingdom the worship of other deities was no doubt also practised. This prophet condemns all worship at the high places as “abominations.” This does not appear to be with him a question of mere locality or number of sanctuaries; he considers the high places to be Canaanitish and the service at them no worship of Jehovah.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Divine Word which Explains the Symbolical Signs, in which the judgment that is announced is laid down as to its cause (5-9) and as to its nature (10-17). - <a href="/ezekiel/5-5.htm">Ezekiel 5:5</a>. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: This Jerusalem have I placed in the midst of the nations, and raised about her the countries. <a href="/ezekiel/5-6.htm">Ezekiel 5:6</a>. But in wickedness she resisted my laws more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries which are round about her; for they rejected my laws, and did not walk in my statutes. <a href="/ezekiel/5-7.htm">Ezekiel 5:7</a>. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have raged more than the nations round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, and have not obeyed my laws, and have not done even according to the laws of the nations which are round about you; <a href="/ezekiel/5-8.htm">Ezekiel 5:8</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I, even I, shall be against thee, and will perform judgments in thy midst before the eyes of the nations. <a href="/ezekiel/5-9.htm">Ezekiel 5:9</a>. And I will do unto thee what I have never done, nor will again do in like manner, on account of all thine abominations.<p>&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; not "this is Jerusalem," i.e., this is the destiny of Jerusalem (Hvernick), but "this Jerusalem" (Hitzig); &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; is placed before the noun in the sense of iste, as in <a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>; cf. Ewald, 293b. To place the culpability of Jerusalem in its proper prominence, the censure of her sinful conduct opens with the mention of the exalted position which God had assigned her upon earth. Jerusalem is described in <a href="/ezekiel/5-5.htm">Ezekiel 5:5</a> as forming the central point of the earth: this is done, however, neither in an external, geographical (Hitzig), nor in a purely typical sense, as the city that is blessed more than any other (Calvin, Hvernick), but in a historical sense, in so far as "God's people and city actually stand in the central point of the God-directed world-development and its movements" (Kliefoth); or, in relation to the history of salvation, as the city in which God hath set up His throne of grace, from which shall go forth the law and the statutes for all nations, in order that the salvation of the whole world may be accomplished (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>.; <a href="/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>.). But instead of keeping the laws and statutes of the Lord, Jerusalem has, on the contrary, turned to do wickedness more than the heathen nations in all the lands round about (&#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, cum accusat. object., "to act rebelliously towards"). Here we may not quote <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>, <a href="/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14</a> against this, as if the heathen, who did not know the law of God, did not also transgress the same, but sinned &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;; for the sinning &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, of which the apostle speaks, is really a transgression of the law written on the heart of the heathen. With &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-7.htm">Ezekiel 5:7</a>, the penal threatening is introduced; but before the punishment is laid down, the correspondence between guilt and punishment is brought forward more prominently by repeatedly placing in juxtaposition the godless conduct of the rebellious city. &#1492;&#1502;&#1504;&#1499;&#1501; is infinitive, from &#1492;&#1502;&#1503;, a secondary form &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, in the sense of &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, "to rage," i.e., to rebel against God; cf. <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>. The last clause of <a href="/ezekiel/5-7.htm">Ezekiel 5:7</a> contains a climax: "And ye have not even acted according to the laws of the heathen." This is not in any real contradiction to <a href="/ezekiel/11-12.htm">Ezekiel 11:12</a> (where it is made a subject of reproach to the Israelites that they have acted according to the laws of the heathen), so that we would be obliged, with Ewald and Hitzig, to expunge the &#1500;&#1488; in the verse before us, because wanting in the Peshito and several Hebrew manuscripts. Even in these latter, it has only been omitted to avoid the supposed contradiction with <a href="/ezekiel/11-12.htm">Ezekiel 11:12</a>. The solution of the apparent contradiction lies in the double meaning of the &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497; &#1492;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;. The heathen had laws which were opposed to those of God, but also such as were rooted in the law of God written upon their hearts. Obedience to the latter was good and praiseworthy; to the former, wicked and objectionable. Israel, which hated the law of God, followed the wicked and sinful laws of the heathen, and neglected to observe their good laws. The passage before us is to be judged by <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10-11</a>, to which Raschi had already made reference.<p>(Note: Coccejus had already well remarked on <a href="/ezekiel/11-12.htm">Ezekiel 11:12</a> : "Haec probe concordant. Imitabantur Judaei gentiles vel fovendo opiniones gentiles, vel etiam assumendo ritus et sacra gentilium. Sed non faciebant ut gentes, quae integre diis suis serviebant. Nam Israelitae nomine Dei abutebantur et ipsius populus videri volebant.")<p>In <a href="/ezekiel/5-8.htm">Ezekiel 5:8</a> the announcement of the punishment, interrupted by the repeated mention of the cause, is again resumed with the words '&#1500;&#1499;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. Since Jerusalem has acted worse than the heathen, God will execute His judgments upon her before the eyes of the heathen. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/5-15.htm">Ezekiel 5:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-9.htm">Ezekiel 11:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-41.htm">Ezekiel 16:41</a>, etc.), "to accomplish or execute judgments," is used in <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a> and <a href="/numbers/33-4.htm">Numbers 33:4</a> of the judgments which God suspended over Egypt. The punishment to be suspended shall be so great and heavy, that the like has never happened before, nor will ever happen again. These words do not require us either to refer the threatening, with Coccejus, to the last destruction of Jerusalem, which was marked by greater severity than the earlier one, or to suppose, with Hvernick, that the prophet's look is directed to both the periods of Israel's punishment - the times of the Babylonian and Roman calamity together. Both suppositions are irreconcilable with the words, as these can only be referred to the first impending penal judgment of the destruction of Jerusalem. This was, so far, more severe than any previous or subsequent one, inasmuch as by it the existence of the people of God was for a time suspended, while that Jerusalem and Israel, which were destroyed and annihilated by the Romans, were no longer the people of God, inasmuch as the latter consisted at that time of the Christian community, which was not affected by that catastrophe (Kliefoth). </body></html>
