Unmindfulness of God was at the bottom of all this wickedness. Sinners provoke God because they forget him. Jerusalem has filled the measure of her sins.

Some render it, "and thou shalt be profaned, or polluted in thyself" (e); shalt be known to be so to thyself, as well as appear so to others. The Targum is, <p>"I will be sanctified in thee before the people:'' <p>and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; able to do what I say; faithful to my word; omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent; and this thou shalt not only know, but own and acknowledge, when these calamities take place, and have their effect. <p>(e)  "et prophana effecta in te", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Polanus; "prophana efficeris", Piscator; "et polluta eris in te", Grotius; "et prophnata eris in te", Starckiss; "et prophanaberis in te", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt take thy <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> inheritance in thyself in the sight of the nations, and thou shalt know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</span><p>(i) You will be no more the inheritance of the Lord, but forsaken.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">take thine inheritance</span>] According to the points: and thou shalt be profaned in (through) thyself. The idea that Jehovah “profanes” his people by casting them out of their land is not uncommon, <a href="/isaiah/43-28.htm" title="Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.">Isaiah 43:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-6.htm" title="I was wroth with my people, I have polluted my inheritance, and given them into your hand: you did show them no mercy; on the ancient have you very heavily laid your yoke.">Isaiah 47:6</a>, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/24-21.htm" title="Speak to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left shall fall by the sword.">Ezekiel 24:21</a> (<a href="/ezekiel/28-16.htm" title="By the multitude of your merchandise they have filled the middle of you with violence, and you have sinned: therefore I will cast you as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy you, O covering cherub, from the middle of the stones of fire.">Ezekiel 28:16</a>). It is doubtful if it be anywhere said that this casting out of the people is a profanation of them “in the sight of the heathen.” On the other hand that phrase is often used when Jehovah himself, or his name, is spoken of as being profaned, ch. <a href="/ezekiel/20-9.htm" title="But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 20:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-14.htm" title="But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.">Ezekiel 20:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-22.htm" title="Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.">Ezekiel 20:22</a>. Particularly it is said that Israel’s dispersion among the nations profaned Jehovah’s name, ch. <a href="/context/ezekiel/36-20.htm" title="And when they entered to the heathen, where they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land....">Ezekiel 36:20-23</a>, and in <a href="/ezekiel/39-7.htm" title="So will I make my holy name known in the middle of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.">Ezekiel 39:7</a> Jehovah says, I will not pollute (let be polluted) my name any more (by the humiliation of his people). A slight change of reading gives: <span class="ital">and I will be</span> profaned in thee in the sight.… The whole passage speaks of the chastisement of Israel, not of the purging away their uncleanness (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/22-15.htm" title="And I will scatter you among the heathen, and disperse you in the countries, and will consume your filthiness out of you.">Ezekiel 22:15</a></span>), which is mentioned incidentally (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/22-22.htm" title="As silver is melted in the middle of the furnace, so shall you be melted in the middle thereof; and you shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury on you.">Ezekiel 22:22</a></span>). This chastisement is dispersion among the nations, by which Jehovah is profaned and by which Israel learns to know that he who disperses them is the Lord. Corn. suggests: by which (uncleanness) I have been profaned in thee. Does the idea appear in the prophet that Jehovah was profaned in the eyes of the nations by Israel’s idolatries?<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt take thine inheritance</span>, etc.; better, with the Revised Version, Keil, and most other commentators, <span class="accented">shalt be profaned in thyself, etc</span>.

The epithet city of blood-guiltiness, as in Ezekiel E<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/24-6.htm">Zechariah 24:6</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/24-9.htm">Ezekiel 24:9</a> (compare <a href="/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>), is explained in <a href="/ezekiel/22-3.htm">Ezekiel 22:3</a>. The apodosis commences with &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, and is continued in <a href="/ezekiel/22-3.htm">Ezekiel 22:3</a> (&#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;). &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, that her time, i.e., her time of punishment, may come: &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, like &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; in <a href="/ezekiel/21-30.htm">Ezekiel 21:30</a>. &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is not a continuation of the infinitive &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;, but of the participle &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1499;&#1514;. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;, of which different renderings have been given, does not mean "over itself," i.e., as a burden with which it has laden itself (Hvernick); still less "for itself" (Hitzig), a meaning which &#1506;&#1500; never has, but literally "upon," i.e., in itself, covering the city with it, as it were. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;, thou hast brought near, brought on thy days, that is to say, the days of judgment, and hast come to, arrived at thy years, sc. the years of visitation and punishment (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/11-23.htm">Jeremiah 11:23</a>). This meaning is readily supplied by the context. &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492;, defiled, unclean with regard to the name, i.e., having forfeited the name of a holy city through capital crimes and other sinful abominations. &#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; is internal confusion, both moral and religious, as in <a href="/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a> (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-10.htm">Psalm 55:10-12</a>).<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6-12</a> there follows an enumeration of a multitude of sins which had been committed in Jerusalem. - <a href="/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>. Behold, the princes of Israel are every one, according to his arm, in thee to shed blood. <a href="/ezekiel/22-7.htm">Ezekiel 22:7</a>. Father and mother they despise in thee; toward the foreigner they act violently in the midst of thee; orphans and widows they oppress in thee. <a href="/ezekiel/22-8.htm">Ezekiel 22:8</a>. Thou despisest my holy things, and desecratest my Sabbaths. <a href="/ezekiel/22-9.htm">Ezekiel 22:9</a>. Slanderers are in thee to shed blood, and they eat upon the mountains in thee; they practise lewdness in thee. <a href="/ezekiel/22-10.htm">Ezekiel 22:10</a>. They uncover the father's nakedness in thee; they ravish the defiled in her uncleanness in thee. <a href="/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a>. They take gifts in thee to shed blood; interest and usury thou takest, and overreachest thy neighbours with violence, and thou forgettest me, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - By the repetition of the refrain, to shed blood (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-9.htm">Ezekiel 22:9</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/22-12.htm">Ezekiel 22:12</a>), the enumeration is divided into three groups of sins, which are placed in the category of blood-guiltiness by the fact that they are preceded by this sentence and the repetition of it after the form of a refrain. the first group (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6-8</a>) embraces sins which are committed in daring opposition to all the laws of morality. By the princes of Israel we are to understand primarily the profligate kings, who caused innocent persons to be put to death, such, for example, as Jehoiakim (<a href="/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>), Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>), and others. The words &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  are rendered by Hitzig and Kliefoth, they were ready to help one another; and in support of the rendering they appeal to <a href="/psalms/83-9.htm">Psalm 83:9</a>. But in that case &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493; would stand for &#1500;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; rof dnat, or rather for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506; &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, - a substitution which cannot be sustained. Nor can they be taken in the sense proposed by Hvernick, every one relying upon his arm, i.e., looking to physical force alone, but simply every one according to his arm, i.e., according to his strength or violence, are they in thee. In this case &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; does not require anything to be supplied, any more than in the similar combination in <a href="/ezekiel/22-9.htm">Ezekiel 22:9</a>. Followed by &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; with an infinitive, it means to be there with the intention of doing anything, or making an attempt, i.e., to direct his efforts to a certain end. In <a href="/ezekiel/22-7.htm">Ezekiel 22:7</a> it is not the princes who are the subject, but the ungodly in general. &#1492;&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is the opposite of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491; (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). In the reproofs which follow, compare <a href="/exodus/22-20.htm">Exodus 22:20</a>.; <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14</a>. With insolence and violence toward men there is associated contempt of all that is holy. For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-8.htm">Ezekiel 22:8</a>, see <a href="/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13</a>. - In the second group, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-9.htm">Ezekiel 22:9-11</a>, in addition to slander and idolatry, the crimes of lewdness and incest are the principal sins for which the people are reproved; and here the allusion to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a> and 19 is very obvious. The reproof of slander also points back to the prohibition in <a href="/leviticus/19-16.htm">Leviticus 19:16</a>. Slander to shed blood, refers to malicious charges and false testimony in a court of justice (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10-11</a>). For eating upon the mountains, see <a href="/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>. The practice of zimma&#770;h is more specifically described in <a href="/ezekiel/22-10.htm">Ezekiel 22:10</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a>. For the thing itself, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-7.htm">Leviticus 18:7-8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a> and <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9</a>. The threefold &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a> does not mean every one, but one, another, and the third, as the correlative &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; shows. - The third group, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-12.htm">Ezekiel 22:12</a>, is composed of sins of covetousness. For the first clause, compare the prohibition in <a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>; for the second, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/18-13.htm">Ezekiel 18:13</a>. The reproof finishes with forgetfulness of God, which is closely allied to covetousness.</body></html>
