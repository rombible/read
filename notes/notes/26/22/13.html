The sword is already drawn against them. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;, taken out of the scabbard, as in <a href="/psalms/37-14.htm">Psalm 37:14</a>. &#1500;&#1496;&#1489;&#1495; is to be connected with &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;, notwithstanding the accents, and &#1500;&#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; &#1500;&#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; with &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1492;. This is required by the correspondence of the clauses. &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; is regarded as a derivative of &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; by Ewald and others, in the sense of ad sustinendum, according to capacity, i.e., as much as possible. But the adverbial rendering it opposed to the context, and cannot be sustained from <a href="/ezekiel/23-32.htm">Ezekiel 23:32</a>. Moreover, &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, to contain, is applicable enough to goblets and other vessels, but not to a sword. Hitzig therefore explains it from the Arabic kll, to blunt (sc., the eyes), i.e., to blind. But this is open to the objection that the form &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; points to the verb &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; rather than &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;; and also to a still greater one, - namely, that there is nothing in the Hebrew usage to suggest the use of &#1499;&#1500;&#1500; in such a sense as this, and even if it were used in the sense of blunting, it would be perfectly arbitrary to supply &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; and lastly, that even the flashing of the sword does not suggest the idea of blinding, but is intended to heighten the terror occasioned by the sharpness of the sword. We therefore adhere to the derivation of &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; from &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, and regard it as a defective form for &#1492;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-14.htm">2 Samuel 19:14</a>, &#1497;&#1492;&#1500; as syncopated form for &#1497;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500; (<a href="/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>), and watochez &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494; for &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494; in <a href="/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a>; literally, to cause it to eat or devour, i.e., to make it fit for the work of devouring. &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; , literally, for the sake of the lightning (flash) that shall issue therefrom (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/21-10.htm">Ezekiel 21:10</a>). - In <a href="/ezekiel/21-29.htm">Ezekiel 21:29</a> (34), &#1500;&#1514;&#1514; (to lay, or place) is also dependent upon &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;, drawn to lay thee; so that the first half of the verse is inserted as a parenthesis, either to indicate the occasion for bringing the sword into the land (Hitzig), or to introduce an attendant circumstance, according to the sense in which the &#1489; in &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1514; is taken. The parenthetical clause is understood by most of the commentators as referring to deceptive oracles of Ammonitish soothsayers, which either determined the policy of Ammon, as Hitzig supposes (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-9.htm">Jeremiah 27:9-10</a>), or inspired the Ammonites with confidence, that they had nothing to fear from the Chaldeans. Kliefoth, on the other hand, refers the words to the oracles consulted by Nebuchadnezzar, according to <a href="/ezekiel/21-23.htm">Ezekiel 21:23</a>. "These oracles, which directed the king not to march against the Ammonites, but against Jerusalem, proved themselves, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-29.htm">Ezekiel 21:29</a>, to be deceptive prophesying to the Ammonites, inasmuch as they also afterwards fell by the sword; just as, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-23.htm">Ezekiel 21:23</a>, they proved themselves to be genuine so far as the Israelites were concerned, inasmuch as they were really the first to be smitten." This view is a very plausible one, if it only answered in any degree to the words. But it is hard to believe that the words, "while it (one) prophesies falsehood to thee," are meant to be equivalent to "while its prophecy proves itself to be false to thee." Moreover, Nebuchadnezzar did not give the Ammonites any oracle, either false or true, by the circumstance that his divination at the cross-road led him to decide in favour of the march to Jerusalem; for all that he did in consequence was to postpone his designs upon the Ammonites, but not to relinquish them. We cannot understand the words in any other sense, therefore, than as relating to oracles, which the Ammonites received from soothsayers of their own.<p>Hitzig takes offence at the expression, "that it (the sword) may lay thee by (to) the necks of the sinners slain," because colla cannot stand for corpora decollata, and consequently proposes to alter &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; into &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, to put it (the sword) to the necks. But by this conjecture he gets the not less striking thought, that the sword was to be put to the necks of those already slain; a thing which would be perfectly unmeaning, and is therefore not generally done. The sinners slain are the Judaeans who have fallen. The words point back to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-25.htm">Ezekiel 21:25</a>, the second half of which is repeated here, and predict the same fate to the Ammonites. It is easy to supply &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; to &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468;: put the sword into its scabbard again. These words can only be addressed to the Ammonites; not to the Chaldeans, as Kliefoth imagines, for the latter does not harmonize in any way with what follows, viz., in the place of thy birth will I judge thee. God does not execute the judgment independently of the Chaldeans, but through the medium of their sword. The difficulties occasioned by taking the words as referring to the Ammonites are not so great as to necessitate an alteration of the text (Hitzig), or to call for the arbitrary explanation: put it now or for the present into the scabbard (Kliefoth). The use of the masculine &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; (with Patach for &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, as in <a href="/isaiah/42-22.htm">Isaiah 42:22</a>), if Ammon is addressed by the side of the feminine &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498;, may be explained in a very simple way, from the fact that the sword is carried by men, so that here the thought of the people, the warriors, is predominant, and the representation of the kingdom of the Ammonites as a woman falls into the background. The objection that the suffix in &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468; can only refer to the sword (of the Chaldean) mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-28.htm">Ezekiel 21:28</a>, is more plausible than conclusive. For inasmuch as the scabbard presupposes a sword, and every sword has a scabbard, the suffix may be fully accounted for from the thing itself, as the words, "put the sword into its scabbard," would lead any hearer to think at once of the sword of the person addressed, without considering whether that particular sword had been mentioned before or not. The meaning of the words is this: every attempt to defend thyself with the sword and avert destruction will be in vain. In thine own land will God judge thee. For &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>. This judgment is still further explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-31.htm">Ezekiel 21:31</a>, where the figure of the sword is dropped, and that of the fire of the wrath of God introduced in its place. &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495;...&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, we render: "the fire of my wrath I blow (kindle) against thee," after <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/54-16.htm">Isaiah 54:16</a>, and not "with the fire...do I blow, or snort, against thee," as others have done; because blowing with the fire is an unnatural figure, and the interpretation of the words in accordance with Isa. l.c. is all the more natural, that in the closing words of the verse, &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;, the allusion to that passage is indisputable, and it is only from this that the combination of the two words can be accounted for. - Different explanations have been given of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. Some render it ardentes, and in accordance with <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a> : burning with wrath. But &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; is never used in this sense. Nor can the rendering "scorching men" (Kliefoth) be sustained, for &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, to burn, only occurs in connection with things which are combustible, e.g., fire, pitch, coals, etc. The word must be explained from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/92-7.htm">Psalm 92:7</a>, "brutish," foolish, always bearing in mind that the Hebrew associated the idea of godlessness with folly, and that cruelty naturally follows in its train. - <a href="/ezekiel/21-32.htm">Ezekiel 21:32</a>. Thus will Ammon perish through fire and sword, and even the memory of it be obliterated. For <a href="/ezekiel/21-32.htm">Ezekiel 21:32</a> compare <a href="/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a>. The words, "thy blood will be &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; in the midst of the land," can hardly be understood in any other sense than "thy blood will flow over all the land." For the rendering proposed by Ewald, "remain in the midst of the earth, without thy being mentioned," like that given by Kliefoth, "thy blood will the earth drink," does not harmonize with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-7.htm">Ezekiel 24:7</a>, where &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1492;&#1468; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is affirmed of blood, which cannot penetrate into the earth, or be covered with dust. For &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;, see <a href="/ezekiel/25-10.htm">Ezekiel 25:10</a>. Ammon as the enemy of the kingdom of God will utterly perish, leaving no trace behind, and without any such hope of restoration as that held out in <a href="/ezekiel/21-27.htm">Ezekiel 21:27</a> to the kingdom of Judah or the people of Israel. </body></html>
