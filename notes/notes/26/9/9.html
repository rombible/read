He says, Of all that thou hast given me, I have lost none. If others perish, and we are saved, we must ascribe the difference wholly to the mercy of our God, for we too have deserved wrath. Let us still continue to plead in behalf of others.

In order to satisfy the prophet, and make him easy, and show the equity and justice of the divine proceedings: <p>the iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great; it cannot be well conceived or expressed how great it is; it abounded and superabounded: this is the answer in general, but in particular it follows: <p>and the land is full of blood; of murders, as the Targum interprets it; of shedding of innocent blood; and even of all atrocious and capital crimes: <p>and the city full of perverseness; or of perversion of judgment, as the Targum; the city of Jerusalem, where was the highest court of judicature, where the sanhedrim of seventy one sat to do justice and judgment, have nothing but perversion and injustice: <p>for they say, the Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not; does not concern himself with human affairs, and takes no notice of what is done below; and, having imbibed such atheistical principles, were hardened in sin, and gave themselves over to all iniquity; having no restraints upon them from the consideration of the providence of God, and his government of the world: or else the sense is, that the Lord had withheld his mercy and favours from them; and therefore they showed no regard to him, and looked upon all their evils and calamities as fortuitous events, and not as ordered by him as punishments for their sins. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said he to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah <i>is</i> exceeding great, and the land is full of <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.</span><p>(k) That is, with all kinds of wickedness.

The Divine answer is inexorable. Two evils are stated, and the deeper cause of them: violence unto bloodshed, and the perversion of justice, the cause of both being the feeling that Jehovah had forsaken the land. The language shews the strange length to which the hard fate of Israel had brought men—Jehovah had abandoned his land. Possibly these persons concluded that he had retired, being overcome by deities stronger than himself; even the godly were driven to conclude that he had ceased to interest himself in his people (<a href="/isaiah/40-27.htm" title="Why say you, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?">Isaiah 40:27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-14.htm" title="But Zion said, The LORD has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me.">Isaiah 49:14</a>). And with the departure of Jehovah, the righteous God, all moral restraints were relaxed. The persons who here speak had probably been obstinate opponents of the prophets, but the passage shews that the prophetic preaching of Jehovah’s righteousness, even when to appearance unheeded, had lodged itself in the consciences of men.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said he unto me.</span> The answer holds out but little comfort. <span class="cmt_word">The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah</span> (we note the coupling of the names though Judah only was the immediate subject of the vision, as if his prayer had gone up for the whole body of the twelve tribes) was immeasurably great. Not idolatry only, but its natural fruits, bloodshed and oppression, had eaten into the life of the nation (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/7-11.htm">Ezekiel 7:11, 12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-25.htm">Ezekiel 22:25</a>). And these evils had their root in the practical atheism of the denials which had been already uttered in <a href="/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>. and which are here reproduced. The unpitying aspect of God's judgments is, for the present, dominant, and the work must be thorough. One notes how the despair of the prophet leads him to forget those who were to have the mark upon their foreheads, who were indeed the true "remnant." Like Elijah, he does not know of any such (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>); like Jeremiah, he searches through the streets of Jerusalem, and cannot find one righteous man (<a href="/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Third Abomination: Worship of Thammuz<p><a href="/ezekiel/8-13.htm">Ezekiel 8:13</a>. And He said to me, Thou shalt yet again see still greater abominations which they do. <a href="/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>. And He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah, which is towards the north, and behold there sat the women, weeping for Thammuz. <a href="/ezekiel/8-15.htm">Ezekiel 8:15</a>. And He said to me, Dost thou see it, O son of man? Thou shalt yet again see still greater abominations than these. - The prophet is taken from the entrance into the court to the entrance of the gate of the temple, to see the women sitting there weeping for Thammuz. The article in &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is used generically. Whilst the men of the nation, represented by the seventy elders, were secretly carrying on their idolatrous worship, the women were sitting at the temple gate, and indulging in public lamentation for Thammuz. Under the weeping for Thammuz, Jerome (with Melito of Sardis and all the Greek Fathers) has correctly recognised the worship of Adonis. "&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, &#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b6; or &#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;," says Jerome, "whom we have interpreted as Adonis, is called Thamuz both in Hebrew and Syriac; and because, according to the heathen legend, this lover of Venus and most beautiful youth is said to have been slain in the month of June and then restored to life again, they call this month of June by the same name, and keep an annual festival in his honour, at which he is lamented by women as though he were dead, and then afterwards celebrated in songs as having come to life again." This view has not been shaken even by the objections raised by Chwolson in his Ssaabins (II. 27. 202ff.), his relics of early Babylonian literature (p. 101), and his Tammuz and human-worship among the ancient Babylonians. For the myth of Thammuz, mentioned in the Nabataean writings as a man who was put to death by the king of Babylon, whom he had commanded to introduce the worship of the seven planets and the twelve signs of the zodiac, and who was exalted to a god after his death, and honoured with a mourning festival, is nothing more than a refined interpretation of the very ancient nature-worship which spread over the whole of Hither Asia, and in which the power of the sun over the vegetation of the year was celebrated. The etymology of the word Tammuz is doubtful. It is probably a contraction of &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, from &#1502;&#1494;&#1494;  equals  &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, so that it denotes the decay of the force of nature, and corresponds to the Greek &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  &#787;&#x391;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (see Hvernick in loc.). </body></html>
