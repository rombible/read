Now it is a city of the dead, and he is left standing alone in the midst of the dead. He falls upon his face in consternation, and pleads that “the residue of Israel” may not be utterly destroyed. The sternness of the Divine answer leaves no room for hope of any mitigation of the judgment. No mention is made here of those who were to be saved; they were so few among the mass as to have no effect upon the general impression of the vision. Yet they are not forgotten; and to show that they are not, the man in linen is represented in the next verse (11) as reporting that he had executed the command given him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/9-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell on my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your fury on Jerusalem?">Ezekiel 9:8</a>. </span><span class="ital">And while they were slaying, and I was left — </span>Having, as it is to be supposed, the mark of preservation set upon his forehead by the protecting angel.

He says, Of all that thou hast given me, I have lost none. If others perish, and we are saved, we must ascribe the difference wholly to the mercy of our God, for we too have deserved wrath.

Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?">Isaiah 49:21</a>. The anomalous form is to be read impf.). The terrible outbreak of the Divine wrath seemed to forebode the extinction of all the remnant of Israel, and the prophet fell on his face, appealing to the Lord on their behalf. The “residue” suggests the many calamities that had already befallen the people, wearing them down to only a few men (<a href="/isaiah/41-14.htm" title="Fear not, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will help you, said the LORD, and your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 41:14</a>, comp. the prophet’s own figure of the half-burnt brand, ch. 15), and the threat of a fire going out upon all the house of Israel seemed about to be realized (ch. <a href="/ezekiel/5-4.htm" title="Then take of them again, and cast them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 5:4</a>). The prophet passes from one state of feeling to another. Sometimes he is in sympathy with the divine resentment, and is himself full of fury against the sinful people (ch. <a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm" title="So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong on me.">Ezekiel 3:14</a>), and of a scorn that rejoices at their coming chastisements (ch. <a href="/ezekiel/6-11.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Smite with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.">Ezekiel 6:11</a>), but when the judgments of God are abroad before his eyes he is appalled at their severity, and his pity for men overcomes his religious zeal (ch. <a href="/ezekiel/11-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died.

His human, national sympathies led him, as they led Moses (<a href="/numbers/11-2.htm">Numbers 11:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-19.htm">Numbers 14:19</a>) and St. Paul (<a href="/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1-3</a>) to undertake the work of intercession.

And He said to me, Thou shalt yet again see still greater abominations which they do. <a href="/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>. And He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah, which is towards the north, and behold there sat the women, weeping for Thammuz. <a href="/ezekiel/8-15.htm">Ezekiel 8:15</a>. And He said to me, Dost thou see it, O son of man? Thou shalt yet again see still greater abominations than these. - The prophet is taken from the entrance into the court to the entrance of the gate of the temple, to see the women sitting there weeping for Thammuz. The article in &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is used generically. Whilst the men of the nation, represented by the seventy elders, were secretly carrying on their idolatrous worship, the women were sitting at the temple gate, and indulging in public lamentation for Thammuz. Under the weeping for Thammuz, Jerome (with Melito of Sardis and all the Greek Fathers) has correctly recognised the worship of Adonis. "&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, &#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b6; or &#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;," says Jerome, "whom we have interpreted as Adonis, is called Thamuz both in Hebrew and Syriac; and because, according to the heathen legend, this lover of Venus and most beautiful youth is said to have been slain in the month of June and then restored to life again, they call this month of June by the same name, and keep an annual festival in his honour, at which he is lamented by women as though he were dead, and then afterwards celebrated in songs as having come to life again." This view has not been shaken even by the objections raised by Chwolson in his Ssaabins (II. 27. 202ff.), his relics of early Babylonian literature (p. 101), and his Tammuz and human-worship among the ancient Babylonians. For the myth of Thammuz, mentioned in the Nabataean writings as a man who was put to death by the king of Babylon, whom he had commanded to introduce the worship of the seven planets and the twelve signs of the zodiac, and who was exalted to a god after his death, and honoured with a mourning festival, is nothing more than a refined interpretation of the very ancient nature-worship which spread over the whole of Hither Asia, and in which the power of the sun over the vegetation of the year was celebrated. The etymology of the word Tammuz is doubtful. It is probably a contraction of &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, from &#1502;&#1494;&#1494;  equals  &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, so that it denotes the decay of the force of nature, and corresponds to the Greek &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  &#787;&#x391;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (see Hvernick in loc.). </body></html>
