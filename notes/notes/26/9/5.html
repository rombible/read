The sense is, I will so order it by my providence, that none whom I have designed for preservation shall be destroyed. This prediction was remarkably fulfilled. Nebuchadnezzar gave particular orders that Jeremiah should be protected, Baruch and Ebed- melech were secured, and it is likely others of Jeremiah’s friends for his sake; God had promised that it should go <span class="ital">well with his remnant, </span>and that they should be well treated, <a href="/jeremiah/15-11.htm" title="The LORD said, Truly it shall be well with your remnant; truly I will cause the enemy to entreat you well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.">Jeremiah 15:11</a>; and we have reason to think that none of the mourning, praying remnant fell by the sword of the Chaldeans, but God found out some way or other to secure them all; as in the last destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, the Christians were all secured in a city on the mountains, called <span class="ital">Pella, </span>and none of them perished with the unbelieving Jews. <span class="ital">Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house — </span>Namely, those who committed idolatry in the several courts and apartments belonging to the temple; that is, they strictly observed the orders given them, and began at God’s sanctuary, as they were commanded. <span class="ital">And he said, Defile the house, and fill the courts with slain — </span>God, abhorring the temple, as having been polluted with idolatry, here not only declares that he will no longer own it for his place of residence, but delivers up both the inner and outward courts belonging to it to be polluted with blood and slaughter. Let us observe well, that if the servants of God’s house defile it with their sins, God will justly suffer its enemies to defile it with their acts of violence. If the ministers and members of God’s church pollute it with their errors and impieties, God will take away its wall of defence, and expose it to the ravages of persecutors. <span class="ital">And they went forth and slew in the city — </span>So it was represented to the prophet in his vision, which was still continued, as a prediction of what should shortly be done in reality. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:5-11 The slaughter must begin at the sanctuary, that all may see and know that the Lord hates sin most in those nearest to him.

He says, Of all that thou hast given me, I have lost none. If others perish, and we are saved, we must ascribe the difference wholly to the mercy of our God, for we too have deserved wrath.

So in the case of Sodom <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, and in the last day <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/21-18.htm">Luke 21:18</a>, <a href="/luke/21-28.htm">Luke 21:28</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>. This accords with the eschatological character of the predictions in this chapter (see the introduction of Ezekiel).<p>A mark - literally, "Tau," the name of the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The old form of the letter was that of a cross. The Jews have interpreted this sign variously, some considering that "Tau," being the last of the Hebrew letters, and so closing the alphabet, denoted completeness, and thus the mark indicated the completeness of the sorrow for sin in those upon whom it was placed. Others again observed that "Tau" was the first letter of Torah ("the Law") and that the foreheads were marked as of men obedient to the Law. Christians, noting the resemblance of this letter in its most ancient form to a cross, have seen herein a reference to the cross with which Christians were signed. The custom for pagan gods and their votaries to bear certain marks furnishes instances, in which God was pleased to employ symbolism, generally in use, to express higher and more divine truth. The sign of the cross in baptism is an outward sign of the designation of God's elect, who at the last day shall be exempted from the destruction of the ungodly <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>, <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. the others&#8212;the six officers of judgment (Eze 9:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The others; </span> the six slaughtermen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He said; </span> the God of glory, or Christ, who appeared in great glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In my hearing; </span> a note of certainty of the thing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Go ye after him; </span> linger not ere you set forward against the wicked, yet still go after, that you destroy none that are to be sealed; so also <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/7-3.htm" title="Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.">Revelation 7:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Through the city; </span> this order must be observed through the whole city, and through the whole execution.

And He brought me to the entrance of the court, and I saw, and behold there was a hole in the wall. <a href="/ezekiel/8-8.htm">Ezekiel 8:8</a>. And He said to me, Son of man, break through the wall: and I broke through the wall, and behold there was a door. <a href="/ezekiel/8-9.htm">Ezekiel 8:9</a>. And He said to me, Come and see the wicked abominations which they are doing here. <a href="/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10</a>. And I came and saw, and behold there were all kinds of figures of reptiles, and beasts, abominations, and all kinds of idols of the house of Israel, drawn on the wall round about. <a href="/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Ezekiel 8:11</a>. And seventy men of the leaders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, stood in front, every man with his censer in his hand; and the smell of a cloud of incense arose. <a href="/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>. And He said to me, Seest thou, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every one in his image-chambers? For they say: Jehovah doth not see us; Jehovah hath forsaken the land. - The entrance of the court to which Ezekiel was now transported cannot be the principal entrance to the outer court towards the east (Ewald). This would be at variance with the context, as we not only find the prophet at the northern entrance in <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5</a>, but at <a href="/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a> we find him there still. If he had been taken to the eastern gate in the meantime, this would certainly have been mentioned. As that is not the case, the reference must be to that entrance to the court which lay between the entrance-gate of the inner court (<a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>) and the northern entrance-gate to the house of Jehovah (<a href="/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>), or northern gate of the outer court, in other words, the northern entrance into the outer court. Thus the prophet was conducted out of the inner court through its northern gate into the outer court, and placed in front of the northern gate, which led out into the open air. There he saw a hole in the wall, and on breaking through the wall, by the command of God, he saw a door, and having entered it, he saw all kinds of figures of animals engraved on the wall round about, in front of which seventy of the elders of Israel were standing and paying reverence to the images of beasts with burning incense. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>, the prophet was thereby shown what the elders of Israel did in the dark, every one in his image-chamber. From this explanation on the part of God concerning the picture shown to the prophet, it is very evident that it had no reference to any idolatrous worship practised by the elders in one or more of the cells of the outer court of the temple. For even though the objection raised by Kliefoth to this view, namely, that it cannot be proved that there were halls with recesses in the outer court, is neither valid nor correct, since the existence of such halls is placed beyond the reach of doubt by <a href="/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>, and <a href="/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a>; such a supposition is decidedly precluded by the fact, that the cells and recesses at the gates cannot have been large enough to allow of seventy-one men taking part in a festive idolatrous service. The supposition that the seventy-one men were distributed in different chambers is at variance with the distinct words of the text. The prophet not only sees the seventy elders standing along with Jaazaniah, but he could not look through one door into a number of chambers at once, and see the pictures draw all round upon their walls. The assembling of the seventy elders in a secret cell by the northern gate of the outer temple to worship the idolatrous images engraved on the walls of the cell, is one feature in the visionary form given to the revelation of what the elders of the people were doing secretly throughout the whole land. To bring out more strikingly the secrecy of this idolatrous worship, the cell is so completely hidden in the wall, that the prophet is obliged to enlarge the hole by breaking through the wall before he can see the door which leads to the cell and gain a view of them and of the things it contains, and the things that are done therein.<p>(Note: "Because the whole is exhibited pictorially and figuratively, he says that he saw one hole in a wall, and was directed to dig through and make it larger, that he might enter as if through an open door, and see the things which he could not possibly have seen while stationed outside." - Jerome.)<p>And the number of the persons assembled there suggests the idea of a symbolical representation, as well as the secrecy of the cell. The seventy elders represent the whole nation; and the number is taken from <a href="/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>. and <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-25.htm">Numbers 24:25</a>, where Moses, by the command of God, chooses seventy of the elders to represent the whole congregation at the making of the covenant, and afterwards to support his authority. This representation of the congregation was not a permanent institution, as we may see from the fact that in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a> seventy other men are said to have been chosen for the purpose named. The high council, consisting of seventy members, the so-called Sanhedrim, was formed after the captivity on the basis of these Mosaic types. In the midst of the seventy was Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, a different man therefore from the Jaazaniah mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>. Shaphan is probably the person mentioned as a man of distinction in <a href="/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>.; <a href="/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>. It is impossible to decide on what ground Jaazaniah is specially mentioned by name; but it can hardly be on account of the meaning of the name he bore, "Jehovah heard," as Hvernick supposes. It is probable that he held a prominent position among the elders of the nation, so that he is mentioned here by name as the leader of this national representation.<p>On the wall of the chamber round about there were drawn all kinds of figures of &#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, reptiles and quadrupeds (see <a href="/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24</a>). &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1509; is in apposition not only to &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, but also to &#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;, and therefore, as belonging to both, is not to be connected with &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; in the construct state. The drawing of reptiles and quadrupeds became a sheqetz, or abomination, from the fact that the pictures had been drawn for the purpose of religious worship. The following clause, "and all the idols of the house of Israel," is co-ordinate with '&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. Besides the animals drawn on the walls, there were idols of other kinds in the chamber. The drawing of reptiles and quadrupeds naturally suggests the thought of the animal-worship of Egypt. We must not limit the words to this, however, since the worship of animals is met with in the nature-worship of other heathen nations, and the expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, "all kinds of figures," as well as the clause, "all kinds of idols of the house of Israel," points to every possible form of idol-worship as spread abroad in Israel. &#1506;&#1514;&#1512;, according to the Aramaean usage, signifies suffimentum, perfume, &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, in the dark, i.e., in secret, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512; in <a href="/2_samuel/12-12.htm">2 Samuel 12:12</a>; not in the sacred darkness of the cloud of incense (Hvernick). &#1495;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497; &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, image-chambers, is the term applied to the rooms or closets in the dwelling-houses of the people in which idolatrous images were set up and secretly worshipped. &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; signifies idolatrous figures, as in <a href="/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a> and <a href="/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>. This idolatry was justified by the elders, under the delusion that "Jehovah seeth us not;" that is to say, not: "He does not trouble Himself about us," but He does not see what we do, because He is not omniscient (cf. <a href="/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>); and He has forsaken the land, withdrawn His presence and His help. Thus they deny both the omniscience and omnipresence of God (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>). </body></html>
