What is the matter of God’s promises, must be the matter of our prayers. By asking for the mercy promised, we give glory to the donor, express our value of the gift, our own dependance upon God, and put honour upon prayer, upon which he has put honour. Christ himself must ask, and then God will <span class="ital">give him the heathen for his inheritance; </span>must <span class="ital">pray the Father, </span>and then <span class="ital">he will send the Comforter; </span>much more must we ask that we may receive. 2d, They must consult the oracles of God, for thus also God is sought unto and inquired after: the mercy must not be an act of providence only, but a child of promise; and therefore the promise must be looked at, and prayer made for it, with an eye of faith fixed upon it, which must be both the guide and the ground of our expectations. In both these ways we find Daniel inquiring of God, in the name of the house of Israel: then when God was about to do these great things for them, he consulted the oracles of God, for he <span class="ital">understood by books, </span>namely, the book of the Prophet Jeremiah, both what was to be expected, and when; and then he <span class="ital">set his face </span>to seek God <span class="ital">by prayer, </span><a href="/context/daniel/9-2.htm" title="In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem....">Daniel 9:2-3</a>. <span class="ital">As the holy flock, </span>&c. — Flocks designed for holy uses, as sacrifices, and therefore further described by the place where they were presented, namely, <span class="ital">Jerusalem; in her solemn feasts — </span>The three great annual feasts.

And the increase of the numbers of a people is then honourable, when they are all dedicated to God as a holy flock, to be presented to him as living sacrifices. Crowds are a lovely sight in God’s temple. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>36:25-38 Water is an emblem of the cleansing our polluted souls from sin. But no water can do more than take away the filth of the flesh. Water seems in general the sacramental sign of the sanctifying influences of the Holy Ghost; yet this is always connected with the atoning blood of Christ. When the latter is applied by faith to the conscience, to cleanse it from evil works, the former is always applied to the powers of the soul, to purify it from the pollution of sin. All that have an interest in the new covenant, have a new heart and a new spirit, in order to their walking in newness of life. God would give a heart of flesh, a soft and tender heart, complying with his holy will. Renewing grace works as great a change in the soul, as the turning a dead stone into living flesh. God will put his Spirit within, as a Teacher, Guide, and Sanctifier. The promise of God's grace to fit us for our duty, should quicken our constant care and endeavour to do our duty. These are promises to be pleaded by, and will be fulfilled to, all true believers in every age.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their sin had prevented God's hearing them.

I will yet for this be inquired of&#8212;so as to grant it. On former occasions He had refused to be inquired of by Israel because the inquirers were not in a fit condition of mind to receive a blessing (Eze 14:3; 20:3). But hereafter, as in the restoration from Babylon (Ne 8:1-9:38; Da 9:3-20, 21, 23), God will prepare His people's hearts (Eze 36:26) to pray aright for the blessings which He is about to give (Ps 102:13-17, 20; Zec 12:10-14; 13:1).<p>like a flock&#8212;resuming the image (Eze 34:23, 31).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Though I have repeated so often my promise to return them, to rebuild, to multiply them, yet they shall know it is their duty to entreat it, to wait on me, and then I will give a merciful answer and do it.

Or else it may be thus; Above all this, or yet more than all this, I will be found of them when they do seek me: thus it is a promise made to their prayer, in the other it is a requiring them to pray, so they shall increase as a flock. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel,....

The Syriac version is, "even for this I seek Israel"; and so the Arabic version; as if the sense was, that the Lord will seek the people of Israel wherever they are, and find them out, and call them by his grace, and gather them out of all countries, and bring them into their own land: "to do it for them"; everything before promised, and what next follows: <p>I will increase them with men like a flock; as a flock of sheep is increased, which is a very increasing creature: or, "as a flock of men" (p); it signifies that the people of the Jews will be very numerous at their conversion; see <a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>. <p>(p)  "sicut gregem hominum", V.

The scanty population of Jerusalem is referred to by Nehemiah nearly a century after the first exiles returned (<a href="/ezekiel/7-4.htm" title="And my eye shall not spare you, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense your ways on you, and your abominations shall be in the middle of you: and you shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 7:4</a>).
