"The law [of retribution] is demanded by the absolute righteousness of God. The judicial visitations of God cannot possibly be one-sided. Punishment can so much the less strike Israel alone, as precisely in its punishment the deep degradation of heathendom, its apostasy from God and its pride, has set itself forth in the most striking way" (Havernick).

For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I myself, I will inquire after my flock, and take charge thereof. <a href="/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a>. As a shepherd taketh charge of his flock in the day when he is in the midst of his scattered sheep, so will I take charge of my flock, and deliver them out of all the places whither they have been scattered in the day of cloud and cloudy night. <a href="/ezekiel/34-13.htm">Ezekiel 34:13</a>. And I will bring them out from the nations, and gather them together out of the lands, and bring them into their land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel, in the valleys, and in all the dwelling-places of the land. <a href="/ezekiel/34-14.htm">Ezekiel 34:14</a>. I will feed them in a good pasture, and on the high mountains of Israel will their pasture-ground be: there shall they lie down in a good pasture-ground, and have fat pasture on the mountains of Israel. <a href="/ezekiel/34-15.htm">Ezekiel 34:15</a>.

And you, my sheep, thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will judge between sheep and sheep, and the rams and the he-goats. <a href="/ezekiel/34-18.htm">Ezekiel 34:18</a>. Is it too little for you, that ye eat up the good pasture, and what remains of your pasture ye tread down with your feet? and the clear water ye drink, and render muddy what remains with your feet? <a href="/ezekiel/34-19.htm">Ezekiel 34:19</a>. And are my sheep to have for food that which is trodden down by your feet, and to drink that which is made muddy by your feet? <a href="/ezekiel/34-20.htm">Ezekiel 34:20</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah to them, Behold, I, I will judge between fat sheep and lean. <a href="/ezekiel/34-21.htm">Ezekiel 34:21</a>.

I will help my sheep, so that they shall no more become a prey; and will judge between sheep and sheep. - All that the Lord will do for His flock is summed up in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11</a>, in the words &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, which stand in obvious antithesis to '&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; in <a href="/ezekiel/34-6.htm">Ezekiel 34:6</a> - an antithesis sharply accentuated by the emphatic &#1492;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, which stands at the head in an absolute form. The fuller explanation is given in the verses which follow, from <a href="/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a> onwards. Observe here that biqeer is substituted for &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;, to seek and examine minutely, involves the idea of taking affectionate charge. What the Lord does for His people is compared in <a href="/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a> to the care which a shepherd who deserves the name manifests towards sheep when they are scattered (&#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; without the article is connected with &#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493; in the form of apposition); and in <a href="/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a> it is still more particularly explained. In the first place, He will gather them from all the places to which they have been scattered. &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; implies that in their dispersion they have fallen into a state of oppression and bondage among the nations (cf. <a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>).  &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;  belongs to the relative clause: whither they have been scattered. The circumstance that these words are taken from <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a> does not compel us to take them in connection with the principal clause, as Hitzig and Kliefoth propose, and to understand them as relating to the time when God will hold His judgment of the heathen world. The notion that the words in Joel signify "God's day of judgment upon all the heathen" (Kliefoth), is quite erroneous; and even Hitzig does not derive this meaning from <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>, but from the combination of our verse with <a href="/ezekiel/30-3.htm">Ezekiel 30:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>. The deliverance of the sheep out of the places to which they have been scattered, consists in the gathering together of Israel out of the nations, and their restoration to their own land, and their feeding upon the mountains and all the dwelling-places of the land (&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, a place suitable for settlement), and that in good and fat pasture (<a href="/ezekiel/34-14.htm">Ezekiel 34:14</a>); and lastly, in the fact that Jehovah bestows the necessary care upon the sheep, strengthens and heals the weak and sick (<a href="/ezekiel/34-15.htm">Ezekiel 34:15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/34-16.htm">Ezekiel 34:16</a>) - that is to say, does just what the bad shepherds have omitted (<a href="/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>) - and destroys the fat and strong. In this last clause another side is shown of the pastoral fidelity of Jehovah. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; has been changed by the lxx, Syr., and Vulg. into  ,&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;; and Luther has followed them in his rendering, "I will watch over them." But this is evidently a mistake, as it fails to harmonize with &#1488;&#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;. The fat and strong sheep are characterized in <a href="/ezekiel/34-18.htm">Ezekiel 34:18</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/34-19.htm">Ezekiel 34:19</a> as those which spoil the food and water of the others. The allusion, therefore, is to the rich and strong ones of the nation, who oppress the humble and poor, and treat them with severity. The destruction of these oppressors shows that the loving care of the Lord is associated with righteousness - that He feeds the flock &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;.<p>This thought is carried out still further in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-17.htm">Ezekiel 34:17-21</a>, the sheep themselves being directly addressed, and the Lord assuring them that He will judge between sheep and sheep, and put an end to the oppressive conduct of the fat sheep and the strong. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;: between the one sheep and the other. &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is extended in the apposition, "the rams and he-goats," which must not be rendered, "with regard to the rams and he-goats," as it has been by Kliefoth. The thought is not that Jehovah will divide the rams and he-goats from the sheep, as some have explained it, from an inappropriate comparison with <a href="/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>; but the division is to be effected in such a manner that sheep will be separated from sheep, the fat sheep being placed on one side with the rams and he-goats, and kept apart from the lean (&#1512;&#1494;&#1492;, <a href="/ezekiel/34-20.htm">Ezekiel 34:20</a>) and the sickly sheep (&#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>). It is to the last-named sheep, rams, and he-goats that <a href="/matthew/25-18.htm">Matthew 25:18</a> and <a href="/matthew/25-19.htm">Matthew 25:19</a> are addressed. With regard to the charge brought against them, that they eat up the pasture and tread down the remainder with their feet, etc., Bochart has already correctly observed, that "if the words are not quite applicable to actual sheep, they are perfectly appropriate to the mystical sheep intended here, i.e., to the Israelites, among whom many of the rich, after enjoying an abundant harvest and vintage, grudged the poor their gleaning in either one or the other." &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1506;, a substantive formation, like &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1505;, literally, precipitation of the water, i.e., the water purified by precipitation; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1506;, to sink, is the opposite of &#1512;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;, to stir up or render muddy by treading with the feet (compare <a href="/ezekiel/32-14.htm">Ezekiel 32:14</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, <a href="/ezekiel/34-20.htm">Ezekiel 34:20</a>  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;. <a href="/ezekiel/34-22.htm">Ezekiel 34:22</a> brings to a close the description of the manner in which God will deliver His flock, and feed it with righteousness. &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; points back to &#1493;&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a>, and &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; to &#1488;&#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; in <a href="/ezekiel/34-16.htm">Ezekiel 34:16</a>. - To this there is appended in <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>. a new train of thought, describing how God will still further display to His people His pastoral fidelity. </body></html>
