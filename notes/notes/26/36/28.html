But no water can do more than take away the filth of the flesh. Water seems in general the sacramental sign of the sanctifying influences of the Holy Ghost; yet this is always connected with the atoning blood of Christ. When the latter is applied by faith to the conscience, to cleanse it from evil works, the former is always applied to the powers of the soul, to purify it from the pollution of sin. All that have an interest in the new covenant, have a new heart and a new spirit, in order to their walking in newness of life. God would give a heart of flesh, a soft and tender heart, complying with his holy will. Renewing grace works as great a change in the soul, as the turning a dead stone into living flesh. God will put his Spirit within, as a Teacher, Guide, and Sanctifier. The promise of God's grace to fit us for our duty, should quicken our constant care and endeavour to do our duty. These are promises to be pleaded by, and will be fulfilled to, all true believers in every age.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye shall be my people - (Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16-18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>. The writers of the New Testament appropriated these and similar phrases of the Old Testament to the Church of Christ. Between the restoration of the Jews (the first step) there are many steps toward the end - the spread of Christ's Church throughout the world, the conversion of the Gentiles, and the acknowledgment of the true God - which justify men in looking forward to a time when the Gospel shall be preached in all the world, and the earth become the kingdom of God in a fuller sense than it has ever yet been.

The promise attached to the fifth commandment—the first commandment with promise—belongs to the commandments given to Israel as a whole. The keeping of them was the condition of remaining in the land. When the people disregarded them they were driven out, and only when their former sins were forgiven could they be restored (<a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm" title="Speak you comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she has received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.">Isaiah 40:2</a>). It may be a question whether there be now any connexion between Israel and the land of Canaan. If there be, the condition of restoration to it is faith and obedience on the part of the people. A restoration of Jews still in unbelief to Canaan, even if it should occur, could have no meaning so far as the redemptive providence of God is concerned, and would not enter into any relation with the Old Testament scriptures.

As the Jews who returned from Babylon did not permanently dwell in the land, but were again ejected from it, the promise contained in these words must be viewed as having been conditional on the realization of the moral and spiritual purity above described. If, therefore, it be aroused that inasmuch as this promise must be fulfilled (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>), the Jews must yet be restored to Palestine, the reply is that their return can only take place when they have been converted to Christianity; so that the whole promise must be regarded as receiving its highest fulfillment in the experiences of the Church of Christ.

Because thou sayest, The two nations and the two lands they shall be mine, and we will take possession of it, when Jehovah was there; <a href="/ezekiel/35-11.htm">Ezekiel 35:11</a>. Therefore, as truly as I live, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to thy wrath and thine envy, as thou hast done because of thy hatred, and will make myself known among them, as I shall judge thee. <a href="/ezekiel/35-12.htm">Ezekiel 35:12</a>.

Ye have magnified against me with your mouth, and heaped up your sayings against me; I have heard it. <a href="/ezekiel/35-14.htm">Ezekiel 35:14</a>.

As thou hadst thy delight in the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was laid waste, so will I do to thee; thou shalt become a waste, Mount Seir and all Edom together; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.<p>The theme of this prophecy, viz., "Edom and its cities are to become a desert" (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-2.htm">Ezekiel 35:2-4</a>), is vindicated and earnestly elaborated in two strophes, commencing with '&#1497;&#1506;&#1503; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; (<a href="/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/35-10.htm">Ezekiel 35:10</a>), and closing, like the announcement of the theme itself (<a href="/ezekiel/35-4.htm">Ezekiel 35:4</a>), with '&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;  (&#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;) &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, by a distinct statement of the sins of Edom. - Already, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25</a>, Edom has been named among the hostile border nations which are threatened with destruction (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-12.htm">Ezekiel 35:12-14</a>). The earlier prophecy applied to the Edomites, according to their historical relation to the people of Israel and the kingdom of Judah. In the present word of God, on the contrary, Edom comes into consideration, on the ground of its hostile attitude towards the covenant people, as the representative of the world and of mankind in its hostility to the people and kingdom of God, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-6</a>. This is apparent from the fact that devastation is to be prepared for Edom, when the whole earth rejoices (<a href="/ezekiel/35-14.htm">Ezekiel 35:14</a>), which does not apply to Edom as a small and solitary nation, and still more clearly from the circumstance that, in the promise of salvation in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36.htm">Ezekiel 36</a>, not all Edom alone (<a href="/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>), but the remnant of the heathen nations generally (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3-7</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-15.htm">Ezekiel 36:15</a>), are mentioned as the enemies from whose disgrace and oppression Israel is to be delivered. For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-2.htm">Ezekiel 35:2</a>, compare <a href="/ezekiel/13-17.htm">Ezekiel 13:17</a>. &#1492;&#1512;  is the name given to the mountainous district inhabited by the Edomites, between the Dead Sea and the Elanitic Gulf (see the comm. on <a href="/genesis/36-9.htm">Genesis 36:9</a>). The prophecy is directed against the land; but it also applies to the nation, which brings upon itself the desolation of its land by its hostility to Israel. For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-3.htm">Ezekiel 35:3</a>, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a>, etc. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, destruction. The sin of Edom mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a> is eternal enmity toward Israel, which has also been imputed to the Philistines in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15</a>, but which struck deeper root, in the case of Edom, in the hostile attitude of Esau toward Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-22.htm">Genesis 25:22</a>. and <a href="/genesis/27-37.htm">Genesis 27:37</a>), and was manifested, as Amos (<a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>) has already said, in the constant retention of its malignity toward the covenant nation, so that Edom embraced every opportunity to effect its destruction, and according to the charge brought against it by Ezekiel, gave up the sons of Israel to the sword when the kingdom of Judah fell. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500; , lit., to pour upon ( - into) the hands of the sword, i.e., to deliver up to the power of the sword (cf. <a href="/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; recalls to mind &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1491;&#1501; in <a href="/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a>; but here it is more precisely defined by &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; , and limited to the time of the overthrow of the Israelites, when Jerusalem was taken and destroyed by the Chaldeans. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1511;&#1509;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/21-30.htm">Ezekiel 21:30</a>. On account of this display of its hostility, the Lord will make Edom blood (<a href="/ezekiel/35-6.htm">Ezekiel 35:6</a>). This expression is probably chosen for the play upon the words &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;. Edom shall become what its name suggests. Making it blood does not mean merely filling it with bloodshed, or reddening the soil with blood (Hitzig); but, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-38.htm">Ezekiel 16:38</a>, turning it as it were into blood, or causing it to vanish therein. Blood shall pursue thee, "as blood-guiltiness invariably pursues a murderer, cries for vengeance, and so delivers him up to punishment" (Hvernick). &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488; cannot be the particle employed in swearing, and dependent upon &#1495;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, since this particle introduces an affirmative declaration, which would be unsuitable here, inasmuch as &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; in this connection cannot possibly signify blood-relationship. &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488; means "if not," in which the conditional meaning of &#1488;&#1501; coincides with the causal, "if" being equivalent to "since." The unusual separation of the &#1500;&#1488; from the verb is occasioned by the fact that &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; is placed before the verb to avoid collision with &#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;. To hate blood is the same as to have a horror of bloodshed or murder. This threat is carried out still further in <a href="/ezekiel/35-7.htm">Ezekiel 35:7</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/35-8.htm">Ezekiel 35:8</a>. The land of Edom is to become a complete and perpetual devastation; its inhabitants are to be exterminated by war. The form &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; stands for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, and is not to be changed into &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;. Considering the frequency with which &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; occurs, the supposition that we have here a copyist's error is by no means a probable one, and still less probable is the perpetuation of such an error. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, as in <a href="/zechariah/7-14.htm">Zechariah 7:14</a>. For <a href="/ezekiel/35-8.htm">Ezekiel 35:8</a> compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-5.htm">Ezekiel 32:5-6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>. The Chetib &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492; is scriptio plena for &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;, the imperfect Kal of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; in the intransitive sense to be inhabited. The Keri &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, is a needless and unsuitable correction, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; does not mean restitui.<p>In the second strophe, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-10.htm">Ezekiel 35:10-15</a>, the additional reason assigned for the desolation of Edom is its longing for the possession of Israel and its land, of which it desired to take forcible possession, although it knew that they belonged to Jehovah, whereby the hatred of Edom toward Israel became contempt of Jehovah. The two peoples and the two lands are Israel and Judah with their lands, and therefore the whole of the holy people and land. &#1488;&#1514; is the sign of the accusative: as for the two peoples, they are mine. The suffix appended to &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; is neuter, and is to be taken as referring generally to what has gone before. &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is a circumstantial clause, through which the desire of Edom is placed in the right light, and characterized as an attack upon Jehovah Himself. Jehovah was there - namely, in the land of which Edom wished to take possession. Kliefoth's rendering, "and yet Jehovah is there," is opposed to Hebrew usage, by changing the preterite &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; into a present; and the objection which he offers to the only rendering that is grammatically admissible, viz., "when Jehovah was there," to the effect "that it attributes to Ezekiel the thought that the Holy Land had once been the land and dwelling-place of God, but was so no longer," calls in question the actual historical condition of things without the slightest reason. For Jehovah had really forsaken His dwelling-place in Canaan before the destruction of the temple, but without thereby renouncing His right to the land; since it was only for the sins of Israel that He had given up the temple, city, and land to be laid waste by the heathen. "But Edom had acted as if Israel existed among the nations without God, and Jehovah had departed from it for ever" (Hvernick); or rather as if Jehovah were a powerless and useless Deity, who had not been able to defend His people against the might of the heathen nations. The Lord will requite Edom for this, in a manner answering to its anger and envy, which had both sprung from hatred. &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1501;, "I will make myself known among them (the Israelites) when I judge thee;" i.e., by the fact that He punishes Edom for its sin, He will prove to Israel that He is a God who does not suffer His people and His possession to be attacked with impunity. From this shall Edom learn that He is Jehovah, the omniscient God, who has heard the revilings of His enemies (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-12.htm">Ezekiel 35:12</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/35-13.htm">Ezekiel 35:13</a>), and the almighty God, who rewards those who utter such proud sayings according to their deeds (<a href="/ezekiel/35-14.htm">Ezekiel 35:14</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/35-15.htm">Ezekiel 35:15</a>). &#1504;&#1488;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; has retained the Kametz on account of the guttural in the first tone, in contrast with &#1504;&#1488;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-18.htm">Nehemiah 9:18</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a> (cf.

The Chetib hmmhs is to be pronounced &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492;, and to be retained in spite of the Keri. The singular of the neuter gender is used with emphasis in a broken and emotional address, and is to be taken as referring ad sensum to the land. &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492;, to magnify or boast with the mouth, i.e., to utter proud sayings against God, in other words, actually to deride God (compare &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>, which has a kindred meaning). &#1492;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;, used here according to Aramean usage for &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;, to multiply, or heap up.

Through this antithesis &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is limited to the world, with the exception of Edom, i.e., to that portion of the human race which stood in a different relation to God and His people from that of Edom; in other words, which acknowledged the Lord as the true God. It follows from this, that Edom represents the world at enmity against God. In &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1498; (<a href="/ezekiel/35-15.htm">Ezekiel 35:15</a>) &#1499; is a particle of comparison; and the meaning of <a href="/ezekiel/35-15.htm">Ezekiel 35:15</a> is: as thou didst rejoice over the desolation of the inheritance of the house of Israel, so will I cause others to rejoice over thy desolation. In <a href="/ezekiel/35-15.htm">Ezekiel 35:15</a> we agree with the lxx, Vulgate, Syriac, and others, in taking &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; as the second person, not as the third. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; serves to strengthen &#1492;&#1512;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (compare <a href="/ezekiel/11-15.htm">Ezekiel 11:15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-10.htm">Ezekiel 36:10</a>). <p>The Restoration and Blessing of Israel<p><a href="/ezekiel/36-1.htm">Ezekiel 36:1</a>. And thou, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, Mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah: <a href="/ezekiel/36-2.htm">Ezekiel 36:2</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because the enemy saith concerning you, Aha! the everlasting heights have become ours for a possession: <a href="/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a>. Therefore prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because, even because they lay you waste, and pant for you round about, so that ye have become a possession to the remnant of the nations, and have come to the talk of the tongue and gossip of the people: <a href="/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a>. Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and hills, to the low places and valleys, and to the waste ruins and the forsaken cities, which have become a prey and derision to the remnant of the nations round about; <a href="/ezekiel/36-5.htm">Ezekiel 36:5</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Truly in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the remnant of the nations, and against Edom altogether, which have made my land a possession for themselves in all joy of heart, in contempt of soul, to empty it out for booty. <a href="/ezekiel/36-6.htm">Ezekiel 36:6</a>.

And I will multiply upon you man and beast; they shall multiply and be fruitful: and I will make you inhabited as in your former time, and do more good to you than in your earlier days; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. <a href="/ezekiel/36-12.htm">Ezekiel 36:12</a>.

Therefore thou shalt no more devour men, and no more cause thy people to stumble, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. <a href="/ezekiel/36-15.htm">Ezekiel 36:15</a>. And I will no more cause thee to hear the scoffing of the nations, and the disgrace of the nations thou shalt bear no more, and shalt no more cause thy people to stumble, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah.<p>This prophecy is uttered concerning the land of Israel, as is plainly declared in <a href="/ezekiel/36-6.htm">Ezekiel 36:6</a>; whereas in <a href="/ezekiel/36-1.htm">Ezekiel 36:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a> the mountains of Israel are mentioned instead of the land, in antithesis to the mountains of Seir (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-1.htm">Ezekiel 35:1-15</a>; see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/35-12.htm">Ezekiel 35:12</a>). The promise takes throughout the form of antithesis to the threat against Edom in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-1.htm">Ezekiel 35:1-15</a>. Because Edom rejoices that the Holy Land, which has been laid waste, has fallen to it for a possession, therefore shall the devastated land be cultivated and sown again, and be inhabited by Israel as in the former time. The heathen nations round about shall, on the other hand, bear their disgrace; Edom, as we have already observed, being expanded, so far as the idea is concerned, into all the heathen nations surrounding Israel (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3-7</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-2.htm">Ezekiel 36:2</a>, &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;, the enemy, is mentioned in quite a general manner; and what has already been stated concerning Edom in <a href="/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-10.htm">Ezekiel 35:10</a>, is her predicted of the enemy. In <a href="/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a> this enemy is designated as a remnant of the heathen nations; and it is not till <a href="/ezekiel/36-5.htm">Ezekiel 36:5</a> that it is more precisely defined by the clause, "and all Edom altogether." The &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; round about (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a>, compared with <a href="/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a>) are the heathen nations which are threatened with destruction in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25</a> and 26, on account of their malicious rejoicing at the devastation of Jerusalem and Judah. This serves to explain the fact that these nations are designated as &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, the rest, or remnant of the heathen nations, which presupposes that the judgment has fallen upon them, and that only a remnant of them is left, which remnant desires to take possession of the devastated land of Israel. The epithet applied to this land, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, everlasting, i.e., primeval heights, points back to the &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; of <a href="/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-15.htm">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>, and is chosen for the purpose of representing the land as a possession secured to the people of Israel by primeval promises, in consequence of which the attempt of the enemy to seize upon this land has become a sin against the Lord God. The indignation at such a sin is expressed in the emotional character of the address. As Ewald has aptly observed, "Ezekiel is seized with unusual fire, so that after the brief statement in <a href="/ezekiel/36-2.htm">Ezekiel 36:2</a> 'therefore' is repeated five times, the charges brought against these foes forcing themselves in again and again, before the prophecy settles calmly upon the mountains of Israel, to which it was really intended to apply." For &#1497;&#1506;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1503;, see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is an infinitive Kal, formed after the analogy of the verbs &#1492;'&#1500; (cf. Ewald, 238e), from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;, to be waste, to devastate, as in <a href="/daniel/8-13.htm">Daniel 8:13</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-11.htm">Daniel 12:11</a>, and is not to be taken in the sense of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, after <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a>, as Hitzig supposes. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, to pant for a thing; here it is equivalent to snapping at anything. This is required by a comparison with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a>, where &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1489;&#1494; corresponds to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, and &#1500;&#1500;&#1506;&#1490; to '&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. In the connection &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1492; signifies the lip as an organ of speech, or, more precisely, the words spoken; and &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, the tongue, is personified, and stands for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; (<a href="/psalms/140-12.htm">Psalm 140:12</a>), a tongue-man, i.e., a talker.<p>In <a href="/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a> the idea expressed in "the mountains of Israel" is expanded into mountains, hills, lowlands, and valleys (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-5.htm">Ezekiel 32:5-6</a>); and this periphrastic description of the land is more minutely defined by the additional clause, "waste ruins and forsaken cities." &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488; in <a href="/ezekiel/36-5.htm">Ezekiel 36:5</a> is the particle used in oaths (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a>, etc.); and the perfect &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is not merely prophetic, but also a preterite. God has already uttered a threatening word concerning the nations round about in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25</a>, 26, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-1.htm">Ezekiel 35:1-15</a>; and here He once more declares that they shall bear their disgrace. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1495; is the fiery jealousy of wrath. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; is an Aramean form for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; (<a href="/ezekiel/35-15.htm">Ezekiel 35:15</a>). For &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1496; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, see <a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a>. In the expression &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468; &#1500;&#1489;&#1494; noisserp, which has been rendered in various ways, we agree with Gesenius and others in regarding &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; as an Aramean form of the infinitive of &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, with the meaning to empty out, which is confirmed by the Syriac; for &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; cannot be a substantive, on account of the &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;; and Hitzig's conjecture, that &#1500;&#1489;&#1494; should be pointed &#1500;&#1489;&#1494;, and the clause rendered "to plunder its produce," is precluded by the fact that the separation of the preposition &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1500;, by the insertion of a word between, is unexampled, to say nothing of the fact that &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; does not mean produce at all. The thought expressed in <a href="/ezekiel/36-6.htm">Ezekiel 36:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-7.htm">Ezekiel 36:7</a> is the following: because Israel has hitherto borne the contempt of the heathen, the heathen shall now bear their own contempt. The lifting of the hand is a gesture employed in taking an oath, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-6.htm">Ezekiel 20:6</a>, etc. But the land of Israel is to receive a blessing. This blessing is described in <a href="/ezekiel/36-8.htm">Ezekiel 36:8</a> in general terms, as the bearing of fruit by the mountains, i.e., by the land of Israel; and its speedy commencement is predicted. It is then depicted in detail in <a href="/ezekiel/36-9.htm">Ezekiel 36:9</a>. In the clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;, the Israelites are not to be regarded as the subject, as Kliefoth supposes, in which case their speedy return from exile would be announced. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; shows that this cannot be the meaning; for it is immediately preceded by '&#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;' yb , which precludes the supposition that, when speaking of the mountains, Ezekiel had the inhabitants in his mind. The promised blessings are the subject, or the branches and fruits, which the mountains are to bear. Nearly all the commentators have agreed in adopting this explanation of the words, after the analogy of <a href="/isaiah/56-1.htm">Isaiah 56:1</a>. With the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/ezekiel/36-9.htm">Ezekiel 36:9</a> the carrying out of the blessing promised is appended in the form of a reason assigned for the general promise. The mountains shall be cultivated, the men upon them, viz., all Israel, multiplied, the desolated cities rebuilt, so that Israel shall dwell in the land as in the former time, and be fruitful and blessed. This promise was no doubt fulfilled in certain weak beginnings after the return of a portion of the people under Zerubbabel and Ezra; but the multiplying and blessing, experienced by those who returned from Babylon, did not take place till long after the salvation promised here, and more especially in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-12.htm">Ezekiel 36:12-15</a>.<p>According to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-12.htm">Ezekiel 36:12</a>, the land is to become the inheritance of the people Israel, and will no more make the Israelites childless, or (according to <a href="/ezekiel/36-14.htm">Ezekiel 36:14</a>) cause them to stumble; and the people are no more to bear the contempt of the heathen. But that portion of the nation which returned from exile not only continued under the rule of the heathen, but had also in various ways to bear the contempt of the heathen still; and eventually, because Israel not only stumbled, but fell very low through the rejection of its Saviour, it was scattered again out of the land among the heathen, and the land was utterly wasted...until this day. In <a href="/ezekiel/36-12.htm">Ezekiel 36:12</a> the masculine suffix attached to &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; refers to the land regarded as &#1492;&#1512;, which is also the subject to &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507;.
