Josephus [Antiquities, 10.7] reports that Ezekiel sent a copy of this prophecy to Zedekiah. As Jeremiah had sent a letter to the captives at the Chebar, which was the means of calling forth at first the agency of Ezekiel, so it was natural for Ezekiel to send a message to Jerusalem confirming the warnings of Jeremiah. The prince, however, fancying a contradiction between Eze 12:13; "he shall not see Babylon," and Jer 24:8, 9, declaring he should be carried to Babylon, believed neither. Seeming discrepancies in Scripture on deeper search prove to be hidden harmonies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Though they regard not to inquire, yet give them to know what I mean hereby. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thus saith the Lord God:</span> this to add weight and authority to the word. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">This burden; </span> this dreadful prognostic; this prophecy is a burden which the kingdom shall groan under, and your king and the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The prince; </span> Zedekiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All the house; </span> none may be excepted. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Say thou unto them, thus saith the Lord God,.... In answer to their sneering question; or notwithstanding their stupidity and indolence, and in order to awaken them out of it: <p>this burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem; the present reigning prince in Jerusalem, King Zedekiah. The sense is, either that that burden of goods the prophet carried out on his shoulders had a regard to the king of Judah and his captivity, and was an emblem of it; or rather that the burden of prophecy, or that sorrowful calamity predicted by the above sign or type, had relation to that prince, and would be fulfilled in him; and so the Targum, <p>"upon the prince is the burden of this prophecy;'' <p>in like manner Jarchi interprets it of prophecy: <p>and all the house of Israel which are among them; they were also concerned in it, and would be carried captive with their prince. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10, 11</span>. The general meaning of these verses is clear enough—the prophet’s action is a representation of what shall happen in Jerusalem in the case of prince and people, but <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/12-10.htm" title="Say you to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.">Ezekiel 12:10</a></span> is very obscure, and probably not in its original form.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">This burden</span> concerneth <span class="ital">the prince</span>] lit. <span class="ital">the prince</span> (is) <span class="ital">this burden</span> in Jerusalem. The term “burden” has also the sense of “oracle,” but Ez. does not use it in this sense and there is no reason to find any play upon the word as <a href="/jeremiah/23-33.htm" title="And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:33</a>. The allusion can only be to the last words of <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/12-7.htm" title="And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I dig through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bore it on my shoulder in their sight.">Ezekiel 12:7</a></span>—I <span class="ital">bare it</span> upon my shoulder; and the meaning would be: this bearing or loading has reference to the prince (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/12-12.htm" title="And the prince that is among them shall bear on his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.">Ezekiel 12:12</a></span>). With this sense the following words must run: and all the house of Israel which are in the midst of it (Jerusalem—with a change of one letter). The objection to this that if the relative were subject the pronoun would not be expressed after it (Hitz., Keil) is worthless. But there are other objections more valid: “all the house of Israel” could hardly be used of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the phrase usually refers to the larger Israel, existing in all places. R.V. “this burden <span class="ital">concerneth</span> the prince … and all the house of Israel among whom they are;” but <span class="ital">concerneth</span> is said of the “prince” and of “all the house of Israel” in different senses. Notwithstanding the objections to it the easiest course is to read: <span class="ital">in the midst of it</span> (Jerusalem) as above. Corn. omits the verse as a gloss.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the prince is this burden in Jerusalem.</span> The word "burden," in the sense of "prophecy," so common in Isaiah and Jeremiah and other prophets, as Hosea (<a href="/hosea/8-10.htm">Hosea 8:10</a>) and Nahum (<a href="/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>), is used by Ezekiel here only. Possibly he on the whole avoided it, as having fallen into discredit through its constant use by the false prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23</a>:83-38), and preferred the formula of "the word of Jehovah." As interpreted by <a href="/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4</a> and <a href="/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a>, the "prince" is Zedekiah. Possibly Ezekiel avoided the title "king," as seeing in him one who was a ruler <span class="accented">de facto</span>, but not a king <span class="accented">de jure.</span> The facts related in <a href="/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4</a> exactly correspond with the symbolic act. Zedekiah and his men of war escape from the city by night, "by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls," probably enough with faces covered, as David's was in his flight (<a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>), to avoid detection, or as a sign of mourning, and through some freshly made exit from the palace. The further significance of the covered face is found in the fact that Zedekiah was blinded at Riblah by Nebuchadnezzar's orders, and from that time could not see the ground on which he trod. Those who see in every Old Testament prediction nothing but a prophecy <span class="accented">ex eventu</span> infer from this that this section of Ezekiel was written after the destruction of Jerusalem. I do not take that view, and place it in close connection with the preceding chapters. We note in ver. 11 the peculiar phrase," I am <span class="accented">your</span> sign." Ezekiel, in what he does in the presence of the exiles, is figuring that which, before long, will come to pass in Jerusalem. They were to go forth into captivity as he had gone. <span class="cmt_word">For they shall remove,</span> the Revised. Version gives, <span class="accented">they shall go into exile.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The promise that the Lord would preserve to Himself a holy seed among those who had been carried away captive, brought to a close the announcement of the judgment that would fall upon the ancient Israel and apostate Jerusalem. All that is now wanting, as a conclusion to the whole vision, is the practical confirmation of the announcement of judgment. This is given in the two following verses. - <a href="/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22</a>. And the cherubim raised their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was up above them. <a href="/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>. And the glory of Jehovah ascended from the midst of the city, and took its stand upon the mountain which is to the east of the city. <a href="/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>. And wind lifted me up, and brought me to Chaldea to the exiles, in the vision, in the Spirit of God; and the vision ascended away from me, which I had seen. <a href="/ezekiel/11-25.htm">Ezekiel 11:25</a>. And I spoke to the exiles all the words of Jehovah, which He had shown to me. - The manifestation of the glory of the Lord had already left the temple, after the announcement of the burning of Jerusalem, and had taken its stand before the entrance of the eastern gate of the outer court, that is to say, in the city itself (<a href="/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>). But now, after the announcement had been made to the representatives of the authorities of their removal from the city, the glory of the God of Israel forsook the devoted city also, as a sign that both temple and city had ceased to be the seats of the gracious presence of the Lord. The mountain on the east of the city is the Mount of Olives, which affords a lofty outlook over the city. There the glory of God remained, to execute the judgment upon Jerusalem. Thus, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, will Jehovah also appear at the last judgment on the Mount of Olives above Jerusalem, to fight thence against His foes, and prepare a way of escape for those who are to be saved. It was from the Mount of Olives also that the Son of God proclaimed to the degenerate city the second destruction (<a href="/luke/19-21.htm">Luke 19:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>); and from the same mountain He made His visible ascension to heaven after His resurrection (<a href="/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50</a>; cf. <a href="/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>); and, as Grotius has observed, "thus did Christ ascend from this mountain into His kingdom, to execute judgment upon the Jews."<p>After this vision of the judgments of God upon the ancient people of the covenant and the kingdom of God, Ezekiel was carried back in the spirit into Chaldea, to the river Chaboras. The vision then vanished; and he related to the exiles all that he had seen. </body></html>
