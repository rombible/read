The Targum is, <p>"he shall cover his face because he hath sinned:'' <p>or that he might not be known and be discovered who he was; and so it was through fear of being betrayed by a false friend, or taken by the enemy: or else this may respect his having his eyes put out at Riblah, so that he could not see with them the land he was carried into; though it rather seems to refer to his first escape out of Jerusalem with a mask or vizor on him, which might hinder his seeing the ground he went upon; and which, in his fright, he could not attend to, looking out here and there, not being able to keep his eye long upon any place.

The prophet clearly foresaw the fall of the city and the captivity of the king, and he may have threatened the king with a chastisement for his rebellion which, though barbarous, was not unusual in that age.

All that is now wanting, as a conclusion to the whole vision, is the practical confirmation of the announcement of judgment. This is given in the two following verses. - <a href="/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22</a>. And the cherubim raised their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was up above them. <a href="/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>. And the glory of Jehovah ascended from the midst of the city, and took its stand upon the mountain which is to the east of the city. <a href="/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>. And wind lifted me up, and brought me to Chaldea to the exiles, in the vision, in the Spirit of God; and the vision ascended away from me, which I had seen. <a href="/ezekiel/11-25.htm">Ezekiel 11:25</a>. And I spoke to the exiles all the words of Jehovah, which He had shown to me. - The manifestation of the glory of the Lord had already left the temple, after the announcement of the burning of Jerusalem, and had taken its stand before the entrance of the eastern gate of the outer court, that is to say, in the city itself (<a href="/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>). But now, after the announcement had been made to the representatives of the authorities of their removal from the city, the glory of the God of Israel forsook the devoted city also, as a sign that both temple and city had ceased to be the seats of the gracious presence of the Lord. The mountain on the east of the city is the Mount of Olives, which affords a lofty outlook over the city. There the glory of God remained, to execute the judgment upon Jerusalem. Thus, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, will Jehovah also appear at the last judgment on the Mount of Olives above Jerusalem, to fight thence against His foes, and prepare a way of escape for those who are to be saved. It was from the Mount of Olives also that the Son of God proclaimed to the degenerate city the second destruction (<a href="/luke/19-21.htm">Luke 19:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>); and from the same mountain He made His visible ascension to heaven after His resurrection (<a href="/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50</a>; cf. <a href="/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>); and, as Grotius has observed, "thus did Christ ascend from this mountain into His kingdom, to execute judgment upon the Jews."<p>After this vision of the judgments of God upon the ancient people of the covenant and the kingdom of God, Ezekiel was carried back in the spirit into Chaldea, to the river Chaboras. The vision then vanished; and he related to the exiles all that he had seen. </body></html>
