Due regard is to be had for the sanctity of the officiating priests' food, by cooking courts being provided close to their chambers. One set of apartments for cooking was to be at the corners of the inner court, reserved for the flesh of the sin offerings, to be eaten only by the priests whose perquisite it was (Le 6:25; 7:7), before coming forth to mingle again with the people; another set at the corners of the outer court, for cooking the flesh of the peace offerings, of which the people partook along with the priests. All this implies that no longer are the common and unclean to be confounded with the sacred and divine, but that in even the least things, as eating and drinking, the glory of God is to be the aim (1Co 10:31).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering; </span> those that were brought sacrifices for sin were in part for the sacrificing priest, and he was to eat thereof; but it was to be dressed in the verge of holy ground, and so kitchens, boilers, ovens, and other utensils were prepared to do it, and these kitchens are here described, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That they bear them not; </span> the priests, or the attending Levites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Into the utter court, </span> where the people were, and many times in great numbers, that this holy flesh must needs be very near many of them, if it were carried out. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To sanctify the people:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/44-19.htm" title="And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.">Ezekiel 44:19</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said he unto me,.... Declaring what this place was, and what it was for: <p>this is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering, and the sin offering; this was the priests' kitchen, in which they prepared the sacrifices that were to be eaten; and which were typical of Christ, who was made sin, and became a sacrifice for the sins of his people, whether presumptuous ones, or sins of ignorance; the doctrine of whose sacrifice and satisfaction is a principal part of the Gospel ministry; and which should be delivered, not in a raw, crude, and indigested manner; but the Scriptures should be diligently searched into, to get a clear and distinct understanding of it; and these should be constantly meditated on, and thoroughly studied: ministers should examine their doctrine by the word of God before they deliver it; and take heed unto it that it is right, according to the oracles of God, and the proportion of faith; and take care to deliver it in the best manner, not in a cold lukewarm way, but with fervency of spirit; all which may be meant by the boiling of these sacrifices; it seems to design the laborious and diligent employ of Gospel ministers in their studies, preparatory to their public work in the house of God; and suggests that they should not come thither unprepared, and deliver out unpremeditated matter; or set before the Lord's people undigested food; or offer that in the sanctuary of the Lord which cost them no pains or trouble: this place, and so the boiling places in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-24.htm">Ezekiel 46:24</a>, are to be understood of the closets, studies, and places of retirement, where the ministers of the word employ their time and thoughts in preparing for their public ministry; for these were without the sanctuary, on the side of the priests' chambers, and in the corners of the outward court: <p>where they shall bake the meat offering; or "bread offering" (q); made of fine flour and oil; typical of Christ the bread of God, the food of believers, who is set forth as such to them in the ministry of the Gospel: the baking of this signifies the same as the boiling of the other before; see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>, <p>that they bear them not out in the utter court, to sanctify the people; that they might not be carried through the outer court, where the common people were; lest they should think it was lawful for them to eat of them as Kimchi observes, when they belonged to the priests only; or lest they should touch them, and become holy thereby, and so for the future be employed in sacred service, and obliged to quit the duties of their calling, which would, introduce confusion in the commonwealth; see <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>, the Targum is, <p>"lest they be mixed with the people.'' <p>The design seems to be to show, that the doctrine of peace, pardon, atonement, and satisfaction for sin, is only to be preached as belonging to such that truly repent of sin, and believe in Christ; and particularly that the ordinance of the Lord's supper, in which the sacrifice of Christ is held forth and commemorated, is to be administered, not to men in common, but to holy and regenerate persons; to do otherwise would be to cast pearls before swine, and give that which is holy to dogs. <p>(q)  "the minchah." <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/46.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said he to me, This <i>is</i> the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear <i>them</i> not out into the outer court, <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> to sanctify the people.</span><p>(e) That the people should not have to do with those things which belong to the Lord, and think it lawful for them to eat them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The "place" was designed as a kitchen where the priests should boil the trespass and the sin offerings and bake the meat (or, meal) offering, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> cook the portions of the sacrifices they should eat in their official capacity (see <a href="/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a>). The Law of Moses (<a href="/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>) required the flesh to be boiled (and probably also the flour to be baked) at the tabernacle door.

To this, however, Kliefoth objects that the conception of deriving ceremonial sanctity from contact with such offerings is completely strange to the Old Testament (see <a href="/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>), and accordingly he connects the words. "to sanctify the people," with the "baking" and "boiling" of the preceding clause. </body></html>
