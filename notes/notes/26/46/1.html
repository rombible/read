Which is premised, to raise the greater attention to what is about to be said: the gate of the inner court that looketh towards the east; the eastern gate of the inner court; the court of the priests, where stood the altar of burnt offerings, and where they offered the sacrifices for atonement; and seems, in the mystical sense, to design the ministry of the Gospel, which is a ministry of reconciliation; which holds forth Christ as the altar saints have a right to eat of; and who is the sacrifice for sin, and has made reconciliation for it; and, where this is preached, he, the angel descending from the east, comes; here appears the rising sun, the sun of righteousness, who arises on those that fear his name, and love his Gospel, with healing in his wings: this gate <p>shall be shut the six working days; which seems to be the same with the gate of the outward sanctuary, <a href="/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a> said to be always shut, and never opened; but by what follows here it appears that that must be understood with some exception and limitation: the six working days are the six days of the week in which men should labour, and do all the work and business of their callings, that they may thereby provide for themselves and families, and have wherewith to give to the poor; during which time the public ministry of the word is intermitted, that men may not be taken off of their necessary and lawful employments; and that the ministers of the word may have sufficient time to prepare in their studies for their ministerial service: <p>but on the sabbath it shall be opened; by which is meant, not the Jewish sabbath now abrogated in the times this vision refers to; but the Lord's day, called by this Jewish name: and this being opposed to the six working days, shows that it ought to be kept by abstinence from all civil, corporeal, and servile works, as well as from dead works or sins, and in the exercise of all religious duties, private and public; and particularly in attendance on the ministry of the word, the gate now opened; and which is sometimes expressed by opening the door of faith, and is called an open door; and may be said to be so when ministers have an opportunity without, and great freedom within themselves, to preach it; and when the doors of men's hearts are opened to attend to it, and many souls are gathered to Christ, and into his churches, by it; see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>, <p>and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened; on stated monthly days, in which the churches of Christ meet together for religious service: the new moon, which is an emblem of new light, and an increase of it, is very suitable to express the Gospel dispensation; in which, as Cocceius observes, there are some particular seasons that may be called so; as the coming of Christ into the world; his resurrection from the dead; the pouring forth of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost; the destruction of the temple, and temple service; the peace and prosperity of the Christian churches in the times of Constantine; the morning star of the reformation; and the call of God's people out of Babylon at the destruction of it; at all which times there has been, or will be, an opening of this eastern gate, or a free, and glorious ministration of the Gospel. Some think these six working days design this life, which is the time of working, after which there will be none but an eternal sabbath or rest; and that, for the present, saints live and walk by faith, and not by sight; divine and heavenly things are greatly shut up, and out of sight; but then it will be new moon, as well as sabbath, and all things will be seen clearly; but the former sense I think is best, which yet I leave to the judgment of others.

"The abrupt style of writing is still continued." The altar wood for the altar was of wood three cubits high; its length, i.e., the expanse of the wall from one corner to the other, was two cubits; the breadth (thickness), which is not expressly mentioned, was the same, because the square form is presupposed from the shape of this altar in the tabernacle and Solomon's temple. Under the term &#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, its corner-pieces, the horns projecting at the corners, or the horn-shaped points, are probably included, as the simple mention of the corners appears superfluous, and the horns, which were symbolically significant features in the altar, would certainly not have been wanting. There is something strange in the occurrence of &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; before and along with &#1511;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, as the length is already included in the walls, and it would not be appropriately said of the length that it was of wood. &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; is therefore certainly a copyist's error for &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (lxx), its stand or pedestal. The angel describes this altar as the "table which stands before Jehovah" - in perfect harmony with the epithet already applied to the sacrifices in the Pentateuch, the "bread (&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;) of God," though not "because the altar table was intended to combine the old table of shewbread and the altar of incense" (Bttcher). The table of shewbread is not mentioned any more than the candlestick and other portions of the temple furniture. - The altar of burnt-offering stood before Jehovah, i.e., before the entrance into the holy of holies. This leads in <a href="/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23</a>. to the notice of the doors of the sanctuary, the character of which is also described as simply openings (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;), since the doorway had been mentioned before. delet &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; signifies a moveable door, and the plural &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;, doors, whether they consist of one leaf or two, i.e., whether they are single or folding doors. Here the &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-24.htm">Ezekiel 41:24</a> (&#1500;&#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;) are folding doors; on the other hand, the first &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="/ezekiel/41-24.htm">Ezekiel 41:24</a> and &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; ibid. are used for the wings of the door, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; for the swinging portions (leaves) of the separate wings. The meaning is this: the holy place (&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;) and the holy of holies (&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;) had two folding doors (i.e., each of these rooms had one). These doors had two wings, and each of these wings, in the one door and in the other, had two reversible door-leaves, so that when going in and out there was no necessity to throw open on every occasion the whole of the wing, which was at least three or four cubits broad. There is no foundation for the objection raised by Kliefoth to the interpretation of &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; &#1493;&#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; as signifying the holy place and the holy of holies; since he cannot deny that the two words are so used, &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-17.htm">1 Kings 6:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-33.htm">1 Kings 6:33</a>, and &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2-3</a>, etc. And the artificial explanation, "to the temple space, and indeed to the holy place," not only passes without notice the agreement between our verses and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31-34</a>, but gains nothing further than a side door, which does violence to the dignity of the sanctuary, a passage from the side chambers into the holy place, with which Bttcher has presented Solomon's temple. - These doors were ornamented, like the walls, with figures of cherubim and palms. - Other remarks are added in vv. 25b and 26 concerning the porch in front of the holy place. The first is, that on the front of the porch outside there was &#1506;&#1489; &#1488;&#1509;. The only other passage in which the word &#1506;&#1489; occurs in a similar connection is <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a>, where it refers to wood-work in front of the Ulam of Solomon's porch of pillars; and it cannot be determined whether it signifies threshold, or moulding, or threshold-mouldings. On the shoulders, i.e., on the right and left side walls of the front porch, there were closed windows and figures of palms. The cherubim were omitted here. - The last words of <a href="/ezekiel/41-26.htm">Ezekiel 41:26</a> are very obscure. &#1493;&#1510;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468; may be taken in connection with the preceding clause, "and on the side-rooms of the temple," as there is no necessity to repeat the preposition in the case of closely continuous clauses (vid., Ewald, 351a); and the side-rooms not only must have had windows, but might also be ornamented with figures of palms. But if the words be taken in this sense, the &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; must also signify something which presented, like the walls of the porch and of the side chambers, a considerable extent of surface capable of receiving a similar decoration; although nothing definite has hitherto been ascertained with regard to the meaning of the word, and our rendering "beams" makes no pretension to correctness. </body></html>
