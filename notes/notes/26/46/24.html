But I think, as the people bringing a sacrifice were admitted into the court that was the court of the priests, and to the very gates of the court of the temple, where they gave the sacrifice to the priest, and saw him prepare and offer it for them, so they might be admitted to feast on so solemn occasion in the courts or chambers, whither ordinarily they might not come; I cannot therefore determine these kitchen courts to have been in the court of the people, it is more likely they were in the priests’ courts. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said he unto me, these are the places of them that boil,....
