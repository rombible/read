Our Lord has directed us to do many duties, but he has also left many things to our choice, that those who delight in his commandments may abound therein to his glory, without entangling their own consciences, or prescribing rules unfit for others; but we must never omit our daily worship, nor neglect to apply the sacrifice of the Lamb of God to our souls, for pardon, peace, and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That gate - The eastern gate of the inner court.

The prince is to go through the east gate without (open on the Sabbath only, to mark its peculiar sanctity) to the entrance of the gate of the inner court; he is to go no further, but "stand by the post" (compare 1Ki 8:14, 22, Solomon standing before the altar of the Lord in the presence of the congregation; also 2Ki 11:14; 23:3, "by a pillar": the customary place), the court within belonging exclusively to the priests. There, as representative of the people, in a peculiarly near relation to God, he is to present his offerings to Jehovah, while at a greater distance, the people are to stand worshipping at the outer gate of the same entrance. The offerings on Sabbaths are larger than those of the Mosaic law, to imply that the worship of God is to be conducted by the prince and people in a more munificent spirit of self-sacrificing liberality than formerly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shall enter</span> into the gate of the court next the temple to offer his sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Go in by the way of the porch; </span> go to the threshold, the inward threshold of the east gate, that opens into the court of the temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Go forth by the way thereof; </span> none of the people might do so, only the prince and the priests might go out the same way they came in. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate,....
