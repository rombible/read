This was the first of the two specific grounds upon which Eden should feel the stroke of Divine vengeance. Edom had been Israel's hereditary foe from the days of Esau and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-22.htm">Genesis 25:22</a>, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.; and Genesis 27:37) downwards. Inspired with unappeasable wrath (<a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>), during the period of the wandering he had refused Israel, "his brother," a passage through his territory (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>; <a href="/judges/11-17.htm">Judges 11:17</a>), and in the days of Jehoshaphat had combined with Ammon and Moab to invade Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-10.htm">2 Chronicles 20:10, 11</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/83-1.htm">Psalm 83:1-8</a>). His relentless antipathy to Israel culminated, according to Ezekiel (cf. <a href="/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a>), in the last days of <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem, in the time of her calamity</span>, when Nebuchadnezzar's armies encompassed her walls, in the time that her <span class="cmt_word">iniquity</span> <span class="cmt_word">had an end</span>; or, in <span class="accented">the time of the iniquity of the end</span> (Revised Version); meaning, according to Keil, "the time of Judah's final transgression;" or, according to Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' the time when the capture of the city put an end to her iniquity; but, with more probability, according to Hengstenberg, Plumptre, and others, the time of that iniquity which brought on her end (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/21-29.htm">Ezekiel 21:29</a>). Ewald translates, "at the time of her extremest punishment," taking <span class="accented">avon</span> in the sense of punishment - a rendering the Revisers have placed in the margin. Then, according to Obadiah (vers. 11-14), the Edomites had not only stood coolly by, but malevolently exulted when they beheld Jerusalem besieged by the Babylonian warriors; and not only joined with the foreign invaders in the sacking of the city, but occupied its gates and guarded the roads leading into the country, so as to prevent the escape of any of the wretched inhabitants, and even hewed down with the sword such fugitives as they were not able to save alive and deliver up to captivity. To this Ezekiel refers when he accuses Edom of having <span class="cmt_word">shed</span> the <span class="cmt_word">blood of the children of Israel</span> by the fores of the sword; literally, of having <span class="accented">poured the children of Israel upon the hands of the sword; i.e.</span> of having delivered them up to the sword (cf. <a href="/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Behaviour of the People Towards the prophet<p><a href="/ezekiel/33-30.htm">Ezekiel 33:30</a>. And thou, son of man, the sons of thy people converse about thee by the walls and in the house-doors; one talketh to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come and let us hear what kind of word goeth out from Jehovah. <a href="/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a>. And they will come to thee, like an assembly of the people, and sit before thee as my people, and will hear thy words, but not do them; but that which is pleasant in their mouth they do; their heart goeth after their gain. <a href="/ezekiel/33-32.htm">Ezekiel 33:32</a>. And, behold, thou art unto them like a pleasant singer, beautiful in voice and playing well; they will hear thy words, but they will not do them. <a href="/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33</a>. But when it cometh - behold, it cometh - they will know that a prophet was in the midst of them. - This addition to the preceding word of God, which is addressed to Ezekiel personally, applies to the whole of the second half of his ministry, and stands in obvious connection with the instructions given to the prophet on the occasion of his first call (<a href="/ezekiel/3-16.htm">Ezekiel 3:16</a>.), and repeated, so far as their substance is concerned, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7-9</a>, as Kliefoth himself acknowledges, in opposition to his assumption that vv. 1-20 of this chapter belong to the prophecies directed against the foreign nations. As God had directed the prophet's attention, on the occasion of his call, to the difficulties connected with the discharge of the duties of a watchman with which he was entrusted, by setting before him the object and the responsibility of his vocation, and had warned him not to allow himself to be turned aside by the opposition of the people; so here in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-30.htm">Ezekiel 33:30-33</a>, at the commencement of the second section of his ministry, another word is addressed to him personally, in order that he may not be influenced in the further prosecution of his calling by either the pleasure or displeasure of men.<p>His former utterances had already induced the elders of the people to come to him to hear the word of God (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/14-1.htm">Ezekiel 14:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/20-1.htm">Ezekiel 20:1</a>). But now that his prophecies concerning Jerusalem had been fulfilled, the exiles could not fail to be still more attentive to his words, so that they talked of him both secretly and openly, and encouraged one another to come and listen to his discourses. God foretells this to him, but announces to him at the same time that this disposition on the part of his countrymen to listen to him is even now no sign of genuine conversion to the word of God, in order that he may not be mistaken in his expectations concerning the people. Kliefoth has thus correctly explained the contents, design, and connection of these verses as a whole. In <a href="/ezekiel/33-30.htm">Ezekiel 33:30</a> the article before the participle &#1504;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; takes the place of the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, and the words are in apposition to &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1502;&#1498;, the sons of thy people who converse about thee. &#1504;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is reciprocal, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/3-13.htm">Malachi 3:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>, and <a href="/psalms/119-12.htm">Psalm 119:12</a>. But &#1489; is to be understood, not in a hostile sense, as in the passage cited from the Psalms, but in the sense of concerning, like &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1489; in <a href="/1_samuel/19-3.htm">1 Samuel 19:3</a> as contrasted with &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1489; in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-7.htm">Numbers 21:7</a>, to speak against a person. The participle is continued by the finite &#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, and the verb belonging to &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;  follows, in the &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a>, in the form of an apodosis. There is something monstrous in Hitzig's assumption, that the whole passage from <a href="/ezekiel/33-30.htm">Ezekiel 33:30</a> to <a href="/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33</a> forms but one clause, and that the predicate to &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1502;&#1498; does not occur till the &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; of <a href="/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33</a>. -  &#1488;&#1510;&#1500; , by the side of the walls, i.e., sitting against the walls, equivalent to secretly; and in the doors of the houses, in other words publicly, one neighbour conversing with another. &#1495;&#1491;, Aramean for &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, and &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; by the side of &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, every one; not merely one here or there, but every man to his neighbour. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1470;&#1506;&#1501;, lit., as the coming of a people, i.e., as when a crowd of men flock together in crowds or troops. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; is a predicate, as my people, i.e., as if they wished, like my people, to hear my word from thee. But they do not think of doing thy words, i.e., what thou dost announce to them as my word. &#1506;&#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; are things for which one cherishes an eager desire, pleasant things in their mouth, i.e., according to their taste (cf. <a href="/genesis/25-28.htm">Genesis 25:28</a>). Hvernick is wrong in taking &#1506;&#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; to mean illicit love. The word &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; is quite inapplicable to such a meaning. The rendering, they do it with their mouth, is opposed both to the construction and the sense. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;&#1501; .esnes , their gain, the source from which they promise themselves advantage or gain. In <a href="/ezekiel/33-32.htm">Ezekiel 33:32</a> a clearer explanation is given of the reason why they come to the prophet, notwithstanding the fact that they do not wish to do his words. "Thou art to them &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512; &#1506;&#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;;" this cannot mean like a pleasant song, but, as &#1502;&#1496;&#1489; &#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503; (one who can play well) clearly shows, like a singer of pleasant songs. The abstract &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512; stands for the concrete &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, a singer, a man of song (Hitzig). In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-32.htm">Ezekiel 33:32</a>, "they hear thy words, but do them not," is repeated with emphasis, for the purpose of attaching the threat in <a href="/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33</a>. But when it cometh - namely, what thou sayest, or prophesiest - behold, it cometh, i.e., it will come as surely as thy prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem; then will they know that a prophet was among them (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>), that is to say, that he proclaimed God's word to them. Therefore Ezekiel is not to be prevented, by the misuse which will be made of his words, from preaching the truth. - This conclusion of the word of God, which points back to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>, also shows that it forms the introduction to the prophecies which follow. </body></html>
