This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father.

The “chariot,” i.e. the whole theophany of cherubim and wheels is often spoken of in later times (e.g. Ecclesus. 49:8), but is nowhere named in the Bible (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/28-18.htm" title="And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.">1 Chronicles 28:18</a>).

The prophet's reason for introducing this clause was manifestly the same he had for identifying the visions - to show that, while it was the same Jehovah who had departed from the old temple that was now returning to the new, there was nothing incongruous in the idea that he who in the past had shown himself a God of justice and judgment by overturning and destroying the old, should in the future exhibit himself as a God of grace and mercy by condescending to establish his abode in the new.

In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten, on this same day the hand of Jehovah came upon me, and He brought me thither. <a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>. In visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain; and upon it there was like a city-edifice toward the south. <a href="/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>. And He brought me thither, and behold there was a man, his appearance like the appearance of brass, and a flaxen cord in his hand, and the measuring-rod; and he stood by the gate. <a href="/ezekiel/40-4.htm">Ezekiel 40:4</a>. And the man spake to me: Son of man, see with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I show thee; for thou art brought hither to show it thee. Tell all that thou seest to the house of Israel. - The twofold announcement of the time when the prophet was shown the vision of the new temple and the new kingdom of God points back to <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a>, and places this divine revelation concerning the new building of the kingdom of God in a definite relation, not only to the appearance of God by which Ezekiel was called to be a prophet (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>), but also to the vision in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8.htm">Ezekiel 8-11</a>, in which he was shown the destruction of the ancient, sinful Jerusalem, together with its temple. The twenty-fifth year of the captivity, and the fourteenth year after the city was smitten, i.e., taken and reduced to ashes, are the year 575 before Christ. There is a difference of opinion as to the correct explanation of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, at the beginning of the year; but it is certainly incorrect to take the expression as denoting the beginning of the economical or so-called civil year, the seventh month (Tishri). For, in the first place, the custom of beginning the year with the month Tishri was introduced long after the captivity, and was probably connected with the adoption of the era of the Seleucidae; and, secondly, it is hardly conceivable that Ezekiel should have deviated from the view laid down in the Torah in so important a point as this. The only thing that could render this at all probable would be the assumption proposed by Hitzig, that the year 575 b.c. was a year of jubilee, since the year of jubilee did commence with the day of atonement on the tenth of the seventh month. But the supposition that a jubilee year fell in the twenty-fifth year of the captivity cannot be raised into a probability. We therefore agree with Hvernick and Kliefoth in adhering to the view of the older commentators, that &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; is a contracted repetition of the definition contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>, &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; , and signifies the opening month of the year, i.e., the month Abib (Nisan). The tenth day of this month was the day on which the preparations for the Passover, the feast of the elevation of Israel into the people of God, were to commence, and therefore was well adapted for the revelation of the new constitution of the kingdom of God. On that day was Ezekiel transported, in an ecstatic state, to the site of the smitten Jerusalem. For &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491; &#1497;&#1497;, compare <a href="/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; evidently points back to &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; in <a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>: thither, where the city was smitten. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; , as in <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>. &#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500; : he set me down upon (not by) a very high mountain (&#1488;&#1500; for &#1506;&#1500;, as in many other instances; e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>).<p>The very high mountain is Mount Zion, which is exalted above the tops of all the mountains (<a href="/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>) - the mountain upon which, according to what follows, the new temple seen in the vision stood, and which has already been designated as the lofty mountain of Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22-23</a>.<p>(Note: J. H. Michaelis has already explained it correctly, viz.: "The highest mountain, such as Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>) had also predicted that Mount Zion would be, not physically, but in the eminence of gospel dignity and glory; cf. <a href="/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>.")<p>Upon this mountain Ezekiel saw something like a city-edifice toward the south (lit.,from the south hither). &#1502;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;  is not the building of the new Jerusalem (H&#1492;vernick, Kliefoth, etc.). For even if what was to be seen as a city-edifice really could be one, although no tenable proof can be adduced of this use of &#1499; simil., nothing is said about the city till <a href="/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/48-156.htm">Ezekiel 48:156</a> and 30 ff., and even there it is only in combination with the measuring and dividing of the land; so that Hvernick's remark, that "the revelation has reference to the sanctuary and the city; these two principal objects announce themselves at once as such in the form of vision," is neither correct nor conclusive. The revelation has reference to the temple and the whole of the holy land, including the city; and the city itself does not come at all into such prominence as to warrant us in assuming that there is already a reference made to it here in the introduction. If we look at the context, the man with the measure, whom Ezekiel saw at the place to which he was transported, was standing at the gate (<a href="/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>). This gate in the wall round about the building was, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>, a temple gate. Consequently what Ezekiel saw as a city-edifice can only be the building of the new temple, with its surrounding wall and its manifold court buildings. The expressions &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; and &#1502;&#1504;&#1490;&#1489; can both be brought into harmony with this. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; refers to the very high mountain mentioned immediately before, to the summit of which the prophet had been transported, and upon which the temple-edifice is measured before his eyes. But &#1502;&#1504;&#1490;&#1489; does not imply, that as Ezekiel looked from the mountain he saw in the distance, toward the south, a magnificent building like a city-edifice; but simply that, looking from his standing-place in a southerly direction, or southwards, he saw this building upon the mountain, - that is to say, as he had been transported from Chaldea, i.e., from the north, into the land of Israel, he really saw it before him towards the south; so that the rendering of &#1502;&#1504;&#1490;&#1489; by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; in the Septuagint is substantially correct, though without furnishing any warrant to alter &#1502;&#1504;&#1490;&#1489; into &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>, &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;  is repeated from the end of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-1.htm">Ezekiel 40:1</a>, for the purpose of attaching the following description of what is seen, in the sense of, "when He brought me thither, behold, there (was) a man." His appearance was like the appearance of brass, i.e., of shining brass (according to the correct gloss of the lxx &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1511;&#1500;&#1500;  equals  , <a href="/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>). This figure suggests a heavenly being, an angel, and as he is called Jehovah in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-2.htm">Ezekiel 44:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-5.htm">Ezekiel 44:5</a>, the angel of Jehovah.
