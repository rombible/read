To “fill the hand” is a synonym for consecration, commonly applied to the priests, who were consecrated by placing in their hands the gifts they were to offer to God. Here it is better to keep to the text as it stands, “filling the hand of the altar” being a strong figurative expression to denote that it shall always be supplied with sacrificial gifts. Nothing is said throughout the passage of the consecration of the priests, the whole family of Aaron having been consecrated once for all by the ceremonies of Leviticus 8.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>43:1-27 After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Consecrate themselves - literally, as in the margin. <a href="/leviticus/8-27.htm">Leviticus 8:27</a>.

The phrase is properly said of the priests, to install; here of the altar, to inaugurate it. Originally the expression had probably a literal meaning, to put the things to be offered into the hands of the priests (<a href="/leviticus/8-25.htm" title="And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was on the inwards, and the lobe above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:">Leviticus 8:25</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.), but later it came to be used generally in the sense of initiate, consecrate (<a href="/exodus/28-41.htm" title="And you shall put them on Aaron your brother, and his sons with him; and shall anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-9.htm" title="And you shall gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and you shall consecrate Aaron and his sons.">Exodus 29:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-29.htm" title="And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.">Exodus 29:29</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-33.htm" title="And they shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.">Exodus 29:33</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-35.htm" title="And thus shall you do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded you: seven days shall you consecrate them.">Exodus 29:35</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-37.htm" title="This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;">Leviticus 7:37</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-3.htm" title="These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office.">Numbers 3:3</a>; <a href="/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Jdg 17:5</a>; <a href="/judges/17-12.htm" title="And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.">Jdg 17:12</a>), cf. <a href="/exodus/32-29.htm" title="For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man on his son, and on his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day.">Exodus 32:29</a>. Wellh. <span class="ital">Hist</span>. p. 152, argues that the priest’s hand was originally “filled” with money (Judges 17). The phrase “fill the hand” of one appears also in the general meaning “to invest with office” in Assyrian; Fd. Del. <span class="ital">Heb. Lang</span>. p. 20, <span class="ital">Prolegomena</span>, p. 48.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In all the above passage it is the altar not the priests that is consecrated. The consecration of the altar appears to carry with it that of the whole sanctuary. The altar needs atonement not because it is a work of human hands, but because it belongs to the things of the world. The sin of the world has defiled all things, penetrating even to the precincts of that where Jehovah abides as he is in himself (<a href="/hebrews/9-23.htm" title="It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.">Hebrews 9:23</a>). The passage can scarcely be compared with Exodus 29 and Leviticus 8 because there the ceremonies refer to the consecration of the priests chiefly and little to the altar. Cf. <a href="/exodus/29-36.htm" title="And you shall offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.">Exodus 29:36</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-11.htm" title="And he sprinkled thereof on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.">Leviticus 8:11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-15.htm" title="And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation on it.">Leviticus 8:15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-33.htm" title="And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.">Leviticus 8:33</a>. In these passages the altar is said to have been anointed with oil, a ceremony wanting in Ezek.; the sin-offering was a young bullock <span class="ital">each</span> day and the burnt—offering simply a ram each day.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall purge the altar</span>. Smend thinks it strange that only the purification of the altar should be mentioned here, while that of the sanctuary is referred to later (<a href="/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a>), and finds in this an explanation (at least, perhaps) of the fact that in <a href="/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a> only the consecration of the Mosaic altar - not of the Mosaic tabernacle - is reported. He conceives it likely that the author of <a href="/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a> copied Ezekiel, but does not explain why Ezekiel may not have copied the author of <a href="/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And they shall consecrate themselves</span>; more correctly, <span class="accented">they - i.e.</span> the priests - <span class="accented">shall consecrate it</span>; literally, <span class="accented">fill</span> <span class="accented">its hand</span>. The phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>, "to fill one's hand," sc. with gifts, occurs with reference to Jehovah (<a href="/exodus/32-29.htm">Exodus 32:29</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-5.htm">1 Chronicles 29:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-31.htm">2 Chronicles 29:31</a>). It is also employed in the sense of filling the hand of another, as e.g. of a priest, with sacrificial gifts, when he is instituted into his sacred office (<a href="/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>; comp, <a href="/leviticus/8-27.htm">Leviticus 8:27</a>). Here the hand to be filled is that of the altar, which is personified for the purpose (compare the use of the terms "bosom" and "lip" in connection with the altar). The meaning is that the altar, at its consecration, should have a plentiful supply of gifts, to symbolize that the offering of such gifts was the work for which it was set apart, and that it should never be without them. </body></html>
