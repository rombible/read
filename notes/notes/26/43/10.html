It seems also, that this same draught and description of the house and its courts, &c., was to be laid before them, as a model for them to imitate, as far as they should be able, when they should return to their own country, and rebuild their temple. See <span class="ital">Preliminary Observations </span>to chap. 40.-48. But, as has been more than once intimated, “the words may have a further view, and the model of God’s temple here set forth might be intended as a pattern of heavenly things, as Moses’s was, <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>, and a type of that pure church, <span class="ital">built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, </span>which we may hope God will in due time everywhere restore.

When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father.

That is, the house the prophet had seen measured, its gates, courts, and all belonging to it; which he was at first bid to observe, that he might show it to others; the house that the glory of the Lord was now come into, and had filled; and which is no other than the Gospel church in its perfection and glory in the latter day. This the prophet, who is addressed under his usual character in this book, is bid to show "to the house of Israel"; either to the captives in Babylon, among whom he was, and to whom he often speaks in this book, being sent with a message to them: and this he is ordered to show them, both to comfort them in their present state, with a view of what would be hereafter; and to humble them, and bring them to a sense of their sins, and shame for them, which had brought them into the condition they were, and so greatly short of this happy one: or else to the Jews in the first times of the Gospel; the prophet representing the apostles of Christ, who delivered out the form of a Gospel church state to the believing ones, far superior to that they had been in, and into which they entered: or rather he represented the ministers of the word in the latter day, showing to the Christians of those times the order, worship, and discipline of a pure Gospel church, who have been greatly deficient in their observance of them; and which is the work and business of Gospel ministers to do, as well as to preach the doctrine of the Gospel: <p>that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; how far short they have come of the model of true Gospel churches, and of observing the order, and maintaining the ordinances, and keeping up the discipline of such churches; and when persons are brought to blush and be ashamed, it looks as if they had a true sight and sense of their mistakes, and of repentance for them: <p>and let them measure the pattern; that is, of the house, and what belongs to it; by which they will see their defects, and correct them; see <a href="/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/43.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/43.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">ashamed of their iniquities</span>] i.e. in disregarding the ordinances of the Lord’s house, in defiling it (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/ezekiel/43-7.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the middle of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places....">Ezekiel 43:7-8</a></span>), and in committing its services to the hands of uncircumcised aliens (<a href="/ezekiel/44-7.htm" title="In that you have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.">Ezekiel 44:7</a>), and the like.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">measure the pattern</span>] LXX. has, “and its appearance and its pattern.” Cf. <a href="/ezekiel/42-11.htm" title="And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.">Ezekiel 42:11</a>, where “measures” and “appearance” were also interchanged.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">10–12</span>.
