When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>altar - Ariel was to be an exact square on all sides.

First the altar, or, <span class="accented">hearth of God</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ariel</span>) was <span class="cmt_word">twelve cubits long and twelve broad</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> was square in the four squares (or, sides) thereof, or a perfect square (comp. <a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>). Next the <span class="cmt_word">settle</span>, or, <span class="accented">enclosure</span> (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) of ver. 14, was <span class="cmt_word">fourteen</span> cubits long, and <span class="cmt_word">fourteen broad in the four squares</span> (or, sides) <span class="cmt_word">thereof</span>; the fourteen being made up of the twelve cubits of the altar-hearth's side with one cubit of ledge from the settle all round. The only question is to which "settle," the upper or the under, reference is made. Some expositors, identifying the greater Azarah with the Harel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "upper settle," with "the mount of God" or the base of the hearth, make the altar height only seven cubits from the ground to the hearth. The general belief, however, is that they cannot be so identified. Among interpreters who distinguish them, Kliefoth, with whom Smend agrees, holds the "settle" in this verse to be the <span class="accented">harel</span>, or "mount of God," which extended (Smend says with a <span class="accented">hek</span>. or "gutter") one cubit on each side beyond the <span class="accented">ariel</span>, or "hearth of God," so that the "mount of God," on which the" hearth of God" rested, was fourteen cubits square. Then, assuming a similar extension of one cubit at each stage - in the greater azarah, the lesser azarah, and the hek, or ground bottom - he finds the surface of the greater azarah to be sixteen, of the lesser azarah eighteen, and of the ground bottom twenty cubits square. Keil, with whom Schroder and Currey agree, objects to this as involving too much of arbitrary assumption, and takes the" settle" of this verse to mean the lower azarah; so that no additional measurements are required beyond those given in the text. If the square surface of the greater azarah be considered as having been the same as that of the harel, so that their sides were continuous, then, as the "ground bottom" extended one cubit on each side beyond the lower azarsh, the altar at its base was a square of sixteen cubits. Comparing now these measurements with those of the altar of burnt offering in the tabernacle and the temple, one finds that the former was only five cubits square and three cubits high (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>), while the latter was twenty cubits broad, but only ten cubits high (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>), which awakes the suspicion that the different views above noted have been insensibly influenced by a desire on the part of their authors to make them harmonize with the measurements of the temple. But there does not appear sufficient reason why the measurements of Ezekiel's altar should have agreed with those of Solomon's rather than with those of Moses', <span class="cmt_word">The border</span> (or, <span class="accented">parapet</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of half a cubit</span> which ran round the ledge, or bottom, of a cubit, at the foot of the lower azarah was clearly designed, not for the protection of the priest officiating, but for ornament. The <span class="cmt_word">stairs</span> (or, <span class="accented">steps</span>), mention of which closes the description, mark a departure, not from the pattern of the Solomonic temple, in which the altar must have had steps (see Keil's 'Biblische Archaologie,' p. 141), but from the pattern of the tabernacle, in which altar-steps were disallowed (<a href="/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>) and did not exist (<a href="/exodus/38-1.htm">Exodus 38:1-7</a>). But if, as Jewish tradition asserts, the pest-exilic altar had no steps as Ezekiel's had, having been reached by an inclined plane, because in the so-called book of the covenant steps were forbidden, how does this harmonize with the theory that Ezekiel's vision temple was designed as a model for the post-exilic temple? And why, if the priest-code was the composition of a writer who worked in the spirit and on the lines of Ezekiel, should it have omitted to assign steps to the tabernacle altar? </body></html>
