Neither our persons nor our performances can be acceptable to God, unless sin be taken away; and that cannot be taken away but by the blood of Christ, which both sanctifies the altar (for Christ entered by his own blood) and the gift upon the altar. <span class="ital">There was also a bullock and a ram to be offered for a burnt-offering, </span>(<a href="/ezekiel/43-24.htm" title="And you shall offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to the LORD.">Ezekiel 43:24</a>,) which was intended purely for the glory of God, to teach us to have an eye to that in all our services. This dedication of the altar is called the cleansing and purging of it, <a href="/ezekiel/43-20.htm" title="And you shall take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and on the border round about: thus shall you cleanse and purge it.">Ezekiel 43:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/43-26.htm" title="Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.">Ezekiel 43:26</a>. Christ, our altar, though he had no pollution to be cleansed from, yet sanctified himself, <a href="/john/17-19.htm" title="And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.">John 17:19</a>. And when we consecrate the altars of our hearts to God, to have holy love always burning upon them, we must see that they be purified and cleansed from the love of the world and the lust of the flesh. It is observable, that there are several differences between the rites of dedication here, and those which were appointed Exodus 29., to intimate that the ceremonial institutions were mutable things, and the changes made in them were earnests of their termination in Christ. Only here, according to the general law that all the sacrifices must be seasoned with salt, (<a href="/leviticus/2-14.htm" title="And if you offer a meat offering of your first fruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the meat offering of your first fruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.">Leviticus 2:14</a>,) particular orders are given (<a href="/ezekiel/43-24.htm" title="And you shall offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to the LORD.">Ezekiel 43:24</a>) that the priests shall cast salt upon the sacrifices. Grace is the salt with which all our religious performances must be seasoned, <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm" title=" Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.">Colossians 4:6</a>. An everlasting covenant is called <span class="ital">a covenant of salt, </span>because it is incorruptible. The glory reserved for us is incorruptible and undefiled; and the grace wrought in us, influencing <span class="ital">the hidden man of the heart, </span>is in <span class="ital">that which is not corruptible, </span>and therefore, in the sight of God, of great price. We may observe further here, that constant use was to be made of the altar when dedicated; the priests being directed to make their burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon it, (<a href="/ezekiel/43-27.htm" title="And when these days are expired, it shall be, that on the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 43:27</a>,) for therefore it was sanctified, that it might sanctify the gift that was offered upon it. And for their encouragement in this whole service, God promises, on condition of their observing these directions, that he would graciously accept them: for those that give themselves to God shall be accepted of him, their persons first, and then their performances, through the Mediator; and if our persons be accepted, and our services be pleasing to him, it is enough, we need no more. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>43:1-27 After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The rites here described are not those of the regular service, but those to be observed on the day of dedication.

The sacrifices here are not mere commemorative, but propitiatory ones. The expressions, "blood" (Eze 43:18), and "for a sin offering" (Eze 43:19, 21, 22), prove this. In the literal sense they can only apply to the second temple. Under the Christian dispensation they would directly oppose the doctrine taught in Heb 10:1-18, namely, that Christ has by one offering for ever atoned for sin. However, it is possible that they might exist with a retrospective reference to Christ's sufferings, as the Levitical sacrifices had a prospective reference to them; not propitiatory in themselves, but memorials to keep up the remembrance of His propitiatory sufferings, which form the foundation of His kingdom, lest they should be lost sight of in the glory of that kingdom [De Burgh]. The particularity of the directions make it unlikely that they are to be understood in a merely vague spiritual sense.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">These are the ordinances; </span> these are the measures and proportions for building the altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the day when, </span> whensoever, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">they shall make it, </span> the returned captives shall build and use it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To offer burnt-offerings thereon:</span> it appears then this was the great brazen altar, of which see <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/38-30.htm" title="And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,">Exodus 38:30</a> 39:39</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To sprinkle blood thereon, </span> according to the law, <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm" title="And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 1:5</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/43.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto me, son of man, thus saith the Lord God,....

Hence he describes the ritual of the sin-offering on the first day fully, omitting to refer to the burnt-offering, which he mentions only in connexion with the second and following days. And when in <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/43-25.htm" title="Seven days shall you prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.">Ezekiel 43:25</a></span> it is said that a goat for sin-offering and a young bullock and a ram were offered for seven days, the difference between the sin-offering on the first day (a bullock) and that for the following six days (a goat) is not adverted to, the burnt-offering being the same all the seven days.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ordinances of the altar.</span> These were not the regulations for the sacrificial worship to be afterwards performed upon this altar, but the rites to be observed at its consecration when the day should arrive for its construction. As the altar in the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1-46</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11-33</a>), and that in Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63-66</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-4.htm">2 Chronicles 7:4-10</a>), so was this in Ezekiel's "house" dedicated by a special ceremonial before being brought into ordinary use. The particular ritual observed by Solomon is not described in detail; but a comparison between that enjoined upon and practiced by Moses with that revealed to and published by Ezekiel shows that while in some respects they agreed, in other important particulars they differed. In both the ceremony largely consisted in offering sacrifice and smearing blood, and lasted seven days; but in the former the ceremony was performed exclusively by Moses, consisted, in addition to the above, of an anointing of the altar, the holy utensils, and the tabernacle itself with oil, and was associated with the consecration of the priests; whereas in the latter, in addition to some variations in the sacrificial victims, which will be noted in the course of exposition, the priests should bear an active part - there should be no anointing with oil, and no consecration of the priests, the priesthood being assumed as already existing. If in Ezekiel's ritual there was no mention of a cleansing of the sanctuary (that of <a href="/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a> referring to a special ease), but only of the altar, that was sufficiently explained by the circumstance that Jehovah was already in the "house." The final clause, to <span class="cmt_word">offer burnt offerings thereon</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and to sprinkle blood thereon</span>, indicates the purpose for which the altar was to be used. </body></html>
