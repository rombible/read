Sometimes one spoke of the wheel is uppermost, sometimes another; but the motion of the wheel on its own axletree is regular and steady. We need not despond in adversity; the wheels are turning round and will raise us in due time, while those who presume in prosperity know not how soon they may be cast down. The wheel is near the living creatures; the angels are employed as ministers of God's providence. The spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels; the same wisdom, power, and holiness of God, that guide and govern the angels, by them order all events in this lower world. The wheel had four faces, denoting that the providence of God exerts itself in all parts. Look every way upon the wheel of providence, it has a face toward you. Their appearance and work were as a wheel in the middle of a wheel. The disposals of Providence seem to us dark, perplexed, and unaccountable, yet are all wisely ordered for the best. The motion of these wheels was steady, regular, and constant. They went as the Spirit directed, therefore returned not. We should not have to undo that by repentance which we have done amiss, if we followed the guidance of the Spirit. The rings, or rims of the wheels were so vast, that when put in motion the prophet was afraid to look upon them. The consideration of the height and depth of God's counsel should awe us. They were full of eyes round about. The motions of Providence are all directed by infinite Wisdom. All events are determined by the eyes of the Lord, which are in every place beholding the evil and the good; for there is no such thing as chance or fortune. The firmament above was a crystal, glorious, but terribly so. That which we take to be a dark cloud, is to God clear as crystal, through which he looks upon all the inhabitants of the earth. When the angels had roused a careless world, they let down their wings, that God's voice might be plainly heard. The voice of Providence is to open men's ears to the voice of the word. Sounds on earth should awaken our attention to the voice from heaven; for how shall we escape, if we turn away from Him that speaks from thence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Every one had two, which covered ... - Or, each one had two wings covering his body on either side. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. straight&#8212;erect [Fairbairn], expanded upright.<p>two &#8230; two &#8230; covered &#8230; bodies&#8212;not, as it might seem, contradicting Eze 1:11.

Probably the rendering should be: <span class="ital">every one had two covering them, and every one had two covering them</span>, even <span class="ital">their bodies</span>—the words “their bodies” giving a more exact definition of “covering them.” Cf. <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm" title="They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.">Isaiah 11:9</a>.

And I saw the creatures, and, lo, there was a wheel upon the earth beside the creatures, towards their four fronts. <a href="/ezekiel/1-16.htm">Ezekiel 1:16</a>. The appearance of the wheels and their work was like the appearance of the chrysolite; and all four had one kind of figure: and their appearance and their work was as if one wheel were within the other. <a href="/ezekiel/1-17.htm">Ezekiel 1:17</a>. Towards their four sides they went when they moved: they turned not as they went. <a href="/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a>. And their felloes, they were high and terrible; and their felloes were full of eyes round about in all the four. <a href="/ezekiel/1-19.htm">Ezekiel 1:19</a>. And when the creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the creatures raised themselves up from the earth, the wheels also raised themselves. <a href="/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Ezekiel 1:20</a>. Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went in the direction in which the spirit was to go; and the wheels raised themselves beside them: for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels. <a href="/ezekiel/1-21.htm">Ezekiel 1:21</a>. When the former moved, the latter moved also; when the former stood, the latter stood; and when the former raised themselves from the ground, the wheels raised themselves beside them: for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels. - The words, "and I saw the creatures," prepare the way for the transition to the new object which presented itself in these creatures to the eye of the seer. By the side of these creatures upon the ground he sees a wheel, and that at the four fronts, or front faces of the creatures. The singular suffix in &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; can neither be referred, with Rosenmller, to the chariot, which is not mentioned at all, nor, with Hitzig, to the preposition &#1488;&#1510;&#1500;, nor, with Hvernick, Maurer, and Kliefoth, to &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1503;, and so be understood as if every wheel looked towards four sides, because a second wheel was inserted in it at right angles. This meaning is not to be found in the words. The suffix refers ad sensum to &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (Ewald), or, to express it more correctly, to the figure of the cherubim with its four faces turned to the front, conceived as a unity - as one creature (&#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22</a>). Accordingly, we have so to represent the matter, that by the side of the four cherubim, namely, beside his front face, a wheel was to be seen upon the earth. Ezekiel then saw four wheels, one on each front of a cherub, and therefore immediately speaks in <a href="/ezekiel/1-16.htm">Ezekiel 1:16</a> of wheels (in the plural). In this verse &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is adspectus, and &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; "work;" i.e., both statements employing the term "construction," although in the first hemistich only the appearance, in the second only the construction, of the wheels is described. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is a chrysolite of the ancients, the topaz of the moderns, - a stone having the lustre of gold. The construction of the wheels was as if one wheel were within a wheel, i.e., as if in the wheel a second were inserted at right angles, so that without being turned it could go towards all the four sides. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1503;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a>, stands absolutely. "As regards their felloes," they possessed height and terribleness-the latter because they were full of eyes all round. Hitzig arbitrarily understands &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; of the upper sides; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, after the Arabic, of the under side, or that which lies towards the back. The movement of the wheels completely followed the movement of the creatures (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-19.htm">Ezekiel 1:19-21</a>), because the spirit of the creature was in the wheels. &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, in <a href="/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Ezekiel 1:20</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-21.htm">Ezekiel 1:21</a>, is not the "principle of life" (Hvernick), but the cherubic creatures conceived as a unity, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22</a>, where the meaning is undoubted. The sense is: the wheels were, in their motion and rest, completely bound by the movements and rest of the creatures, because the spirit which ruled in them was also in the wheels, and regulated their going, standing, and rising upwards. By the  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; the wheels are bound in one with the cherub-figures, but not by means of a chariot, to or upon which the cherubim were attached. </body></html>
