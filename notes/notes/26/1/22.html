We are here to conceive, therefore, of that which was “stretched forth over their heads above” as a simple expanse, like the sky, as if he had said, “And above their heads was stretched forth the sky.” This expanse is not represented as supported by the cherubim, or resting upon them, and it remained undisturbed when they let down their wings (<a href="/ezekiel/1-25.htm" title="And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.">Ezekiel 1:25</a>).

Sometimes one spoke of the wheel is uppermost, sometimes another; but the motion of the wheel on its own axletree is regular and steady. We need not despond in adversity; the wheels are turning round and will raise us in due time, while those who presume in prosperity know not how soon they may be cast down. The wheel is near the living creatures; the angels are employed as ministers of God's providence. The spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels; the same wisdom, power, and holiness of God, that guide and govern the angels, by them order all events in this lower world. The wheel had four faces, denoting that the providence of God exerts itself in all parts. Look every way upon the wheel of providence, it has a face toward you. Their appearance and work were as a wheel in the middle of a wheel. The disposals of Providence seem to us dark, perplexed, and unaccountable, yet are all wisely ordered for the best. The motion of these wheels was steady, regular, and constant. They went as the Spirit directed, therefore returned not. We should not have to undo that by repentance which we have done amiss, if we followed the guidance of the Spirit. The rings, or rims of the wheels were so vast, that when put in motion the prophet was afraid to look upon them. The consideration of the height and depth of God's counsel should awe us. They were full of eyes round about. The motions of Providence are all directed by infinite Wisdom. All events are determined by the eyes of the Lord, which are in every place beholding the evil and the good; for there is no such thing as chance or fortune. The firmament above was a crystal, glorious, but terribly so. That which we take to be a dark cloud, is to God clear as crystal, through which he looks upon all the inhabitants of the earth. When the angels had roused a careless world, they let down their wings, that God's voice might be plainly heard. The voice of Providence is to open men's ears to the voice of the word. Sounds on earth should awaken our attention to the voice from heaven; for how shall we escape, if we turn away from Him that speaks from thence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"The color" (Hebrew, "eye") "of the terrible crystal" refers to the dazzling brightness of the "firmament," a clear bright expanse between the "throne" and the "living creatures," separating heaven from earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. upon the heads&#8212;rather, "above the heads" [Fairbairn].<p>colour&#8212;glitter.<p>terrible crystal&#8212;dazzling the spectator by its brightness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The likeness; </span> the appearance or resemblance; of which word before, <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/1-13.htm" title="As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.">Ezekiel 1:13</a>,16</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The firmament:</span> the living creatures, the wheels, and these upon the earth, our prophet had seen and mentioned; now he speaks of the firmament, which must be supposed to be stretched forth above the earth; as the prophet saw the one, so he saw the other.

This was not a real firmament, but the likeness of one; it was like the firmament which God created on the second day, which divided between the waters above and below, and which he called Heaven; and is no other than the airy and starry heavens. Its name is in Hebrew  "an expanse"; from its being stretched out as a curtain, and a tent to dwell in; and a "firmament" from its firmness and continuance; and therefore called the firmament of his power, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-8.htm">Genesis 1:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/150-1.htm">Psalm 150:1</a>; and this visionary one was "over the heads of the living creatures"; which shows that they could not be angels, for those have their habitation in the third heaven, above the firmament; much less in hieroglyphic of the trinity of Persons, who are the three that bear record in heaven, and are not under the firmament; but ministers of the Gospel, who are on earth, and are subject to Christ, whose throne is above the firmament, <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; and who receive their commission and gifts from him, and are accountable to him. This firmament <p>was as the colony of the tenable crystal; crystal is a very white, transparent, precious stone, resembling ice, from whence it has its name; hence Pliny (t) thought it was no other than ice vehemently frozen; and here it is called "terrible", because exceeding clear and bright, so that there was no looking upon it, without the eyes being dazzled with the glory of it. The sky is called a molten looking glass, in which the glory of God, and his handiwork, may be seen, <a href="/job/37-18.htm">Job 37:18</a>; and as the throne of Christ was over this crystal firmament, it shows that, though he is in heaven, he sees all that is done on earth, and in his churches, and by his ministers; and the saints also see him by faith, and through the glass of the Gospel: it is only a crystal firmament that is between them, <p>stretched forth over their heads above; that is, over the heads of the living creatures, as before; said to be stretched out, in allusion to its name, an expanse, as before observed. <p>(t) Nat.

In the above passages LXX. renders “make strong,” and the noun “firmament.” The word “firmament” occurs only in Genesis 1; Ezekiel 1; <a href="/ezekiel/10-1.htm" title="Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.">Ezekiel 10:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/19-1.htm" title="The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows his handiwork.">Psalm 19:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/150-1.htm" title="Praise you the LORD.

It meets us again in vers. 23, 25, 26, and in 10:1, but does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament. What met the prophet's eye was the expanse, the "body of heaven in its clearness" (<a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>), the deep intense blue of an Eastern sky. <span class="cmt_word">Like the colour of the terrible crystal,</span> etc. The Hebrew noun is not found elsewhere.

Rock crystal, seen, as it is, in small masses, and in its pure colourless transparency, hardly suggests the idea of terror; but the intense brightness of masses of ice, as shining in the morning sun, might well make that impression. Had Ezekiel seen the glories of a mountain throne of ice as he looked up, on his nay from Palestine to Chaldea, at the heights of Lebanon, or Hermon, and thought of them as the fitting symbol of the throne of God? We note, in this connection, the use of "terrible" in <a href="/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a> (see note on ver. 4). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The four wheels beside the cherubim. - <a href="/ezekiel/1-15.htm">Ezekiel 1:15</a>. And I saw the creatures, and, lo, there was a wheel upon the earth beside the creatures, towards their four fronts. <a href="/ezekiel/1-16.htm">Ezekiel 1:16</a>. The appearance of the wheels and their work was like the appearance of the chrysolite; and all four had one kind of figure: and their appearance and their work was as if one wheel were within the other. <a href="/ezekiel/1-17.htm">Ezekiel 1:17</a>. Towards their four sides they went when they moved: they turned not as they went. <a href="/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a>. And their felloes, they were high and terrible; and their felloes were full of eyes round about in all the four. <a href="/ezekiel/1-19.htm">Ezekiel 1:19</a>. And when the creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the creatures raised themselves up from the earth, the wheels also raised themselves. <a href="/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Ezekiel 1:20</a>. Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went in the direction in which the spirit was to go; and the wheels raised themselves beside them: for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels. <a href="/ezekiel/1-21.htm">Ezekiel 1:21</a>. When the former moved, the latter moved also; when the former stood, the latter stood; and when the former raised themselves from the ground, the wheels raised themselves beside them: for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels. - The words, "and I saw the creatures," prepare the way for the transition to the new object which presented itself in these creatures to the eye of the seer. By the side of these creatures upon the ground he sees a wheel, and that at the four fronts, or front faces of the creatures. The singular suffix in &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; can neither be referred, with Rosenmller, to the chariot, which is not mentioned at all, nor, with Hitzig, to the preposition &#1488;&#1510;&#1500;, nor, with Hvernick, Maurer, and Kliefoth, to &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1503;, and so be understood as if every wheel looked towards four sides, because a second wheel was inserted in it at right angles. This meaning is not to be found in the words. The suffix refers ad sensum to &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (Ewald), or, to express it more correctly, to the figure of the cherubim with its four faces turned to the front, conceived as a unity - as one creature (&#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22</a>). Accordingly, we have so to represent the matter, that by the side of the four cherubim, namely, beside his front face, a wheel was to be seen upon the earth. Ezekiel then saw four wheels, one on each front of a cherub, and therefore immediately speaks in <a href="/ezekiel/1-16.htm">Ezekiel 1:16</a> of wheels (in the plural). In this verse &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is adspectus, and &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; "work;" i.e., both statements employing the term "construction," although in the first hemistich only the appearance, in the second only the construction, of the wheels is described. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is a chrysolite of the ancients, the topaz of the moderns, - a stone having the lustre of gold. The construction of the wheels was as if one wheel were within a wheel, i.e., as if in the wheel a second were inserted at right angles, so that without being turned it could go towards all the four sides. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1503;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a>, stands absolutely. "As regards their felloes," they possessed height and terribleness-the latter because they were full of eyes all round. Hitzig arbitrarily understands &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; of the upper sides; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, after the Arabic, of the under side, or that which lies towards the back.
