But the most probable opinion seems to be that which the Chaldee paraphrast, Archbishop Usher, Dr. Prideaux, and other learned men adopt: namely, that these thirty years are to be reckoned from the time when Josiah and all the people of Judah entered into that solemn covenant mentioned <a href="/2_kings/22-3.htm" title="And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,">2 Kings 22:3</a>; and when the book of the law was found by Hilkiah the priest, which was in the eighteenth year of Josiah, from which date, it appears, to the fifth year of the captivity, were thirty years. This being an event which put the Jewish state upon a new trial, was certainly sufficiently remarkable to render the time when it took place an era proper to be dated from. Accordingly, from the same period learned men compute the forty years of Judah’s transgression, mentioned <a href="/ezekiel/4-6.htm" title="And when you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed you each day for a year.">Ezekiel 4:6</a>. <span class="ital">In the fourth month — </span>Thammuz, which nearly corresponds to our July; <span class="ital">as I was among the captives — </span>Carried away by Nebuchadnezzar, with King Jehoiachin, <a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm" title="And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.">2 Kings 24:14</a>. Thus the godly are sometimes involved in the same outward calamities which befall the wicked. <span class="ital">By the river Chebar — </span>Which river Ammianus calls Aboras, and Ptolemy, Chaboras. It flows into the east side of the Euphrates at Circesium, or Carchemish, nearly two hundred miles northward of Babylon. On this river, at Tel-abib and other places, Nebuchadnezzar planted his Jewish captives, probably to cultivate waste lands, or to carry on some manufacture for the benefit of their victors. This was the scene of Ezekiel’s prophecies, which were continued through the course of twenty-two years. Here he was present in body, though in visionary representation he was sometimes taken to Jerusalem: see Bishop Newcome.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The heavens were opened — </span>As a prelude to a heavenly vision. The appearance of the heavens, as it were, opening, seems, in this and such like cases, to have been represented first to excite attention to the vision that was to follow: see <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a>. <span class="ital">And I saw visions of God — </span>It is probable that the captive Jews had been left some time without prophets or visions from God, which might supply the want of the more ordinary means of instruction; at length, however, God raised them up a prophet in their captivity, to whom he first revealed himself by an extraordinary vision, as he had done to Isaiah, chap. 6., to Jeremiah, chap. 1., to Abraham, <a href="/acts/7-2.htm" title="And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,">Acts 7:2</a>, and to many others of his servants, in order, as it were, to open and settle a correspondence, and a satisfactory way of intercourse, so that there needed not afterward a vision upon every fresh revelation made to them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-14 It is a mercy to have the word of God brought to us, and a duty to attend to it diligently, when we are in affliction. The voice of God came in the fulness of light and power, by the Holy Spirit. These visions seem to have been sent to possess the prophet's mind with great and high thoughts of God. To strike terror upon sinners. To speak comfort to those that feared God, and humbled themselves. In ver. 4-14, is the first part of the vision, which represents God as attended and served by a vast company of angels, who are all his messengers, his ministers, doing his commandments. This vision would impress the mind with solemn awe and fear of the Divine displeasure, yet raise expectations of blessings. The fire is surrounded with a glory. Though we cannot by searching find out God to perfection, yet we see the brightness round about it. The likeness of the living creatures came out of the midst of the fire; angels derive their being and power from God. They have the understanding of a man, and far more. A lion excels in strength and boldness. An ox excels in diligence and patience, and unwearied discharge of the work he has to do. An eagle excels in quickness and piercing sight, and in soaring high; and the angels, who excel man in all these respects, put on these appearances. The angels have wings; and whatever business God sends them upon, they lose no time. They stood straight, and firm, and steady. They had not only wings for motion, but hands for action. Many persons are quick, who are not active; they hurry about, but do nothing to purpose; they have wings, but no hands. But wherever the angels' wings carried them, they carried hands with them, to be doing what duty required. Whatever service they went about, they went every one straight forward. When we go straight, we go forward; when we serve God with one heart, we perform work. They turned not when they went. They made no mistakes; and their work needed not to be gone over again. They turned not from their business to trifle with any thing. They went whithersoever the Spirit of God would have them go. The prophet saw these living creatures by their own light, for their appearance was like burning coals of fire; they are seraphim, or burners; denoting the ardour of their love to God, and fervent zeal in his service. We may learn profitable lessons from subjects we cannot fully enter into or understand. But let us attend to the things which relate to our peace and duty, and leave secret things to the Lord, to whom alone they belong.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The thirtieth year - being closely connected with as I, is rather in favor of considering this a personal date. It is not improbable that Ezekiel was called to his office at the age prescribed in the Law for Levites <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-23.htm">Numbers 4:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-30.htm">Numbers 4:30</a>, at which age both John the Baptist and our Lord began their ministry. His call is probably to be connected with the letter sent by Jeremiah to the captives <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29.htm">Jeremiah 29</a> written a few months previously. Some reckon this date from the accession of Nabopolassar, father of Nebuchadnezzar, 625 b.c., and suppose that Ezekiel here gives a Babylonian, as in <a href="/ezekiel/1-2.htm">Ezekiel 1:2</a> a Jewish, date; but it is not certain that this accession formed an era in Babylon and Ezekiel does not elsewhere give a double date, or even a Babylonian date. Others date from the 18th year of Josiah, when Hilkiah discovered the Book of the Law (supposed to be a jubilee year): this would give 594 b.c. as the 30th year, but there is no other instance in Ezekiel of reckoning from this year.<p>The captives - Not in confinement, but restricted to the place of their settlement.<p>The fourth month - "Month" is not expressed in the original. This is the common method. Before the captivity the months were described not by proper names but by their order, "the first, the second," etc.; the first month corresponding nearly with our "April." After the captivity, the Jews brought back with them the proper names of the months, "Nisan" etc. (probably those used in Chaldaea).<p>Chebar - The modern "Khabour" rises near Nisibis and flows into the Euphrates near "Kerkesiah," 200 miles north of Babylon.<p>Visions of God - The exposition of the fundamental principles of the existence and nature of a Supreme God, and of the created angels, was called by the rabbis "the Matter of the Chariot" (compare <a href="/1_chronicles/28-18.htm">1 Chronicles 28:18</a>) in reference to the form of Ezekiel's vision of the Almighty; and the subject was deemed so mysterious as to call for special caution in its study. The vision must be compared with other manifestations of the divine glory <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>; <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>. Each of these visions has some of the outward signs or symbols here recorded. If we examine these symbols we shall find them to fall readily into two classes,<p>(1) Those which we employ in common with the writers of all ages and countries. "Gold, sapphire, burnished brass," the "terrible crystal" are familiar images of majestic glory, "thunders, lightnings" and "the rushing storm" of awful power. But<p>(2) We come to images to our minds strange and almost grotesque. That the "Four Living Creatures" had their groundwork in the cherubim there can be no doubt. And yet their shapes were very different. Because they were symbols not likenesses, they could yet be the same though their appearance was varied.<p>Of what are they symbolic? They may, according to the Talmudists, have symbolized orders of Angels and not persons; according to others they were figures of the Four Gospels actuated by one spirit spread over the four quarters of the globe, upon which, as on pillars, the Church is borne up, and over whom the Word of God sits enthroned. The general scope of the vision gives the best interpretation of the meaning.<p>Ezekiel saw "the likeness of the glory of God." Here His glory is manifested in the works of creation; and as light and fire, lightning and cloud, are the usual marks which in inanimate creation betoken the presence of God <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6-14</a> - so the four living ones symbolize animate creation. The forms are typical, "the lion" and "the ox" of the beasts of the field (wild and tame), "the eagle" of the birds of the air, while "man" is the rational being supreme upon the earth. And the human type predominates over all, and gives character and unity to the four, who thus form one creation. Further, these four represent the constitutive parts of man's nature: "the ox" (the animal of sacrifice), his faculty of suffering; "the lion" (the king of beasts), his faculty of ruling; "the eagle" (of keen eye and soaring wing), his faculty of imagination; "the man," his spiritual faculty, which actuates all the rest.<p>Christ is the Perfect Man, so these four in their perfect harmony typify Him who came to earth to do His Father's will; and as man is lord in the kingdom of nature, so is Christ Lord in the kingdom of grace. The "wings" represent the power by which all creation rises and falls at God's will; the "one spirit," the unity and harmony of His works; the free motion in all directions, the universality of His Providence. The number "four" is the symbol of the world with its "four quarters;" the "veiled" bodies, the inability of all creatures to stand in the presence of God; the "noise of the wings," the testimony borne by creation to God <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-3</a>; the "wheels" connect the vision with the earth, the wings with heaven, while above them is the throne of God in heaven. Since the eye of the seer is turned upward, the lines of the vision become less distinct. It is as if he were struggling against the impossibility of expressing in words the object of his vision: yet on the summit of the throne is He who can only be described as, in some sort, the form of a man. That Yahweh, the eternal God, is spoken of, we cannot doubt; and such passages as <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/12-41.htm">John 12:41</a>, justify us in maintaining that the revelation of the divine glory here made to Ezekiel has its consummation or fulfillment in the person of Christ, the only-begotten of God (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17-18</a>).<p>The vision in the opening chapter of Ezekiel is in the most general form - the manifestation of the glory of the living God. It is repeated more than once in the course of the book (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-2.htm">Ezekiel 8:2</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>; 10; <a href="/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>). The person manifested is always the same, but the form of the vision is modified according to special circumstances of time and place. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>THE BOOK OF THE PROPHET E Z E K I E L. Commentary by A. R. Faussett   <p>INTRODUCTION<p>The name Ezekiel means "(whom) God will strengthen" [Gesenius]; or, "God will prevail" [Rosenmuller]. His father was Buzi (Eze 1:3), a priest, and he probably exercised the priestly office himself at Jerusalem, previous to his captivity, as appears from the matured priestly character to be seen in his prophecies, a circumstance which much increased his influence with his captive fellow countrymen at Babylon. Tradition represents Sarera as the land of his nativity. His call to prophesy was in the fifth year from the date of his being carried away with Jehoiachin (see 2Ki 24:11-15) by Nebuchadnezzar, 599 B.C. The best portions of the people seem to have been among the first carried away (Eze 11:16; Jer 24:2-7, 8, 10). The ungodly were willing to do anything to remain in their native land; whereas the godly believed the prophets and obeyed the first summons to surrender, as the only path of safety. These latter, as adhering to the theocratic principle, were among the earliest to be removed by the Chaldeans, who believed that, if they were out of the way, the nation would fall to pieces of itself. They were despised by their brethren in the Holy Land not yet captives, as having no share in the temple sacrifices. Thus Ezekiel's sphere of labor was one happier and less impeded by his countrymen than that of Jeremiah at home. The vicinity of the river Chebar, which flows into the Euphrates near Circeslum, was the first scene of his prophecies (Eze 1:1). Tel-Abib there (now Thallaba) was his place of residence (Eze 3:15), whither the elders used to come to inquire as to God's messages through him. They were eager to return to Jerusalem, but he taught them that they must first return to their God. He continued to prophesy for at least twenty-two years, that is, to the twenty-seventh year of the captivity (Eze 29:17), and probably remained with the captives by the Chebar the rest of his life. A treatise, falsely attributed to Epiphanius, states a tradition that he was killed at Babylon by a prince of his people whom he had reproved for idolatry.<p>He was contemporary with Jeremiah and Daniel. The former had prophesied for thirty-four years before Ezekiel, and continued to do so for six or seven years after him. The call of Ezekiel followed the very next year after the communication of Jeremiah's predictions to Babylon (Jer 51:59), and was divinely intended as a sequel to them. Daniel's predictions are mostly later than Ezekiel's but his piety and wisdom had become proverbial in the early part of Ezekiel's ministry (Eze 14:14, 16; 28:3). They much resemble one another, especially in the visions and grotesque images. It is a remarkable proof of genuineness that in Ezekiel no prophecies against Babylon occur among those directed against the enemies of the covenant-people. Probably he desired not to give needless offence to the government under which he lived. The effect of his labors is to be seen in the improved character of the people towards the close of the captivity, and their general cessation from idolatry and a return to the law. It was little more than thirty years after the close of his labors when the decree of the Jews' restoration was issued. His leading characteristic is realizing, determined energy; this admirably adapted him for opposing the "rebellious house" "of stubborn front and hard heart," and for maintaining the cause of God's Church among his countrymen in a foreign land, when the external framework had fallen to pieces. His style is plain and simple. His conceptions are definite, and the details even of the symbolical and enigmatical parts are given with lifelike minuteness. The obscurity lies in the substance, not in the form, of his communications. The priestly element predominates in his prophecies, arising from his previous training as a priest. He delights to linger about the temple and to find in its symbolical forms the imagery for conveying his instructions. This was divinely ordered to satisfy the spiritual want felt by the people in the absence of the outward temple and its sacrifices. In his images he is magnificent, though austere and somewhat harsh. He abounds in repetitions, not for ornament, but for force and weight. Poetical parallelism is not found except in a few portions, as in the seventh, twenty-first, twenty-seventh, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth through thirty-first chapters. His great aim was to stimulate the dormant minds of the Jews. For this end nothing was better suited than the use of mysterious symbols expressed in the plainest words. The superficial, volatile, and wilfully unbelieving would thereby be left to judicial blindness (Isa 6:10; Mt 13:11-13, &c.); whereas the better-disposed would be awakened to a deeper search into the things of God by the very obscurity of the symbols. Inattention to this divine purpose has led the modern Jews so to magnify this obscurity as to ordain that no one shall read this book till he has passed his thirtieth year.<p>Rabbi Hananias is said to have satisfactorily solved the difficulties (Mischna) which were alleged against its canonicity. Ecclesiasticus 49:8 refers to it, and Josephus [Antiquities, 10.5.1]. It is mentioned as part of the canon in Melito's catalogue [Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, 4.26]; also in Origen, Jerome, and the Talmud. The oneness of tone throughout and the repetition of favorite expressions exclude the suspicion that separate portions are not genuine. The earlier portion, the first through the thirty-second chapters, which mainly treats of sin and judgment, is a key to interpret the latter portion, which is more hopeful and joyous, but remote in date. Thus a unity and an orderly progressive character are imparted to the whole. The destruction of Jerusalem is the central point. Previous to this he calls to repentance and warns against blind confidence in Egypt (Eze 17:15-17; compare Jer 37:7) or other human stay. After it he consoles the captives by promising them future deliverance and restoration. His prophecies against foreign nations stand between these two great divisions, and were uttered in the interval between the intimation that Nebuchadnezzar was besieging Jerusalem and the arrival of the news that he had taken it (Eze 33:21). Havernick marks out nine sections:&#8212;(1) Ezekiel's call to prophesy (Eze 1:1-3:15). (2) Symbolical predictions of the destruction of Jerusalem (Eze 3:16-7:27). (3) A year and two months later a vision of the temple polluted by Tammuz or Adonis worship; God's consequent scattering of fire over the city and forsaking of the temple to reveal Himself to an inquiring people in exile; happier and purer times to follow (Eze 8:1-11:25). (4) Exposure of the particular sins prevalent in the several classes&#8212;priests, prophets, and princes (Eze 12:1-19:14). (5) A year later the warning of judgment for national guilt repeated with greater distinctness as the time drew nearer (Eze 20:1-23:49). (6) Two years and five months later&#8212;the very day on which Ezekiel speaks&#8212;is announced as the day of the beginning of the siege; Jerusalem shall be overthrown (Eze 24:1-27). (7) Predictions against foreign nations during the interval of his silence towards his own people; if judgment begins at the house of God, much more will it visit the ungodly world (Eze 25:1-32:32). Some of these were uttered much later than others, but they all began to be given after the fall of Jerusalem. (8) In the twelfth year of the captivity, when the fugitives from Jerusalem (Eze 33:21) had appeared in Chaldea, he foretells better times and the re-establishment of Israel and the triumph of God's kingdom on earth over its enemies, Seir, the heathen, and Gog (Eze 33:1-39:29). (9) After an interval of thirteen years the closing vision of the order and beauty of the restored kingdom (Eze 40:1-48:35). The particularity of details as to the temple and its offerings rather discountenances the view of this vision being only symbolical, and not at all literal. The event alone can clear it up. At all events it has not yet been fulfilled; it must be future. Ezekiel was the only prophet (in the strict sense) among the Jews at Babylon. Daniel was rather a seer than a prophet, for the spirit of prophecy was given him to qualify him, not for a spiritual office, but for disclosing future events. His position in a heathen king's palace fitted him for revelations of the outward relations of God's kingdom to the kingdoms of the world, so that his book is ranked by the Jews among the Hagiographa or "Sacred Writings," not among the prophetical Scriptures. On the other hand, Ezekiel was distinctively a prophet, and one who had to do with the inward concerns of the divine kingdom. As a priest, when sent into exile, his service was but transferred from the visible temple at Jerusalem to the spiritual temple in Chaldea.   <p>CHAPTER 1<p>Eze 1:1-28. Ezekiel's Vision by the Chebar. Four Cherubim and Wheels.<p>1. Now it came to pass&#8212;rather, "And it came," &c. As this formula in Jos 1:1 has reference to the written history of previous times, so here (and in Ru 1:1, and Es 1:1), it refers to the unwritten history which was before the mind of the writer. The prophet by it, as it were, continues the history of the preceding times. In the fourth year of Zedekiah's reign (Jer 51:59), Jeremiah sent by Seraiah a message to the captives (Jer 29:1-32) to submit themselves to God and lay aside their flattering hopes of a speedy restoration. This communication was in the next year, the fifth, and the fourth month of the same king (for Jehoiachin's captivity and Zedekiah's accession coincide in time), followed up by a prophet raised up among the captives themselves, the energetic Ezekiel.<p>thirtieth year&#8212;that is, counting from the beginning of the reign of Nabopolassar, father of Nebuchadnezzar, the era of the Babylonian empire, 625 B.C., which epoch coincides with the eighteenth year of Josiah, that in which the book of the law was found, and the consequent reformation began [Scaliger]; or the thirtieth year of Ezekiel's life. As the Lord was about to be a "little sanctuary" (Eze 11:16) to the exiles on the Chebar, so Ezekiel was to be the ministering priest; therefore he marks his priestly relation to God and the people at the outset; the close, which describes the future temple, thus answering to the beginning. By designating himself expressly as "the priest" (Eze 1:3), and as having reached his thirtieth year (the regular year of priests commencing their office), he marks his office as the priest among the prophets. Thus the opening vision follows naturally as the formal institution of that spiritual temple in which he was to minister [Fairbairn].<p>Chebar&#8212;the same as Chabor or Habor, whither the ten tribes had been transported by Tiglath-pileser and Shalmaneser (2Ki 17:6; 1Ch 5:26). It flows into the Euphrates near Carchemish or Circesium, two hundred miles north of Babylon.<p>visions of God&#8212;Four expressions are used as to the revelation granted to Ezekiel, the three first having respect to what was presented from without, to assure him of its reality, the fourth to his being internally made fit to receive the revelation; "the heavens were opened" (so Mt 3:16; Ac 7:56; 10:11; Re 19:11); "he saw visions of God"; "the word of Jehovah came verily (as the meaning is rather than 'expressly, English Version, Eze 1:3) unto him" (it was no unreal hallucination); and "the hand of Jehovah was upon him" (Isa 8:11; Da 10:10, 18; Re 1:17; the Lord by His touch strengthening him for his high and arduous ministry, that he might be able to witness and report aright the revelations made to him).The time of Ezekiel's prophecy by the river Chebar, <span class="bld">Eze 1:1-3</span>. His vision of four cherubims, and four wheels, <span class="bld">Eze 1:4-25</span>, and of the glory of God above them, <span class="bld">Eze 1:26-28</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">Now</span>: this does not refer to any particular time before mentioned, though sometimes this English particle <span class="ital">now</span> connotes particular time, (the Hebrew is <span class="ital">and</span>, so the Greek and Latin,) but is a phrase in use on entering upon discourse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">It came to pass in the thirtieth year, </span> of the prophet's age, or from the finding the book of the law in the eighteenth year of Josiah, when the threats were read which now were executed on the Jews, according to <span class="bld">2Ki 22:16</span>, from which date to the fifth year of the captivity are thirty years; or in the thirtieth year of the Chaldean monarchy, founded by Nabopollassar. Other accounts omitted, you are left to your own thoughts which of these two latter are more probable; both have very weighty authority for them; and indeed they both concur and meet in the fifth year of the captivity, and so either computation may without mistake be followed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the fourth month; </span> the original hath only <span class="ital">in the fourth</span>, concisely, but it is certainly the month, but whether in account from Marchesvan, October with us, to Shebat, January, or from Nisan, March, unto Tamuz, July, is more questionable; the latter I guess to be the rightest account; so from Nisan, which is part of our March and April, to Tamuz, part of our June and July, will be the fourth month; and this account in church things best suits the prophet's design. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the fifth day of the month; </span> it was the third day of our July, probably it was the sabbath day, when the Jews would be free from labour, and at leisure to hear the prophet; and indeed such declarations of the will of God are an entertainment suitable to the consecration of the seventh day to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As I was among the captives; </span> Heb. <span class="ital">and I</span>, &c.

It was no meteor, chasm, or yawning, which is naturally a figured semblance of a breach in the visible heavens, whence appears a gulf or deep and wide pit to the eye. It was not thus, but a supernatural and extraordinary aperture or opening, wrought by the immediate power of God, who was now appearing to the prophet, and commissioning him.

Either from the last jubilee, as R. Joseph Kimchi (r), Jarchi, and Abendana; or from the time that the book of the law was found by Hilkiah the priest (s); so the Targum, which paraphrases the words thus, <p>"and it was in the thirtieth year after Hilkiah the high priest found the book of the law, in the house of the sanctuary, in the court under the porch, in the middle of the night, after the moon was down, in the days of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah;'' <p>or, according to Jerom (t), from the time of the prophet's birth, who was now thirty years of age, and was just entered into his priestly office; or rather it was the thirtieth year of Nabopolassar, or the father of Nebuchadnezzar: this was the twelfth year of the captivity, reckoning from the third of Jehoiakim, which was the first captivity, and from whence the seventy years are to be reckoned, and also the twelfth of Nebuchadnezzar's reign; and if two years are taken, as Vitringa (u) observes, from the twenty one years, which are given to Nabopolassar in Ptolemy's canon, in which Nebuchadnezzar his son reigned with him, there will be found thirty years from the beginning of Nabopolassar's reign to the fifth of Jeconiah's captivity, when Ezekiel began his prophecy, and which, as Bishop Usher (w), Mr. Bedford (x), Mr. Whiston (y), and the authors of the Universal History (z), place in the year 593, before the birth of Christ: <p>in the fourth month; the month Tammuz, as the Targum expresses it; which answers to part of June, and part of July: <p>in the fifth day of the month; which some take to be on a sabbath day; because, seven days after, the word of the Lord came to him again <a href="/ezekiel/3-16.htm">Ezekiel 3:16</a>; just as John was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>; between one of whose visions and this there is a very great likeness, as will be seen hereafter: <p>as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar; which is another agreement in circumstance between Ezekiel and John, when they had their visions: John was an exile in Patrons, and Ezekiel among the captives by the river Chebar in Chaldea. Some think this is the same river which is called by Ptolemy (a) Chaboras; and is said by him to pass through Mesopotamia: others say it was a river that was drawn off from the river Euphrates, by the order of one Cobaris, or Gobaris, a governor, from whence it had its name; that the river Euphrates might not, by its rapid course, hurt the city of Babylon; and by the Assyrians it was called Armalchar, or Narmalcha (b), the king's river; though it seems to be no other than Euphrates itself; and Kimchi observes, that in some copies of the Targum on this place it is interpreted of the river Euphrates; and he says their Rabbins of blessed memory say, that Chebar is Euphrates; and so Abarbinel; see <a href="/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>. Monsieur Thevenot (c) speaks of a river called Chabur, which is less than Alchabour, another mentioned by him; and has its source below Mosul, and on the left hand to those that go down the Tigris, and at Bagdad loses itself in the Tigris which he takes to be the same as here: <p>that the heavens were opened; as at our Lord's baptism, and at the stoning of Stephen; and so when John had his vision which corresponds with the following, a door was opened in heaven <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>; <p>and I saw the visions of God; which God showed unto him, and which were great and excellent; as excellent things are called things of God, as mountains of God, and cedars of God, <a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; and indeed he had a vision of a divine Person, in a human form; to which agrees the Targum, <p>"and I saw in the vision of prophecy, which abode on me, the vision of the glory of the majesty of the Lord.'' <p>The Arabic and Syriac versions read, "the vision of God". <p>(r) Apud R.

By reason of which he confirms his former prophecies, declaring by new visions and revelations shown to him, that the city would most certainly be destroyed, and the people grievously tormented by God's plagues, in so much that they who remained would be brought into cruel bondage. Lest the godly despair in these great troubles, he assures them that God will deliver his church at his appointed time and also destroy their enemies, who either afflicted them, or rejoiced in their miseries. The effect of the one and the other would be chiefly performed under Christ, of whom in this book are many notable promises, and in whom the glory of the new temple would perfectly be restored. He prophesied these things in Chaldea, at the same time that Jeremiah prophesied in Judah, and there began in the fifth year of Jehoiachin's captivity.<p>(a) After that the book of the Law as found, which was the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah, so that twenty-five years after this book was found, Jeconiah was led away captive with Ezekiel and many of the people, who the first year later saw these visions.<p>(b) Which was a part of Euphrates so called.<p>(c) That is, notable and excellent visions, so that it might be known, it was no natural dream but came from God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>FIRST DIVISION, CH. 1–24, PROPHECIES OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE KINGDOM<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>First Section.

If the verse stood alone the natural inference from the other dates would be that the year was the thirtieth of Jehoiachin’s captivity, as in other cases, or as it is put in two instances “our captivity” (<a href="/ezekiel/33-21.htm" title="And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is smitten.">Ezekiel 33:21</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/40-1.htm" title="In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was on me, and brought me thither.">Ezekiel 40:1</a>).

Against this, however, is (1) that the specification of circumstances and place in <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.">Ezekiel 1:1</a></span> is natural in an introductory statement, but not to be expected in any other. In point of fact it nowhere occurs after the introductory visions by which the prophet received his commission, except in references to these visions (<a href="/ezekiel/10-15.htm" title="And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.">Ezekiel 10:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-20.htm" title="This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubim.">Ezekiel 10:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-22.htm" title="And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.">Ezekiel 10:22</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/43-3.htm" title="And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.">Ezekiel 43:3</a>). And (2) the words “which was the fifth year” <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/1-2.htm" title="In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,">Ezekiel 1:2</a></span> evidently refer to some year already mentioned, which is now said to coincide with the fifth of Jehoiachin’s captivity. The two parts of the superscription are awkwardly connected, but neither of them can be wanted, though it is quite possible that they do not appear in their original form.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The thirtieth year might refer to some event or era from which Ezekiel reckoned. (1) As such an event the discovery of the Book of the Law and Josiah’s consequent reformation of worship (621 b.c.) already occurred to the Chaldee translator. Between this date and 592, the fifth year of Jehoiachin’s captivity there is a period of 29 years. There is, however, no other instance of such a kind of reckoning, nor any evidence that the discovery in Josiah’s eighteenth year was ever regarded as an era. (2) That the prophet should refer to a Babylonian era is quite possible, seeing he lived in Babylonia. But no such era has been discovered. The beginning of the reign of Nabopolassar, when Babylon became independent of Assyria, is usually dated in 625; and the fifth year of Jehoiachin’s captivity would be the thirty-third year of such an era. (3) It is possible that the prophet might refer to the year of his own age. The conjecture that Ezekiel, being a priest, would have entered upon office in his thirtieth year, and that his prophetic call coincided with this date, has little to support it, as the age at which priests might undertake office is nowhere fixed in the Law; and the reference to the year of the prophet’s age in <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.">Ezekiel 1:1</a></span> would be extremely unnatural. Neither is there much probability in the suggestion (Klostermann, <span class="ital">Stud. u.

In such a case reference to the thirtieth year of his age would certainly lose its strangeness, but such a history would be without example, as a prophet’s life always opens with his call.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the river of Chebar</span>] Not to be identified with the Chabor (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2 Kings 17:6</a>) which falls into the Euphrates at Circesium. More probably the Chebar was some stream much further south in Babylonia proper (<a href="/2_kings/24-15.htm" title="And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.">2 Kings 24:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-15.htm" title="Because you have said, The LORD has raised us up prophets in Babylon;">Jeremiah 29:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-20.htm" title="Hear you therefore the word of the LORD, all you of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:">Jeremiah 29:20</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">heavens were opened</span>] In his trance the prophet saw the heavens opened (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm" title="The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.">Ezekiel 1:3</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">visions of God</span>] Might be visions given by God, or visions in which God was seen. The expression is probably to be taken somewhat generally, as meaning heavenly or divine visions (<a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm" title="And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.">Ezekiel 8:3</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and.</span> The use of the conjunction indicates here, as in <a href="/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1</a>, that the narrative that follows links itself on to something that has gone before. In <a href="/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a> it may point to a connection with the book that precedes it. Here the sequence is subjective. We may think of Ezekiel as retracing the years of his life till he comes to the thirtieth. Then, as it were, he pulls himself up. That must be the starting point of what he has to say. Our English use of "now" is nearly equivalent to this. <span class="cmt_word">In the thirtieth year.</span> I incline, following Origen, Hengstenberg, Smend, and others, to refer the date to the prophet's own life. That year in Jewish reckoning was the age of full maturity. At that age the earlier Levites (<a href="/numbers/4-23.htm">Numbers 4:23, 20, 39, 43, 47</a>) had entered on their duties. It is probable, though no written rule is found, that it was the normal age for the functions of the priesthood. In the case of our Lord (<a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>) and of the Baptist it appears to have been recognized as the starting point of a prophet's work. Jeremiah's call as a "child" (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>; the word may, however, include adult manhood, as in <a href="/1_samuel/30-17.htm">1 Samuel 30:17</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>) was obviously exceptional. Other theories are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That the years are reckoned from the era of Nabopolassar, the father of Nebuchadnezzar ( <span class="date">B.C. 625</span>), dating from his throwing off the sovereignty of Assyria, and giving here the date  <span class="date">B.C. 595</span> (Michaelis, Rosenmuller, Ewald, and others); but against this it may be urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that there is no evidence that that era was in use in Ezekiel's time, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that he nowhere else uses a double historical chronology. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That the years are reckoned from the discovery of the book of the Law in the reign of Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/34-14.htm">2 Chronicles 34:14</a>), as a turning point or era in the history of Judah (Targum, Theodoret, Jerome, Havernick), which would again bring us to  <span class="date">B.C. 595</span>. This view is, however, open to the same objections as (1). We have no proof that the Jews ever reckoned from that event, and Ezekiel did not want, here or elsewhere, another point to reckon from, as far as his people's history was concerned, than the captivity of Jehoiachin. <span class="cmt_word">In the fourth month</span>. Both here and in ver. 2 the months are probably reckoned from Abib, or Nisan, the month of the Passover, with which the Jewish year began (<a href="/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-1.htm">Nehemiah 2:1</a>; <a href="/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a>), so that the fourth month, known by later Jews as Tammuz, would bring us to June or July. <span class="cmt_word">Among the captives</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the captivity</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>by the river of Chebar.</span> By most earlier commentators the Chebar has been identified with the Chaboras of the Greeks (now the <span class="accented">Khabour</span>), which rises in Upper Mesopotamia, at <span class="accented">Ras-el-Ain</span>, and falls into the Euphrates at Carcesium, a city which modern geographers distinguish from the Carchemish of the Old Testament. Recent critics, however (Rawlinson, Smend, and others), have urged that this was too far north to be in the "land of the Chaldeans" (ver. 3), or Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>), and have suggested that the Chebar of Ezekiel is the <span class="accented">Nahr-Malcha</span>, or Royal Canal of Nebuchadnezzar, the greatest of that king's irrigation works, to which, therefore, the name Chebar (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> uniting) would be appropriate. The identification of Chebar with the labor of <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>, to which the  ten tribes had been deported (whether, with Rawlinson, we think of that river as identical with the Chaboras, or still further north, near an affluent of the Tigris of the same name), must, for like reasons, be rejected. The two names are, indeed, spelt differently, with initial letters that do not interchange. <span class="cmt_word">The heavens were opened.</span> The phrase, not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, appears in <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>; <a href="/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Visions of God.</span> The words admit of three interpretations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Great, or wonderful, visions; as in the "mountains of God" (<a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>), the "cedars of God" (<a href="/psalms/80-10.htm">Psalm 80:10</a>), the "river of God" (<a href="/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> visions sent from God; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> actual theophanies or manifestations of the Divine glory, of these <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is most in harmony with what follows, here and elsewhere, on the phrase (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3</a>). Such a theophany constituted in his ease, as in that of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>), Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>), Zechariah (<a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-14</a>), his call to the office of a prophet. The visions may be thought of as manifested to his waking consciousness in an ecstatic state, and are thus distinguished from the dreams of sleep (comp. <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a> for the distinction between the two - "visions" belonging to the young, and "dreams" to the old). The visions of Balaam, seen in a "trance," but with his "eyes open" (<a href="/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3, 4</a>), and of St. Paul, "whether in the body or out of the body" he could not tell (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2, 3</a>), present suggestive parallels. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/lamentations/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The request that the judgment of wrath may be averted, and that the former gracious condition may be restored. <a href="/lamentations/5-17.htm">Lamentations 5:17</a> and <a href="/lamentations/5-18.htm">Lamentations 5:18</a> form the transition to the request in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/5-19.htm">Lamentations 5:19-22</a>. "Because of this" and "because of these [things]" refer mainly to what precedes, yet not in such a way as that the former must be referred to the fact that sin has been committed, and the latter to the suffering. The two halves of the verse are unmistakeably parallel; the sickening of the heart is essentially similar to the dimness coming on the eyes, the former indicating the sorrow of the soul, while the latter is the expression of this sorrow in tears. "Because of this (viz., because of the misery hitherto complained of) the heart has become sick," and the grief of the heart finds vent in tears, in consequence of which the eyes have become dim; cf. <a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>. But this sorrow culminates in the view taken of the desolation of Mount Zion, which receives consideration, not because of its splendid palaces (Thenius), but as the holy mountain on which the house of God stood, for "Zion" comprehended Moriah; see on <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/9-12.htm">Psalm 9:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/76-3.htm">Psalm 76:3</a>. The glory formerly attaching to Mount Zion (<a href="/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-2.htm">Psalm 50:2</a>) is departed; the mountain has been so much laid waste, that jackals roam on it. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; are not properly foxes, but jackals (as in <a href="/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>), which lodge among the ruins. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; is an intensive form, meaning to rove or roam about.</body></html>
