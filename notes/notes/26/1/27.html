The first thing observed was a throne. It is a throne of glory, a throne of grace, a throne of triumph, a throne of government, a throne of judgment. It is good news to men, that the throne above the firmament is filled with One who appears, even there, in the likeness of a man. The throne is surrounded with a rainbow, the well-known emblem of the covenant, representing God's mercy and covenanted love to his people. The fire of God's wrath was breaking out against Jerusalem, but bounds should be set to it; he would look upon the bow, and remember the covenant. All the prophet saw was only to prepare him for what he was to hear. When he fell on his face, he heard the voice of One that spake. God delights to teach the humble. Let sinners, then, humble themselves before him. And let believers think upon his glory, that they may be gradually changed into his image by the Spirit of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sapphire - Clear heavenly blue.<p>The appearance of a man - Deeply significant is the form of this manifestation. Here is no angel conveying God's message to man, but the glory of the Lord Himself. We recognize in this vision the prophetic annunciation of the Holy Incarnation. We are told little of the extent to which the human form was made evident to the prophet. For the vision was rather to the mind than to the bodily eye, and even inspired language was inadequate to convey to the hearer the glory which eye hath not seen or ear heard, and which only by special revelation it hath entered into the heart of man to conceive. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. colour of amber&#8212;"the glitter of chasmal" [Fairbairn].

And I saw the creatures, and, lo, there was a wheel upon the earth beside the creatures, towards their four fronts. <a href="/ezekiel/1-16.htm">Ezekiel 1:16</a>. The appearance of the wheels and their work was like the appearance of the chrysolite; and all four had one kind of figure: and their appearance and their work was as if one wheel were within the other. <a href="/ezekiel/1-17.htm">Ezekiel 1:17</a>. Towards their four sides they went when they moved: they turned not as they went. <a href="/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a>. And their felloes, they were high and terrible; and their felloes were full of eyes round about in all the four. <a href="/ezekiel/1-19.htm">Ezekiel 1:19</a>. And when the creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the creatures raised themselves up from the earth, the wheels also raised themselves. <a href="/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Ezekiel 1:20</a>. Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went in the direction in which the spirit was to go; and the wheels raised themselves beside them: for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels. <a href="/ezekiel/1-21.htm">Ezekiel 1:21</a>. When the former moved, the latter moved also; when the former stood, the latter stood; and when the former raised themselves from the ground, the wheels raised themselves beside them: for the spirit of the creatures was in the wheels. - The words, "and I saw the creatures," prepare the way for the transition to the new object which presented itself in these creatures to the eye of the seer. By the side of these creatures upon the ground he sees a wheel, and that at the four fronts, or front faces of the creatures. The singular suffix in &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; can neither be referred, with Rosenmller, to the chariot, which is not mentioned at all, nor, with Hitzig, to the preposition &#1488;&#1510;&#1500;, nor, with Hvernick, Maurer, and Kliefoth, to &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1503;, and so be understood as if every wheel looked towards four sides, because a second wheel was inserted in it at right angles. This meaning is not to be found in the words. The suffix refers ad sensum to &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (Ewald), or, to express it more correctly, to the figure of the cherubim with its four faces turned to the front, conceived as a unity - as one creature (&#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22</a>). Accordingly, we have so to represent the matter, that by the side of the four cherubim, namely, beside his front face, a wheel was to be seen upon the earth. Ezekiel then saw four wheels, one on each front of a cherub, and therefore immediately speaks in <a href="/ezekiel/1-16.htm">Ezekiel 1:16</a> of wheels (in the plural). In this verse &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is adspectus, and &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; "work;" i.e., both statements employing the term "construction," although in the first hemistich only the appearance, in the second only the construction, of the wheels is described. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is a chrysolite of the ancients, the topaz of the moderns, - a stone having the lustre of gold. The construction of the wheels was as if one wheel were within a wheel, i.e., as if in the wheel a second were inserted at right angles, so that without being turned it could go towards all the four sides. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1503;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a>, stands absolutely. "As regards their felloes," they possessed height and terribleness-the latter because they were full of eyes all round. Hitzig arbitrarily understands &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; of the upper sides; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, after the Arabic, of the under side, or that which lies towards the back. The movement of the wheels completely followed the movement of the creatures (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-19.htm">Ezekiel 1:19-21</a>), because the spirit of the creature was in the wheels. &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, in <a href="/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Ezekiel 1:20</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-21.htm">Ezekiel 1:21</a>, is not the "principle of life" (Hvernick), but the cherubic creatures conceived as a unity, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22</a>, where the meaning is undoubted. The sense is: the wheels were, in their motion and rest, completely bound by the movements and rest of the creatures, because the spirit which ruled in them was also in the wheels, and regulated their going, standing, and rising upwards. By the  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; the wheels are bound in one with the cherub-figures, but not by means of a chariot, to or upon which the cherubim were attached. </body></html>
