Imperfectly as this may be carried out here on earth, the effect of the Gospel is to bring about ever more and more fully its realisation; and the closing book of the volume of Revelation, catching the echoes of Ezekiel’s prophecy, looks forward to the Holy City, the New Jerusalem “coming down from God out of heaven,” and declares, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them and be their God” (<a href="/context/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2-3</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/48.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/48-35.htm" title="It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.">Ezekiel 48:35</a></span>. <span class="ital">The name of the city from that day shall be, The Lord is there</span> — It is very frequently said in Scripture, that a person or thing should be called by a certain name, when it was to be invested with qualities which might entitle it to that denomination. Thus Isaiah, foretelling the coming of the Messiah, says, <span class="ital">His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace, </span>because he was to possess the qualities which should serve as a foundation for all those titles. In like manner, <a href="/2_samuel/12-25.htm" title="And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.">2 Samuel 12:25</a>, it is said, that Solomon should be called <span class="ital">Jedidiah, </span>or, the <span class="ital">Beloved of the Lord; </span>and, <a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm" title="And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counsellors as at the beginning: afterward you shall be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.">Isaiah 1:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm" title="You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah: for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.">Isaiah 62:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-12.htm" title="And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and you shall be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.">Isaiah 62:12</a>, that Jerusalem should be called <span class="ital">The City of Righteousness, The Faithful City, Hephzibah, </span>or <span class="ital">the Lord’s Delight, Sought Out, A City not forsaken. </span>Not that it was to quit its ancient name, and assume all these; but it was to be crowned with the favours of heaven in such a manner as to draw upon itself all these honourable titles. Here the prophetic declaration, that <span class="ital">the name of the city </span>should be THE LORD IS THERE, might be intended to signify, 1st, That the captives, after their return, should have manifest tokens of God’s presence with them, and of his residence among them, both in his ordinances and in his providences; so that they should have no occasion to ask, as their fathers did, <span class="ital">Is the Lord among us or not? </span>for they should see and acknowledge that he was among them of a truth. And then, though their troubles should be many and threatening, they would be like the bush which burned, but was not consumed, because <span class="ital">the Lord was there. </span>More especially it was meant to signify, 2d, That the gospel church should have the presence of God in it; though not in the Shechinah, or cloud of glory, as of old, yet in a token no less sure, namely, that of the Holy Spirit in his gifts and graces. Where the gospel is faithfully preached, gospel ordinances duly administered, and God worshipped in the name of Jesus Christ only, it may be truly said, <span class="ital">The Lord is there; </span>for, <span class="ital">faithful is he that hath promised, </span>and will fulfil his word, <span class="ital">Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. </span>The Lord is in his church, to rule and govern it, to protect and defend it, and graciously to own, accept, and bless his sincere worshippers, and to show himself <span class="ital">nigh unto them in all that they call upon him for. </span>This should engage us to keep close to the communion of saints, and not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together; for where two or three are met in the name of Jesus, he is there. Nay, the Lord is present with and in every true and genuine Christian: God dwells in him, and he in God. It may be truly said of every one who has a living principle of grace in his soul, <span class="ital">The Lord is there. </span>And, as this is the chief privilege, glory, and happiness of the church militant, that the Lord is present with and in her; Song of Solomon , 3 d, It is the principal blessing of the church triumphant. That <span class="ital">the pure in heart shall </span>there <span class="ital">see God; shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads; </span>that <span class="ital">God himself, who sits on the throne, shall be with them, and dwell among them, </span>(<a href="/revelation/7-2.htm" title="And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,">Revelation 7:2</a>, and <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.">Revelation 21:3</a>,) is the crowning blessing of the heavenly city, and the consummation of the felicity of all its inhabitants. For in his presence is fulness of joy, and at his <span class="ital">right hand are pleasures for evermore. </span>Let us therefore give all diligence to secure to ourselves a place in that city, that we may <span class="ital">be for ever with the Lord.</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/48.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>48:1-35 Here is a description of the several portions of the land belonging to each tribe. In gospel times, behold all things are become new. Much is wrapped up in emblems and numbers. This method God has used to state mysterious truths in his word, not to be more clearly revealed till the proper time and season. But into the church of Christ, both in its state of warfare and triumph, there is free access by faith, from every side. Christ has opened the kingdom of heaven for all believers. Whoever will, may come, and take of the water of life, of the tree of life, freely. The Lord is there, in his church, to be nigh unto them in all they call upon him for. This is true of every real Christian; whatever soul has in it a living principle of grace, it may truly be said, The Lord is there. May we be found citizens of this holy city, and act agreeably to that character; and have the benefit of the Lord's presence with us, in life, in death, and for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The circuit of the city walls, a square of 4500 reeds, was 18,000 reeds, not quite 37 English miles. The circuit of Jerusalem in the time of Josephus was reckoned by him to be about four miles.<p>The name ... - The manner of expressing a spiritual meaning by giving a name to a city, a people, or the like, is familiar to the prophets (see <a href="/ezekiel/43-15.htm">Ezekiel 43:15</a> note). Jerome explains it: "The name of the city shall be no longer Jerusalem ("the vision of peace"), but Adonai-shama ("the Lord is there") (rather, Jehovah-shammah, "Jehovah is there"), because Yahweh will never again withdraw from it, as He once withdrew, but will hold it as His everlasting possession." The visible presence of God's glory, once represented in the tabernacle and in the temple, had departed, and should not return in the same form. Yet Ezekiel in "visions of God" sees a temple reconstructed to receive the glory of the divine presence, a prophetic vision fulfilled in Emmanuel ("God with us"), who tabernacled among men <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>.

Putting the numbers together which each side made, the circumference of the city was eighteen thousand measures; which, according to Cornelius a Lapide, were thirty two thousand miles; which shows that no city literally taken can be here meant, but mystically and spiritually the church of Christ, which will be of great extent in the latter day; and a large one it had need to be, to hold all nations that will flow into it; it will be spread all over the world; the world will become the church; the kingdoms of it will become Christ's; the little stone will become a great mountain, and fill the whole earth; the kingdom and interest of Christ, which is his church, will be from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth; even from the rising of the sun to the setting of the same. Some Jewish writers (a), not knowing what to make of these large measures, say that they have respect to the eighteen thousand worlds God is said (b) to make, which these were a similitude, figure, or exemplar of; but those Jews are nearer the true sense of them, who say (c) that this is to be understood of Jerusalem above, or as it will be in future time, in the world to come, the dispensation of the Messiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>, <p>and the name of the city from that day shall be, the Lord is there; the Gospel church has other names, as Jerusalem, Mount Zion, the Lord our righteousness, Hephzibah and Beulah, a city not forsaken, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>, but here it is called "Jehovah Shammah", the Lord is there, or dwells there; which is to be understood of his presence in it; not in a general way, as he is in all places, and with all his creatures, continually, constantly, and everywhere working in a providential manner; but of his gracious presence in a special way and manner: in this sense Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit, are in the Gospel church, and will be more manifestly in the latter day; Jehovah the Father, as the Father of Christ, blessing them with all spiritual blessings in him; granting them his presence in him, and communion with him, through him; as their Father providing all good things for them, and as the God of all grace unto them: Jehovah the Son, as the master of the family taking care of it, as a son in his own house, and the first born among his brethren; as the prophet in the midst of his church, teaching and instructing; as the high priest in the midst of the golden candlesticks, lighting and trimming them; as the King in Zion, to rule and govern, protect and defend it; showing himself in all the glories of his person, and the riches of his grace, according to his promise, <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>. Jehovah the Spirit is here to qualify men with gifts for the ministry, to apply the word, and make it useful; as a Spirit of grace and supplication, and to help the Lord's people in the exercise of grace, and discharge of duty; and to be their comforter and remembrancer. Jehovah here does and will display his glorious perfections; his power in the preservation of his saints; his wisdom in the guidance and direction of them; his truth and faithfulness in the performance of promises to them; his purity and holiness in the sanctification of them; his love, grace, and mercy, in the large discoveries made unto them; in short, he will appear all glorious to them, and will be the glory in the midst of them, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>, <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a> the date from whence this will commence is "that day"; either from the beginning of the Gospel dispensation, that famous day made by the rising of the sun of righteousness; or from the day and date of Christ's promise of his presence, <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a> or from the time the Gospel church state was set up; or from the day this city will be rebuilt and restored, the Lord will more visibly and manifestly grant his presence to the inhabitants of it, and never more depart from them; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-12.htm">Isaiah 42:12</a>, The Targum is, <p>"the name of the city which is separated from the day, the Lord will cause his Shechaniah to dwell there.'' <p>The Jews (d) produce this place to show that Jerusalem is called Jehovah, and say, do not read Shammah, "there", but Shemah, "its name"; and the Socinians from hence would disprove the incommunicableness of the name Jehovah to a creature, but without effect; since this city is not called simply Jehovah, but with an additional epithet; and this is to be understood, not in a divided, but compound sense, as the altar in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>, and the mount in <a href="/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>. <p>(a) Lipman.

The dress prescribed in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a> for the priests to wear during the holy service had this signification. The same rule is here presupposed as still in force; and it is simply renewed and partially emphasized by the enumeration of some of the leading points. At the service at the altar and in the holy place the priests are to wear linen clothes, and, after the performance of the service, they are to take them off again when they go into the outer court (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17-19</a>). In the Mosaic law, &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, white byssus, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;, white linen, is mentioned as the material used for the priests' clothing (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>, <a href="/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>); here the material is more distinctly designated as &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, flax linen; and &#1510;&#1502;&#1512;, animal wool, is expressly forbidden, the motive being assigned for this regulation, namely, that the priest is not to cause himself to sweat by wearing woollen clothing. Sweat produces uncleanness; and the priest, by keeping his body clean, is to show even outwardly that he is clean and blameless. With regard to the putting on and off of the official clothes, the new thorah accords with the Mosaic. For we cannot agree with Kliefoth, who detects a deviation in the fact that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>, the priests were to wear the official clothes only when they entered the tabernacle and when approaching the altar, and, according to <a href="/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm">Leviticus 16:23</a>, were to take them off when the service was ended; whereas, according to <a href="/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a> of the chapter before us, they were to put them on as soon as they entered the inner court, and were never to come before the people in the official costume. If, according to the Mosaic law, the priests were to go before the altar of burnt-offering in the court in their holy official dress, and not otherwise, they must have put on this dress on entering the court; for they could not wait till they were in front of the altar before they changed their clothes. For the expression &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; does not imply that, according to Ezekiel, they were never to appear in the presence of the people in their official costume, as it does not mean "come before the people," but "go out to the people," or "walk among the people;" nor is this involved in the words '&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; , they shall not sanctify the people in their clothes (by their clothes). The latter by no means affirms that they are to sanctify the people by intercourse with them, but are not to do this in official costume; the meaning is simply that they are not to move among the people in the outer court while wearing their official clothes, that they may not sanctify them by their holy clothes.<p>This sanctification cannot be understood in any other way than as analogous to the rule laid down in the law, that touching most holy sacrificial flesh would sanctify (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>, <a href="/leviticus/6-20.htm">Leviticus 6:20</a>), which Ezekiel repeats in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>, and which does not stand in anything like an isolated position in the law, but is also affirmed in <a href="/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a> and <a href="/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a> of the altar of burnt-offering and the vessels of the sanctuary. The same thing which applied to these vessels - namely, that their holiness passed from them to any one who touched them - is here predicated of the holy dresses of the priests; and the moving of the priests among the people in their holy clothes is forbidden, because such holiness, acquired by contact with holy objects, imposed upon the person to whom it had passed the obligation to guard against all defilement (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-8</a>), which the people could not avoid in the ordinary relations of life, and thus a weakening or abolition of the distinction between things holy and common would inevitably have ensued. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; are the holy cell-buildings described in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-14</a>. - To the clothing there is simply appended in <a href="/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20</a> the direction concerning the hair of the head, the natural covering of the head, in relation to which excess on either side is prohibited, either shaving the head bald or wearing the hair uncut. Both of these were forbidden to the priests in the law: shaving in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>, and letting the hair grow freely in <a href="/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>; and the latter was simply imposed upon the Nazarites for the period of their vow (<a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1501; only occurs here; but its meaning, to cut the hair, is obvious from the context. - <a href="/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>. The prohibition of the drinking of wine when performing service agrees with <a href="/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>; on the other hand, the instructions concerning the choice of wives are sharpened in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-22.htm">Ezekiel 44:22</a>, as that which only applied to the high priest in the law is here extended to all the priests. In fact, Ezekiel throughout makes no distinction between the high priest and the common priests. In <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-14.htm">Leviticus 21:14</a>, marrying a widow is only forbidden to the high priest, who was to marry a virgin of his own people, whereas no such restriction is laid down for the ordinary priests. Here, on the other hand, marrying a widow is forbidden to all the priests, marriage with the widow of a priest being the only one allowed. &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; belongs to &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, who has become the widow of a priest.<p>(Note: The Rabbins (Targ. Talm. and Masor. according to their accentuation) have endeavoured to obliterate this distinction, by applying the first hemistich to the high priest alone, and explaining the second thus: "The widow, who is really a widow, the priest may take," interpreting &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; by quidam sacerdotum, or aliqui ex ordine sacerdotali, or ceteri sacerdotes. But this is contrary to the usage of the language, as &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; cannot possibly be understood in a partitive sense in this passage, where the priests generally are spoken of, and the plural &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; follows.)<p>In <a href="/ezekiel/44-23.htm">Ezekiel 44:23</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/44-24.htm">Ezekiel 44:24</a> the general official duties of the priests are mentioned, viz., to teach the people, and to instruct them concerning the difference between the holy and the unholy, the clean and the unclean, as in <a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Ezekiel 22:26</a>); also to administer justice in questions in dispute according to the rights of God-a duty which had already been committed to the priests in its highest form in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-17.htm">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>. &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, concerning, in the case of, matters in dispute. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; , to stand to judge, i.e., to appear or act as judge (compare &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, to appoint or institute judges, in <a href="/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">2 Chronicles 19:5</a>). The Keri &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; is a needless emendation after <a href="/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>. The Chetib &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, on the other hand, is a copyist's error for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;. Lastly, at all the feasts they are to observe the laws and statutes of Jehovah, that is to say, to perform all the priestly duties binding upon them at the feasts, and to sanctify the Sabbaths, not merely by offering the Sabbath sacrifices, but also by maintaining the Sabbath rest (cf. <a href="/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3</a>). - In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Ezekiel 44:25-27</a> there follow regulations concerning defilement from the dead, and its removal. <a href="/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Ezekiel 44:25</a> is a simple repetition of <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-3</a>. But the instructions concerning the purification from defilement from the dead are sharpened, inasmuch as not only is the purification prescribed by the law (<a href="/numbers/19-1.htm">Numbers 19:1</a>.), and which lasted seven days, required (this is meant by &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493;), but a further period of seven days is appointed after these, at the expiration of which the presentation of a sin-offering is demanded before the service in the sanctuary can be resumed. By this demand for a heightened purification, the approach to a corpse permitted to the priests, which was prohibited to the high priest in the Mosaic law, even in the case of father and mother (<a href="/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a>), is tolerably equalized.<p>For these duties and obligations of service the priests are to receive corresponding emoluments. These are treated of in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28-31</a>. They are not, indeed, to receive any share of the land as their property in time to come any more than in former times; but in the place of this Jehovah will be their property and possession, and give them the necessary room for their dwellings from His own property in the land (<a href="/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>), and let them draw their maintenance from His altar (<a href="/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>). The promise that Jehovah will be the &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; of the priests is a simple repetition of the regulation in the law (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>). So far as the construction in <a href="/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a> is concerned, the words &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1501; are really the subject to '&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1500;&#1503;, which we are obliged to render obliquely, "the inheritance for them shall be, I am their inheritance." For the proposal of Hitzig to take the words from &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1501; to the close of the verse as a parenthesis, and to regard '&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; in <a href="/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> as the subject to '&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, is untenable, not only on account of the great harshness which such a parenthesis would involve, but principally because these portions of the sacrifices and heave-offerings which belonged to the priest were not a &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, and are never designated as &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, inheritance, i.e., property in land. <a href="/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a> treats of the property in land, which God assigned to the Levites and priests under the Mosaic economy, by appointing them towns to dwell in, with meadows for the feeding of their cattle, within the territory of the other tribes, but would assign to them in future from the heave-offering set apart from the land for the sanctuary (<a href="/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>). It is not till <a href="/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a> that the means of support for the priests are spoken of. They are to be supported from the sacrifices and the tithes and first-fruits which Israel has to pay to Jehovah as the lord of the land, and which He transfers to His servants the priests. For the priests' share of the meat-offering, sin-offering, and trespass-offering, see <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>, <a href="/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6-7</a>; for that which is put under the ban, <a href="/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>; for the first-fruits, <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-26.htm">Exodus 34:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>; for the &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>; for the &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-20.htm">Numbers 15:20-21</a>. In '&#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;, "to cause a blessing to rest upon thy house," the individual Israelite is addressed. For the fact itself, see <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>. - To the enumeration of the means of support there is appended in <a href="/ezekiel/44-31.htm">Ezekiel 44:31</a> an emphatic repetition of the command in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/22-8.htm">Leviticus 22:8</a>, not to eat of any dead thing (i.e., anything that has died a natural death), or anything torn to pieces, either of birds or beasts, on account of its defiling (<a href="/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>). </body></html>
