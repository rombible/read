Beginning at the north, a portion is assigned to each of seven tribes (<a href="/context/ezekiel/48-1.htm" title="Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goes to Hamath, Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for Dan.">Ezekiel 48:1-7</a>); then the “oblation” is described, with its parts for the Levites, the priests and Temple, the city and those that serve it, and for the prince (<a href="/context/ezekiel/48-8.htm" title="And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>), and lastly portions for the remaining five tribes. The chapter and the book close with an account of the size and the twelve gates of the city, the whole ending with its name, “The Lord is there.”<p>The distribution of the land is entirely different from that made under Joshua, nor is it easy to trace any historical reasons for it, except that the central portion, containing the Temple, the land of the priests and the prince, is flanked by the two tribes of the southern kingdom, Judah and Benjamin. The chapter can best be understood by the aid of a small map, the outline of which is traced from Dr. Wm. Smith’s ancient atlas. This might be drawn with the lines between the tribes perpendicular either to the general course of the Jordan, or to the general coast-line of the Mediterranean. The latter would give a little more width for the oblation, but still not enough, and would leave no space at all on the west for the prince. The former arrangement is on the whole preferred. It will be seen that the tribes are not arranged either according to their seniority or their maternity. The territory falling to each tribe was much smaller than of old, partly because of the large space occupied by the “oblation” (fully one-fifth of the whole), and partly because the remainder was to be divided among the whole twelve tribes, instead of among only nine and a half. The portion thus given to each tribe was rather less than two-thirds that assigned, on the average, by Joshua.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">These are his sides east and west.</span>—<span class= "ital">Lit., The east side, the west side, shall be to him,</span> meaning that the portion of Dan stretches across the country from the eastern to the western boundary. So of them all. The original portion of Dan was at the west of Benjamin, but a part of the tribe having conquered Laish, and settled at the extreme north, Dan is now made the most northern of the tribes. Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, and Ephraim are so far approximated to their old places as to be north of the sanctuary.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">In length as one of the other parts.—</span>The oblation, which has been already spoken of in <a href="/context/ezekiel/45-1.htm" title="Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an oblation to the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.">Ezekiel 45:1-7</a> in a different connection, is here (<a href="/context/ezekiel/48-8.htm" title="And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>) more exactly described. Its whole width is again stated as 25,000 reeds, and its length from the eastern to the western boundaries of the laud “as one of the other parts,” no account being taken in this of the varying distance between the Jordan and the Mediterranean. It cannot, however, be so placed as not to exceed that distance.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">The oblation.—</span>This is the same word as is translated <span class= "ital">offering</span> in <a href="/ezekiel/48-8.htm" title="And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.">Ezekiel 48:8</a>. It is used in this passage in three different senses:—(1) as including the whole strip from the Jordan to the Mediterranean and 25,000 reeds wide; (2) for that part of this set aside for the priests, and for the Levites; (3) for the most sacred part of this, appropriated to the priests and Temple, 25,000 reeds from east to west, and 10,000 from north to south. This last portion, although in the middle, is mentioned first on account of its especial sacredness.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">In the midst thereof.—</span>The whole connection shows that this is <span class= "ital">to</span> be understood strictly; the sanctuary was to be not merely within the priests’ portion, but in its centre.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Sons of Zadok.—</span>See Note on <a href="/ezekiel/40-46.htm" title="And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister to him.">Ezekiel 40:46</a>.<p><span class= "bld">As the Levites went astray</span>.—That the Levites were far more affected than the priests by the general apostasy, may be reasonably inferred from the fact that at the restoration less than 400 Levites, and as many Nethinims, returned (<a href="/context/ezra/2-40.htm" title="The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of Hodaviah, seventy and four.">Ezra 2:40-58</a>; <a href="/context/nehemiah/7-43.htm" title="The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the children of Hodevah, seventy and four.">Nehemiah 7:43-60</a>), while there were 4,289 of the priests.<p>MAP OF PALESTINE,<p>Showing the Divisions among the Tribes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/48.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ezekiel/48-1.htm" title="Now these are the names of the tribes.

In gospel times, behold all things are become new. Much is wrapped up in emblems and numbers. This method God has used to state mysterious truths in his word, not to be more clearly revealed till the proper time and season. But into the church of Christ, both in its state of warfare and triumph, there is free access by faith, from every side. Christ has opened the kingdom of heaven for all believers. Whoever will, may come, and take of the water of life, of the tree of life, freely. The Lord is there, in his church, to be nigh unto them in all they call upon him for. This is true of every real Christian; whatever soul has in it a living principle of grace, it may truly be said, The Lord is there. May we be found citizens of this holy city, and act agreeably to that character; and have the benefit of the Lord's presence with us, in life, in death, and for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The distribution of the holy land is seen in detail throughout <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>. The order of the original occupation by the tribes under Joshua is partly, but only partly, followed. It is a new order of things - and its ideal character is evinced as elsewhere, by exact and equal measurements. From north to south seven tribes succeed each other. Then comes a portion, separated as an offering to the Lord, subdivided into:<p>(1) a northern portion for the Levites,<p>(2) a central portion for the priests and the temple,<p>(3) a southern portion for the city and those who serve it.<p>These three form a square, which does not occupy the whole breadth of the land, but is flanked on either side, east and west, by portions assigned to the prince. Then follow, south of the city, five portions for the five remaining tribes - similar to those assigned to the seven. Thus the Levites, the temple, and city, are guarded by Judah and Benjamin, the two tribes who had throughout preserved their allegiance to the true sovereignty of Yahweh, and thus the plan expresses the presence of Yahweh among His people, summed up in the name of the city, with which Ezekiel's prophecy closes, the Lord is there.<p>The breadth of the portions is not given, but since the exact breadth of the oblation was about 30 geog. miles (<a href="/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a> note), and seven tribes were between the entrance of Hamath and the oblation, the "breadth of one portion" was about 17 geog. miles. The breadth of the Levites' portion and of the priests' portion was in each case about 15 geog. miles. Ain-el-Weibeh, if Kadesh, ( (?),see <a href="/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>) would be very nearly the southern border.<p>The general lines of existing features are followed with considerable fidelity, but accommodation is made to give the required symbolic expression. "Dan" had originally an allotment west of Benjamin, but having colonized and given its name to Laish in the north, was regarded as the most northern occupant of Canaan <a href="/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>. "Zebulun and Issachar" are removed to the south to make room for the second half of "Manasseh" brought over from the east of Jordan. "Reuben," brought over from the east, is placed between "Ephraim and Judah." "Benjamin" comes immediately south of the city, and "Gad" is brought over from the east to the extreme south.<p>See map, The Land of Israel <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 48<p>Eze 48:1-35. Allotment of the Land to the Several Tribes.<p>1. Dan&#8212;The lands are divided into portions of ideal exactness, running alongside of each other, the whole breadth from west to east, standing in a common relation to the temple in the center: seven tribes' portions on the north, five in the smaller division in the south. The portions of the city, the temple, the prince, and the priesthood, are in the middle, not within the boundaries of any tribe, all alike having a common interest in them. Judah has the place of honor next the center on the north, Benjamin the corresponding place of honor next the center on the south; because of the adherence of these two to the temple ordinances and to the house of David for so long, when the others deserted them. Dan, on the contrary, so long locally and morally semi-heathen (Jud 18:1-31), is to have the least honorable place, at the extreme north. For the same reason, St. John (Re 7:5-8) omits Dan altogether.The portions of the twelve tribes, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/ezekiel/48-1.htm" title="Now these are the names of the tribes.

The portion should then, as to situation, be one lying <span class="cmt_word">northwards, to the coast of</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">beside</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Hamath.</span> That is to say, beginning with the border of Hamath, it should extend southwards. <span class="cmt_word">For these are his sides, east and west</span> should be, And <span class="accented">there shall be to him sides east</span>, <span class="accented">west</span>, meaning "the tract between both eastern and western boundaries," rather than as Hitzig translates, "And there shall be to him the east side of the sea," signifying that his territory should embrace the land east of the Mediterranean;" or as Hengstenberg renders, And they shall be to him the east side the sea," equal to "the tract in question should have the sea for its east border." Then, as this applies equally to all the tribe-portions, Hengstenberg regards "to him" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>) as pointing to "the whole of the tribes combined into an ideal unity," but expositors generally agree that "to him" should be referred to Dan, whom the prophet had in mind and was about to mention. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> portion for <span class="cmt_word">Dan</span> should be <span class="accented">Dan one</span> "portion," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> (<a href="/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>), rather than "tribe," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>, as Smend proposes. To take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> as alluding to the enumeration of the tribes is indeed countenanced by Ezekiel's mode of numbering the gates (vers. 30-35); but Ezekiel's style in vers. 30-35 will be preserved here also if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> precede "Judah," thus: "the portion of Danone." "The presupposition that one tribe should receive exactly as much as another led to the individual tribe's portion being considered as a <span class="accented">mona</span>s" (Kliefoth). In the first division of the land, Dan's portion was small, and situated west of the territories of Ephraim and Benjamin. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/43.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Entrance of the Glory of the Lord into the New Temple<p><a href="/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1</a>.

And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate, the direction of which is toward the east. <a href="/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>.

And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I shall dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel for ever; and the house of Israel will no more defile my holy name, they and their kings, through their whoredom and through the corpses of their kings, their high places, <a href="/ezekiel/43-8.htm">Ezekiel 43:8</a>.

And when they are ashamed of all that they have done, show them the picture of the house and its arrangement, and its goings out and in, and all its forms and all its statutes, and all its forms and all its laws; and write it before their eyes, that they may keep all its form and all its statutes and do them. <a href="/ezekiel/43-12.htm">Ezekiel 43:12</a>. This is the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain all its territory round about is most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. - The angel had shown the prophet the new sanctuary as already completed, and had measured it in his presence according to its several parts. But this building only became the house of God when Jehovah as the God of Israel consecrated it, to be the dwelling-place of His divine and gracious presence in the midst of His people, by the entrance of His divine glory into the house.<p>(Note: "The Lord appears, and fills the house with His own glory; showing that the house will not only be built, but will be filled with the power of God" (Theodoret).)<p>The description of the new temple closes, therefore, with this act of consecration. That the prophet might see this act of divine grace with his own eyes, the measuring man led him from the ground surrounding the temple (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-15.htm">Ezekiel 42:15-20</a>) back again to the east gate (<a href="/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1</a>). The allusion is to the eastern gate of the outer court; for it is not till <a href="/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a> that Ezekiel is taken into the inner court, and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>, he was brought back to the east gate of the outer court. Standing in front of this gate, he sees the glory of the God of Israel come by the way from the east with a great noise, and lighting up the earth with its splendour. The coming of the theophany from the east points back to <a href="/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>, where the Shechinah, when leaving the ancient temple, went out at the east gate and ascended to the summit of the mountain, which was situated on the east of Jerusalem. It was from the east, therefore, that it returned to enter the new temple. This fact is sufficient of itself to show that the present entrance of the divine glory into the new temple did not lay the foundation for a new and more exalted bond of grace, but was simply intended to restore the relation which had existed before the removal of Israel into captivity. The tabernacle and Solomon's temple had both been consecrated by Jehovah in the same manner as the seat of His throne of grace in Israel (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>; and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13-14</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1-3</a>, from which the expression &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; in <a href="/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a> has been borrowed). It is true that Hvernick, Kliefoth, and others find, along with this agreement, a difference in the fact that the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud in both the tabernacle and Solomon's temple; whereas here, on the contrary, it appeared in that peculiar form which Ezekiel had already repeatedly seen. But it does not follow that there was really a difference, because the cloud is not mentioned in the verses before us; for it is evident that the cloud was not wanting, even in the manifestation of the glory of God seen by Ezekiel, from the words found in <a href="/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3</a> : "The cloud filled the inner court, and the glory of Jehovah had risen up from the cherubim to the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the splendour of the glory of Jehovah." If, therefore, it is expressly attested in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3</a>, as even Kliefoth admits, that the appearance of God which entered the temple as like the appearance which Ezekiel saw by the Chaboras and before the destruction of the temple, and in connection with the last-mentioned appearance the cloud was visible along with the brilliant splendour of the divine doxa, the cloud will certainly not have been wanting when it entered the new temple; and the only reason why it is not expressly mentioned must be, that it did not present a contrast to the brilliant splendour, or tend to obscure the light of the glory of God, but as a shining cloud was simply the atmospheric clothing of the theophany.<p>If, then, the cloud did not present a contrast to the brilliancy of the divine glory, it cannot be inferred from the words, "and the earth shone with His glory," that there was any difference between this and the earlier manifestations of the divine glory at the consecration of the tabernacle and Solomon's temple; more especially as these words to not affirm that it became light on earth, but simply that the earth shone with the glory God, - that is to say, that it threw a bright light upon the earth as it passed along, - so that this remark simply serves to indicate the intensity of the brightness of this theophany. The words '&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493; &#1499;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;  are not to be understood, as we may learn from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>, as referring to a voice of the coming God, but describe the loud noise made by the moving of the theophany on account of the rustling of the wings of the cherubim. This resembled the roaring of mighty waves. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3</a>, the expression &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; ...&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;  is somewhat heavy in style, but is correct Hebrew; and the remark with which Hitzig seeks to justify his alteration of &#1493;&#1499;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; into &#1493;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, - namely, that &#1499;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; "would signify 'so the appearance,' whereas Ezekiel intends to explain the present appearance from the well-known earlier one," - is false so far as the usage of the language is concerned. When the Hebrew uses two &#1499;&#1468; in cases of comparison, which we are accustomed to express in German by so...wie (so...as), he always commences with the thing to which he compares another, and lets the thing which is to be compared follow afterwards. Thus, for example, in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>, &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;  does not affirm that it happens as to the righteous so to the wicked, but vice vers&#1490;, that it happens to the righteous as to the wicked; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/44-18.htm">Genesis 44:18</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498;  does not mean, for like thee so is Pharaoh, but "for thou art like Pharaoh." According to this genuine Hebrew expression, the present appearance of the divine glory is mentioned first in the verse before us, and then in the earlier one which the present resembled. And even the apparent pleonasm &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; vanishes if we render &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; by "look," - the look of the apparition which I saw was just like the apparition, etc. '&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; refers to the ecstatic transportation of the prophet to Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8.htm">Ezekiel 8-11</a>), to witness the destruction of the city (see more particularly <a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/9-1.htm">Ezekiel 9:1</a>.). "The prophet destroyed the city ideally by his prophecy, of which the fulfilment simply forms the objective reverse side" (Hitzig). &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is appended in loose apposition, - there were appearances, visions, - and the plural is to be taken as in &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>. For what follows, compare <a href="/ezekiel/3-23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-15.htm">Ezekiel 10:15</a>. For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>, compare <a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>.<p>In <a href="/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a> the question arises, who it is who is speaking to the prophet; whether it is Jehovah, who has entered the temple, or the man who is standing by Ezekiel in the inner court? There can be no doubt that &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is Jehovah here, as in <a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>; though the commentators are divided in opinion whether Jehovah spoke directly to the prophet, or through the medium of the man who stood by his side. Hvernick presses the Hithpael &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, and imagines that Ezekiel heard God conversing within the sanctuary, in consequence of which the angel stood by his side; so that the words of God consisted chiefly in the command to communicate to Ezekiel the divine revelation which follows in <a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>. But this view is proved to be erroneous by the expression &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; which follows &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, and which Hvernick has overlooked. Kliefoth, on the other hand, is of opinion that the words contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>, which proceeded from the &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, were addressed to the prophet directly by God Himself; for he heard them before anything was said by the man, and neither here nor in what follows is the man said to have spoken. On the contrary, both here and in what follows, even in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>,<a href="/ezekiel/46-24.htm">Ezekiel 46:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6-7</a>, it is always God Himself who appears as the speaker, and the man simply as the prophet's guide. But this is also not correct. Such passages as <a href="/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/46-24.htm">Ezekiel 46:24</a> compared with <a href="/ezekiel/43-19.htm">Ezekiel 43:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-21.htm">Ezekiel 43:21</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8</a>, compared with <a href="/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>, show undeniably that the man who conducted the prophet also talked with him. Consequently, in the case referred to in the verse before us, we must also conclude that he who spoke to the prophet from the temple addressed him through the medium of the man who stood by his side, and that &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is the subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>; from which, however, it by no means follows that the &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; was also an angel, who spoke to the prophet, not from the most holy place, but simply from within the house, as Hitzig explains the matter. The meaning is rather, that Ezekiel heard God conversing with him from the sanctuary, whilst a man, i.e., an angel, stood by his side and spoke to him as follows. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is in that case not some angel merely who spoke in the name of Jehovah, but the angel of Jehovah, God's own speaker, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>.). But according to his outward habitus, this angel of the Lord, who is designated as &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, is identical with the angel who showed the prophet the temple, and measured it (<a href="/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a> onwards). For according to <a href="/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>. this &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; had also a measuring rod, and measured. The absence of the article from &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6</a>, which prevents Kliefoth from admitting this identity, does not indicate decidedly that a different man from the one mentioned before is introduced here as the prophet's attendant, but simply leaves the identity of this &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; with the former indefinite, so that it can only be inferred from the further course of events; because the point of importance here was neither to establish this identity by employing the article, nor to define the medium of the word of God more precisely, but simply to introduce the words which follow as the words of God Himself. The address commences with an explanation on the part of God that the temple into which the glory of the Lord had entered was the place of His throne, where He would dwell for ever among the sons of Israel. The &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; is a concise expression, in which &#1488;&#1514; is nota accus., and we have to supply in thought either &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; or &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;: "behold the place." &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;, the place of the soles of my feet (cf. <a href="/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>), is equivalent to the footstool of my feet in <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>. The ark of the covenant is called the footstool of God in <a href="/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a> and <a href="/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>; compare <a href="/psalms/99-5.htm">Psalm 99:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>, where this epithet may possibly be used to designate the temple. This also applies to the throne of Jehovah, since God was enthroned above the cherubim of the ark in the holy of holies (cf. <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>, etc.). In the sanctuary which Ezekiel saw, no reference is made to the ark of the covenant, and the silence with regard to this is hardly to be regarded as a mere omission to mention it, inasmuch as none of the things contained in the temple are mentioned with the exception of the altars, not even the table of shew-bread or the candlestick. The ark of the covenant is not mentioned, because, as is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Jeremiah 3:16</a>, in the Messianic times the ark of the covenant will not be remembered, neither will it be missed.<p>&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/37-28.htm">Ezekiel 37:28</a>. The promise culminates in this. &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; does not apply either to the tabernacle or to Solomon's temple, in which Jehovah also had His dwelling-place, though not for ever. These sanctuaries He left, and gave them up to destruction, because the Israelites had profaned His holy name by their idolatry. This will not take place any more after the erection of the new sanctuary. &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is not imperative, but a simple future: "they will no more defiled," because they come to a knowledge of their sins through the punitive judgment of exile, so that they become ashamed of them, and because the Lord will have poured out His Spirit upon them (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/37-23.htm">Ezekiel 37:23</a>., <a href="/ezekiel/39-29.htm">Ezekiel 39:29</a>). - Formerly, however (<a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>), they profaned the holy name of God by their spiritual whoredom (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>) and by dead idols, for which they erected high places in the immediate neighbourhood of the dwelling-place of Jehovah, that is to say, even in the temple courts, so that Jehovah was only separated from the idols by a wall. This is the general meaning of <a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-8.htm">Ezekiel 43:8</a>, in which the exposition of &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497;  is difficulty. Rosenm&#1516;ller, H&#1492;vernick, and others understand by the "corpses of their kings," the dead idols. Ewald, Hitzig, and Kliefoth, on the other hand, take the expression in a literal sense, as referring to the corpses of kings which had been buried near to the temple, so that the temple had been defiled by the proximity of these graves. But the latter view is precluded by the fact that not a single instance can be adduced of the burial of a king in the vicinity of the temple, since <a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a> contains no allusion to anything of the kind, and the tombs of the kings upon Zion were not so near to the temple that it could possibly be defiled in consequence. Moreover, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; cannot be reconciled with this view; and for that reason Ewald and Hitzig propose to read &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, "in their death." The attempt of Kliefoth, however, to defend the reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, by taking it as in apposition to &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; and not to &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, is a desperate remedy, which clearly shows the impossibility of connecting &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; with the "corpses of the kings." We therefore understand by &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497; the dead idols, in accordance with <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a> (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>); but by &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; we understand, not the idols, but the Israelitish kings, as in the case of the preceding &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;; partly because it cannot be shown that the plural &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; is ever used in the sense of idols (though the singular &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; is used of Baal in <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a> and <a href="/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>), and partly on account of the harshness involved in interpreting the two &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; when standing so close together, in the first instance of the kings, and in the second of the idols of Israel. The corpses of the kings are therefore the dead idols, for which the kings (for example, Manasseh) had built altars or high places (&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;) in the sanctuary, i.e., in the courts of the temple (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4-7</a>). The objection that &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; without anything further, such, for instance, as &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; sa ,ecnatsni rof ,hcus in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>, cannot signify the dead idols, will not bear examination, as the more precise definition which is wanting is supplied by the context, where idolatry is the point in question. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; without the preposition &#1489; is a loosely attached apposition to &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501;, which defines more precisely in what way the whoredom of the nation and the dead idols of the kings had amounted to a defiling of the house of the Lord, namely, from the fact that the people and the kings had erected temples of high places (ba&#770;moth) for dead idols by the side of the temple of the living God, and had placed them so close that the threshold and door-posts of these idol-temples touched the threshold and door-posts of the temple of Jehovah, and there was nothing but the wall of the temple (&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512;) between Jehovah and the carcase-gods. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; is explained in this way in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-8.htm">Ezekiel 43:8</a>, and then the defiling of the holy name of the Lord is mentioned again for the purpose of appending, by means of &#1493;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; (imperf. Piel of &#1499;&#1500;&#1492;), the allusion to the penal judgment which they had thereby brought upon themselves. <a href="/ezekiel/43-9.htm">Ezekiel 43:9</a>. Such profanation as this will not take place any more in time to come, and Jehovah will dwell for ever in the midst of Israel.<p>To lead Israel to this goal, Ezekiel is to show them the house (i.e., the temple). In this way are the further words of God in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10-12</a> attached to what goes before. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, show or make known the house, is equivalent to proclaim to the people the revelation concerning the new temple. In this were the Israelites to discern the magnitude of the grace of God, that they might blush at their evil deeds, and measure the well-measured building (&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12</a>), i.e., carefully consider and ponder what the Lord had bestowed upon His people through this sanctuary, so that they might suffer themselves to be brought to repentance by means of its glory. And if they felt shame and repentance on account of their transgressions, Ezekiel was to show them the shape and arrangement of the sanctuary, with all its forms and ordinances, an write them out before their eyes, that they might have the picture of it impressed upon their minds, and keep the statutes thereof. In <a href="/ezekiel/43-11.htm">Ezekiel 43:11</a> the words are crowded together, to indicate that all the several parts and arrangements of the new temple are significant and worthy of being pondered and laid to heart. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; is the shape of the temple generally, its external form; &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, the internal arrangement as a whole. Both of these are noticed specifically by the allusion to the goings out and in, as well as to the forms (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;) of the separate parts, and their statutes and laws. &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; are the precepts concerning the things to be observed by Israel when appearing before the Lord in the temple, the regulations for divine worship. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, the instructions contained in these statutes for sanctification of life. The second &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; is omitted in the lxx and some of the Hebrew Codd., and has therefore been expunged as a gloss by Dathe, Hitzig, and other critics; but it is undoubtedly genuine, and in conformity with the intentional crowding together of words. - The admonition to keep and to observe everything carefully is closed in <a href="/ezekiel/43-12.htm">Ezekiel 43:12</a> with a statement of the fundamental law of the temple; that upon the lofty mountain the whole of its domain round about is to be most holy. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1492;&#1512; does not belong to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; ot g in the sense of the house which is to be built upon the top of the mountain, but to the contents of the thora&#770;h of this house. It is to stand upon the top of the mountain, and to be most holy in all its domain. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1492;&#1512; is to be understood in accordance with <a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493; points back to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;. Both by its situation upon a very high mountain, and also by the fact that not merely the inner sanctuary, and not merely the whole of the temple house, but also the whole of its surroundings (all its courts), are to be most holy, the new sanctuary is to be distinguished from the earlier one. What has been already stated - namely, that the temple shall not be profaned any more - is compressed into this clause; and by the repetition of the words, "this is the law of the house,"' the first section of this vision, viz., the description of the temple, is rounded off; whilst the command given to the prophet in <a href="/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-11.htm">Ezekiel 43:11</a>, to make known all the statutes and laws of this temple to the house of Israel, forms at the same time the transition to the section which follows. </body></html>
