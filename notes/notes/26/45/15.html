These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cor - Translated "measure" in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>, ...

In these oblations there is a progression as to the relation between the kind and the quantity: of the corn, the sixth of a tenth, that is, a sixtieth part of the quantity specified; of the oil, the tenth of a tenth, that is, an hundredth part; and of the flock, one from every two hundred.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse prescribes the proportion that is to he observed in bringing the lambs for daily sacrifice. They were bound to choose out of the best pastures of Israel the best and fattest lambs, one out of two hundred; so favourable was God to them in these cattle, taking so few out of so many. And these lambs were designed for to be offered with the meat-offering, either in expiatory sacrifices, or in eucharistical sacrifices: thus daily sacrifices kept up their peace with God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/45.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred,.... As provision is before made for bread and oil, so here for meat for the servants of the Lord: if a man had two hundred lambs in his flock, one of them was to be given to them; it may be observed, that this plainly refers to times when the Mosaic dispensation should be abrogated; not tithes of all things are to be given to the priests, as heretofore; only the sixtieth part of wheat and barley, the hundredth part of oil, and but one lamb of two hundred; and which denotes the moderate maintenance of Gospel ministers, with which they should be contented, and the people should not grudge to give; nothing extraordinary or extravagant being required of them: this lamb was to be taken <p>out of the fat pastures of Israel; or, out of the watery places (c); out of those fields which were well watered, and produced good pasture, which fattened the sheep and lambs that were fed in them; and denotes that the best of the kind is to be given to the Lord, and to his servants, or for the support of his interest; not the lean and the lame, the halt and the blind, <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>, <p>for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings; not that the lamb was given for all these; but the wheat and the oil for the meat offering, and the lamb for the burnt offering and peace offerings. The sense may be, that this provision of wheat and barley, oil and lambs, or the sufficient maintenance signified by them, was in the room of the meat offering, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, which fell to the share of the priests under the legal dispensation: <p>to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord God; either to this end, that the ministers of the Gospel, who have the word of reconciliation committed to them, might cheerfully and faithfully dispense it to the people; or that they, by these liberal and generous contributions of theirs to the maintenance of them, might testify that they have truly by faith received the atonement by the sacrifice of Christ. <p>(c) "de irriguo", Montanus, Vatablus; "ex irriguis pascuis", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Polanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/45.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/45.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>.

And the building at the front of the separate place was seventy cubits broad on the side turned toward the west, and the wall of the building five cubits broad round about, and its length ninety cubits. <a href="/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13</a>. And he measured the (temple) house: the length a hundred cubits; and the separate place, and its building, and its walls: the length a hundred cubits. <a href="/ezekiel/41-14.htm">Ezekiel 41:14</a>. And the breadth of the face of the (temple) house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits. - The explanation of these verses depends upon the meaning of the word &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;. According to its derivation from &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, to cut, to separate, &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; means that which is cut off, or separated. Thus &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; is the land cut off, the desert, which is not connected by roads with the inhabited country. In the passage before us, &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; signifies a place on the western side of the temple, i.e., behind the temple, which was separated from the sanctuary (Plate I J), and on which a building stood, but concerning the purpose of which nothing more definite is stated than we are able to gather, partly from the name and situation of the place in question, and partly from such passages as <a href="/1_chronicles/26-18.htm">1 Chronicles 26:18</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>, according to which, even in Solomon's temple, there was a similar space at the back of the temple house with buildings upon it, which had a separate way out, the gate &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;, namely, that "this space,with its buildings, was to be used for the reception of all refuse, sweepings, all kinds of rubbish, - in brief, of everything that was separated or rejected when the holy service was performed in the temple, - and that this was the reason why it received the name of the separate place" (Kliefoth). The building upon this space was situated &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, in the front of the gizrah (that is to say, as one approached it from the temple); and that &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, on the side of the way to the sea, i.e., on the western side, sc. of the temple, and had a breadth of seventy cubits (from north to south), with a wall round about, which was five cubits broad (thick), and a length of ninety cubits. As the thickness of the wall is specially mentioned in connection with the breadth, we must add it both to the breadth and to the length of the building as given here; so that, when looked at from the outside, the building was eighty cubits broad and a hundred cubits long. In <a href="/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13</a> this length is expressly attributed to the separate place, and (i.e., along with) its building, and the walls thereof. But the length of the temple house has also been previously stated as a hundred cubits. In <a href="/ezekiel/41-14.htm">Ezekiel 41:14</a> the breadth of both is also stated to have been a hundred cubits - namely, the breadth of the outer front, or front face of the temple, was a hundred cubits; and the breadth of the separate place &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; toward the east, i.e., the breadth which it showed to the person measuring on the eastern side, was the same. If, them, the building on the separate place was only eighty cubits broad, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12</a>, including the walls, whilst the separate place itself was a hundred cubits broad, there remains a space of twenty cubits in breadth not covered by the building; that is to say, as we need not hesitate to put the building in the centre, open spaces of ten cubits each on the northern and southern sides were left as approaches to the building on both sides (K), whereas the entire length of the separate place (from east to west) was covered by the building. - All these measurements are in perfect harmony. As the inner court formed a square of a hundred cubits in length (<a href="/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a>), the temple house, which joined it on the west, extended with its appurtenances to a similar length; and the separate place behind the temple also covered a space of equal size. These three squares, therefore, had a length from east to west of three hundred cubits. If we add to this the length of the buildings of the east gates of the inner and outer courts, namely fifty cubits for each (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-15.htm">Ezekiel 40:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-25.htm">Ezekiel 40:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-29.htm">Ezekiel 40:29</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-33.htm">Ezekiel 40:33</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/40-36.htm">Ezekiel 40:36</a>), and the length of the outer court from gate to gate a hundred cubits (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-19.htm">Ezekiel 40:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>), we obtain for the whole of the temple building the length of five hundred cubits. If, again, we add to the breadth of the inner court or temple house, which was one hundred cubits, the breadths of the outer court, with the outer and inner gate-buildings, viz., two hundred cubits on both the north and south sides, we obtain a total breadth of 100 + 200 + 200  equals  500 (say five hundred) cubits; so that the whole building covered a space of five hundred cubits square, in harmony with the calculation already made (at <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-24.htm">Ezekiel 40:24-27</a>) of the size of the surrounding wall. </body></html>
