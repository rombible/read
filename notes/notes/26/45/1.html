They first describe the setting apart of a large part of the whole land for the sanctuary, the priests, the prince, and the city, in a way and in a geographical position entirely unknown either in the past or the subsequent history of the people (<a href="/context/ezekiel/45-1.htm" title="Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an oblation to the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.">Ezekiel 45:1-8</a>). The portion assigned to the prince is to prevent violence and exaction on his part; in this connection all unjust measurements are to cease, and standard weights and measures are prescribed (<a href="/context/ezekiel/45-9.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 45:9-12</a>). Then follow directions for the tax or “oblation” to be paid by the people to the prince, that he may be able to furnish the required sacrifices (<a href="/context/ezekiel/45-13.htm" title="This is the oblation that you shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and you shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley:">Ezekiel 45:13-17</a>). The chapter closes with directions concerning the daily sacrifices and the feasts, these feasts being in part unknown to the law; while some feasts that were prominent in the law are entirely omitted, and the ritual of nearly all is greatly changed. The whole is so different from the arrangements of the Mosaic economy, and so foreign to the restoration of that economy on the return from the exile, that it can only be explained of an ideal picture which both prophet and people understood was not to receive a literal realisation.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">When ye shall divide by lot.—</span>The same expression is used in <a href="/ezekiel/47-22.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be to you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.">Ezekiel 47:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/48-29.htm" title="This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 48:29</a>, as it had long before been used in <a href="/joshua/13-6.htm" title="All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide you it by lot to the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.">Joshua 13:6</a>; but that it does not imply anything of chance is plain from the fact that in Ezekiel 48 a definite portion of the land is assigned to each of the tribes by name.

As a small portion of these was burned upon the altar and the rest given to the priests, so here, a small part of this territory was to be occupied by the sanctuary and the rest given to the priests and Levites. A fuller description of this oblation is given in <a href="/context/ezekiel/48-8.htm" title="And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>; it is here merely mentioned in connection with the support of the priests and the prince.<p><span class= "bld">Five and twenty thousand.—</span>In the original there is no mention of the measure to be used, but the English has rightly supplied <span class= "ital">reeds.</span> This is plain both from the size of the precincts of the Temple, which are made 500 reeds square in <a href="/context/ezekiel/42-16.htm" title="He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.">Ezekiel 42:16-20</a>, and from the special mention of cubits in <a href="/ezekiel/45-2.htm" title="Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.">Ezekiel 45:2</a> implying that the measure in other cases was different.

According to this measure, the portion here set apart will be almost seven miles square; whereas if we measure by reeds it will arise to six times as much, and can only be understood in a mystical sense. Mr. Scott, however, with some others, is of opinion, “that our translators did right in adding the word <span class="ital">reeds </span>to the numbers mentioned in this admeasurement; referring to the reed that was in the hand of Ezekiel’s divine conductor, because the length and breadth of the sanctuary are stated the same as before: (see <a href="/context/ezekiel/42-16.htm" title="He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about....">Ezekiel 42:16-19</a> :) so that,” they think, “unless the text be there totally changed, without any authority, this passage as well as that must be understood of reeds.” They acknowledge, indeed, “that the land of Canaan could by no means admit of so large a proportion being allotted to the sanctuary, with the priests and Levites,” &c.; but they think “this was intended to intimate the immensely large extent of the Christian Church above that of Israel; especially in those glorious times, which are doubtless emblematically predicted.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/45.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>45:1-25 In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God will be provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding their power under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness. These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By lot - Not by casting lots, but by "allotment," the several portions being assigned by rule <a href="/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>.<p>Oblation - The oblation (properly "heaveoffering") was regarded as the Lord's portion <a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>. This "oblation" is given here as part of the provision made for the priests, and was probably in lieu of tithes <a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>, just as the prince had his definite portion of land instead of being supported by the contributions of the people. The priests and Levites had, in addition, the sacrifices (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a>, note). This provision for them, out of proportion in any actual arrangement, is no doubt intended to symbolize the reverence and honor due to God, and expressed by liberality to His services and His ministers. The Septuagint read "the breadth twenty thousand;" and those who adopt this, read <a href="/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a> "and from this" whole measure is to be deducted the priests' special portion 25,000 from east to west, and 10,000 from north to south. Others, retaining the reading of the text, suppose the term oblation here to denote the portion assigned to the priests alone (as in <a href="/ezekiel/48-9.htm">Ezekiel 48:9</a>), and "of this measure" <a href="/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a> to mean not "deducted from this measure," but "computed by this measure." The King James Version rightly supplies "reeds," since the precincts <a href="/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a> were 500 "reeds" square. 25,000 reeds  equals about 42 12 statute miles, 36 12 geographic miles. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/45.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 45<p>Eze 45:1-25.

The special territorial division for the tribes is given in the forty-seventh and forty-eighth chapters. Only Jehovah's portion is here subdivided into its three parts: (1) that for the sanctuary (Eze 45:2, 3); (2) that for the priests (Eze 45:4); (3) that for the Levites (Eze 45:5). Compare Eze 48:8-13.<p>five and twenty thousand reeds, &c.&#8212;So English Version rightly fills the ellipsis (compare Note, see on [1079]Eze 42:16). Hence "cubits" are mentioned in Eze 45:2, not here, implying that there alone cubits are meant. Taking each reed at twelve feet, the area of the whole would be a square of sixty miles on each side. The whole forming a square betokens the settled stability of the community and the harmony of all classes. "An holy portion of the land" (Eze 45:1) comprised the whole length, and only two-fifths of the breadth. The outer territory in its distribution harmonizes with the inner and more sacred arrangements of the sanctuary. No room is to be given for oppression (see Eze 45:8), all having ample provision made for their wants and comforts. All will mutually co-operate without constraint or contention.The portion of land for the sanctuary, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/ezekiel/45-1.htm" title="Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an oblation to the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand.

The Greek keeps to the Hebrew, and adds not reed or cubit. Could it be demonstrated which is here intended, we might proceed with greater clearness and certainty.

As the territory of Canaan had been originally divided by lot among the twelve tribes after the conquest (comp. <a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>; <a href="/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>, etc.), this same method of allocating the soil amongst the new community should be followed on a second time taking possession of it after the exile. Currey believes the phrase, "divide by lot," "does not imply anything like casting lots, but is equivalent to our notion of <span class="accented">allotment</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> several portions being assigned by rule." There is, however, little doubt "lots" were cast to determine, if not the actual size, at least the precise situation, of each tribe's territory (see REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschNumbers 26:54 <span class="commentary">Keil</span> and 'Pulpit Commentary' on Numbers 26:54). That no such methodical distribution of Canaan ever took place, or for that matter could hays taken place amongst the returned exiles, should be proof sufficient that the prophet here moves in the region of the ideal and symbolical rather than of the real and literal. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall offer an oblation</span> -literally, <span class="accented">lift up a heave offering</span> (comp. Ezekiel 44:80; <a href="/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2, 3</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-28.htm">Exodus 29:28</a>; <a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13, 14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14, 32</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-12.htm">Leviticus 22:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-24.htm">Numbers 18:24</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord, an holy portion of the land;</span> literally, a <span class="accented">holy</span> (portion) <span class="accented">from the land</span>. Very significantly, in the new partition of Palestine the Lord's portion should be the first to be marked off and solemnly dedicated to Jehovah for the purposes to be forthwith specified. Those who, like Wellhansen and Smend, perceive in this allotment of land to Jehovah, and therefore to the priests, a  contradiction to <a href="/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a>, omit to notice first that Jehovah required some place on which his sanctuary might be erected, and the priests some ground on which to build houses for themselves; and secondly, that, so far as the priests were concerned, the laud was given by the people, not to them, but to Jehovah, and by him to them (comp. on Ezekiel 44:28). The exact site of this <span class="accented">terumah</span>, or "holy portion," is afterwards indicated (<a href="/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>); meanwhile its dimensions are recorded. <span class="cmt_word">The length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand</span>. Whether "reeds" or "cubits" should be supplied after "thousand" has divided expositors. Bottcher, Hitzig, Ewald, Hengstenberg, and Smend decide for "cubits," principally on the grounds that "cubits" are mentioned in ver. 2; that "cubits" have been the usual measure hitherto, even (as they contend) in <a href="/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>; and that otherwise the dimensions of this sacred territory must have been colossal, in fact, out of all proportion to the Holy Land, viz. about 720 square miles (25,000 reeds, or 42.5 miles, &times; 10,000 reeds, or 17 miles,   =   722.5 square miles). Havernick, Keil, <span class="accented">Kliefoth</span>, Currey, and Plumptre favor "reeds," chiefly for the reasons that in ver. 2 "cubits" are specified, and are therefore to be regarded as exceptional; that the customary measuring instrument throughout has been a reed (see <a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>); and that the dimensions, which Ezekiel designed should be colossal (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>), correspond exactly with the measurements afterwards given in <a href="/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>, if these he in reeds, but not if they be in cubits. As to the breadth of this <span class="accented">terumah</span> from east to west, Hitzig, Keil, <span class="accented">Smend</span>, Schroder, and Plumptre follow the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) in substituting 20,000 for 10,000, considering that the space referred to in ver. 3 appears as if meant to be taken from an already measured larger area, which could only be that of ver. 1 - the portion in ver. 1 being the whole territory assigned to the priests and Levites, and that in ver. 3 the allotment for the priests. Kliefoth, however, contends that no necessity exists for tampering with the text, and certainly if vers. 1-4 be regarded as descriptive of the priests' portion <span class="accented">only</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> in the phrase, "of this measure" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span>), in ver. 8 be rendered "according to" - a sense it may have (see Gesenius, <span class="accented">sub voce</span>), the supposed difficulty disappears. In this case the demonstrative this in the last clause will refer to the priests' portion exclusively; in the former ease, to the whole portion of the priests and Levites. That <a href="/ezekiel/48-14.htm">Ezekiel 48:14</a> declares the Levites' portion to be "holy unto the land" does not prove it must have been included in the holy <span class="accented">terumah</span> of ver. 1 Nor does this concession follow, as will appear, from ver. 7. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Temple-Porch<p>(see Plate III A). The measuring angel conducts the prophet still farther to the porch of the temple, and measures its breadth and length. - <a href="/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a>. And he led me to the porch of the house, and measured the pillar of the porch, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the breadth of the gate, three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side. <a href="/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a>. The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and that by the steps by which one went up; and columns were by the pillars, one on this side and one on that side. - &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is the temple in the more restricted sense of the word, the temple-house, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>, etc.; and &#1488;&#1500;&#1501;, the porch before the entrance into the holy place (cf. <a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>). The measurements in <a href="/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a>, which are apparently irreconcilable with one another, led the lxx to the adoption of arbitrary interpolations and conjectures in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a>, in accordance with which Bttcher, Hitzig, and others have made corrections in the text, which have a plausible justification in the many artificial and for the most part mistaken interpretations that have been given of the text. The measures in <a href="/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a> are perfectly plain, namely, the length of the porch twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and there is no question that these measurements are to be understood in the clear, that is to say, as referring to the internal space, excluding the side-walls, as in the case of the holy place, the most holy place, and the inner court. The only question is whether the length signifies the dimension from east to west, i.e., the distance which had to be traversed on entering the temple, and therefore the breadth, the extent from north to south; or whether we are to understand by the length the larger dimension, and by the breadth the smaller, in which case the measurement from north to south, which formed the breadth of the house, would be designated the length of the porch, and that from east to west the breadth. Nearly all the commentators have decided in favour of the latter view, because, in the porch of Solomon's temple, the length of twenty cubits was measured according to the breadth of the house. But the fact has been overlooked, that in <a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a> the length given is more precisely defined by the clause, "in front of the breadth of the house." There is no such definition here, and the analogy of the building of Solomon's temple is not sufficient in itself to warrant our regarding the construction of the porch in the temple seen by Ezekiel as being precisely the same; since it was only in the essential portions, the form of which was of symbolical significance (the holy place and the most holy), that this picture of a temple resembled the temple of Solomon, whereas in those which were less essential it differed from that temple in various ways. At the very outset, therefore, the more probable assumption appears to be, that just as in the case of the holy place and the holy of holies, so also in that of the porch, we are to understand by the length, the distance to be traversed (from east to west), and by the breadth, the extension on either side (i.e., from south to north).<p>If, then, we understand the measurements in <a href="/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a> in this way, the measures given in <a href="/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a> may also be explained without any alterations in the text. The measuring of the pillar of the porch on either side, and of the gate on this side and that (<a href="/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a>), is sufficient of itself to lead to the conclusion that the front turned toward a person entering is the breadth from south to north. This breadth presented to the eye a pillar on this side and one on that - two pillars, therefore, each five cubits broad (c c), and a breadth of gate of three cubits on this side and three on that, six cubits in all (b), that is to say, a total breadth (k-k) of 5 + 3 + 3 + 5  equals  16 cubits. The only thing that can surprise one here is the manner in which the breadth of the gate is defined: three cubits on this side and that, instead of simply six cubits. But the only reason in all probability is, that the pillars on either side are mentioned just before, and the gate of six cubits' breadth consisted of two halves, which had their hinges fastened to the adjoining pillars, so that each half was measured by itself from the pillar to which it was attached. The breadth of front mentioned, viz., sixteen cubits, agrees very well with the breadth of the porch inside, i.e., eleven cubits (m-m), for it allows a thickness of two cubits and a half for each side wall (a), and this was sufficient for the walls of a porch. The pillars, which were five cubits broad on the outer face, were therefore only half that breadth (2 1/2 cubits) in the inner side within the porch, the other two cubits and a half forming the side wall. All the particulars given in <a href="/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a> may be explained in this way without any artifice, and yield a result the proportions of which are in harmony with those of the entire building. For the porch, with an external breadth of sixteen cubits, was half as broad as the house, which had a breadth of twenty cubits in the clear, and side walls of six cubits in thickness (<a href="/ezekiel/41-5.htm">Ezekiel 41:5</a>), so that when measured on the outside it was 6 + 20 + 6  equals  32 cubits broad. The breadth of the interior also is apparently perfectly appropriate, as the porch was not intended either for the reception of vessels or for the abode of individuals, but was a simple erection in front of the entrance into the holy place, the door of which (d) was ten cubits broad (<a href="/ezekiel/41-2.htm">Ezekiel 41:2</a>), that is to say, half a cubit narrower on either side than the porch-way leading to it. And lastly, the length of the porch was also in good proportion to the holy place, which followed the porch; the porch being twenty cubits long, and the holy place forty cubits. If we add to this the front wall, with a thickness of two cubits and a half, corresponding to that of the side walls, we obtain an external length of twenty-two cubits and a half for the porch. In front were the steps by which one went up to the porch (l). It is generally supposed that there were ten steps, the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; after &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; being changed into &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; (ten) after the example of the lxx. But however this alteration may commend itself when the facts of the case are considered, ten steps in front of the porch answering very well to the eight steps before the gateway of the inner court, and to the seven steps in front of the gateway of the outer court, it is not absolutely necessary, and in all probability is merely a conjecture of the Seventy, who did not know what to do with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, and possibly it is not even correct (see at <a href="/ezekiel/41-8.htm">Ezekiel 41:8</a>). The words &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; can be attached without difficulty to the preceding account of the breadth: "the breadth was eleven cubits, and that at the steps by which they went up to it," i.e., when measured on the side on which the flight of steps stood. If the words are taken in this way, they serve to remove all doubt as to the side which is designated as the breadth, with special reference to the fact that the porch of Solomon's temple was constructed in a different manner. The number of steps, therefore, is not given, as was also the case with the east gate of the outer court (<a href="/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>), because it was of no essential importance in relation to the entire building. The last statement, "and there were columns by the pillars on this side and on that," is free from difficulty, although there is also a difference of opinion among the commentators as to the position of these columns. &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; points back to &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a>). The preposition &#1488;&#1500; does not imply that the columns stood close to the pillars, and had the form of half-columns, but simply that they stood near the pillars (see Plate III K), like the columns Jachin and Boaz in Solomon's temple, to which they correspond. </body></html>
