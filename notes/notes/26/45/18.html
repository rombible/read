In each case the deviations from the Mosaic law are remarkable, as well as the omission of any mention of the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) and of the Great Day of Atonement. Ezekiel, as a priest, must have been familiar with the law in these matters, and therefore the changes he introduces must have been intentional. Like the changes in the division of the land, they seemed designed to show that this was an ideal vision. No attempt was ever made to follow the arrangements here laid down. The Mosaic law prescribed (in addition to the burnt offerings and meat offerings) a sin offering, which was to be a he-goat (<a href="/numbers/28-15.htm" title="And one kid of the goats for a sin offering to the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.">Numbers 28:15</a>) for the first of every month; also on the tenth day of the seventh month, on the Great Day of Atonement, two he-goats (one for the “scape-goat”) were to be offered. Of all these Ezekiel mentions only the sin offering for the beginning of the first month, and also for the seventh day of the same, of which the Mosaic law knows nothing; but he provides for these bullocks instead of goats. In the ritual of the blood he makes a corresponding change. The law gives no special directions for the sprinkling of the blood of the sin offerings on the first of each month, because they were included in the ordinary rule (<a href="/leviticus/4-25.htm" title="And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.">Leviticus 4:25</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-30.htm" title="And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.">Leviticus 4:30</a>, &c.) of sprinkling upon the sides of the altar of burnt offering; only in the case of the sin offering for the high priest or for the whole congregation (when the victim was a bullock) was the blood brought within the Temple itself, and sprinkled seven times before the vail, and applied to the horns of the altar of incense. On the Day of Atonement it was carried into the Holy of Holies, and sprinkled upon and before the mercyseat. All this is here changed. Some of the blood of these sin offerings (<a href="/ezekiel/45-19.htm" title="And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it on the posts of the house, and on the four corners of the settle of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court.">Ezekiel 45:19</a>) is to be put upon the “posts of the house” (see <a href="/ezekiel/41-21.htm" title="The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.">Ezekiel 41:21</a>), upon the “corners of the settle of the altar,” and “upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/45.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ezekiel/45-18.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the month, you shall take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary:...">Ezekiel 45:18-20</a></span>. <span class="ital">In the first month, &c., thou shalt take a young bullock — </span>These words are directed to the prince, who is commanded, on the first day of the new year, (which, according to the ecclesiastical computation, began with the month <span class="ital">Nisan, </span>and answers to our 10th of March: see <a href="/exodus/12-2.htm" title="This month shall be to you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.">Exodus 12:2</a>,) to provide a bullock for a burnt-offering to cleanse the temple from any defilement it might have contracted, by the people’s offering their sacrifices, or coming into any of the courts belonging to it, while they were under any legal pollution. <span class="ital">And the priest shall take of the blood, </span>&c. — The office of the priest is here distinguished from that of the prince: the prince was to provide the sacrifices, and the priest to offer them. <span class="ital">So shalt thou do the seventh day for every one that erreth — </span>For all the errors of all the house of Israel through ignorance.

These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This order of certain solemn services does not follow exactly the order of Moses, of Solomon, or of Ezra.

Whether three festivals are referred to or only two is debated by expositors. Fairbairn, Havernick, Ewald, Keil, Schroder, and Plumptre decide for three - the festival of the new year (vers. 18-20), the Passover (vers. 21-24), and the Feast of Tabernacles (ver. 25). Kliefoth, Smend, and Curtsy find only two a Passover and a Feast of Tabernacles. Hengstenberg sees in the solemnities of the first and seventh days of the new year a special consecration service for the new temple, not to be repeated, corresponding to the dedication of the tabernacle on the first day of the first month (<a href="/exodus/40-1.htm">Exodus 40:1, 17</a>), or of the Solomonic temple in the seventh month (<a href="/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>),  and in imitation of which the post-exilic temple was dedicated, probably on the first day of the year (<a href="/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-22</a>). Against the notion of a special dedication service, however, stand the facts <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the temple had been already consecrated by the entrance into it of the glory of the Lord (<a href="/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the service here described differs in respect either of time or ritual or both from every one of the three cited dedications. Between the two other views the difference is slight. If the festival of the new year (vers. 18-20) was distinct from the Passover, it was still, by the ritual of the seventh and fourteenth days of the first month (vers. 20, 22), so closely connected with the Passover as practically to form a preparation for and introduction to it. Then the circumstance that the proper ceremonial for the new moon is afterwards described (<a href="/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a>) favors the proposal to regard the rites in vers. 18-20 as a part of the Passover festival; while this view, if adopted, will explain the omission from ver. 25 of all mention of the Feast of Trumpets on the first day of the seventh month (<a href="/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>; <a href="/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1</a>), and of the great Day of Atonement on the tenth day of the seventh month (<a href="/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>; <a href="/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7</a>), with which the autumn festival was usually preceded, by showing that in lieu of these a sacrificial observance had been prefixed to the Passover on the first and seventh days of the first month. Smend's theory, that "Ezekiel's feast-calendar divides the ecclesiastical year into two halves, each of which begins with a re. conciliation ceremony (or expiatory sacrifice) on the first days of the first and seventh months respectively," would lend confirmation to the above view, were it not that the theory in question is based on an alteration of the text in ver. 20 (see Exposition). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord God.</span> The usual solemn introduction prefixed to Divine enactments (comp. ver. 9; <a href="/ezekiel/43-19.htm">Ezekiel 43:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-6.htm">Ezekiel 44:6, 9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the first month, in the first day of the month</span> (comp. <a href="/genesis/8-13.htm">Genesis 8:13</a>). That the first month, Abib, was intended is apparent from ver. 21, compared with <a href="/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/9-1.htm">Numbers 9:1</a>. Under the Mosaic Torah, the Passover began on the tenth day of the first month by the selection of a lamb (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-6</a>), corresponding to which the great Day of Atonement in the seventh month fell upon the tenth day (<a href="/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>). In the Torah of Ezekiel, the ceremonies introducing and leading up to the Passover should begin with the first day of the month, as under the Law the Feast of Trumpets on the first day of the seventh mouth practically began the solemnities which culminated in the Feast of Tabernacles. <span class="cmt_word">A young bullock without blemish</span> should form the sacrificial offering on this first day of the year, according to the ordinance published by Ezekiel; that promulgated by the Hebrew lawgiver appointed for new moons generally, in addition to the burnt and meat offerings, a he-goat for a sin offering (<a href="/numbers/28-15.htm">Numbers 28:15</a>), and particularly for the first day of the seventh month, in addition to the regular burnt and meat offerings, one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs for a burnt offering, meat offerings of flour and oil for each of these animals, and a he-goat for a sin offering (<a href="/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2-6</a>). The object for which the Mosaic offerings were presented was to make atonement for the worshippers; the Ezekelian sacrifices should stand in more immediate relation to the place of worship, and be designed to <span class="cmt_word">cleanse the sanctuary</span> from such defilement, to be afterwards mentioned, as might be contracted from the presence in it of erring men (ver. 20). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Summary Account of the Measurement, the Character, and the Significant Ornaments of the Projecting Portions of the Temple Building. - <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a>.

The circumstance that another measurement follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a>, whereas no further numbers are given from <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a> onwards, does not warrant us in assuming that <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a> is to be joined on to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-14.htm">Ezekiel 41:14</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a> to be taken in connection with <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a>.

The contents of <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a> are also decisive against the separation mentioned. If, for instance, we connect <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-14.htm">Ezekiel 41:14</a>, the first clause contains a pure tautology, as the length of the building has been already measured, and the result is given in <a href="/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13</a>. The tautology does not exist, if the summary statements of the measurement of different portions of the whole temple building commence with <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a>; and in connection with these a supplementary account is given of various details not mentioned before.<p>The contents of the second clause, namely, what is stated concerning the &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, belong directly to the latter. The building in front of the separate place, which was measured by the man, is more precisely defined, so far as its situation is concerned, by the words &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;. The feminine suffix in &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; points back to &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;; consequently &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; can only refer to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;: "the building...which was at the back of the gizrah." This is not at variance with the situation indicated in &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, but serves as a more exact definition of this statement, showing that the building which stood at the front of the gizrah occupied the hinder part of it, i.e., extended in length from the front of the gizrah to the back. - The meaning of &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, here (Keri) and in <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/42-3.htm">Ezekiel 42:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-5.htm">Ezekiel 42:5</a>, the only other passages in which it occurs, is involved in obscurity. Even Raschi confesses that he does not know what it means, and the older translators have simply resorted to vague conjectures for their renderings; the lxx here, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;, in <a href="/ezekiel/42-3.htm">Ezekiel 42:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/42-5.htm">Ezekiel 42:5</a> &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; and &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;; the Vulgate, here, ethecas (the Hebrew word Latinized), in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42.htm">Ezekiel 42</a> porticus; Targum, in the London Polyglot, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a>, &#1494;&#1497;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;&#1488;; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a>, &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-3.htm">Ezekiel 42:3</a>, &#1494;&#1493;&#1497;; and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-5.htm">Ezekiel 42:5</a>, &#1494;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;. There is no root &#1488;&#1514;&#1511; in Hebrew; and the derivation of the word from &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; is not only uncertain, but furnishes us with nothing that can be used for tracing the architectural signification of the word. Even the context in <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> of this chapter supplies nothing, for in both verses the meaning of the clauses in which &#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; stands is a matter of dispute. It is only in <a href="/ezekiel/42-3.htm">Ezekiel 42:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/42-5.htm">Ezekiel 42:5</a> that we find any clue. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-3.htm">Ezekiel 42:3</a>, in the three-storied cell-building there was &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; on the third storey; and according to <a href="/ezekiel/41-5.htm">Ezekiel 41:5</a> the cells of the upper storey in this building were shorter than those of the lower and central storey, because &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; took space away from them; and the reason for this, again, was, that the three-storied cells had no pillars. From this we may infer with certainty that the &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; were galleries or passages running along the outer walls of the building, which were not supported by pillars, and therefore necessarily rested upon ledges obtained by the receding of the rooms of the upper storey. This meaning also suits the present chapter. The suffix in &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1492;&#1488; (an Aramaic form for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1492;) points back, not to &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, but to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13</a>; for the words, "and its galleries on this side and on that," i.e., on the north and south sides of the building, are not dependent upon &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, in the sense of "the length of the building, with its galleries on this side and on that," as &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1492;&#1488; is too widely separated from '&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1489; for this. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1492;&#1488; is rather a second object to &#1502;&#1491;&#1491;: he measured (1) the length of the building; (2) its galleries on this side and that - a hundred cubits; (3) the inner temple, etc. The hundred cubits do not refer to the length of the building, but to the galleries on both sides, which were of the same length as the building, and therefore ran along its entire length, - a fact which it was not superfluous to mention, as they might possibly have been shorter. &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; is the temple house, with the buildings against it, within the inner court. In addition to these, there are also mentioned the porches of the court, i.e., at the gate-buildings of the inner and outer courts, as the projecting portions of these buildings. These three works mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a> comprise the whole of the buildings, the measurements of which have been mentioned in the previous description - viz. the building to the west of the temple, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12-14</a>; the inner temple, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1-11</a>; the porches of the courts, to which the temple porch in front of the holy place is to be added, as having been reckoned in the measurement as belonging to the inner court, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41.htm">Ezekiel 41</a>. - Thus the contents of our verse (<a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a>) plainly show that it not only is an indivisible whole, but forms a conclusion in which the foregoing measurements are all summed up, and which serves as an introduction, in accordance with this, to the following summary of various additional features in the temple buildings which are also worthy of mention.<p>In this summary there are five points noticed: (a) the fact that all parts of the buildings had their measurements (<a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a>); (b) the significant ornamentation of the inner walls of the sanctuary (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18-21</a>); (c) the altar in the holy place (<a href="/ezekiel/41-22.htm">Ezekiel 41:22</a>); (d) the character and decoration of the doors of the sanctuary (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23-25</a>); (e) the style of the porch and of the side-buildings against the temple (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-25.htm">Ezekiel 41:25</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/41-26.htm">Ezekiel 41:26</a>). - <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a> form one period, enlarged by the parenthetical insertion of explanatory statements, similar to the construction in <a href="/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-19.htm">Ezekiel 41:19</a>. The predicate to the three subjects - the thresholds, the closed windows, and the galleries - is not to be sought for either in &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;  or in '&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1507; &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1507; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The latter construction, adopted by Bttcher and Hvernick, yields the unmeaning assertion that the thresholds lay across in front of the threshold. The former gives the apparently bald thought, that thresholds, windows, and galleries were round about; in which the use of the article, the thresholds, the windows, is exceedingly strange. The predicate to '&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; at the end of <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a> : the thresholds, etc., had measurements; and the construction is so far anakolouthistic, that the predicate &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, strictly speaking, belongs to the things mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a> alone, and the subjects mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> are to be regarded as absolute nominatives. The words &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; belong to the three preceding subjects, as a further definition, the thresholds, windows, and galleries (which were) against these three round about. The suffix to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, "their triad," refers to the three buildings mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a> : the one upon the separate place, the temple building, and the porches of the court; and the appositional &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; is not to be so pressed as to lead to the conclusion that all three buildings, and therefore the porches of the court also, had &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; round about. As the &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1501; is affirmed of the thresholds, and the windows, and the galleries, and these three objects are introduced by the article, as well known, i.e., as already mentioned and described in the preceding verses, the more precise definition (resp. limitation) of the apposition, "round about these three," is to be taken from the preceding description of these three buildings, and we are simply to assume the existence of thresholds, windows, and galleries in these buildings in those cases in which they have been mentioned in that description; so that the only place in which there were galleries was the building upon the separate place. But before the intended information is given concerning the thresholds, etc., a remark is introduced, with the words from &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1507; to &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, as to the construction of the thresholds: viz., that opposite to the threshold (&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1507; being used in a general sense for every threshold) there was &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1507; &#1506;&#1509;, a thin covering of wood, or wainscoting. &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; does not mean across the front (Bttcher), but "opposite;" and the part opposite to the threshold of a door is, strictly speaking, the lintel. Here, however, the word is probably used in the broader sense for the framework of the door, above and on the two sides, as is shown by &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; which follows. With &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; a fresh object is introduced. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is a nominative, like &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, etc.; and the thought of supplying &#1502;&#1503; gniylppus, "from the ground," has originated in a faulty interpretation of the words. The idea is this: as the thresholds, the windows, etc., so also the ground up to the windows, i.e., the space between the ground and the windows, had measurements. The allusion to the windows is followed by the remark, in the form of a circumstantial clause, that "the windows were covered." &#1502;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is apparently only a substantial explanation of &#1488;&#1496;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/40-16.htm">Ezekiel 40:16</a>).<p>In <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a> two further objects are mentioned as having measurements; not, however, in the logical position of subjects, but with prepositions &#1506;&#1500; and &#1488;&#1500;: upon that which was above the opening of the door...and (what was) on all the walls, i.e., the space above the doors and on all the walls. To this periphrasis of the subject, through &#1506;&#1500; and &#1488;&#1500;, there is attached the predicate &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, which belongs to all the subjects of <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a>, in the sense of, "on all the walls there were measures." The meaning is, that all the parts of the building which have been named had their definite measurements, were carefully measured off. In order to express this thought in as general and comprehensive a manner as possible, the ideas contained in the subjects in <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a> are expanded by means of appositions: that of the space above, over the entrance door, by &#1493;&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; '&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1507; (both &#1493;-&#1493;  equals  et-et) into the inner temple, i.e., both the inside of the temple throughout, and also to the outside. The idea of the whole wall is expressed by "round about, in the inside and on the outside." - Thus everything in <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a> is clear, and in accordance with fact; and there is no necessity either for the critical scissors of Ewald and Hitzig, who cut out all that they do not understand as glosses, or for the mal-emendation of Bttcher, who changes &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; into &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="/1_kings/6-18.htm">1 Kings 6:18</a>), and thus finds it good to ornament the temple with sculptures, even on the outsides of all the walls.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18-21</a> treat of the ornamenting of the inside of the sanctuary, i.e., of the holy place and the holy of holies. <a href="/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-19.htm">Ezekiel 41:19</a> form, like <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a>, a period extended by parentheses. The predicate &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;, standing at the beginning of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a>, is resumed in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-19.htm">Ezekiel 41:19</a>, and completed by &#1505;' '&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1505;. That the cherubim and palms were executed in sculpture or carving, is evident from the resemblance to Solomon's temple. They were so distributed that a cherub was followed by a palm, and this by a cherub again, so that the palm stood between the two cherubim, and the cherub turned one of its two faces to the palm on this side, and the other to the palm upon that side. In sculpture only two faces could be shown, and consequently these cherubic figures had only two faces, and not four, like those in the vision. This sculpture was placed round about the whole house, and that, as is added in <a href="/ezekiel/41-20.htm">Ezekiel 41:20</a> by way of explanation, from the ground even to up above the door, namely, on the inner wall of the sanctuary (&#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;). &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is hereby limited to the &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, the holy place and the holy of holies. &#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512; is a local accusative. To this there is appended the further notice in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21</a>, that the sanctuary had door-posts in a square form. The loose arrangement of the words, "the sanctuary post work of square form," is a concise form of expression after the manner of brief topographical notices. &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492; invariably signifies, wherever it occurs, the door-posts, i.e., the projecting framework of the entrances. &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, "foured," does not mean four-cornered merely, but really square (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a> and <a href="/exodus/28-16.htm">Exodus 28:16</a>). Consequently the words, "the door-posts of the holy place were of a square shape," might be understood as signifying not merely that the door-posts were beams cut square, but, as Kliefoth supposes, that the post work surrounding the door was made of a square form, that is to say, was of the same height as breadth, which would be quite in keeping with the predominance of the square shape, with its symbolical significance, in this picture of a temple. But the statement in the second half of the verse can hardly be reconciled with this; for whatever diversity there may be in the interpretation of this verse in particular points, it is certain that it does contain the general assertion that the doorway of the holy of holies was also shaped in the same way. But the door of the holy of holies, instead of being square, was (according to <a href="/ezekiel/41-3.htm">Ezekiel 41:3</a>) six cubits high and seven cubits broad. &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, as distinguished from &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, is the holy of holies, which <a href="/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23</a> places beyond all doubt (for this use of &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2-3</a>, <a href="/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>). &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, the face of the holy of holies, the front which met the eye of a person entering the holy place. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is the predicate, which is attached as loosely as in the first hemistich. The front of the holy of holies had the appearance like the appearance (just described), i.e., like the appearance of the &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;; in fact, it had also a doorway with four-cornered posts. J. F. Starch has already given this explanation of the words: Eadem facies et aspectus erat utriusque portae templi et adyti, utraque quadrata et quadratis postibus conspicua erat. The proposal of Ewald, on the other hand, to connect &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; with the following word &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, "in front of the holy of holies there was something to be seen like the shape of the altar" (lxx, Syr.), has the article in &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; against it (Bttcher). </body></html>
