Even if these were intended for the use of the Levites (which does not appear), it would be strange that they should be abruptly spoken of in the midst of this description of the oblation. A slight change in the text—the transposition of two letters in the first word, and the change of one letter in the second for another much like it—will make the clause read, “for a possession of gates to dwell in,” <span class= "ital">gates</span> being used, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-18.htm" title="But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put your hands to.">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-27.htm" title="And the Levite that is within your gates; you shall not forsake him; for he has no part nor inheritance with you.">Deuteronomy 14:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-11.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD your God has chosen to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 16:11</a> (comp. <a href="/exodus/20-10.htm" title="But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates:">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-14.htm" title="But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your ox, nor your ass, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates; that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you.">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>), for cities.

Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For a possession for twenty chambers - literally, "For a possession twenty chambers," possibly twenty out of the thirty chambers in the outer court <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a>, and assigned for their use during residence in the sanctuary.

The special territorial division for the tribes is given in the forty-seventh and forty-eighth chapters. Only Jehovah's portion is here subdivided into its three parts: (1) that for the sanctuary (Eze 45:2, 3); (2) that for the priests (Eze 45:4); (3) that for the Levites (Eze 45:5).

Hence "cubits" are mentioned in Eze 45:2, not here, implying that there alone cubits are meant. Taking each reed at twelve feet, the area of the whole would be a square of sixty miles on each side. The whole forming a square betokens the settled stability of the community and the harmony of all classes. "An holy portion of the land" (Eze 45:1) comprised the whole length, and only two-fifths of the breadth. The outer territory in its distribution harmonizes with the inner and more sacred arrangements of the sanctuary. No room is to be given for oppression (see Eze 45:8), all having ample provision made for their wants and comforts.

Kliefoth and Curroy retain the word "chambers "as in the text, and think the "chambers" and the "land" were two distinct possessions of the Levites, the chambers having been within (see <a href="/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17, 18</a>) as the land was without the sanctuary. Rosenm&uuml;ller, Havernick, Hengstenberg, and Schroder decide for "chambers," or "courts," rows of dwellings standing outside the sanctuary as the priests' chambers were located within. Havernick supposes that along with these, which were obviously designed to be employed when the Levites were on duty, there may have been other Levitical towns and dwellings, Hengstenberg conceives them as having been "barracks for the Levites, the inhabitants of which used the twentieth part of the land assigned to them as pasturage." Unfavorable to the first view is the fact that it requires the text to be altered. Against the second is its awkward dividing of the verse and unexpected interjection of a reference to cells within the sanctuary while speaking of the land without. The third, while not free from difficulty as taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> to be equivalent to "cell-buildings," is perhaps the best. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Inner Space of the Temple (see Plate III B and C)<p><a href="/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1</a>.

And he measured its length, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, toward the temple; and said to me, This is the holy of holies. - <a href="/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-2.htm">Ezekiel 41:2</a> give the measurements of the holy place. &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; is used here in the more restricted sense for the nave of the temple, the holy place (B), without the porch and the holy of holies (cf. <a href="/1_kings/6-17.htm">1 Kings 6:17</a>). The measuring commences with the front (eastern) wall, in which there was the entrance door. This wall had pillars (e e) of six cubits breadth on either side (on the right hand and the left), and between the pillars a door (d) ten cubits broad, with door-shoulders (e e) of five cubits on this side and that (<a href="/ezekiel/41-2.htm">Ezekiel 41:2</a>). These measurements (6 + 6 + 10 + 5 + 5) yield for the front wall a total breadth of thirty-two cubits. This agrees with the measurements which follow: twenty cubits, the (internal) breadth of the holy place, and six cubits the thickness of the wall (e) on either side (<a href="/ezekiel/41-5.htm">Ezekiel 41:5</a>). The only remaining difficulty is in the very obscure words appended, &#1512;&#1495;&#1489; &#1492;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;, in which Ewald and Hitzig propose to alter &#1492;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500; into &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500; otni &#1492;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500; re, because the lxx have substituted &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;, but without making any improvement, as &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500; is still more inexplicable. Kliefoth, after examining the various attempts to explain these words, comes to the conclusion that no other course is left than to take &#1492;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500; as signifying the inner space of Ezekiel's temple, consisting of the holy place and the holy of holies, which was the same in the entire building as the tabernacle had been, - viz. the tent of God's meeting with His people, and which is designated as &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; to show the substantial identity of this space and the tabernacle. The clause &#1512;&#1495;&#1489; &#1492;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500; is thus attached to the preceding double &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; (i.e., to the measurement of the two pillars bounding the holy space), in an elliptical manner, in the following sense: "he measured the breadth of the pillars, on this side and that, which marked off the breadth of the tent, on the outside, that is to say, of the inner space of the holy place which resembled the tabernacle;" so that this clause formed a loose apposition, meaning, "with regard to the breath of the tent." &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; are the walls on both sides of the door (e e), between the door and the boundary pillars. - The internal length and breadth of the holy place are the same as in the holy place of Solomon's temple (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>, <a href="/1_kings/6-17.htm">1 Kings 6:17</a>).<p><a href="/ezekiel/41-3.htm">Ezekiel 41:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-4.htm">Ezekiel 41:4</a> refer to the holy of holies (c). "He went within." We have &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; (for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;) and not &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1</a>), because the prophet was not allowed to tread the most holy place, and therefore the angel went in alone. &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; is defined in <a href="/ezekiel/41-4.htm">Ezekiel 41:4</a> as the holy of holies. The measurements in <a href="/ezekiel/41-3.htm">Ezekiel 41:3</a> refer to the partition wall between the holy place and the most holy (g). &#1488;&#1497;&#1500; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, the pillar-work of the door, stands for the pillars on both sides of the door; and the measurement of two cubits no doubt applies to each pillar, denoting, not the thickness, but the breadth which it covered on the wall. There is a difficulty in the double measurement which follows: the door six cubits, and the breadth of the door seven cubits. As the latter is perfectly clear, and also apparently in accordance with the fact, and on measuring a door the height is the only thing which can come into consideration in addition to the breadth, we agree with Kliefoth in taking the six cubits as a statement of the height. The height of six cubits bears a fitting proportion to the breadth of seven cubits, if there were folding-doors; and the seven is significant in the case of the door to the holy of holies, the dwelling of God. The Seventy, however, did not know what to do with this text, and changed &#1512;&#1495;&#1489; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; into &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, in which they have been followed by Bttcher, Hitzig, and others. But it is obvious at once that the Seventy have simply derived these data from the measurements of the front of the holy place (<a href="/ezekiel/41-2.htm">Ezekiel 41:2</a>), and have overlooked the fact, that in the first place, beside the measure of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, i.e., &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, the &#1512;&#1495;&#1489; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, or breadth of the door, is also expressly measured there, whereas here, on the contrary, it is preceded by &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; alone, without &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;; and secondly, as the measurement of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; given in <a href="/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1</a> indicates their breadth (from south to north), in the present instance also the measure ascribed to the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; can only refer to the breadth of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;, and not to its thickness (from east to west). But if we explain the first clause of <a href="/ezekiel/41-3.htm">Ezekiel 41:3</a> in this manner, as both the language and the fact require, the reading of the lxx is proved to be a false correction, by the fact that it yields a breadth of twenty-two or twenty-four cubits (2 + 2 + 6 + 7 + 7), whereas the holy of holies, like the holy place, was only twenty cubits broad. The dimensions of the holy of holies also correspond to the space covered by the holy of holies in Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>). The expression &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, "toward the holy place," is to be explained by the supposition that the measuring angel, after he had proceeded to the western end of the holy of holies for the purpose of measuring the length, turned round again to measure the breadth, so that this breadth lay "toward the holy place." </body></html>
