These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customs of the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that is sacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, and feast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptian slavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword of Divine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; as the whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The people's gifts were to be placed in the hands of the prince, so as to form a common stock, out of which the prince was to provide what was necessary for each sacrifice.

Or, "upon the prince shall be the burnt offerings" (e); it shall lie upon him to provide them; who is not the high priest, as Jarchi; nor the civil magistrate or king, as Menachem; but Christ, who is both Prince and Priest; and whose sacrifice of himself is designed by these, and the other sacrifices after mentioned, of which the sacrifices were all typical; though he is but one, they many, his answers to them all, and is one for all; and though his is but once offered up, they often, because of the fulness of efficacy in the one, and the want of it in the other; and though in itself infinitely superior to these. Of the burnt offerings, and of their being typical of Christ; see Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-39.htm">Ezekiel 40:39</a>, <p>and meat offerings, and drink offerings; the meat offerings, which were rather bread offerings, were made of fine flour, with oil poured, and frankincense put thereon, <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a> and were typical of Christ, compared to a corn of wheat dying in the earth, and bringing forth fruit, <a href="/john/12-24.htm">John 12:24</a> and to wheat as bruised and ground into fine flour, kneaded and baked, which may denote his various sufferings, and so made bread of; he being the true and living bread, which gives life to men. The "oil" poured upon this offering may signify the grace of the Spirit without measure on Christ; and the "frankincense" how savoury and acceptable he is to his people. The "drink offering" was of wine, which went along with other sacrifices, and was very acceptable to God; and may denote the blood of Christ, which is drink indeed; and his love expressed in shedding it, which is better than the choicest wine; both these are held forth, Christ's flesh, which is meat, and his blood, which is drink, in the ordinance of the supper, administered by his priests, whom he furnishes with such offerings to set before his saints: <p>in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, and in all solemnities of the house of Israel; in the feasts of the passover, tabernacle, and pentecost, which were all figures of Christ; of his being the passover sacrificed for us, of his tabernacling in our nature, and of the effusion of his Spirit; and the "new moons", and "sabbaths", and "solemn days", are only Old Testament phrases to express the times of New Testament worship; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>, as monthly days for the administration of the ordinance of the supper, and the Lord's day for the preaching of the word, and other parts of public worship; in all which the sacrifice of Christ, his blood, righteousness, and satisfaction, make a principal part: <p>he shall prepare the sin offering; which also was a type of Christ; of which See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-39.htm">Ezekiel 40:39</a>, and this, with the <p>meat offering; and the burnt offering, of which before, were to be prepared by the prince himself, or our Lord Jesus Christ: and also the "peace offerings", or thank offerings (f); his own thank offerings for himself and his people; see <a href="/john/11-41.htm">John 11:41</a> and the thank offerings of them, or their sacrifices of praise, which become acceptable through him, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>, and even himself, for whom the saints offer thanks to God, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-15.htm">2 Corinthians 9:15</a>, and as the end of all the legal sacrifices was <p>to make reconciliation for the house of Israel; so this is the end and use of the sacrifice of Christ, typified by them, to make peace for the Israel of God; which could not be made by them, by their obedience, repentance, or faith; and yet was necessary to their happiness, to their communion with God, and enjoyment of him; this Christ has made by his obedience, sufferings, and death, whereby he has fulfilled the law, satisfied justice, and made atonement for sin: this is all at his expense, and is meant by his "preparing" these offerings; which denotes his ready and cheerful engagement to become a sacrifice; his voluntary offering up himself unto God, or giving himself an offering and a sacrifice unto him; and also his furnishing his ministers with proper matter for their ministrations in all the solemn times and seasons thereof, which is the doctrine of his sacrifice and satisfaction, or salvation by a crucified Christ; and so as the people are to offer to their maintenance, Christ the Prince takes care to furnish them for their ministry. <p>(e)    "et super principem erunt holocausta", V.

The tautology does not exist, if the summary statements of the measurement of different portions of the whole temple building commence with <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a>; and in connection with these a supplementary account is given of various details not mentioned before.<p>The contents of the second clause, namely, what is stated concerning the &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, belong directly to the latter.

The feminine suffix in &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; points back to &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;; consequently &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; can only refer to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;: "the building...which was at the back of the gizrah."

According to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-3.htm">Ezekiel 42:3</a>, in the three-storied cell-building there was &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; on the third storey; and according to <a href="/ezekiel/41-5.htm">Ezekiel 41:5</a> the cells of the upper storey in this building were shorter than those of the lower and central storey, because &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; took space away from them; and the reason for this, again, was, that the three-storied cells had no pillars. From this we may infer with certainty that the &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; were galleries or passages running along the outer walls of the building, which were not supported by pillars, and therefore necessarily rested upon ledges obtained by the receding of the rooms of the upper storey. This meaning also suits the present chapter. The suffix in &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1492;&#1488; (an Aramaic form for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1492;) points back, not to &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, but to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13</a>; for the words, "and its galleries on this side and on that," i.e., on the north and south sides of the building, are not dependent upon &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, in the sense of "the length of the building, with its galleries on this side and on that," as &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1492;&#1488; is too widely separated from '&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1489; for this. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1492;&#1488; is rather a second object to &#1502;&#1491;&#1491;: he measured (1) the length of the building; (2) its galleries on this side and that - a hundred cubits; (3) the inner temple, etc. The hundred cubits do not refer to the length of the building, but to the galleries on both sides, which were of the same length as the building, and therefore ran along its entire length, - a fact which it was not superfluous to mention, as they might possibly have been shorter. &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; is the temple house, with the buildings against it, within the inner court. In addition to these, there are also mentioned the porches of the court, i.e., at the gate-buildings of the inner and outer courts, as the projecting portions of these buildings. These three works mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a> comprise the whole of the buildings, the measurements of which have been mentioned in the previous description - viz. the building to the west of the temple, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12-14</a>; the inner temple, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1-11</a>; the porches of the courts, to which the temple porch in front of the holy place is to be added, as having been reckoned in the measurement as belonging to the inner court, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41.htm">Ezekiel 41</a>. - Thus the contents of our verse (<a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a>) plainly show that it not only is an indivisible whole, but forms a conclusion in which the foregoing measurements are all summed up, and which serves as an introduction, in accordance with this, to the following summary of various additional features in the temple buildings which are also worthy of mention.<p>In this summary there are five points noticed: (a) the fact that all parts of the buildings had their measurements (<a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a>); (b) the significant ornamentation of the inner walls of the sanctuary (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18-21</a>); (c) the altar in the holy place (<a href="/ezekiel/41-22.htm">Ezekiel 41:22</a>); (d) the character and decoration of the doors of the sanctuary (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23-25</a>); (e) the style of the porch and of the side-buildings against the temple (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-25.htm">Ezekiel 41:25</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/41-26.htm">Ezekiel 41:26</a>). - <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a> form one period, enlarged by the parenthetical insertion of explanatory statements, similar to the construction in <a href="/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-19.htm">Ezekiel 41:19</a>. The predicate to the three subjects - the thresholds, the closed windows, and the galleries - is not to be sought for either in &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;  or in '&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1507; &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1507; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The latter construction, adopted by Bttcher and Hvernick, yields the unmeaning assertion that the thresholds lay across in front of the threshold. The former gives the apparently bald thought, that thresholds, windows, and galleries were round about; in which the use of the article, the thresholds, the windows, is exceedingly strange. The predicate to '&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; at the end of <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a> : the thresholds, etc., had measurements; and the construction is so far anakolouthistic, that the predicate &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, strictly speaking, belongs to the things mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a> alone, and the subjects mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> are to be regarded as absolute nominatives. The words &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; belong to the three preceding subjects, as a further definition, the thresholds, windows, and galleries (which were) against these three round about. The suffix to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, "their triad," refers to the three buildings mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15</a> : the one upon the separate place, the temple building, and the porches of the court; and the appositional &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; is not to be so pressed as to lead to the conclusion that all three buildings, and therefore the porches of the court also, had &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; round about. As the &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1501; is affirmed of the thresholds, and the windows, and the galleries, and these three objects are introduced by the article, as well known, i.e., as already mentioned and described in the preceding verses, the more precise definition (resp. limitation) of the apposition, "round about these three," is to be taken from the preceding description of these three buildings, and we are simply to assume the existence of thresholds, windows, and galleries in these buildings in those cases in which they have been mentioned in that description; so that the only place in which there were galleries was the building upon the separate place. But before the intended information is given concerning the thresholds, etc., a remark is introduced, with the words from &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1507; to &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, as to the construction of the thresholds: viz., that opposite to the threshold (&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1507; being used in a general sense for every threshold) there was &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1507; &#1506;&#1509;, a thin covering of wood, or wainscoting. &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; does not mean across the front (Bttcher), but "opposite;" and the part opposite to the threshold of a door is, strictly speaking, the lintel. Here, however, the word is probably used in the broader sense for the framework of the door, above and on the two sides, as is shown by &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; which follows. With &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; a fresh object is introduced. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is a nominative, like &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, etc.; and the thought of supplying &#1502;&#1503; gniylppus, "from the ground," has originated in a faulty interpretation of the words. The idea is this: as the thresholds, the windows, etc., so also the ground up to the windows, i.e., the space between the ground and the windows, had measurements. The allusion to the windows is followed by the remark, in the form of a circumstantial clause, that "the windows were covered." &#1502;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is apparently only a substantial explanation of &#1488;&#1496;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/40-16.htm">Ezekiel 40:16</a>).<p>In <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a> two further objects are mentioned as having measurements; not, however, in the logical position of subjects, but with prepositions &#1506;&#1500; and &#1488;&#1500;: upon that which was above the opening of the door...and (what was) on all the walls, i.e., the space above the doors and on all the walls. To this periphrasis of the subject, through &#1506;&#1500; and &#1488;&#1500;, there is attached the predicate &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, which belongs to all the subjects of <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a>, in the sense of, "on all the walls there were measures." The meaning is, that all the parts of the building which have been named had their definite measurements, were carefully measured off. In order to express this thought in as general and comprehensive a manner as possible, the ideas contained in the subjects in <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a> are expanded by means of appositions: that of the space above, over the entrance door, by &#1493;&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; '&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1507; (both &#1493;-&#1493;  equals  et-et) into the inner temple, i.e., both the inside of the temple throughout, and also to the outside. The idea of the whole wall is expressed by "round about, in the inside and on the outside." - Thus everything in <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a> is clear, and in accordance with fact; and there is no necessity either for the critical scissors of Ewald and Hitzig, who cut out all that they do not understand as glosses, or for the mal-emendation of Bttcher, who changes &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; into &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="/1_kings/6-18.htm">1 Kings 6:18</a>), and thus finds it good to ornament the temple with sculptures, even on the outsides of all the walls.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18-21</a> treat of the ornamenting of the inside of the sanctuary, i.e., of the holy place and the holy of holies. <a href="/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/41-19.htm">Ezekiel 41:19</a> form, like <a href="/ezekiel/41-16.htm">Ezekiel 41:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-17.htm">Ezekiel 41:17</a>, a period extended by parentheses. The predicate &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;, standing at the beginning of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a>, is resumed in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-19.htm">Ezekiel 41:19</a>, and completed by &#1505;' '&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1505;. That the cherubim and palms were executed in sculpture or carving, is evident from the resemblance to Solomon's temple. They were so distributed that a cherub was followed by a palm, and this by a cherub again, so that the palm stood between the two cherubim, and the cherub turned one of its two faces to the palm on this side, and the other to the palm upon that side. In sculpture only two faces could be shown, and consequently these cherubic figures had only two faces, and not four, like those in the vision. This sculpture was placed round about the whole house, and that, as is added in <a href="/ezekiel/41-20.htm">Ezekiel 41:20</a> by way of explanation, from the ground even to up above the door, namely, on the inner wall of the sanctuary (&#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;). &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is hereby limited to the &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, the holy place and the holy of holies. &#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512; is a local accusative. To this there is appended the further notice in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21</a>, that the sanctuary had door-posts in a square form. The loose arrangement of the words, "the sanctuary post work of square form," is a concise form of expression after the manner of brief topographical notices. &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492; invariably signifies, wherever it occurs, the door-posts, i.e., the projecting framework of the entrances. &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, "foured," does not mean four-cornered merely, but really square (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a> and <a href="/exodus/28-16.htm">Exodus 28:16</a>). Consequently the words, "the door-posts of the holy place were of a square shape," might be understood as signifying not merely that the door-posts were beams cut square, but, as Kliefoth supposes, that the post work surrounding the door was made of a square form, that is to say, was of the same height as breadth, which would be quite in keeping with the predominance of the square shape, with its symbolical significance, in this picture of a temple. But the statement in the second half of the verse can hardly be reconciled with this; for whatever diversity there may be in the interpretation of this verse in particular points, it is certain that it does contain the general assertion that the doorway of the holy of holies was also shaped in the same way. But the door of the holy of holies, instead of being square, was (according to <a href="/ezekiel/41-3.htm">Ezekiel 41:3</a>) six cubits high and seven cubits broad. &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, as distinguished from &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, is the holy of holies, which <a href="/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23</a> places beyond all doubt (for this use of &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2-3</a>, <a href="/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>). &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, the face of the holy of holies, the front which met the eye of a person entering the holy place. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is the predicate, which is attached as loosely as in the first hemistich. The front of the holy of holies had the appearance like the appearance (just described), i.e., like the appearance of the &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;; in fact, it had also a doorway with four-cornered posts. J. F. Starch has already given this explanation of the words: Eadem facies et aspectus erat utriusque portae templi et adyti, utraque quadrata et quadratis postibus conspicua erat. The proposal of Ewald, on the other hand, to connect &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; with the following word &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, "in front of the holy of holies there was something to be seen like the shape of the altar" (lxx, Syr.), has the article in &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; against it (Bttcher). </body></html>
