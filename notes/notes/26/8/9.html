No superiority in worldly matters will preserve men from lust, or idolatries, when they are left to their own deceitful hearts; and those who are soon wearied in the service of God, often grudge no toil nor expense when following their superstitions. When hypocrites screen themselves behind the wall of an outward profession, there is some hole or other left in the wall, something that betrays them to those who look diligently. There is a great deal of secret wickedness in the world. They think themselves out of God's sight. But those are ripe indeed for ruin, who lay the blame of their sins upon the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The door of the court - The seer is brought to another spot. In Ezekiel's time there were various buildings on the space around the inner court which formed a court or courts, not improbably enclosed by a wall. The idolatries here were viewed as taking place in secret, and it is more in accordance with the temple arrangements to suppose that such chambers as would give room for those rites should belong to the outer than to the inner court. The seer is now outside the wall of the outer court, by the door which leads from it out of the temple-boundary. By breaking through the wall he enters into a chamber which stands in the outer court against the wall near the gate. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. dig&#8212;for it had been blocked up during Josiah's reformation. Or rather, the vision is not of an actual scene, but an ideal pictorial representation of the Egyptian idolatries into which the covenant-people had relapsed, practising them in secret places where they shrank from the light of day [Fairbairn], (Joh 3:20). But compare, as to the literal introduction of idolatries into the temple, Eze 5:11; Jer 7:30; 32:34.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Go in:</span> this was to secure him; he need fear neither the violence which idolaters usually show against those that discover them, nor yet any legal impurity by coming so near these abominable things. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Behold; </span> look diligently, that thou mayst particularly reprove these, and denounce my just judgments against them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The wicked abominations; </span> the most abominable wickednesses; these are loathsome in their nature, and multiplied in number before me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Do here, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">are doing here</span>: before the evil day appeared so near, they did, and under the approach of judgments they are still doing at this day, in this very place, under the walls of my temple. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto me, go in,....

The king will mourn, and the prince will clothe himself in horror, and the hands of the common people will tremble. I will deal with them according to their way, and according to their judgments will I judge them, that they may learn that I am Jehovah. - Those who have escaped death by sword or famine at the conquest of Jerusalem have captivity and exile awaiting them. This is the meaning of the command to make the chain, i.e., the fetters needed to lead the people into exile. This punishment is necessary, because the land is full of mishpat da&#770;mim, judgment of blood. This cannot mean, there is a judgment upon the shedding of blood, i.e., upon murder, which is conducted by Jehovah, as Hvernick supposes. Such a thought is irreconcilable with &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;, and with the parallel &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is to be explained after the same manner as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (a matter for sentence of death, a capital crime) in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a> -22, as signifying a matter for sentence of bloodshed, i.e., a crime of blood, or capital crime, as the Chaldee has already rendered it. Because the land is filled with capital crime, the city (Jerusalem) with violence, the Lord will bring &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;, evil ones of the heathen, i.e., the worst of the heathen, to put an end to the pride of the Israelites. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is not "pride of the insolents;" for &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; does not stand for &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-50.htm">Deuteronomy 28:50</a>, etc.). The expression is rather to be explained from &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;, pride of strength, in <a href="/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-6.htm">Ezekiel 30:6</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a> (cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>), and embraces everything on which a man (or a nation) bases his power and rests his confidence. The Israelites are called &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, because they thought themselves strong, or, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a>, based their strength upon the possession of the temple and the holy land. This is indicated by &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;  which follows. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, Niphal of &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, not a participle Piel, from &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, with the Dagesh dropped, but an unusual form, from &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; for &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (vid., Ew. 215a). - The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1495;&#1492;&#1510;&#1504;&#1510;&#1496;&#894;, with the tone drawn back on account of the tone-syllable which follows (cf. Ges. 29, 3. 6), signifies excidium, destruction (according to the Rabbins), from &#1511;&#1508;&#1491;, to shrink or roll up (<a href="/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; is a prophetic perfect. In <a href="/ezekiel/7-25.htm">Ezekiel 7:25</a> the ruin of the kingdom is declared to be certain, and in <a href="/ezekiel/7-26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a> the occurrence of it is more minutely depicted. Stroke upon stroke does the ruin come; and it is intensified by reports, alarming accounts, which crowd together and increase the terror, and also by the desperation of the spiritual and temporal leaders of the nation - the prophets, priests, and elders - whom God deprives of revelation, knowledge, and counsel; so that all ranks (king and princes and the common people) sink into mourning, alarm, and horror. That it is to no purpose that visions or prophecies are sought from the prophets (<a href="/ezekiel/7-26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26</a>), is evident from the antithetical statement concerning the priests and elders which immediately follows. The three statements serve as complements of one another. They seek for predictions from prophets, but the prophets receive no vision, no revelation. They seek instruction from priests, but instruction is withdrawn from the priests; and so forth. T&#772;o&#772;ra&#770;h signifies instruction out of the law, which the priests were to give to the people (<a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a>, the three classes into which the people were divided are mentioned - viz. king, prince (i.e., tribe-princes and heads of families), and, in contradistinction to both, &#1506;&#1501; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the common people, the people of the land, in distinction from the civil rulers, as in <a href="/2_kings/21-24.htm">2 Kings 21:24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501;, literally from their way, their mode of action, will I do to them: i.e., my action will be derived from theirs, and regulated accordingly. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>, etc. (See the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a>.) </body></html>
