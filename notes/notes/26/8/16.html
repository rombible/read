They were standing between the altar and the Temple, therefore in the most sacred part of the court, and there, turning their backs upon the Temple of the Lord, worshipped the sun. The adoration of the sun, probably the earliest form of false religion, was the especial worship of Persia, but had been long since practised by the kings and people of Judah (<a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm" title="And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.">2Kings 23:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-11.htm" title="And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.">2Kings 23:11</a>). Thus all classes of the nation are seen to be involved in common sin; and the priests particularly, the especial guardians of true religion, are found practising this sin under circumstances of peculiar insult to God. That the “chief priests” did pollute the sanctuary at this time is expressly asserted in the history at <a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm" title="Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 36:14</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:13-18 The yearly lamenting for Tammuz was attended with infamous practices; and the worshippers of the sun here described, are supposed to have been priests.

These then were the representatives of the priests, as the seventy were of the people. In the temple the seat of the Divine Majesty was at the west, perhaps appointed for this very purpose, to guard against the idolatrous adoration of the rising sun. Therefore the idolatrous priests must in worshipping the false sun-god turn their backs upon the True. The worship of the heavenly bodies was one of the earliest forms of idolatry <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26-27</a> and was expressly forbidden in the Law <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>. In its earliest form, it was conducted without the intervention of images, the adoration being addressed to the heavenly bodies themselves: this form, continued among the Persians, seems to have been introduced afresh into Jerusalem at the time of Ezekiel. Compare, also, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11-12</a>. The images (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-4.htm">Ezekiel 6:4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/6-6.htm">Ezekiel 6:6</a>) were probably columns set up in honor of the sun, not images in human form. This simpler mode of sunworship was soon changed. The sun, or the god supposed to preside over it, was represented as a person, whose image was set up and adored. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. worshipped&#8212;In the Hebrew a corrupt form is used to express Ezekiel's sense of the foul corruption of such worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The inner court; </span> the inmost, that which was next to the temple, called here the Lord’s house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">At the door of the temple:</span> before he saw abominations in the gates of the courts, now he is come to the very house itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The porch; </span> that stately, large porch, beautified with the high, curious, and mighty brass pillars, Jachin and Boaz, of which see <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm" title="And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.">1 Kings 6:3</a> 7:15,21</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The altar; </span> the brazen altar for burnt-offerings, which was placed in the court before the front of the temple, and is here represented in its proper place, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/16-14.htm" title="And he brought also the brazen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.">2 Kings 16:14</a></span>.

It was the "inner court" (<a href="/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>) which, after the exile, was entered only by the priests. During the monarchy, however, it seems to have been accessible to kings and other persons of importance, as in the case of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22, 64</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a>) in the revolution against Athaliah (<a href="/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4-15</a>), and Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14</a>), and Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>). Ezekiel does not say that the men whom he saw were priests, though the number twenty-five suggests that they were taking the place of the high priest and the heads of the twenty-four courses of the priesthood (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-4.htm">1 Chronicles 24:4-19</a>), and so symbolized the whole order of the priesthood as the seventy elders represented the laity. In <a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a> the chief of the priests is spoken of as having been prominent in "polluting the house of the Lord." They were seen turning their backs to the temple of Jehovah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sanctuary. The very act was symbolical of their apostasy (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-6.htm">2 Chronicles 29:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>). And they did this in order that they might look to the east and worship the rising sun. That, and not the temple (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>), was the <span class="accented">Kiblah</span> of their adoration. The sun worship here appears to have had a Persian character, as being offered to the sun itself, and not to Baal, as a solar god. Of such a worship we have traces in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; <a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5, 11</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Abominations of the Idolatry of the House of Israel<p>Time and place of the divine revelation. - <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>. And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth (month), on the fifth (day) of the month, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me; there fell upon me the hand of the Lord Jehovah there. <a href="/ezekiel/8-2.htm">Ezekiel 8:2</a>. And I saw, and behold a figure like the look of fire, from the look of its loins downwards fire, and from its loins upwards like a look of brilliance, like the sight of red-hot brass. <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>. And he stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by the locks of my head, and wind carried me away between earth and heaven, and brought me to Jerusalem in visions of God, to the entrance of the gate of the inner court, which faces towards the north, where the image of jealousy exciting jealousy had its stand. <a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>. And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision which I have seen in the valley. - The place where Ezekiel received this new theophany agrees with the statements in <a href="/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-6.htm">Ezekiel 4:6</a>, that he was to shut himself up in his house, and lie 390 days upon the left side, and 40 days upon the right side - in all, 430 days. The use of the word &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, "I sat," is not at variance with this, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; does not of necessity signify sitting as contrasted with lying, but may also be used in the more general sense of staying, or living, in the house. Nor is the presence of the elders of Judah opposed to the command, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24</a>, to shut himself up in the house, as we have already observed in the notes on that passage. The new revelation is made to him in the presence of these elders, because it is of the greatest importance to them. They are to be witnesses of his ecstasy; and after this has left the prophet, are to hear from his lips the substance of the divine revelation (<a href="/ezekiel/11-25.htm">Ezekiel 11:25</a>). It is otherwise with the time of the revelation. If we compare the date given in <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a> with those mentioned before, this new vision apparently falls within the period required for carrying out the symbolical actions of the previous vision. Between <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1-2</a> (the fifth day of the fourth month in the fifth year) and <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a> (the fifth day of the sixth month in the sixth year) we have one year and two months, that is to say (reckoning the year as a lunar year at 354 days, and the two months at 59 days), 413 days; whereas the two events recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1-7</a> require at least 437 days, namely 7 days for <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>, and 390 + 40  equals  430 days for <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-5.htm">Ezekiel 4:5-6</a>. Consequently the new theophany would fall within the 40 days, during which Ezekiel was to lie upon the right side for Judah. To get rid of this difficulty, Hitzig conjectures that the fifth year of Jehoiachin (<a href="/ezekiel/1-2.htm">Ezekiel 1:2</a>) was a leap year of 13 months or 385 days, by which he obtains an interval of 444 days after adding 59 for the two months, - a period sufficient not only to include the 7 days (<a href="/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>) and 390 + 40 days (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-5.htm">Ezekiel 4:5-6</a>), but to leave 7 days for the time that elapsed between <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/7.htm">Ezekiel 7</a> and 8. But however attractive this reckoning may appear, the assumption that the fifth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin was a leap year is purely conjectural; and there is nothing whatever to give it probability. Consequently the only thing that could lead us to adopt such a solution, would be the impossibility of reconciling the conclusion to be drawn from the chronological data, as to the time of the two theophanies, with the substance of these divine revelations.<p>If we assume that Ezekiel carried out the symbolical acts mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4</a> and 5 in all their entirety, we can hardly imagine that the vision described in the chapters before us, by which he was transported in spirit to Jerusalem, occurred within the period of forty days, during which he was to typify the siege of Jerusalem by lying upon his right side. Nevertheless, Kliefoth has decided in favour of this view, and argues in support of it, that the vision described in <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>. took place in the prophet's own house, that it is identical in substance with what is contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22-7:27</a>, and that there is no discrepancy, because all that occurred here was purely internal, and the prophet himself was to address the words contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-4.htm">Ezekiel 11:4-12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-14.htm">Ezekiel 11:14-21</a> to the inhabitants of Jerusalem in his state of ecstasy. Moreover, when it is stated in <a href="/ezekiel/11-25.htm">Ezekiel 11:25</a> that Ezekiel related to the exiles all that he had seen in the vision, it is perfectly open to us to assume that this took place at the same time as his report to them of the words of God in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-1.htm">Ezekiel 6:1-14</a> and 7, and those which follow in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/12.htm">Ezekiel 12</a>. But. on the other hand, it may be replied that the impression produced by <a href="/ezekiel/11-25.htm">Ezekiel 11:25</a> is not that the prophet waited several weeks after his visionary transport to Jerusalem before communicating to the elders what he saw in the vision. And even if the possibility of this cannot be disputed, we cannot imagine any reason why the vision should be shown to the prophet four weeks before it was to be related to the exiles. Again, there is not sufficient identity between the substance of the vision in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8.htm">Ezekiel 8-11</a> and the revelation in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4-7</a>, to suggest any motive for the two to coincide. It is true that the burning of Jerusalem, which Ezekiel sees in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8.htm">Ezekiel 8-11</a>, is consequent upon the siege and conquest of that city, which he has already predicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4-7</a> both in figure and word; but they are not so closely connected, that it was necessary on account of this connection for it to be shown to him before the completion of the symbolical siege of Jerusalem. And, lastly, although the ecstasy as a purely internal process is so far reconcilable with the prophet's lying upon his right side, that this posture did not preclude a state of ecstasy or render it impossible, yet this collision would ensue, that while the prophet was engaged in carrying out the former word of God, a new theophany would be received by him, which must necessarily abstract his mind from the execution of the previous command of God, and place him in a condition in which it would be impossible for him to set his face firmly upon the siege of Jerusalem, as he had been commanded to do in <a href="/ezekiel/4-7.htm">Ezekiel 4:7</a>. On account of this collision, we cannot subscribe to the assumption, that it was during the time that Ezekiel was lying bound by God upon his right side to bear the sin of Jerusalem, that he was transported in spirit to the temple at Jerusalem. On the contrary, the fact that this transport occurred, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>, at a time when he could not have ended the symbolical acts of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4</a>, if he had been required to carry them out in all their external reality, furnishes us with conclusive evidence of the correctness of the view we have already expressed, that the symbolical acts of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4</a> and 5 did not lie within the sphere of outward reality (see comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/5-4.htm">Ezekiel 5:4</a>). - And if Ezekiel did not really lie for 430 days, there was nothing to hinder his having a fresh vision 14 months after the theophany in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>. For '&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491; , see at <a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>.<p>The figure which Ezekiel sees in the vision is described in <a href="/ezekiel/8-2.htm">Ezekiel 8:2</a> in precisely the same terms as the appearance of God in <a href="/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27</a>. The sameness of the two passages is a sufficient defence of the reading &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; against the arbitrary emendation &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; '&#1499;&#1501;, after the Sept. rendering &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, in support of which Ewald and Hitzig appeal to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>, though without any reason, as the reading there is not &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, but &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;. It is not expressly stated here that the apparition was in human form - the fiery appearance is all that is mentioned; but this is taken for granted in the allusion to the &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (the loins), either as self-evident, or as well known from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. &#1494;&#1492;&#1512; is synonymous with &#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27</a>. What is new in the present theophany is the stretching out of the hand, which grasps the prophet by the front hair of his head, whereupon he is carried by wind between heaven and earth, i.e., through the air, to Jerusalem, not in the body, but in visions of God (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>), that is to say, in spiritual ecstasy, and deposited at the entrance of the inner northern door of the temple. &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; is not an adjective belonging to &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, for this is not a feminine noun, but is used as a substantive, as in <a href="/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a> ( equals  &#1492;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;: cf. <a href="/ezekiel/40-40.htm">Ezekiel 40:40</a>): gate of the inner court, i.e., the gate on the north side of the inner court which led into the outer court. We are not informed whether Ezekiel was placed on the inner or outer side of this gate, i.e., in the inner or outer court; but it is evident from <a href="/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5</a> that he was placed in the inner court, as his position commanded a view of the image which stood at the entrance of the gate towards the north. The further statement, "where the standing place of the image of jealousy was," anticipates what follows, and points out the reason why the prophet was placed just there. The expression "image of jealousy" is explained by &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, which excites the jealousy of Jehovah (see the comm. on <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Consequently, we have not to think of any image of Jehovah, but of an image of a heathen idol (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>); probably of Baal or Asherah, whose image had already been placed in the temple by Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-7.htm">2 Kings 21:7</a>); certainly not the image of the corpse of Adonis moulded in wax or clay. This opinion, which Hvernick advances, is connected with the erroneous assumption that all the idolatrous abominations mentioned in this chapter relate to the celebration of an Adonis-festival in the temple. There (<a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>) in the court of the temple Ezekiel saw once more the glory of the God of Israel, as he had seen it in the valley (<a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>) by the Chaboras, i.e., the appearance of God upon the throne with the cherubim and wheels; whereas the divine figure, whose hand grasped him in his house, and transported him to the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/8-2.htm">Ezekiel 8:2</a>), showed neither throne nor cherubim. The expression "God of Israel," instead of Jehovah (<a href="/ezekiel/3-23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23</a>), is chosen as an antithesis to the strange god, the heathen idol, whose image stood in the temple. As the God of Israel, Jehovah cannot tolerate the image and worship of another god in His temple. To set up such an image in the temple of Jehovah was a practical renunciation of the covenant, a rejection of Jehovah on the part of Israel as its covenant God.<p>Here, in the temple, Jehovah shows to the prophet the various kinds of idolatry which Israel is practising both publicly and privately, not merely in the temple, but throughout the whole land. The arrangement of these different forms of idolatry in four groups of abomination scenes (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-7.htm">Ezekiel 8:7-12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-13.htm">Ezekiel 8:13-15</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16-18</a>), which the prophet sees both in and from the court of the temple, belong to the visionary drapery of this divine revelation. It is altogether erroneous to interpret the vision as signifying that all these forms of idolatry were practised in the temple itself; an assumption which cannot be carried out without doing violence to the description, more especially of the second abomination in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-7.htm">Ezekiel 8:7-12</a>. Still more untenable is Hvernick's view, that the four pictures of idolatrous practices shown to the prophet are only intended to represent different scenes of a festival of Adonis held in the temple. The selection of the courts of the temple for depicting the idolatrous worship, arises from the fact that the temple was the place where Israel was called to worship the Lord its God. Consequently the apostasy of Israel from the Lord could not be depicted more clearly and strikingly than by the following series of pictures of idolatrous abominations practised in the temple under the eyes of God. </body></html>
