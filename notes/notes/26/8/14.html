Tammuz is nowhere else mentioned in Scripture, but is identified by ancient tradition (incorporated into the Vulg.) with the Greek Adonis, the beloved of Venus. The name <span class= "ital">Adonis </span>could not well have been used, because in its Hebrew form it means <span class= "ital">Lord, </span>and is frequently used of God. His worship is first heard of in Phoenicia, and was wide-spread throughout Syria and the adjacent countries. As the creature worship before mentioned was undoubtedly connected with political reasons, while aid was being sought from Egypt, so the worship of Adonis may have been affected by the league which Zedekiah attempted to form (<a href="/context/jeremiah/27-1.htm" title="In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 27:1-11</a>) with the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, and Philistines against Nebuchadnezzar. The annual feast of Adonis consisted of a mourning by the women for his death, followed by a rejoicing over his return to life, and was accompanied by great abominations and licentiousness. The myth of Adonis was also closely associated with the worship of nature. This festival did not fall in the “sixth month,” but the description is not necessarily of what was actually occurring at the moment; there is brought before the prophet’s vision a representation of the wickedness practised at various times in Jerusalem. Women engaged in the service of idolatry near the Temple are mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/23-7.htm" title="And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.">2Kings 23:7</a>. (Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm" title="The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.">Jeremiah 7:18</a>.)<p>Thus far, the prophet has seen in the different courts of the Temple the general image worship of the people, then the creature worship of their elders, and now the corrupt and debasing rites of their women.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/8-14.htm" title="Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.">Ezekiel 8:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then he brought me to the door which was toward the north — </span>Dr. Lightfoot distinguishes this door from that mentioned <a href="/ezekiel/8-5.htm" title="Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north.

The Vulgate renders <span class="ital">Tammuz, </span>by <span class="ital">Adonis; </span>and that Adonis, according to the physical theology of the heathen, was the same as the sun, there is no question. Macrobius expressly affirms it, <span class="ital">Saturnal., </span>lib. 1. cap. 21, and says, that the tradition of Adonis being killed by a boar, means the diminution of the sun’s light and heat by winter. This departure of Adonis, or the sun, was lamented in the most frantic ceremonies of grief by the Phœnician and Assyrian women, who, on these occasions, used to prostitute themselves in honour of his vivifying power; and thus the Jewish women are described by our prophet, weeping for Tammuz, on the fifth day of the sixth month, that is, of August; at which time his death, by the winter boar, was drawing on apace. Tammuz was supposed to have been killed by a wild boar in mount Lebanon, whence flows the river Adonis, concerning which Lucian relates an opinion prevailing in these parts, that its stream, at certain seasons of the year, is of a bloody colour, which the heathen considered as proceeding from a kind of sympathy in the river for his death: see Parkhurst and <span class="ital">Uni. Hist., </span>vol. 1. p. 342. Milton has touched upon each of these particulars in the following elegant lines:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">“ — — — Tammuz came next behind, Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured The Syrian damsels to lament his fate, In am’rous ditties all a summer’s day, While smooth Adonis, from his native rock, Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood Of Tammuz, yearly wounded: the love-tale Infected Sion’s daughters with like heat, Whose wanton passions, in the sacred porch, Ezekiel saw, when by the vision led His eye survey’d the dark idolatries Of alienated Judah — — — .” PARADISE LOST b. 1. 5:446.</span></span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:13-18 The yearly lamenting for Tammuz was attended with infamous practices; and the worshippers of the sun here described, are supposed to have been priests. The Lord appeals to the prophet concerning the heinousness of the crime; and lo, they put the branch to their nose, denoting some custom used by idolaters in honour of the idols they served. The more we examine human nature and our own hearts, the more abominations we shall discover; and the longer the believer searches himself, the more he will humble himself before God, and the more will he value the fountain open for sin, and seek to wash therein.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The seer is now brought back to the same gate as in <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>.<p>It is not certain that this verse refers to any special act of Tammuz-worship. The month in which the vision was seen, the sixth month (September), was not the month of the Tammuz-rites. But that such rites had been performed in Jerusalem there can be little doubt. Women are mentioned as employed in the service of idols in <a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>. There is some reason for believing that the weeping of women for Tammuz passed into Syria and Palestine from Babylonia, Tammuz being identified with Duv-zi, whose loss was lamented by the goddess Istar. The festival was identical with the Greek "Adoniacs." The worship of Adonis had its headquarters at Byblos, where at certain periods of the year the stream, becoming stained by mountain floods, was popularly said to be red with the blood of Adonis. From Byblos it spread widely over the east and was thence carried to Greece. The contact of Zedekiah with pagan nations <a href="/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3</a> may very well have led to the introduction of an idolatry which at this time was especially popular among the eastern nations.<p>This solemnity was of a twofold character, first, that of mourning, in which the death of Adonis was bewailed with extravagant sorrow; and then, after a few days, the mourning gave place to wild rejoicings for his restoration to life. This was a revival of nature-worship under another form - the death of Adonis symbolized the suspension of the productive powers of nature, which were in due time revived. Accordingly, the time of this festival was the summer solstice, when in the east nature seems to wither and die under the scorching heat of the sun, to burst forth again into life at the due season. At the same time there was a connection between this and the sun-worship, in that the decline of the sun and the decline of nature might be alike represented by the death of Adonis. The excitement attendant upon these extravagances of alternate wailing and exultation were in complete accordance with the character of nature-worship, which for this reason was so popular in the east, especially with women, and led by inevitable consequence to unbridled license and excess. Such was in Ezekiel's day one of the most detestable forms of idolatry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. From the secret abominations of the chambers of imagery, the prophet's eye is turned to the outer court at the north door; within the outer court women were not admitted, but only to the door.<p>sat&#8212;the attitude of mourners (Job 2:13; Isa 3:26).<p>Tammuz&#8212;from a Hebrew root, "to melt down." Instead of weeping for the national sins, they wept for the idol. Tammuz (the Syrian for Adonis), the paramour of Venus, and of the same name as the river flowing from Lebanon; killed by a wild boar, and, according to the fable, permitted to spend half the year on earth, and obliged to spend the other half in the lower world. An annual feast was celebrated to him in June (hence called Tammuz in the Jewish calendar) at Byblos, when the Syrian women, in wild grief, tore off their hair and yielded their persons to prostitution, consecrating the hire of their infamy to Venus; next followed days of rejoicing for his return to the earth; the former feast being called "the disappearance of Adonis," the latter, "the finding of Adonis." This Phœnician feast answered to the similar Egyptian one in honor of Osiris. The idea thus fabled was that of the waters of the river and the beauties of spring destroyed by the summer heat. Or else, the earth being clothed with beauty, during the half year when the sun is in the upper hemisphere, and losing it when he departs to the lower. The name Adonis is not here used, as Adon is the appropriated title of Jehovah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He brought me, </span> not by real and corporal change of place, but in vision and by representation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the gate</span> of the outer court, or court of the women, so called because they were allowed to come into it, as were all the laity of the Jews: but it is more likely the gate of the inner court, the court of the priests, next to the house of God, whither none save priests might come; but in this very great corruption of the state others were admitted into it, which makes this sin the greater. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Towards the north; </span> he enters at first by the north gate, and so passeth on to what places were next to the temple on that side. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">There sat women:</span> contrary to the law were they come thither, led by their blindest, because the vilest and most impudent, superstition, and waiting (expressed by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">sitting</span>) ready to commit most lewd wickednesses, as part of their obscene and beastly rites. Weeping: this is the only part which is specified of their irreligious religion, commemorating with tears an infamously lustful and unclean whoremonger, or votary of Venus, snatched from her by an unhappy wound of a boar, say some; this weeping implieth all the beastly rites of that idol. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Tammuz; </span> a magician, say some; a handsome young man, but notorious for love of women, say others; an adulterer (say some) slain by his brother, king of Egypt, and mangled in pieces, whose torn members were thrown into the river, but gathered up by the fond adulteresses, and rites of worship fitted to so lewd an idol; whose adulteries, lascivious practices, and immodest gestures these she priests acted over before the idol with men of like lewdness, of whom what they received, as rewards of their prostituting themselves, was offered to Venus. By this means God’s temple was turned into a lewd stews. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord's house, which was towards the north,.... By "the Lord's house" no doubt is meant the temple, which the Targum here calls the house of the sanctuary of the Lord; that gate of the temple (for the temple had several gates) which was to the north was the gate called Teri or Tedi, and was very little used (y). In this part of the temple were the sacrifices offered; and therefore it was the greater abomination to commit idolatry where the Lord was more solemnly worshipped: <p>and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz: they were not in the court of the women, where they should have been; but at the northern gate, near the place of sacrifice; and they were sitting there, which none but the kings of the house of Judah, and of the family of David, were allowed in the temple (z); but, what was the greatest abomination, they were weeping for Tammuz. Jarchi says this was an image, which they heated inwardly, and its eyes were of lead; and these being melted with the heat, it seemed to weep; wherefore (the women) said, it asks for an offering: but not the idol, but the women, wept. Kimchi relates various interpretations of it; <p>"some (he says) expound it by an antiphrasis, "making Tammuz glad"; in the month of Tammuz they made a feast to the idol, and the women came to make him glad: others say, that with great diligence they brought water to the eyes of the idol called Tammuz, and it wept; signifying that it desired they would worship it: others interpret the word Tammuz as signifying "burnt"; (from the words in <a href="/daniel/3-19.htm">Daniel 3:19</a>; , "to heat the furnace";) as if should say, they wept for him, because he was for they burnt their sons and daughters in the fire, and the women wept for them. He further observes, that Maimonides (a) writes, that he found written in one of the books of the ancient idolaters, that there was a man of the idolatrous prophets, whose name was Tammuz; who called to a certain king, and commanded him to worship the seven stars, and the twelve signs of the zodiac, for which the king put him to a violent death; and, the same night he died, all the images from the ends of the earth gathered together to the temple of Babylon, to a golden image which was the image of the sun; and this image was hanging between the heavens and the earth, and it fell into the midst of the temple, and so all the images round about it; and it declared unto them what had happened to Tammuz the prophet; and all the images wept and lamented all that night; and when it was morning, they all fled to their temples at the ends of the earth; and this became an everlasting statute to them, that at the beginning of the first day of the month Tammuz, every year, they lament and weeps for Tammuz; and there are others that expound Tammuz the name of a beast which they worship;'' <p>but, leaving these interpretations, Tammuz was either the Adonis of the Grecians; and so the Vulgate Latin version renders it Adonis; who was a young man beloved by Venus, and, being killed by a boar, his death was lamented by her; and, in respect to the goddess, an anniversary solemnity was kept by men and women lamenting his death, especially by women. So Pausanias, speaking of a certain place, there (says he) the women of the Argives (a people in Greece) mourn for Adonis (b). Lucian (c) gives a particular account of this ceremony, as performed at Byblus, a city in Phoenicia, not far from Judea; from whence the Jews might have borrowed this custom. <p>"I have seen (says he), in Byblus, a large temple of Venus Byblia, where they performed the rites unto Adonis, and I was a spectator of them. The Byblians say the affair relating to Adonis (or his death) by a boar happened in their country; and, in memory of it, every year they beat themselves, lament and offer sacrifice, and great mourning goes through the whole country; and when they beat themselves and mourn, they sacrifice to Adonis as dead; but the day following they pretend he is alive; and they shave their heads, as the Egyptians do at the death of Apis;'' <p>and indeed it is thought by some that this Tammuz is the Osiris of the Egyptians; the same with Mizraim, the first king of Egypt, who, being slain in battle, his wife his ordered that he should be worshipped as a god, and a yearly lamentation made for him; and indeed Osiris and Adonis seem to be one and the same, only in different nations called by different names. Mention is made in Plato (d) of Thamus, a king that reigned at Thebes over all Egypt, and was the god called Ammon; no doubt the same with this Tammuz; and who is here called, in the Syriac and Arabic versions, Thamuz or Tamuz; he seems to be the same with Ham; and Egypt was called, the land of Ham, <a href="/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>; and it is most probable the Jews borrowed this piece of idolatry from the Egyptians their neighbours; with whom they were now very familiar, and from whom they expected help against the Chaldeans; but as there were such shocking obscenities used in this idolatrous service, it is most amazing that the Jewish women, who had been instructed in the law and worship of God, should ever go into it. Gussetius (e) thinks that Bacchus, the god of wine, is meant; and gives several reasons for it; and among the rest observes, that in the fourth month, called Tammuz from him, the vine was forming in ripe grapes; near the beginning of a fifth month, it was pressed out, and tunned up; and by the next month, having done fermenting, it was stopped up, which represented him buried; and for which the weeping was in this month. <p>(y) Misn.

The women may have been seen sitting outside the gate, or they may have been in some of the chambers of the outer gateway. Of course the temple building in Ezekiel’s time did not quite correspond to his ideal sketch in ch. 40 seq., but there were no doubt chambers at that time connected with both gateways (<a href="/jeremiah/35-2.htm" title="Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.">Jeremiah 35:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/35-4.htm" title="And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:">Jeremiah 35:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm" title="Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.">Jeremiah 36:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-12.htm" title="Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, see, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.">Jeremiah 36:12</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/36-20.htm" title="And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king....">Jeremiah 36:20-21</a>; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/26-10.htm" title="When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house.">Jeremiah 26:10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-11.htm" title="And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.">2 Kings 23:11</a>). Tammuz is identical with Adonis. The latter name, <span class="ital">Adon</span>, “Lord,” is not a proper name, being applicable to any great god, but when the myth found its way to Greece, the word became a proper name. The name Tammuz is Babylonian Dumu-zi, Dûzi, said to signify “son of life,” and to indicate the eternal youth of the sun-god (cf. Fried. Del. in Baer’s <span class="ital">Ezek</span>.; Schrader, <span class="ital">KAT</span>. on <a href="/ezekiel/8-14.htm" title="Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.">Ezekiel 8:14</a>; Sayce, <span class="ital">Hibbert Lect</span>. IV). The story of the death of Tammuz is said to be a solar myth, having reference to the death of the sun-god. The explanations given by Assyrian scholars are not very clear. Sometimes the death is said to be that which he undergoes each night, sometimes that which he undergoes when he expires before the touch of winter, and sometimes the death is that of the lusty, life-giving vernal god, who perishes along with all life on earth amidst the summer fires which he himself has kindled. The town of Gebal or Byblos, eight miles north of Beirut, was the great seat of the Adonis worship in Phenicia. It is possible that the cult passed westward from Babylonia, but it may be that in Syria the rites had an independent origin and a different meaning, and that it was not till later that they were interpreted in the sense of the Babylonian myth (W. R. Smith, <span class="ital">Religion of the Semites</span>, index under Adonis). It was probably from Phenicia that the worship entered Judæa. Milton’s interpretation of the rites may not quite exhaust their meaning:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>the love tale<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Infected Zion’s daughters with like heat;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ezekiel saw.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such myths may originally be only beautiful nature poetry, but we are so allied to nature that we see our feelings reflected in her, as on the other hand her moods repeat themselves in us. Particularly in times of decay and loss the sadder aspects of nature intensify our own feeling by presenting to our minds a universal decay in which we and all things are involved. It is only the sorrowful side of the Tammuz rite that the prophet refers to.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, there sat women wailing for Tammuz.</span> The point of view is probably the same as that of ver. 3, but the women were apparently in the outer porch of it, as he has to be brought to the gate in order to see them. We are led to note two things: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the general prominence of women in the later idolatry of Judah; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the specific character of the Tammuz worship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Under <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> we have the women who wove hangings for the Ashera (<a href="/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>), those who had burnt incense to other gods, especially to the queen of heaven (<a href="/jeremiah/44-9.htm">Jeremiah 44:9, 15-19</a>), probably, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to Ashtaroth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The name <span class="accented">Tammuz</span> does not meet us elsewhere in the Old Testament. All interpreters, however, agree that it answers to the Adonis of Greek mythology. So Jerome translates it, and expressly states (<span class="accented">in loc</span>.) that what Ezekiel saw corresponded to the Adonis festivals. It may be enough to state, without going into the details of the story, that Adonis, the beautiful youth beloved of Aphrodite, was slain by a wild boar; that after his death he was allowed to spend six months of each year with her, while the other was passed with Persephone in Hades. The cultus thus became the symbol of the annual decay and revival of nature; but the legend rather than the inner meaning was in the thoughts of the worshippers. The emotions of women poured themselves out in lamentations over the waxen image of the beautiful dead youth who had perished in his prime, and in orgiastic joy over his return to life. Milton, deriving his knowledge, probably, from Selden's 'De Diis Syris,' has painted the whole atone in words which may well be quoted - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Thammuz next came behind,<br />Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured<br />The Syrian damsels to lament his fate<br />In amorous ditties all a summer's day;<br />While smooth Adonis from his native rock<br />Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood<br />Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale<br />Infected Sion's daughters with like heat;<br />Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch<br />Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led,<br />His eyes surveyed the dark idolatries<br />Of alienated Judah."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Par. Lost,' 1:446, etc.</span>) The chief centre of the Tammuz-Adonis worship was Byblos, in Syria. but it spread widely over the shores of the Mediterranean and was fashionable both in Alexandria and Athens. One of the practices of the festival, that of planting flowers in vases for forced cultivation, has been perpetuated by Plato's allusion to "the gardens of Adonis" as the type of transitoriness ('Phaedr.' p. 376, b). Cheyne, following Lagarde, finds a reference to the cultus in <a href="/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>: 66:17. The festival of Ishtar and Tammuz (or <span class="accented">Tam-zi</span>) at Babylon presented a marked parallel. Adonis is, with hardly a doubt, identical with the Hebrew <span class="accented">Adonai</span> (equivalent to "Lord"). <span class="accented">Tammuz</span> has been explained as meaning "victorious," or "disappearance," or "burning;" but all etymologies are conjectural. Lastly, it is not without interest to note <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that when Jerome wrote, the Cave of the Nativity at Bethlehem was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz ('Ep. ad Paul.'); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the later Jewish calendar included the month of Tammuz, which corresponded to July. The festival seems to have been celebrated at the summer solstice. The time of Ezekiel's vision was in the sixth month, <span class="accented">sc.</span> about the time of the autumnal equinox (see 'Dict. Bible,' art. "Tammuz"). Mr. Baring-Gould, treating the legend as a solar myth, finds the old Phoenician deity represented in the "St. George of Merrie England" ('Curious Myths,' pp. 277-316). An exhaustive monograph, "Tammuz Adonis," has been published by Liebrecht, in his 'Zur Volkskunde' (1879), reprinted from the <span class="accented">Zeitschrift Deutschen Morgen-Gesellschaft</span>, vol. 17. pp. 397, etc. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Abominations of the Idolatry of the House of Israel<p>Time and place of the divine revelation. - <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>. And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth (month), on the fifth (day) of the month, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me; there fell upon me the hand of the Lord Jehovah there. <a href="/ezekiel/8-2.htm">Ezekiel 8:2</a>. And I saw, and behold a figure like the look of fire, from the look of its loins downwards fire, and from its loins upwards like a look of brilliance, like the sight of red-hot brass. <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>. And he stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by the locks of my head, and wind carried me away between earth and heaven, and brought me to Jerusalem in visions of God, to the entrance of the gate of the inner court, which faces towards the north, where the image of jealousy exciting jealousy had its stand. <a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>. And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision which I have seen in the valley. - The place where Ezekiel received this new theophany agrees with the statements in <a href="/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-6.htm">Ezekiel 4:6</a>, that he was to shut himself up in his house, and lie 390 days upon the left side, and 40 days upon the right side - in all, 430 days. The use of the word &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, "I sat," is not at variance with this, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; does not of necessity signify sitting as contrasted with lying, but may also be used in the more general sense of staying, or living, in the house. Nor is the presence of the elders of Judah opposed to the command, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24</a>, to shut himself up in the house, as we have already observed in the notes on that passage. The new revelation is made to him in the presence of these elders, because it is of the greatest importance to them. They are to be witnesses of his ecstasy; and after this has left the prophet, are to hear from his lips the substance of the divine revelation (<a href="/ezekiel/11-25.htm">Ezekiel 11:25</a>). It is otherwise with the time of the revelation. If we compare the date given in <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a> with those mentioned before, this new vision apparently falls within the period required for carrying out the symbolical actions of the previous vision. Between <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1-2</a> (the fifth day of the fourth month in the fifth year) and <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a> (the fifth day of the sixth month in the sixth year) we have one year and two months, that is to say (reckoning the year as a lunar year at 354 days, and the two months at 59 days), 413 days; whereas the two events recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1-7</a> require at least 437 days, namely 7 days for <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>, and 390 + 40  equals  430 days for <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-5.htm">Ezekiel 4:5-6</a>. Consequently the new theophany would fall within the 40 days, during which Ezekiel was to lie upon the right side for Judah. To get rid of this difficulty, Hitzig conjectures that the fifth year of Jehoiachin (<a href="/ezekiel/1-2.htm">Ezekiel 1:2</a>) was a leap year of 13 months or 385 days, by which he obtains an interval of 444 days after adding 59 for the two months, - a period sufficient not only to include the 7 days (<a href="/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>) and 390 + 40 days (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-5.htm">Ezekiel 4:5-6</a>), but to leave 7 days for the time that elapsed between <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/7.htm">Ezekiel 7</a> and 8. But however attractive this reckoning may appear, the assumption that the fifth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin was a leap year is purely conjectural; and there is nothing whatever to give it probability. Consequently the only thing that could lead us to adopt such a solution, would be the impossibility of reconciling the conclusion to be drawn from the chronological data, as to the time of the two theophanies, with the substance of these divine revelations.<p>If we assume that Ezekiel carried out the symbolical acts mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4</a> and 5 in all their entirety, we can hardly imagine that the vision described in the chapters before us, by which he was transported in spirit to Jerusalem, occurred within the period of forty days, during which he was to typify the siege of Jerusalem by lying upon his right side. Nevertheless, Kliefoth has decided in favour of this view, and argues in support of it, that the vision described in <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>. took place in the prophet's own house, that it is identical in substance with what is contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22-7:27</a>, and that there is no discrepancy, because all that occurred here was purely internal, and the prophet himself was to address the words contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-4.htm">Ezekiel 11:4-12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-14.htm">Ezekiel 11:14-21</a> to the inhabitants of Jerusalem in his state of ecstasy. Moreover, when it is stated in <a href="/ezekiel/11-25.htm">Ezekiel 11:25</a> that Ezekiel related to the exiles all that he had seen in the vision, it is perfectly open to us to assume that this took place at the same time as his report to them of the words of God in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-1.htm">Ezekiel 6:1-14</a> and 7, and those which follow in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/12.htm">Ezekiel 12</a>. But. on the other hand, it may be replied that the impression produced by <a href="/ezekiel/11-25.htm">Ezekiel 11:25</a> is not that the prophet waited several weeks after his visionary transport to Jerusalem before communicating to the elders what he saw in the vision. And even if the possibility of this cannot be disputed, we cannot imagine any reason why the vision should be shown to the prophet four weeks before it was to be related to the exiles. Again, there is not sufficient identity between the substance of the vision in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8.htm">Ezekiel 8-11</a> and the revelation in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4-7</a>, to suggest any motive for the two to coincide. It is true that the burning of Jerusalem, which Ezekiel sees in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8.htm">Ezekiel 8-11</a>, is consequent upon the siege and conquest of that city, which he has already predicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4-7</a> both in figure and word; but they are not so closely connected, that it was necessary on account of this connection for it to be shown to him before the completion of the symbolical siege of Jerusalem. And, lastly, although the ecstasy as a purely internal process is so far reconcilable with the prophet's lying upon his right side, that this posture did not preclude a state of ecstasy or render it impossible, yet this collision would ensue, that while the prophet was engaged in carrying out the former word of God, a new theophany would be received by him, which must necessarily abstract his mind from the execution of the previous command of God, and place him in a condition in which it would be impossible for him to set his face firmly upon the siege of Jerusalem, as he had been commanded to do in <a href="/ezekiel/4-7.htm">Ezekiel 4:7</a>. On account of this collision, we cannot subscribe to the assumption, that it was during the time that Ezekiel was lying bound by God upon his right side to bear the sin of Jerusalem, that he was transported in spirit to the temple at Jerusalem. On the contrary, the fact that this transport occurred, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>, at a time when he could not have ended the symbolical acts of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4</a>, if he had been required to carry them out in all their external reality, furnishes us with conclusive evidence of the correctness of the view we have already expressed, that the symbolical acts of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4</a> and 5 did not lie within the sphere of outward reality (see comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/5-4.htm">Ezekiel 5:4</a>). - And if Ezekiel did not really lie for 430 days, there was nothing to hinder his having a fresh vision 14 months after the theophany in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>. For '&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491; , see at <a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>.<p>The figure which Ezekiel sees in the vision is described in <a href="/ezekiel/8-2.htm">Ezekiel 8:2</a> in precisely the same terms as the appearance of God in <a href="/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27</a>. The sameness of the two passages is a sufficient defence of the reading &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; against the arbitrary emendation &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; '&#1499;&#1501;, after the Sept. rendering &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, in support of which Ewald and Hitzig appeal to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>, though without any reason, as the reading there is not &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, but &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;. It is not expressly stated here that the apparition was in human form - the fiery appearance is all that is mentioned; but this is taken for granted in the allusion to the &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (the loins), either as self-evident, or as well known from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. &#1494;&#1492;&#1512; is synonymous with &#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27</a>. What is new in the present theophany is the stretching out of the hand, which grasps the prophet by the front hair of his head, whereupon he is carried by wind between heaven and earth, i.e., through the air, to Jerusalem, not in the body, but in visions of God (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>), that is to say, in spiritual ecstasy, and deposited at the entrance of the inner northern door of the temple. &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; is not an adjective belonging to &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, for this is not a feminine noun, but is used as a substantive, as in <a href="/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a> ( equals  &#1492;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;: cf. <a href="/ezekiel/40-40.htm">Ezekiel 40:40</a>): gate of the inner court, i.e., the gate on the north side of the inner court which led into the outer court. We are not informed whether Ezekiel was placed on the inner or outer side of this gate, i.e., in the inner or outer court; but it is evident from <a href="/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5</a> that he was placed in the inner court, as his position commanded a view of the image which stood at the entrance of the gate towards the north. The further statement, "where the standing place of the image of jealousy was," anticipates what follows, and points out the reason why the prophet was placed just there. The expression "image of jealousy" is explained by &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, which excites the jealousy of Jehovah (see the comm. on <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Consequently, we have not to think of any image of Jehovah, but of an image of a heathen idol (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>); probably of Baal or Asherah, whose image had already been placed in the temple by Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-7.htm">2 Kings 21:7</a>); certainly not the image of the corpse of Adonis moulded in wax or clay. This opinion, which Hvernick advances, is connected with the erroneous assumption that all the idolatrous abominations mentioned in this chapter relate to the celebration of an Adonis-festival in the temple. There (<a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>) in the court of the temple Ezekiel saw once more the glory of the God of Israel, as he had seen it in the valley (<a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>) by the Chaboras, i.e., the appearance of God upon the throne with the cherubim and wheels; whereas the divine figure, whose hand grasped him in his house, and transported him to the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/8-2.htm">Ezekiel 8:2</a>), showed neither throne nor cherubim. The expression "God of Israel," instead of Jehovah (<a href="/ezekiel/3-23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23</a>), is chosen as an antithesis to the strange god, the heathen idol, whose image stood in the temple. As the God of Israel, Jehovah cannot tolerate the image and worship of another god in His temple. To set up such an image in the temple of Jehovah was a practical renunciation of the covenant, a rejection of Jehovah on the part of Israel as its covenant God.<p>Here, in the temple, Jehovah shows to the prophet the various kinds of idolatry which Israel is practising both publicly and privately, not merely in the temple, but throughout the whole land. The arrangement of these different forms of idolatry in four groups of abomination scenes (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-7.htm">Ezekiel 8:7-12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-13.htm">Ezekiel 8:13-15</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16-18</a>), which the prophet sees both in and from the court of the temple, belong to the visionary drapery of this divine revelation. It is altogether erroneous to interpret the vision as signifying that all these forms of idolatry were practised in the temple itself; an assumption which cannot be carried out without doing violence to the description, more especially of the second abomination in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-7.htm">Ezekiel 8:7-12</a>. Still more untenable is Hvernick's view, that the four pictures of idolatrous practices shown to the prophet are only intended to represent different scenes of a festival of Adonis held in the temple. The selection of the courts of the temple for depicting the idolatrous worship, arises from the fact that the temple was the place where Israel was called to worship the Lord its God. Consequently the apostasy of Israel from the Lord could not be depicted more clearly and strikingly than by the following series of pictures of idolatrous abominations practised in the temple under the eyes of God. </body></html>
