Or, were "foursquare" (n); the two posts on each side the door, the lintel and the threshold, made a square; the posts themselves were not round, as pillars, but flat and square; and the upper part was not arched, as in some buildings, but square. Jarchi says he had heard that the posts of Solomon's temple were foursquare; but that is not certain; however, these were. The Vulgate Latin version renders it "four cornered"; as doors formerly were: this was the ancient way of building, as Philander (o) observes; almost everything in this wonderful building was foursquare; denoting the firmness, stability, and perfection of all things in it: <p>and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other; that is, the front of the holy of holies was like that of the temple; they both had the same appearance, though one was larger than another. The posts of the one were squared, even as the posts of the other; showing that the same is the way of entrance into the Gospel church and into the New Jerusalem church state, and even into the heavenly glory, which is Christ; and, whether in the less or more perfect state of the church on earth, there are the same precious faith, and love, and communion, though different degrees.

The word “temple” (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/41-20.htm" title="From the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.">Ezekiel 41:20</a></span>) being omitted the words read: <span class="ital">and the wall</span>, 21 <span class="ital">of the temple was square door-posts</span>—a construction scarcely possible to express the idea that the wall <span class="ital">had</span> square door-posts. Syriac read: and the wall of the temple was four-square—omitting “door-posts.” LXX.: and the holy place (holiest) and the temple opened (spread out) four-square—reading “holy place” for wall, and “opened” for door-posts. It is probable that something is said of the holiest, because the next clause refers to an article that stood in front of it. It is also probable that the “door” referred to <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/41-20.htm" title="From the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.">Ezekiel 41:20</a></span> is that from the holy place into the holiest. But the witnesses leave us uncertain whether something be said about the wall or about the door-posts. If of the first the reading may be: <span class="ital">and the wall of the holiest was four-square</span> (Hitz., Corn.). Reference, however, might be to the door-posts. In Solomon’s temple those of the holy place appear to have been four-cornered, and those of the holiest five-cornered (<a href="/1_kings/6-31.htm" title="And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.">1 Kings 6:31</a>; <a href="/1_kings/6-33.htm" title="So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.">1 Kings 6:33</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">face of the sanctuary</span> … the other] This has no probability. The clause is rather to be connected with <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/41-22.htm" title="The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table that is before the LORD.">Ezekiel 41:22</a></span>. Perhaps: <span class="bld">and in front of the sanctuary</span> (the holiest) <span class="bld">was the appearance as the appearance 22 of an altar of wood, three cubits the height thereof</span>, &c. So LXX. and partly Syr. In the holy place in front of the holiest there stood an object having the appearance of an altar of wood. The present text might read: “and (as for) the front of the sanctuary, the appearance was as the appearance,” i.e. it had the appearance which is well known and does not need further description—a form of speech common enough in Shemitic, but quite improbable here.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The posts of the temple were squared</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as for the temple the doorposts</span> were <span class="accented">squared</span>, or "the sanctuary post work of square form" (Keil). The remaining clauses ought to read as in the Revised Version, "As for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance <span class="accented">thereof</span> was as the appearance <span class="accented">of the temple</span>," the sanctuary being the holy of holies as distinguished from the holy place or the house as a whole, The precise force of the last words, <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">appearance as the appearance</span>, is supposed by Kliefoth and Keil to be that the sanctuary door, like that of the temple, had square pests; by Ewald, that it appeared to be what it really was; by Plumptre, that the appearance was like that he (Ezekiel) had formerly described: by Currey, that the appearance in this vision was the same as in the other visions, and as in the actual temple (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>). Something can be said for each of these attempts to elucidate a dark phrase.
