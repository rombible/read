The wall of the house at its base was 6 cubits thick, and the breadth (N. to S.) of the side-chambers on the basement was 4 cubits.

Round about the wall of the house on three sides (N., W. and S.) were built side-chambers in three stories, thirty chambers in each story, Fig. 2, D. The chamber on the ground floor was 4 cubits wide (N. to S.), but in the second story the width was greater than in the first, and in the third story greater than in the second. The reason of this greater wideness of the upper stories was that the wall of the house on which the chambers were built diminished in thickness as it ascended. This wall was 6 cubits thick at the base (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/41-5.htm" title="After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.">Ezekiel 41:5</a></span>), but it was let in at two points as it ascended. The same arrangement had place in Solomon’s temple—“on the outside he made rebatements in the wall of the house round about” (<a href="/1_kings/6-6.htm" title="The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.">1 Kings 6:6</a>). The effect of this decrease in the thickness of the wall (in Solomon’s temple a cubit each time) was that the chambers in the second and third stories became so much broader. In consequence of this narrowing of the wall of the house at two points two ledges ran round the wall on three sides, and on these ledges the beams that supported the second and third stories of the side-chambers rested, without being let into the wall (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/41-6.htm" title="And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.">Ezekiel 41:6</a></span>). The wall of the side-chambers was thus on one side the wall of the house; on the other side they had a wall of their own, 5 cubits thick (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/41-9.htm" title="The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.">Ezekiel 41:9</a></span>).

Further, on the walls of the inner court, N. and S., were chambers for the priests, Fig. 3, GG´, and between the temple-platform and these cells ran a passage or court of 20 cubits (“the separate place,” <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/41-12.htm" title="Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.">Ezekiel 41:12</a></span>). This court ran round the house-platform on three sides (N. W. S.), Fig. 3, H.

This description of Israel's mode of life also points beyond the times succeeding the Babylonian captivity to the Messianic days, when the Lord will have destroyed the horses and war-chariots and fortresses (<a href="/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>), and Jerusalem will be inhabited as an open country because of the multitude of the men and cattle, and the Lord will be a wall of fire round about her (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8-9</a>).

One motive of Gog for making the attack was to be found in the possessions of Israel; a second is given in the words: who dwell upon the navel of the earth. This figurative expression is to be explained from <a href="/ezekiel/5-5.htm">Ezekiel 5:5</a> : "Jerusalem in the midst of the nations." This navel is not a figure denoting the high land, but signifies the land situated in the middle of the earth, and therefore the land most glorious and most richly blessed; so that they who dwell there occupy the most exalted position among the nations. A covetous desire for the possessions of the people of God, and envy at his exalted position in the centre of the world, are therefore the motives by which Gog is impelled to enter upon his predatory expedition against the people living in the depth of peace. This covetousness is so great, that even the rich trading populations of Sabaea, Dedan, and Tarshish (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-20.htm">Ezekiel 27:20</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>) perceive it, and declare that it is this alone which has determined Gog to undertake his expedition. The words of these peoples (<a href="/ezekiel/38-13.htm">Ezekiel 38:13</a>) are not to be taken as expressing their sympathies (Kliefoth), but serve to give prominence to the obvious thirst for booty which characterizes the multitude led by Gog. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, their young lions, are the rapacious rulers of these trading communities, according to <a href="/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>. - <a href="/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a> introduces the announcement of the punishment, which consists of another summary account of the daring enterprise of Gog and his hosts (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4-9</a>), and a clear statement of the design of God in leading him against His people and land. &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a>, close), of which different renderings have been given, does not mean, thou wilt experience, or be aware of, the punishment; but the object is to be taken from the context: thou wilt know, or perceive, sc. that Israel dwells securely, not expecting any hostile invasion. The rendering of the lxx (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;) does not furnish any satisfactory ground for altering &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; into &#1514;&#1506;&#1512;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512; (Ewald, Hitzig). With the words '&#1493;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; (<a href="/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>) the opening thought of the whole picture (<a href="/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>) is resumed and defined with greater precision, for the purpose of attaching to it the declaration of the design of the Lord in bringing Gog, namely, to sanctify Himself upon him before the eyes of the nations (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a>). </body></html>
