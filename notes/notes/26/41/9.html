This description of Israel's mode of life also points beyond the times succeeding the Babylonian captivity to the Messianic days, when the Lord will have destroyed the horses and war-chariots and fortresses (<a href="/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>), and Jerusalem will be inhabited as an open country because of the multitude of the men and cattle, and the Lord will be a wall of fire round about her (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8-9</a>).

One motive of Gog for making the attack was to be found in the possessions of Israel; a second is given in the words: who dwell upon the navel of the earth. This figurative expression is to be explained from <a href="/ezekiel/5-5.htm">Ezekiel 5:5</a> : "Jerusalem in the midst of the nations." This navel is not a figure denoting the high land, but signifies the land situated in the middle of the earth, and therefore the land most glorious and most richly blessed; so that they who dwell there occupy the most exalted position among the nations. A covetous desire for the possessions of the people of God, and envy at his exalted position in the centre of the world, are therefore the motives by which Gog is impelled to enter upon his predatory expedition against the people living in the depth of peace. This covetousness is so great, that even the rich trading populations of Sabaea, Dedan, and Tarshish (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-20.htm">Ezekiel 27:20</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>) perceive it, and declare that it is this alone which has determined Gog to undertake his expedition. The words of these peoples (<a href="/ezekiel/38-13.htm">Ezekiel 38:13</a>) are not to be taken as expressing their sympathies (Kliefoth), but serve to give prominence to the obvious thirst for booty which characterizes the multitude led by Gog. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, their young lions, are the rapacious rulers of these trading communities, according to <a href="/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>. - <a href="/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a> introduces the announcement of the punishment, which consists of another summary account of the daring enterprise of Gog and his hosts (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4-9</a>), and a clear statement of the design of God in leading him against His people and land. &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a>, close), of which different renderings have been given, does not mean, thou wilt experience, or be aware of, the punishment; but the object is to be taken from the context: thou wilt know, or perceive, sc. that Israel dwells securely, not expecting any hostile invasion.
