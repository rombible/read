I will make known my holy name in the midst of my people Israel, and will not let my holy name be profaned any more, that the nations may know that I am Jehovah, holy in Israel. <a href="/ezekiel/39-8.htm">Ezekiel 39:8</a>. Behold, it comes and happens, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah; this is the day of which I spoke. - The further description of the judgment with which Gog and his hosts are threatened in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-21.htm">Ezekiel 38:21-23</a>, commences with a repetition of the command to the prophet to prophesy against Gog (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-1.htm">Ezekiel 39:1</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-2.htm">Ezekiel 38:2-3</a>).

The judgment will not be confined to the destruction of the army of Gog, which has invaded the land of Israel, but (<a href="/ezekiel/39-6.htm">Ezekiel 39:6</a>) will also extend to the land of Gog, and to all the heathen nations that are dwelling in security. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, fire, primarily the fire of war; then, in a further sense, a figure denoting destruction inflicted directly by God, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>, which is therefore represented in <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a> as fire falling from heaven. Magog is the population of the land of Magog (<a href="/ezekiel/38-2.htm">Ezekiel 38:2</a>). With this the inhabitants of the distant coastlands of the west (the &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;) are associated, as representatives of the remotest heathen nations. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/39-8.htm">Ezekiel 39:8</a>.
