The last verse states that narrow or closed (as in ver. 16) windows admitted light into the porch, while carvings of palm trees adorned its walls on each side. The cherubic figures, Plumptre hints, were absent, because the porch was a place of less sanctity than the temple. Hengstenberg notes that the words, "thick planks," "thick beams," or "steps," as he translates, fitly close this description, "as placing the extreme east over against the extreme west with which it began." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/39.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Further Description of the Judgment to Fall upon Gog and his Hosts<p><a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-1.htm">Ezekiel 39:1-8</a>.
