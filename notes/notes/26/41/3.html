Kliefoth and Keil take the six as the height and the seven as the breadth of the entrance into the holy of holies; but as no other measurement of height occurs throughout this description, Dr. Currey regards "six" as the distance from "pest" to "post," and "seven" as the actual width of the door, each post projecting half a cubit beyond the hinge of the door, which opened inward. Ewald and Villalpandus, after the LXX., read, "the entrance six cubits and the flanks of the entrance seven cubits;" and these figures, 7 + 6 4- 7, certainly make up the breadth of the interior; only it is impossible to extract this meaning from the Hebrew without tampering with the text. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/38.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Account of the motive by which Gog was induced to undertake his warlike expedition, and incurred guilt, notwithstanding the fact that he was led by God, and in consequence of which he brought upon himself the judgment of destruction that was about to fall upon him. - <a href="/ezekiel/38-10.htm">Ezekiel 38:10</a>.

What things these are, we learn from <a href="/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/38-12.htm">Ezekiel 38:12</a>; but first of all, these things are described as evil thoughts or designs. Gog resolves to fall upon Israel, now living in peace and security, and dwelling in open unfortified places, and to rob and plunder it. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; , literally, land of plains, i.e., a land which has no fortified towns, but only places lying quite exposed (see the comm. on <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>); because its inhabitants are living in undisturbed peace and safe repose, and therefore dwell in places that have no walls with gates and bars (cf. <a href="/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-31.htm">Jeremiah 49:31</a>). This description of Israel's mode of life also points beyond the times succeeding the Babylonian captivity to the Messianic days, when the Lord will have destroyed the horses and war-chariots and fortresses (<a href="/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>), and Jerusalem will be inhabited as an open country because of the multitude of the men and cattle, and the Lord will be a wall of fire round about her (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8-9</a>). For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-12.htm">Ezekiel 38:12</a>, compare <a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>. &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1497;&#1491;&#1498; is not dependent upon &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, like the preceding infinitives, but is subordinate to &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;: "thou sayest, I will go up...to turn thy hand." &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to bring back, is to be explained from the fact that the heathen had already at an earlier period turned their hand against the towns of Israel, and plundered their possessions and goods. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; in this connection are desolate places which are inhabited again, and therefore have been rebuilt (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/12-20.htm">Ezekiel 12:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/26-19.htm">Ezekiel 26:19</a>). &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; are synonyms; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; does not mean flocks or herds, but gain, possession (cf. <a href="/genesis/36-6.htm">Genesis 36:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-18.htm">Genesis 31:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/34-23.htm">Genesis 34:23</a>). One motive of Gog for making the attack was to be found in the possessions of Israel; a second is given in the words: who dwell upon the navel of the earth. This figurative expression is to be explained from <a href="/ezekiel/5-5.htm">Ezekiel 5:5</a> : "Jerusalem in the midst of the nations." This navel is not a figure denoting the high land, but signifies the land situated in the middle of the earth, and therefore the land most glorious and most richly blessed; so that they who dwell there occupy the most exalted position among the nations. A covetous desire for the possessions of the people of God, and envy at his exalted position in the centre of the world, are therefore the motives by which Gog is impelled to enter upon his predatory expedition against the people living in the depth of peace. This covetousness is so great, that even the rich trading populations of Sabaea, Dedan, and Tarshish (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-20.htm">Ezekiel 27:20</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>) perceive it, and declare that it is this alone which has determined Gog to undertake his expedition. The words of these peoples (<a href="/ezekiel/38-13.htm">Ezekiel 38:13</a>) are not to be taken as expressing their sympathies (Kliefoth), but serve to give prominence to the obvious thirst for booty which characterizes the multitude led by Gog. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, their young lions, are the rapacious rulers of these trading communities, according to <a href="/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>. - <a href="/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a> introduces the announcement of the punishment, which consists of another summary account of the daring enterprise of Gog and his hosts (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4-9</a>), and a clear statement of the design of God in leading him against His people and land. &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-14.htm">Ezekiel 38:14</a>, close), of which different renderings have been given, does not mean, thou wilt experience, or be aware of, the punishment; but the object is to be taken from the context: thou wilt know, or perceive, sc. that Israel dwells securely, not expecting any hostile invasion. The rendering of the lxx (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;) does not furnish any satisfactory ground for altering &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; into &#1514;&#1506;&#1512;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512; (Ewald, Hitzig).
