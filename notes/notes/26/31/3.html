The Hebrew text, as rendered in all versions and interpreted by most commentators, gives us, in the form of the parable of the cedar, the history of the Assyrian empire in its glory and its fall. That had passed away in spite of its greatness, and so should Egypt. The question in Ver. 18 takes the place of "Thou art the man!" in Nathan's interpretation of his parable (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), or the <span class="accented">mutato nominee de te fabula, narratur</span> of the Roman satirist. Some recent commentaters, however, either like Ewald, taking the Hebrew word for, Assyrian" as describing a particular kind of cedar or fir tree, or, like Comill and amend, adopting a conjectural emendation of the text which actually gives that meaning (<span class="accented">Tasshur</span> for <span class="accented">Asshur</span>), refer the whole parable primarily to Egypt, and dwell on the fact that the words of Vers. 10, 18 are addressed to the living representative of a great monarchy, and not to a power that has already passed away into the Hades of departed glory. The former view seems to me the more tenable of the two, and I therefore adopt it throughout the chapter. It may be admitted, however, that the inner meaning of the parable at times breaks through the outward imagery, as was indeed to be expected, the prophet seeking to apply his apologue even before he had completed it. The "cedar in Lebanon" has already met us as the symbol of s kingdom, in <a href="/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The shadowing shroud</span> may be noted as a specially vivid picture of the peculiar foliage of the cedar rendered with singular felicity. <span class="cmt_word">His top was among the thick boughs</span>; better, <span class="accented">clouds, as</span> in the margin of the Revised Version.

For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians out of the nations, whither they were scattered. <a href="/ezekiel/29-14.htm">Ezekiel 29:14</a>. And I will turn the captivity of Egypt, and will bring them back into the land of Pathros, into the land of their origin, and they shall be a lowly kingdom there. <a href="/ezekiel/29-15.htm">Ezekiel 29:15</a>. Lowlier than the kingdoms shall it be, and exalt itself no more over the nations; and I will make them small, so that they shall rule no more over the nations. <a href="/ezekiel/29-16.htm">Ezekiel 29:16</a>. And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance when they incline towards it; and they shall learn that I am the Lord Jehovah. - The turning of the period of Egypt's punishment is connected by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, which refers to the time indicated, viz., "forty years." For forty years shall Egypt be utterly laid waste; for after the expiration of that period the Lord will gather the Egyptians again from their dispersion among the nations, turn their captivity, i.e., put an end to their suffering (see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/16-53.htm">Ezekiel 16:53</a>), and lead them back into the land of their birth, i.e., of their origin (for &#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, see <a href="/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>), namely, to Pathros. &#1508;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1505;, the Egyptian Petore&#772;s (&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, lxx <a href="/jeremiah/44-1.htm">Jeremiah 44:1</a>), or south land, i.e., Upper Egypt, the Thebais of the Greeks and Romans. The designation of Upper Egypt as the mother country of the Egyptians, or the land of their nativity, is confirmed not only by the accounts given by Herodotus (ii. 4 and 15) and Diodorus Sic. (i. 50), but also by the Egyptian mythology, according to which the first king who reigned after the gods, viz., Menes or Mena, sprang from the city of Thinis (Thynis), Egypt. Tenj, in the neighbourhood of Abydos in Upper Egypt, and founded the city of Memphis in Lower Egypt, which became so celebrated in later times (vid., Brugsch, Histoire d'Egypte, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/16.htm">1 Peter 16</a>). But Egypt shall not attain to its former power any more. It will be and continue a lowly kingdom, that it may not again become a ground of confidence to Israel, a power upon which Israel can rely, so as to fall into guilt and punishment. The subject to &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is Egypt as a nation, notwithstanding the fact that it has previously been construed in the feminine as a land or kingdom, and in &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; the Egyptians are spoken of in the plural number. For it is out of the question to take &#1502;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; as the subject to &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; in the sense of "no more shall one who calls guilt to remembrance inspire the house of Israel with confidence," as Kliefoth proposes, not only because of the arrangement of the words, but because the more precise definition of &#1502;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; as '&#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495; clearly shows that Egypt is the subject of the sentence; whereas, in order to connect this definition in any way, Kliefoth is compelled to resort to the interpolation of the words, "which it committed." &#1502;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; is in apposition to &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;; making Egypt the ground of confidence, brings into remembrance before God the guilt of Israel, which consists in the fact that the Israelites turn to the Egyptians and seek salvation from them, so that He is obliged to punish them (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-28.htm">Ezekiel 21:28-29</a>). - The truth of the prediction in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-13.htm">Ezekiel 29:13-16</a> has been confirmed by history, inasmuch as Egypt never recovered its former power after the Chaldean period. - Moreover, if we compare the Messianic promise for Egypt in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18-25</a> with the prediction in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-13.htm">Ezekiel 29:13-15</a>, we are struck at once with the peculiarity of Ezekiel, already referred to in the introductory remarks on <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25-32</a>, namely, that he leaves entirely out of sight the Messianic future of the heathen nations. </body></html>
