And I saw that she had defiled herself; they both went one way. <a href="/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Ezekiel 23:14</a>.

And she was inflamed with lust toward them, when her eyes saw them, and sent messengers to them to Chaldea. <a href="/ezekiel/23-17.htm">Ezekiel 23:17</a>.

And she burned toward their paramours, who have members like asses and heat like horses. <a href="/ezekiel/23-21.htm">Ezekiel 23:21</a>. Thou lookest after the lewdness of thy youth, when they of Egypt handled thy bosom because of thy virgin breasts. - The train of thought in these verses is the following: - Judah went much further than Samaria. It not only indulged in sinful intercourse with Assyria, which led on to idolatry as the latter had done, but it also allowed itself to be led astray by the splendour of Chaldea, to form alliances with that imperial power, and to defile itself with her idolatry. And when it became tired of the Chaldeans, it formed impure connections with the Egyptians, as it had done once before during its sojourn in Egypt. The description of the Assyrians in <a href="/ezekiel/23-12.htm">Ezekiel 23:12</a> coincides with that in <a href="/ezekiel/23-5.htm">Ezekiel 23:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a>, except that some of the predicates are placed in a different order, and &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is substituted for &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1514;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;. The former expression, which occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>, must really mean the same as &#1514;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514; '&#1500;&#1489;. But it does not follow from this that &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500; signifies purple, as Hitzig maintains. The true meaning is perfection; and when used of the clothing, it signifies perfect beauty. The Septuagint rendering, &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;, with a beautiful border - more especially a variegated one - merely expresses the sense, but not the actual meaning of &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1500;. The Chaldee rendering is &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1490;&#1502;&#1512;, perfecte induti. - There is great obscurity in the statement in <a href="/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Ezekiel 23:14</a> as to the way in which Judah was seduced to cultivate intercourse with the Chaldeans. She saw men engraved or drawn upon the wall (&#1502;&#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;, a participle Pual of &#1495;&#1511;&#1511;, engraved work, or sculpture). These figures were pictures of Chaldeans, engraved (drawn) with &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, red ochre, a bright-red colour. &#1495;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, an adjective form &#1495;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;, wearing a girdle. &#1496;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, coloured cloth, from &#1496;&#1489;&#1500;, to colour; here, according to the context, variegated head-bands or turbans. &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, the overhanging, used here of the cap. The reference is to the tiarae tinctae (Vulgate), the lofty turbans or caps, as they are to be seen upon the monuments of ancient Nineveh. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, not chariot-warriors, but knights: "tristatae, the name of the second grade after the regal dignity" (Jerome. See the comm. on <a href="/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>).<p>The description of these engravings answers perfectly to the sculptures upon the inner walls of the Assyrian palaces in the monuments of Nimrud, Khorsabad, and Kouyunjik (see Layard's Nineveh and its Remains, and Vaux, Nineveh and Persepolis). The pictures of the Chaldeans are not mythological figures (Hvernick), but sculptures depicting war-scenes, triumphal processions of Chaldean rulers and warriors, with which the Assyrian palaces were adorned. We have not to look for these sculptures in Jerusalem or Palestine. This cannot be inferred from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10</a>, as Hvernick supposes; nor established by Hitzig's argument, that the woman must have been in circumstances to see such pictures. The intercourse between Palestine and Nineveh, which was carried on even in Jonah's time, was quite sufficient to render it possible for the pictures to be seen. When Israelites travelled to Nineveh, and saw the palaces there, they could easily make the people acquainted with the glory of Nineveh by the accounts they would give on their return. It is no reply to this, to state that the woman does not send ambassadors till afterwards (<a href="/ezekiel/23-16.htm">Ezekiel 23:16</a>), as Hitzig argues; for Judah sent ambassadors to Chaldea not to view the glories of Assyria, but to form alliances with the Chaldeans, or to sue for their favour. Such an embassy, for example, was sent to Babylon by Zedekiah (<a href="/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>); and there is no doubt that in v. 16b Ezekiel has this in his mind. Others may have preceded this, concerning which the books of Kings and Chronicles are just as silent as they are concerning that of Zedekiah. The thought in these verses is therefore the following: - The acquaintance made by Israel (Judah) with the imperial splendour of the Chaldeans, as exhibited in the sculptures of their palaces, incited Judah to cultivate political and mercantile intercourse with this imperial power, which led to its becoming entangled in the heathen ways and idolatry of the Chaldeans. The Chaldeans themselves came and laid the foundation for an intercourse which led to the pollution of Judah with heathenism, and afterwards filled it with disgust, because it was brought thereby into dependence upon the Chaldeans. The consequence of all this was, that the Lord became tired of Judah (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-17.htm">Ezekiel 23:17</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/23-18.htm">Ezekiel 23:18</a>). For instead of returning to the Lord, Judah turned to the other power of the world, namely, to Egypt; and in the time of Zedekiah renewed its ancient coquetry with that nation (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-19.htm">Ezekiel 23:19-21</a> compared with <a href="/ezekiel/23-8.htm">Ezekiel 23:8</a>). The form &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-20.htm">Ezekiel 23:20</a>, which the Keri also gives in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-18.htm">Ezekiel 23:18</a>, has taken ah as a feminine termination (not the cohortative ah), like &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-1.htm">Proverbs 8:1</a> (vid., Delitzsch, Comm. on Job, en loc.). &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are scorta mascula (here (Kimchi) - a drastically sarcastic epithet applied to the sa&#770;risim, the eunuchs, or courtiers. The figurative epithet answers to the licentious character of the Egyptian idolatry. The sexual heat both of horses and asses is referred to by Aristotle, Hist. anim. vi. 22, and Columella, de re rust. vi. 27; and that of the horse has already been applied to the idolatry of the people by Jeremiah (vid., <a href="/jeremiah/5-8.htm">Jeremiah 5:8</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/16-26.htm">Ezekiel 16:26</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; (<a href="/ezekiel/23-21.htm">Ezekiel 23:21</a>), to look about for anything, i.e., to search for it; not to miss it, as Hvernick imagines. </body></html>
