Aholah&#8212;that is, "Her tent" (put for worship, as the first worship of God in Israel was in a tent or tabernacle), as contrasted with Aholibah, that is, "My tent in her." The Beth-el worship of Samaria was of her own devising, not of God's appointment; the temple-worship of Jerusalem was expressly appointed by Jehovah, who "dwelt" there, "setting up His tabernacle among the people as His" (Ex 25:8; Le 26:11, 12; Jos 22:19; Ps 76:2).<p>the elder&#8212;Samaria is called "the elder" because she preceded Judah in her apostasy and its punishment.<p>they were mine&#8212;Previous to apostasy under Jeroboam, Samaria (Israel, or the ten tribes), equally with Judah, worshipped the true God.

The name Oholah may mean “her tent,” though not so pointed, and Oholibah “my tent in her.” Possibly the words mean “tent” (or, tents) and “tent in her;” and the reference may be to the worship practised on the high places in both kingdoms, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/16-16.htm" title="And of your garments you did take, and decked your high places with divers colors, and played the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.">Ezekiel 16:16</a>. It is doubtful if the prophet means that Samaria had “her tent,” i.e. a sanctuary or worship of her own devising, while Jerusalem had Jehovah’s tent or true sanctuary in her. Cf. the names Hephzi-bah, <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm" title="You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah: for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.">Isaiah 62:4</a>, and Oholibamah (high-place tent), <a href="/genesis/36-2.htm" title="Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;">Genesis 36:2</a>.

It is curious that Jehovah is represented as the husband of two sisters, a thing which the law disallows, <a href="/leviticus/18-18.htm" title="Neither shall you take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.">Leviticus 18:18</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The occurrence of proper names is almost unique in the parables of the Bible, the Lazarus of <a href="/luke/16-20.htm">Luke 16:20</a> being  the only other instance. Their meaning is sufficiently clear. <span class="cmt_word">Aholah</span> (but both names should begin with O rather than A) means "Her tent;" <span class="cmt_word">Aholibah</span>, "My tent is in her." A parallel, which may have suggested the names, is found in the <span class="accented">Aholibamah</span> (equivalent to "My tent is in the high place") of <a href="/genesis/36-2.htm">Genesis 36:2</a>, and another in the use of <span class="accented">Ohel</span> as a proper name in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-20.htm">1 Chronicles 3:20</a>. The common element of the two names is the word that is commonly used for the sacred tent or tabernacle in the Pentateuch and elsewhere. The distinctive element of each points to the fact that the worship in Samaria was unauthorized. Her "tent" was hers, not Jehovah's. Of Jerusalem with its temple Jehovah could say, "My tent is in her," and this, as magnifying her privilege, also aggravated her guilt. Keil and others take the adjective here, as in <a href="/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>, as meaning "greater" rather than "older." The former adjective is, of course, applicable to the greater power of the kingdom of the Ten Tribes, and, even if we retain the renderings of the Authorized Version, is probably the explanation of Samaria being named as the <span class="cmt_word">elder</span> of the two. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Refining of Israel in the Furnace of Besieged Jerusalem<p><a href="/ezekiel/22-17.htm">Ezekiel 22:17</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/22-18.htm">Ezekiel 22:18</a>. Son of man, the house of Israel has become to me as dross; they are all brass, and tin, and iron, and lead in the furnace; dross of silver have they become. <a href="/ezekiel/22-19.htm">Ezekiel 22:19</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because ye have all become dross, therefore, behold, I gather you together in Jerusalem. <a href="/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20</a>. As men gather together silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin into the furnace, to blow the fire upon it for melting, so will I gather (you) together in my anger and my wrath, and put you in and melt you. <a href="/ezekiel/22-21.htm">Ezekiel 22:21</a>. And I will collect you together, and blow the fire of my wrath upon you, that ye may be melted therein. <a href="/ezekiel/22-22.htm">Ezekiel 22:22</a>. As silver is melted in the furnace, so shall ye be melted therein (viz., in Jerusalem), and shall learn that I Jehovah have poured out my wrath upon you. - This second word of God rests no doubt upon the figure in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-15.htm">Ezekiel 22:15</a>, of the uncleanness or dirt of sin; but it is not an exposition of the removal of the dirt, as predicted there. For that was to be effected through the dispersion of Israel among the nations, whereas the word of God, from <a href="/ezekiel/22-17.htm">Ezekiel 22:17</a> onwards, represents the siege awaiting Jerusalem as a melting process, through which God will separate the silver ore contained in Israel from the baser metals mingled with it. In <a href="/ezekiel/22-18.htm">Ezekiel 22:18</a> it commences with a description of the existing condition of Israel. It has turned to dross. &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; is clearly a perfect, and is not to be taken as a prophetical future, as Kliefoth proposes. Such a rendering is not only precluded by the clause '&#1497;&#1506;&#1503; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;  in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-19.htm">Ezekiel 22:19</a>, cut could only be made to yield an admissible sense by taking the middle clause of the verse, "all of them brass and tin," etc., as a statement of what Israel had become, or as a preterite in opposition to all the rules of Hebrew syntax, inasmuch as this clause merely furnishes an explanation of &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1500;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;. &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;, which only occurs here, for &#1505;&#1497;&#1490; signifies dross, not smelting-ore (Kliefoth), literally, recedanea, the baser ingredients which are mixed with the silver, and separated from it by smelting. This is the meaning here, where it is directly afterwards interpreted as consisting of brass, tin, iron, and lead, and then still further defined as &#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507;, dross of silver, i.e., brass, tin, iron, and lead, with a mixture of silver. Because Israel had turned into silver-dross of this kind, the Lord would gather it together in Jerusalem, to smelt it there as in a smelting furnace; just as men gather together brass, iron, lead, and tin in a furnace to smelt them, or rather to separate the silver contained thereon. &#1511;&#1489;&#1510;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507;, literally, a collection of silver, etc., for "like a collection." The &#1499; simil. is probably omitted for the sake of euphony, to avoid the discord occasioned by prefixing it to &#1511;&#1489;&#1510;&#1514;. Ezekiel mentions the silver as well, because there is some silver contained in the brass, iron, etc., or the dross is silver-dross. &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, nomen verbale, from &#1504;&#1514;&#1498; in the Hiphil, smelting; literally, as the smelting of silver takes place in the furnace. The smelting is treated here simply as a figurative representation of punishment, and consequently the result of the smelting, namely, the refining of the silver by the removal of the baser ingredients, is not referred to any further, as in the case in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27-30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>. This smelting process was experienced by Israel in the last siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. </body></html>
