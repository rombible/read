Jerusalem and Judah bear the name of Aholibah, my tabernacle is in her, because their temple was the place which God himself had chosen, to put his name there. The language and figures are according to those times. Will not such humbling representations of nature keep open perpetual repentance and sorrow in the soul, hiding pride from our eyes, and taking us from self-righteousness? Will it not also prompt the soul to look to God continually for grace, that by his Holy Spirit we may mortify the deeds of the body, and live in holy conversation and godliness?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After Israel's captivity Judah intrigued first with Assyria, then with Babylon, courting their monarchs, imitating their customs, and learning their idolatries.<p>Pourtrayed upon the wall - The monuments of Nineveh show how the walls of its palaces were adorned with figures precisely answering to this description.

They committed whoredom in Egypt, in their youth they committed whoredom; there were their breasts pressed, and there men handled their virgin bosom. <a href="/ezekiel/23-4.htm">Ezekiel 23:4</a>. Their names are Oholah, the greater, and Oholibah her sister; and they became mine, and bare sons and daughters. But their names are: Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem is Oholibah. - The name &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492; is formed from &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, "my tent in her;" and, accordingly, &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; is to be derived from &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, "her tent," and not to be regarded as an abbreviation of &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468; &#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, "her tent in her," as Hitzig and Kliefoth maintain. There is no ground for this assumption, as "her tent," in contrast with "my tent in her," expresses the thought with sufficient clearness, that she had a tent of her own, and the place where her tent was does not come into consideration. The "tent" is the sanctuary: both tabernacle and temple. These names characterize the two kingdoms according to their attitude toward the Lord. Jerusalem had the sanctuary of Jehovah; Samaria, on the other hand, had her own sanctuary, i.e., one invented by herself. Samaria and Jerusalem, as the historical names of the two kingdoms, represent Israel of the ten tribes and Judah. Oholah and Oholibah are daughters of one mother, because they were the two halves of the one Israel; and they are called women, because Jehovah had married them (<a href="/ezekiel/23-4.htm">Ezekiel 23:4</a>). Oholah is called &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, the great, i.e., the greater sister (not the elder, see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>); because ten tribes, the greater portion of Israel, belonged to Samaria, whereas Judah had only two tribes. They committed whoredom even in Egypt in their youth, for even in Egypt the Israelites defiled themselves with Egyptian idolatry (see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7</a>). &#1502;&#1497;&#1506;&#1498;, to press, to crush: the Pual is used here to denote lewd handling. In a similar manner the Piel &#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1492; is used to signify tractare, contrectare mammas, in an obscene sense. </body></html>
