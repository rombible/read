Jerusalem and Judah bear the name of Aholibah, my tabernacle is in her, because their temple was the place which God himself had chosen, to put his name there. The language and figures are according to those times. Will not such humbling representations of nature keep open perpetual repentance and sorrow in the soul, hiding pride from our eyes, and taking us from self-righteousness? Will it not also prompt the soul to look to God continually for grace, that by his Holy Spirit we may mortify the deeds of the body, and live in holy conversation and godliness?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sending of "messengers" refers to the act of Ahaz <a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. sent messengers &#8230; into Chaldea&#8212;(Eze 16:29). It was she that solicited the Chaldeans, not they her. Probably the occasion was when Judah sought to strengthen herself by a Chaldean alliance against a menaced attack by Egypt (compare 2Ki 23:29-35; 24:1-7). God made the object of their sinful desire the instrument of their punishment. Jehoiakim, probably by a stipulation of tribute, enlisted Nebuchadnezzar against Pharaoh, whose tributary he previously had been; failing to keep his stipulation, he brought on himself Nebuchadnezzar's vengeance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Saw them; </span> the portraits of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">She doted upon them; </span> like an unsatiable and most impudent adulteress, she fell into most inordinate affection for their persons on sight of their pictures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Sent messengers unto them; </span> courted the love of those strangers, and wooed their embraces, sent to make alliances with them, prostituted herself to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Into Chaldea:</span> though it was a long journey, troublesome and costly, all this hinders not this extravagant, lewd woman, she sends to these remote parts, and forgets her God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them,....

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/23-2.htm">Ezekiel 23:2</a>. Son of man, two women, daughters of one mother were they, <a href="/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a>. They committed whoredom in Egypt, in their youth they committed whoredom; there were their breasts pressed, and there men handled their virgin bosom. <a href="/ezekiel/23-4.htm">Ezekiel 23:4</a>. Their names are Oholah, the greater, and Oholibah her sister; and they became mine, and bare sons and daughters. But their names are: Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem is Oholibah. - The name &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492; is formed from &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, "my tent in her;" and, accordingly, &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492; is to be derived from &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, "her tent," and not to be regarded as an abbreviation of &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492;&#1468; &#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, "her tent in her," as Hitzig and Kliefoth maintain. There is no ground for this assumption, as "her tent," in contrast with "my tent in her," expresses the thought with sufficient clearness, that she had a tent of her own, and the place where her tent was does not come into consideration. The "tent" is the sanctuary: both tabernacle and temple. These names characterize the two kingdoms according to their attitude toward the Lord. Jerusalem had the sanctuary of Jehovah; Samaria, on the other hand, had her own sanctuary, i.e., one invented by herself. Samaria and Jerusalem, as the historical names of the two kingdoms, represent Israel of the ten tribes and Judah. Oholah and Oholibah are daughters of one mother, because they were the two halves of the one Israel; and they are called women, because Jehovah had married them (<a href="/ezekiel/23-4.htm">Ezekiel 23:4</a>). Oholah is called &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, the great, i.e., the greater sister (not the elder, see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>); because ten tribes, the greater portion of Israel, belonged to Samaria, whereas Judah had only two tribes. They committed whoredom even in Egypt in their youth, for even in Egypt the Israelites defiled themselves with Egyptian idolatry (see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7</a>). &#1502;&#1497;&#1506;&#1498;, to press, to crush: the Pual is used here to denote lewd handling. In a similar manner the Piel &#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1492; is used to signify tractare, contrectare mammas, in an obscene sense. </body></html>
