There is Elam, and all its multitude round about its grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised into the nether world, who spread terror before them in the land of the living, and bear their shame with those who went into the pit. <a href="/ezekiel/32-25.htm">Ezekiel 32:25</a>. In the midst of the slain have they made it a bed with all its multitude, round about it are their graves; all of them uncircumcised, pierced with the sword; because terror was spread before them in the land of the living, they bear their shame with those who have gone into the pit. In the midst of slain ones is he laid. - Asshur is followed by &#1506;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;, Elam, the warlike people of Elymais, i.e., Susiana, the modern Chusistan, whose archers served in the Assyrian army (<a href="/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>), and which is mentioned along with the Medes as one of the conquerors of Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>), whereas Jeremiah prophesied its destruction at the commencement of Zedekiah's reign (<a href="/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>.). Ezekiel says just the same of Elam as he has already said of Asshur, and almost in the same words. The only difference is, that his description is more copious, and that he expresses more distinctly the thought of shameful destruction which is implied in the fact of lying in Sheol among the slain, and repeats it a second time, and that he also sets the bearing of shame into Sheol in contrast with the terror which Elam had spread around it during its life on earth. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; , as in <a href="/ezekiel/16-52.htm">Ezekiel 16:52</a>. The &#1489; in &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468; is either the "with of association," or the fact of being in the midst of a crowd. &#1500;&#1492;&#1468;  refers to &#1506;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;; and &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; has an indefinite subject, "they gave"  equals  there was given. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;, the resting-place of the dead, as in <a href="/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>. The last clause in <a href="/ezekiel/32-25.htm">Ezekiel 32:25</a> is an emphatic repetition of the leading thought: he (Elam) is brought or laid in the midst of the slain.</body></html>
