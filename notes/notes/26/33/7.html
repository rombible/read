As if he had said, If a watchman, appointed by his fellow-citizens, is so highly guilty, if he do not give warning to the city, and shall receive such punishment from my hands; what must not thou expect, who art appointed by me to give warning to thy countrymen of the terrible evils which their sins will bring upon them, if thou neglect to do it? God has never left his people without sufficient means of instruction, but has vouch-safed it to them more or less in every age, from the beginning of the world to this day. He has, from time to time, and at all times, set watchmen over them, raised up good and holy men to instruct, admonish, warn, and reprove. “I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets daily, rising up early and sending them, but you have not hearkened unto me, nor inclined your ear,” <a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm" title="Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day I have even sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:">Jeremiah 7:25</a>. <span class="ital">When I say unto the wicked, </span>&c. — See notes on <a href="/context/ezekiel/3-18.htm" title="When I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him not warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand....">Ezekiel 3:18-19</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:1-9 The prophet is a watchman to the house of Israel. His business is to warn sinners of their misery and danger. He must warn the wicked to turn from their way, that they may live. If souls perish through his neglect of duty, he brings guilt upon himself. See what those have to answer for, who make excuses for sin, flatter sinners, and encourage them to believe they shall have peace, though they go on. How much wiser are men in their temporal than in their spiritual concerns! They set watchmen to guard their houses, and sentinels to warn of the enemies' approach, but where the everlasting happiness or misery of the soul is at stake, they are offended if ministers obey their Master's command, and give a faithful warning; they would rather perish, listening to smooth things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Again - And.

The evil, corresponding to the sword in the illustration, in regard to which the prophet is to warn the people, is left undefined. As in the case of all the prophets, however, the turning point in the fortunes of the exiles appeared to Ezek. of the nature of a divine interposition and judgment, and it is this general idea that colours his language. Except in the two or three passages, <a href="/ezekiel/13-5.htm" title="You have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.">Ezekiel 13:5</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/30-3.htm" title="For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.">Ezekiel 30:3</a>, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/38-19.htm" title="For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;">Ezekiel 38:19</a>, the day of the Lord is not referred to in Ezek.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The destruction of Pharoah. - <a href="/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>. Son of man, raise a lamentation over Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and say to him, Thou wast compared to a young lion among the nations, and yet wast like a dragon in the sea; thou didst break forth in thy streams, and didst trouble the waters with thy feet, and didst tread their streams. <a href="/ezekiel/32-3.htm">Ezekiel 32:3</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Therefore will I spread out my net over thee in the midst of many nations, that they may draw thee up in my yarn; <a href="/ezekiel/32-4.htm">Ezekiel 32:4</a>. And will cast thee upon the land, hurl thee upon the surface of the field, and will cause all the birds of the heaven to settle upon thee, and the beasts of the whole earth to satisfy themselves with thee. <a href="/ezekiel/32-5.htm">Ezekiel 32:5</a>. Thy flesh will I put upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy funeral heap. <a href="/ezekiel/32-6.htm">Ezekiel 32:6</a>. I will saturate the earth with thine outflow of thy blood even to the mountains, and the low places shall become full of thee. - This lamentation begins, like others, with a picture of the glory of the fallen king. Hitzig objects to the ordinary explanation of the words &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;  &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; (lxx), leoni gentium assimilatus es (Vulg.), on the ground that the frequently recurring &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; would only have this meaning in the present passage, and that &#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, which would then be synonymous, is construed in three other ways, but not with the nominative. For these reasons he adopts the rendering, "lion of the nations, thou belongest to death." But it would be contrary to the analogy of all the &#1511;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; to commence the lamentation with such a threat; and Hitzig's objections to the ordinary rendering of the words will not bear examination. The circumstance that the Niphal &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; is only met with here in the sense of &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, proves nothing; for &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; has this meaning in the Kal, Piel, and Hithpael, and the construction of the Niphal with the accusative (not nominative, as Hitzig says) may be derived without difficulty from the construction of the synonymous &#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; with &#1499;. But what is decisive in favour of this rendering is the fact that the following clause is connected by means of the adversative &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (but thou), which shows that the comparison of Pharaoh to a &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; forms an antithesis to the clause in which he is compared to a young lion. If &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; '&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; &#1490; contained a declaration of destruction, not only would this antithesis be lost, but the words addressed to it as a lion of the nations would float in the air and be used without any intelligible meaning. The lion is a figurative representation of a powerful and victorious ruler; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; is really equivalent to &#1488;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/ezekiel/31-11.htm">Ezekiel 31:11</a>.<p>Pharaoh was regarded as a mighty conqueror of the nations, "though he was rather to be compared to the crocodile, which stirs up the streams, the fresh waters, and life-giving springs of the nations most perniciously with mouth and feet, and renders turbid all that is pure" (Ewald). &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>. Ewald and Hitzig have taken offence at the words &#1514;&#1468;&#1490;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, "thou didst break forth in thy streams," and alter &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; retla d into &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, with thy nostrils (<a href="/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>); but they have not considered that &#1514;&#1468;&#1490;&#1495; would be quite out of place with such an alteration, as &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495; in both the Kal and Hiphil (<a href="/judges/20-33.htm">Judges 20:33</a>) has only the intransitive meaning to break out. The thought is simply this: the crocodile lies in the sea, then breaks occasionally forth in its streams, and makes the waters and their streams turbid with its feet. Therefore shall Pharaoh also end like such a monster (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-3.htm">Ezekiel 32:3-6</a>). The guilt of Pharaoh did not consist in the fact that he had assumed the position of a ruler among the nations (Kliefoth); but in his polluting the water-streams, stirring up and disturbing the life-giving streams of the nations. God will take him in His net by a gathering of nations, and cause him to be drawn out of his element upon the dry land, where he shall become food to the birds and beasts of prey (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4-5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12-13</a>). The words '&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492;&#1500; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512; are not to be understood as referring to the nations, as spectators of the event (Hvernick); but &#1489; denotes the instrument, or medium employed, here the persons by whom God causes the net to be thrown, as is evident from the &#1493;&#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; which follows. According to the parallelismus membrorum, the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; can only refer to the carcase of the beast, although the source from which this meaning of the word is derived has not yet been traced. There is no worth to be attached to the reading rimowt in some of the codices, as &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; does not yield a suitable meaning either in the sense of reptile, or in that of putrefaction or decomposed bodies, which has been attributed to it from the Arabic. Under these circumstances we adhere to the derivation from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, to be high, according to which &#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; may signify a height or a heap, which the context defines as a funeral-pile. &#1510;&#1508;&#1492;, strictly speaking, a participle from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, to flow, that which flows out, the outflow (Hitzig), is not to be taken in connection with &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, but is a second object to &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;; and the appended word &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1498; indicates the source whence the flowing takes place, and of what the outflow consists. &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, to the mountains, i.e., up to the top of the mountains. The thought in these verses is probably simply this, that the fall of Pharaoh would bring destruction upon the whole of the land of Egypt, and that many nations would derive advantage from his fall.</body></html>
