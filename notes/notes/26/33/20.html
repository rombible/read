The ruin of the city and state was determined, but that did not relate to the final state of persons. God says to the righteous, that he shall surely live. But many who have made profession, have been ruined by proud confidence in themselves. Man trusts to his own righteousness, and presuming on his own sufficiency, he is brought to commit iniquity. If those who have lived a wicked life repent and forsake their wicked ways, they shall be saved. Many such amazing and blessed changes have been wrought by the power of Divine grace. When there is a settled separation between a man and sin, there shall no longer be a separation between him and God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Again - And.

For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon thee. <a href="/ezekiel/32-12.htm">Ezekiel 32:12</a>. By swords of heroes will I cause thy tumult to fall, violent ones of the nations are they all, and will lay waste the pride of Egypt, and all its tumult will be destroyed. <a href="/ezekiel/32-13.htm">Ezekiel 32:13</a>.

Then will I cause their waters to settle and their streams to flow like oil, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, <a href="/ezekiel/32-15.htm">Ezekiel 32:15</a>. When I make the land of Egypt a desert, and the land is made desolate of its fulness, because I smite all the inhabitants therein, and they shall know that I am Jehovah. <a href="/ezekiel/32-16.htm">Ezekiel 32:16</a>. A lamentatoin (mournful ode) is this, and they will sing it mournfully; the daughters of the nations will sing it mournfully, over Egypt and over all its tumult will they sing it mournfully, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - In this concluding strophe the figurative announcement of the preceding one is summed up briefly in literal terms; and toward the close (<a href="/ezekiel/32-14.htm">Ezekiel 32:14</a>) there is a slight intimation of a better future. The destruction of the proud might of Egypt will be effected through the king of Babylon and his brave and violent hosts. &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a> (see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/28-7.htm">Ezekiel 28:7</a>). &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="/ezekiel/32-12.htm">Ezekiel 32:12</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/32-13.htm">Ezekiel 32:13</a> must not be restricted to the multitude of people. It signifies tumult, and embraces everything in Egypt by which noise and confusion were made (as in <a href="/ezekiel/31-2.htm">Ezekiel 31:2</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a>); although the idea of a multitude of people undoubtedly predominates in the use of &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="/ezekiel/32-12.htm">Ezekiel 32:12</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; , the pride of Egypt, is not that of which Egypt is proud, but whatever is proud or exalts itself in Egypt. The utter devastation of Egypt includes the destruction of the cattle, i.e., of the numerous herds which fed on the grassy banks of the Nile and were driven to the Nile to drink (cf. <a href="/genesis/47-6.htm">Genesis 47:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-2.htm">Genesis 41:2</a>.; <a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>); and this is therefore specially mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-13.htm">Ezekiel 32:13</a>, with an allusion to the consequence thereof, namely, that the waters of the Nile would not be disturbed any more either by the foot of man or hoof of beast (compare <a href="/ezekiel/32-13.htm">Ezekiel 32:13</a> with <a href="/ezekiel/29-11.htm">Ezekiel 29:11</a>). The disturbing of the water is mentioned with evident reference to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>, where Pharaoh is depicted as a sea-monster, which disturbs the streams of water. The disturbance of the water is therefore a figurative representation of the wild driving of the imperial power of Egypt, by which the life-giving streams of the nations were stirred up.<p><a href="/ezekiel/32-14.htm">Ezekiel 32:14</a>. Then will God cause the waters of Egypt to sink. Hitzig and Kliefoth understand this as signifying the diminution of the abundance of water in the Nile, which had previously overflowed the land and rendered it fertile, but for which there was no further purpose now. According to this explanation, the words would contain a continued picture of the devastation of the land. But this is evidently a mistake, for the simple reason that it is irreconcilable with the &#1488;&#1494;, by which the thought is introduced. &#1488;&#1494;, tunc, is more precisely defined by '&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; in <a href="/ezekiel/32-15.htm">Ezekiel 32:15</a> as the time when the devastation has taken place; whereas Kliefoth takes the 15th verse, in opposition both to the words and the usage of the language, as the sequel to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-14.htm">Ezekiel 32:14</a>, or in other words, regards &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; as synonymous with &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. The verse contains a promise, as most of the commentators, led by the Chaldee and Jerome, have correctly assumed.<p>(Note: The explanation of Jerome is the following: "Then will purest waters, which had been disturbed by the sway of the dragon, be restored not by another, but by the Lord Himself; so that their streams flow like oil, and are the nutriment of true light.")<p>&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506;, to make the water sink, might no doubt signify in itself a diminution of the abundance of water. But if we consider the context, in which reference is made to the disturbance of the water through its being trodden with the feet (<a href="/ezekiel/32-13.htm">Ezekiel 32:13</a>), &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506; can only signify to settle, i.e., to become clear through the sinking to the bottom of the slime which had been stirred up (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/34-18.htm">Ezekiel 34:18</a>). The correctness of this explanation is confirmed by the parallel clause, to make their streams flow with oil. To understand this as signifying the slow and gentle flow of the diminished water, would introduce a figure of which there is no trace in Hebrew. Oil is used throughout the Scriptures as a figurative representation of the divine blessing, or the power of the divine Spirit. &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503;, like oil, according to Hebrew phraseology, is equivalent to "like rivers of oil." And oil-rivers are not rivers which flow quietly like oil, but rivers which contain oil instead of water (cf. <a href="/job/29-6.htm">Job 29:6</a>), and are symbolical of the rich blessing of God (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>). The figure is a very appropriate one for Egypt, as the land is indebted to the Nile for all its fertility. Whereas its water had been stirred up and rendered turbid by Pharaoh; after the fall of Pharaoh the Lord will cause the waters of the stream, which pours its blessings upon the land, to purify themselves, and will make its streams flow with oil. The clarified water and flowing oil are figures of the life-giving power of the word and Spirit of God. But this blessing will not flow to Egypt till its natural power is destroyed. Ewald has therefore given the following as the precise meaning of <a href="/ezekiel/32-14.htm">Ezekiel 32:14</a> : "The Messianic times will then for the first time dawn on Egypt, when the waters no more become devastating and turbid, that is to say, through the true knowledge to which the chastisement leads." <a href="/ezekiel/32-16.htm">Ezekiel 32:16</a> "rounds off the passage by turning back to <a href="/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>" (Hitzig). The daughters of the nations are mentioned as the singers, because mourning for the dead was for the most part the business of women (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/9-16.htm">Jeremiah 9:16</a>). The words do not contain a summons to the daughters of the nations to sing the lamentation, but the declaration that they will do it, in which the thought is implied that the predicted devastation of Egypt will certainly occur. </body></html>
