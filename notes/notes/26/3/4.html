Gracious souls can receive those truths of God with delight, which speak terror to the wicked. He must speak all that, and that only, which God spake to him. How can we better speak God's mind than with his words? If disappointed as to his people, he must not be offended. The Ninevites were wrought upon by Jonah's preaching, when Israel was unhumbled and unreformed. We must leave this unto the Divine sovereignty, and say, Lord, thy judgments are a great deep. They will not regard the word of the prophet, for they will not regard the rod of God. Christ promises to strengthen him. He must continue earnest in preaching, whatever the success might be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before, there was a direct commission, now there is a symbolic action. John has the same vision (<a href="/revelation/10-8.htm">Revelation 10:8</a> ff), but there that is expressed, which is here left to be inferred, namely, that "as soon as he had eaten it his belly was bitter." The sweetness in the mouth denoted that it was good to be a messenger of the Lord (compare the margin reference), but the bitterness which accompanied it, denoted that the commission brought with it much sorrow. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. honey for sweetness&#8212;Compare Ps 19:10; 119:103; Re 10:9, where, as here in Eze 3:14, the "sweetness" is followed by "bitterness." The former being due to the painful nature of the message; the latter because it was the Lord's service which he was engaged in; and his eating the roll and finding it sweet, implied that, divesting himself of carnal feeling, he made God's will his will, however painful the message that God might require him to announce. The fact that God would be glorified was his greatest pleasure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Song of Solomon of man:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/3-1.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 3:1</a></span>, and <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.">Ezekiel 2:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Go</span>; either the first word, go, intimates the awakening and rousing him, and the latter, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">get thee, </span> directs him whither to go when on his legs, or else it is an idiom of the Hebrew language, or a hendyadis, an ingemination of the same command. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The house of Israel:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/2-3.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day.">Ezekiel 2:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Speak with my words; </span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/3-1.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 3:1</a></span>; in my name and authority, so some, but then it would have been in the singular number, not plural.

It is an arduous one. The difficulties are not of a superficial kind. He is not sent to foreign nations, who would not understand his words, but to Israel. They can well understand, but they will not listen. Their refusal to listen unto him is but an example of their life-long refusal to listen unto God. They are resolute and obstinate in their disobedience, but the prophet shall be made more resolute than they.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Call of Ezekiel to the Prophetic Office - <a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>. Upon the manifestation of the Lord follows the word of vocation. Having, in the feeling of his weakness and sinfulness, fallen to the ground before the terrible revelation of Jehovah's glory, Ezekiel is first of all raised up again by the voice of God, to hear the word which calls him to the prophetic function. - <a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1</a>. And He said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, I will speak with thee. <a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>. Then came spirit unto me as He spake unto me, and it placed me on my feet, and I heard Him speaking unto me. - The address &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; occurs so frequently in Ezekiel, that it must be regarded as one of the peculiarities of his prophecies. Elsewhere it occurs only once, <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>. That it is significant, is generally recognised, although its meaning is variously given. Most expositors take it as  a reminder of the weakness and frailness of human nature; Coccejus and Kliefoth, on the contrary, connect it with the circumstance that God appears to Ezekiel in human form, and find in it a &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; amicitiae, that God speaks in him as man to man, converses with him as a man with his friend.  This last interpretation, however, has against it the usus loquendi. As &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; denotes man according to his natural condition, it is used throughout as a synonym with &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, denoting the weakness and fragility of man in opposition to God; cf. <a href="/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a>; <a href="/job/25-6.htm">Job 25:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2</a>; and <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>. This is the meaning also of &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; in the address, as may be distinctly seen from the various addresses in Daniel. Daniel is addressed, where comfort is to be imparted to him, as &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1473; &#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, "man greatly beloved," <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-11.htm">Daniel 10:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-19.htm">Daniel 10:19</a>, cf. <a href="/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>; but, on the contrary, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>, where he has fallen on his face in terror before the appearance of Gabriel, with the words, "Understand, O son of man," in order to remind him of his human weakness. This is also the case in our verse, where Ezekiel, too, had fallen upon his face, and by God's word spoken to him, is again raised to his feet. It is only in Ezekiel that this address is constantly employed to mark the distance between the human weakness of his nature and the divine power which gives him the capacity and the impulse to speak. Not, however, with the design, mentioned by Jerome on <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, "that he may not be elated on account of his high calling," because, as Hvernick subjoins, Ezekiel's extremely powerful and forcible nature may have needed to be perpetually reminded of what it is in reality before God. If this were the meaning and object of this address, it would also probably occur in the writings of several of the other prophets, as the supposition that the nature of Ezekiel was more powerful and forcible than that of the other prophets is altogether without foundation. The constant use of this form of address in Ezekiel is connected rather with the manner and fashion in which most of the revelations were imparted to him, that is, with the prevalence of "vision," in which the distinction between God and man comes out more prominently than in ordinary inspiration or revelation, effected by means of an impression upon the inner faculties of man. The bringing prominently forward, however, of the distance between God and men is to remind the prophet, as well as the people to whom he communicated his revelations, not merely of the weakness of humanity, but to show them, at the same time, how powerfully the word of God operates in feeble man, and also that God, who has selected the prophet as the organ of His will, possesses also the power to redeem the people, that were lying powerless under the oppression of the heathen, from their misery, and to raise them up again. - At the word of the Lord, "Stand upon thy feet," came &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; into the prophet, which raised him to his feet. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; here is not "life consciousness" (Hitzig), but the spirit-power which proceeds from God, and which is conveyed through the word which imparted to him the strength to stand before the face of God, and to undertake His command. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, partic. Hithpa., properly "collocutor," occurs here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6</a>, and in <a href="/numbers/7-89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>; elsewhere, only in <a href="/2_samuel/14-13.htm">2 Samuel 14:13</a>. </body></html>
