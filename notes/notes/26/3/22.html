Some think this was done by the captive Jews at Tel- abib, and that they bound him as a criminal, and disturber of the peace, in order to the punishing of him. Others suppose his domestics bound him, as thinking him out of his right mind. But it is more probable, comparing this passage with chap. <a href="/ezekiel/4-8.htm" title="And, behold, I will lay bands on you, and you shall not turn you from one side to another, till you have ended the days of your siege.">Ezekiel 4:8</a>, that the meaning is, as Bishop Newcome observes, that his friends or servants bound him by his order; namely, more fully to express the shutting up of the Jews in Jerusalem by the siege. <span class="ital">And thou shalt not go out among them — </span>Thou shalt not go abroad among the people, but continue thus shut up. <span class="ital">And thou shalt be dumb — </span>For some space of time I will withhold revelations from thee, and thou shalt say nothing to the people by way of admonition or reproof. <span class="ital">For they are a rebellious house — </span>They are an obstinate, refractory people, who will give no heed to thy words. <span class="ital">But when I speak with thee — </span>Or, <span class="ital">when I have spoken to thee; </span>that is, revealed to thee the knowledge of what is to come, or have communicated to thee what I intend to be declared to them; <span class="ital">I will open thy mouth — </span>Give thee the power of speaking such things to them as it is my pleasure should be set before them. <span class="ital">He that heareth, let him hear</span> — This is the last warning I shall give them, and they must take it as such, and either give heed to and obey what is said to them, and so avoid the impending evil; or neglect it at their peril, and take the consequence which shall follow. These words, it seems, were spoken to Ezekiel only, and are not any part of the message which he was to deliver to the people. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:22-27 Let us own ourselves for ever indebted to the mediation of Christ, for the blessed intercourse between God and man; and a true believer will say, I am never less alone than when thus alone.

At Telabib, <a href="/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>. The Targum interprets "the hand of the Lord" of the spirit of prophecy, which remained upon him there; but it seems to design a fresh impulse of the Spirit, a powerful emotion of the split upon his spirit, stirring up to attention to what might be said unto him: <p>and he said unto me; the same glorious Person, the Lord Christ, described in <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; <p>arise, go forth into the plain; or "the valley" (w); the Arabic version renders it, "the desert"; a solitary place, free from noise and hurry, and from the company and conversation of men; and so more fit for retirement and contemplation, and for attention to divine orders.

It is probable that the prophet’s retiring to the “valley” was merely transacted in vision. He felt himself transported away from the presence of men to some lonely retreat, and there the glory of the Lord seemed again to stand before him (cf. ch. <a href="/context/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me....">Ezekiel 8:1-3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">into the plain</span>] R.V. marg. <span class="ital">the valley</span>. This is scarcely a general term, meaning the plain country in opposition to Tel-Abib, where the exiles dwelt; some particular place in the neighbourhood called the “valley” is meant. According to <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/3-23.htm" title="Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.">Ezekiel 3:23</a></span> the place was not identical with the other by the river Chebar, where the Vision of God first appeared to the prophet. Cf. ch. <a href="/ezekiel/37-1.htm" title="The hand of the LORD was on me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the middle of the valley which was full of bones,">Ezekiel 37:1</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ch. <a href="/context/ezekiel/3-22.htm" title="And the hand of the LORD was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you....">Ezekiel 3:22-27</a>. The prophet abandons public exercise of his ministry<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verses form the preface to ch. 4–24, all the prophecies that bear upon the fate of Jerusalem and its inhabitants, up to its fall. The prophet under the “hand” of God goes out into the “valley,” and the same Theophany appears to him as at the first by the river Chebar. He is in communication with the same great God, and all his actions are determined by his commands. According to the interpretation put upon ch. <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.">Ezekiel 1:1</a> to <a href="/ezekiel/3-21.htm" title="Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also you have delivered your soul.">Ezekiel 3:21</a> above, he had exercised his office of watchman among the people, speaking to them publicly in the name of the Lord, for some time. Possibly the time was not very long, for this passage comes in under the same general date as all that preceded it. His ministry had met with resistance, the people would not hear, as he had anticipated. A public ministry among them was fruitless; the burden of his preaching to them was distasteful. He warned them against their idolatries, from which they would not turn; and foretold the downfall of their city and country, a thing which they heard with an incredulous ear and would have none of. Therefore the prophet feels instructed of God to cease to be a public “reprover” (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm" title="And I will make your tongue sticks to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be dumb, and shall not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 3:26</a></span>) for a time. The people refuse to believe his words when he speaks of the downfall of their beloved city, they will be constrained to believe events when they happen; and then the prophet, his word being confirmed, will speak with boldness, his mouth will be opened, and he will be able to impress upon more ready listeners the lessons of God’s righteous providence. His silence meantime is not an absolute one, it is only a change of method; but this so-called silence continues till the actual destruction of the city. In ch. <a href="/ezekiel/24-27.htm" title="In that day shall your mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and you shall speak, and be no more dumb: and you shall be a sign to them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 24:27</a>, it is said, “in that day (when tidings come of the city’s fall) shall thy mouth be opened and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb, and they shall know that I am the Lord;” and in ch. <a href="/ezekiel/33-21.htm" title="And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is smitten.">Ezekiel 33:21</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>., when those that escaped came bringing tidings, saying, the city is fallen, it is said: “then my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.” No motive is assigned for the change in his prophetic method, beyond the unwillingness of the people to listen, “for they are a rebellious house” (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm" title="And I will make your tongue sticks to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be dumb, and shall not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 3:26</a></span>). At the same time as a prophet of the restoration with its new principles (ch. 18, 33), a watchman appointed to speak no more to the state but to individual men, his ministry proper could not commence till the state had fallen. See note on ch. <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm" title="Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.">Ezekiel 3:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Second Section. Ch. <a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm" title="And the hand of the LORD was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.">Ezekiel 3:22</a> to <a href="/ezekiel/7-27.htm" title="The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 7:27</a>The second section of the Book contains these parts:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) Ch. <a href="/context/ezekiel/3-22.htm" title="And the hand of the LORD was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you....">Ezekiel 3:22-27</a>.

Psychologically, it seems probable that the effect of the message was to fill him with an overwhelming, crushing sense of the burden of his responsibility. How was he to begin so terrible a work? What were to be the nearer, and the remoter, issues of such a work? Apparently, at least, he does not then begin it by a spoken warning. He passes, at the Divine command borne in on his soul, from the crowd that had watched him during the seven days' silence, and betakes himself to the solitude of the "plain," as distinct from the "mound" where the exiles dwelt, and there the vision appears again in all points as he had seen it when he stood on the river's bank. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the Lord had pointed out to the prophet the difficulties of the call laid upon him, He prepared him for the performance of his office, by inspiring him with the divine word which he is to announce. - <a href="/ezekiel/2-8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8</a>. And thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee, Be not stiff-necked like the stiff-necked race; open thy mouth, and eat what I give unto thee. <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>. Then I saw, and, lo, a hand outstretched towards me; and, lo, in the same a roll of a book. <a href="/ezekiel/2-10.htm">Ezekiel 2:10</a>. And He spread it out before me; the same was written upon the front and back: and there were written upon it lamentations, and sighing, and woe. <a href="/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1</a>. And He said to me: Son of man, what thou findest eat; eat the roll, and go and speak to the house of Israel. <a href="/ezekiel/3-2.htm">Ezekiel 3:2</a>. Then opened I my mouth, and He gave me this roll to eat. <a href="/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Ezekiel 3:3</a>. And said to me: Son of man, feed thy belly, and fill thy body with this roll which I give thee. And I ate it, and it was in my mouth as honey and sweetness. - The prophet is to announce to the people of Israel only that which the Lord inspires him to announce. This thought is embodied in symbol, in such a way that an outstretched hand reaches to him a book, which he is to swallow, and which also, at God's command, he does swallow; cf. <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>. This roll was inscribed on both sides with lamentations, sighing, and woe (&#1492;&#1497; is either abbreviated from &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;, not  equals  &#1488;&#1497;, or as Ewald, 101c, thinks, is only a more distinct form of &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; or &#1492;&#1493;). The meaning is not, that upon the roll was inscribed a multitude of mournful expressions of every kind, but that there was written upon it all that the prophet was to announce, and what we now read in his book. These contents were of a mournful nature, for they related to the destruction of the kingdom, the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple. That Ezekiel may look over the contents, the roll is spread out before his eyes, and then handed to him to be eaten, with the words, "Go and speak to the children of Israel," i.e., announce to the children of Israel what you have received into yourself, or as it is termed in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-4.htm">Ezekiel 3:4</a>, &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;, "my words." The words in <a href="/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Ezekiel 3:3</a> were spoken by God while handing to the prophet the roll to be eaten. He is not merely to eat, i.e., take it into his mouth, but he is to fill his body and belly therewith, i.e., he is to receive into his innermost being the word of God presented to him, to change it, as it were, into sap and blood. Whilst eating it, it was sweet in his mouth. The sweet taste must not, with Kliefoth, be explained away into a sweet "after-taste," and made to bear this reference, that the destruction of Jerusalem would be followed by a more glorious restoration. The roll, inscribed with lamentation, sorrow, and woe, tasted to him sweetly, because its contents was God's word, which sufficed for the joy and gladness of his heart (<a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a>); for it is "infinitely sweet and lovely to be the organ and spokesman of the Omnipotent," and even the most painful of divine truths possess to a spiritually-minded man a joyful and quickening side (Hengstenberg on <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>). To this it is added, that the divine penal judgments reveal not only the holiness and righteousness of God, but also prepare the way for the revelation of salvation, and minister to the saving of the soul.</body></html>
