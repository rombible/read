Similar facts are continually encountered in the Scriptures, whether in its histories, as in those of Naaman the Syrian, of the faith of the Syro-Phœnician woman (<a href="/context/matthew/15-21.htm" title="Then Jesus went there, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.">Matthew 15:21-28</a>), and of the Roman centurion (<a href="/context/matthew/8-10.htm" title="When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.">Matthew 8:10-12</a>), or in the express declarations of our Lord that the teaching and signs given to Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum in vain would have been more than sufficient for the conversion of Tyre, or Sidon, or even of Sodom (<a href="/matthew/11-21.htm" title="Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.">Matthew 11:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-23.htm" title="And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.">Matthew 11:23</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/12-41.htm" title="The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.">Matthew 12:41-42</a>). If it be asked, Why then should so much of the Divine compassion be expended upon a nation which so generally refused to avail itself of its blessings? the answer must be that only thus could even a few be raised at all above the very lowest spiritual plane, and that the raising of these few leads ultimately to the elevation of many. As an accountable being, man must be left free to neglect the proffered grace; and, as in the case of the Israelites to whom Ezekiel was sent, there would always be many who choose to do so. The consequence of this neglect must be such a hardening of the heart as was now shown by these people, and every man is warned by their example of the responsibility attached to the enjoyment of religious privilege. But the same thing would have happened with any other nation; and that God’s faithfulness should not fail, and that His purposes for man’s salvation should be accomplished, more grace must yet be given and His people must still be pleaded with, that at least a remnant of them might be led to repentance and be saved from the impending ruin. Theodoret calls attention to the contrast between the restriction of the grace of the Old Dispensation to a single people, and the universal diffusion of the preaching of the Gospel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ezekiel/3-5.htm" title="For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;...">Ezekiel 3:5-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech — </span>It would be a great addition to the burden of thy office if thou wert sent, as Jonah was, as a prophet to a foreign nation, and to a people whose language thou couldest not understand, nor they thine. <span class="ital">Not to many people of a strange speech, </span>&c. — God seems, as it were, to hint here that the time would come when he should order his messengers to go to many people of a strange speech, and should find those who would obey him in this.

Gracious souls can receive those truths of God with delight, which speak terror to the wicked. He must speak all that, and that only, which God spake to him. How can we better speak God's mind than with his words? If disappointed as to his people, he must not be offended. The Ninevites were wrought upon by Jonah's preaching, when Israel was unhumbled and unreformed. We must leave this unto the Divine sovereignty, and say, Lord, thy judgments are a great deep. They will not regard the word of the prophet, for they will not regard the rod of God. Christ promises to strengthen him.

This may be considered, either by way of encouragement to the prophet to go on his errand to such a people; since as he could understand them, and they him he might hope to meet with success; or, however he could deliver his message so as to be understood: or as an aggravation of the impiety perverseness and stupidity of the Israelites; that though the prophet spoke to them in their own language, yet they would not hear nor receive his words: <p>but to the house of Israel; who were a people of the same speech and language with the prophet; all spoke and understood the language of Canaan; nor were the things he delivered such as they were altogether strangers to being the same, for substance, which Moses, and the other prophets, had ever taught. <p>(g)  "profundi labii", Vatablus; "profundorum labio", Polanus, Cocceius; "profundi sermonis", Starkius.

The thought implied is that Ezekiel's mission, as to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (<a href="/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>), was outwardly easier than if he had been sent to the heathen. With Israel there was at least the medium of a speech common both to the prophet and his hearers. In ver. 6 the thought is enlarged by the use of "many peoples." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Call of Ezekiel to the Prophetic Office - <a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>. Upon the manifestation of the Lord follows the word of vocation. Having, in the feeling of his weakness and sinfulness, fallen to the ground before the terrible revelation of Jehovah's glory, Ezekiel is first of all raised up again by the voice of God, to hear the word which calls him to the prophetic function. - <a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1</a>. And He said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, I will speak with thee. <a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>. Then came spirit unto me as He spake unto me, and it placed me on my feet, and I heard Him speaking unto me. - The address &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; occurs so frequently in Ezekiel, that it must be regarded as one of the peculiarities of his prophecies. Elsewhere it occurs only once, <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>. That it is significant, is generally recognised, although its meaning is variously given. Most expositors take it as  a reminder of the weakness and frailness of human nature; Coccejus and Kliefoth, on the contrary, connect it with the circumstance that God appears to Ezekiel in human form, and find in it a &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; amicitiae, that God speaks in him as man to man, converses with him as a man with his friend.  This last interpretation, however, has against it the usus loquendi. As &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; denotes man according to his natural condition, it is used throughout as a synonym with &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, denoting the weakness and fragility of man in opposition to God; cf. <a href="/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a>; <a href="/job/25-6.htm">Job 25:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2</a>; and <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>. This is the meaning also of &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; in the address, as may be distinctly seen from the various addresses in Daniel. Daniel is addressed, where comfort is to be imparted to him, as &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1473; &#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, "man greatly beloved," <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-11.htm">Daniel 10:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-19.htm">Daniel 10:19</a>, cf. <a href="/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>; but, on the contrary, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>, where he has fallen on his face in terror before the appearance of Gabriel, with the words, "Understand, O son of man," in order to remind him of his human weakness. This is also the case in our verse, where Ezekiel, too, had fallen upon his face, and by God's word spoken to him, is again raised to his feet. It is only in Ezekiel that this address is constantly employed to mark the distance between the human weakness of his nature and the divine power which gives him the capacity and the impulse to speak. Not, however, with the design, mentioned by Jerome on <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, "that he may not be elated on account of his high calling," because, as Hvernick subjoins, Ezekiel's extremely powerful and forcible nature may have needed to be perpetually reminded of what it is in reality before God. If this were the meaning and object of this address, it would also probably occur in the writings of several of the other prophets, as the supposition that the nature of Ezekiel was more powerful and forcible than that of the other prophets is altogether without foundation. The constant use of this form of address in Ezekiel is connected rather with the manner and fashion in which most of the revelations were imparted to him, that is, with the prevalence of "vision," in which the distinction between God and man comes out more prominently than in ordinary inspiration or revelation, effected by means of an impression upon the inner faculties of man. The bringing prominently forward, however, of the distance between God and men is to remind the prophet, as well as the people to whom he communicated his revelations, not merely of the weakness of humanity, but to show them, at the same time, how powerfully the word of God operates in feeble man, and also that God, who has selected the prophet as the organ of His will, possesses also the power to redeem the people, that were lying powerless under the oppression of the heathen, from their misery, and to raise them up again. - At the word of the Lord, "Stand upon thy feet," came &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; into the prophet, which raised him to his feet. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; here is not "life consciousness" (Hitzig), but the spirit-power which proceeds from God, and which is conveyed through the word which imparted to him the strength to stand before the face of God, and to undertake His command. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, partic. Hithpa., properly "collocutor," occurs here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6</a>, and in <a href="/numbers/7-89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>; elsewhere, only in <a href="/2_samuel/14-13.htm">2 Samuel 14:13</a>. </body></html>
