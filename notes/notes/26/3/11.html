In <a href="/ezekiel/3-10.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.">Ezekiel 3:10</a> he has been told in plain terms what had already been symbolically conveyed under the figure of the roll, and now he is further informed that his immediate mission to the house of Israel is limited to that part of it which, like himself, was already in captivity. At this time, and for several years to come, this was a comparatively small part of the whole nation; but before Ezekiel’s ministrations were finished it embraced the mass of them. (See Introd., III.) It is noticeable that God directs him to go, not to <span class= "ital">My, </span>but to <span class= "ital">thy </span>people; just as in <a href="/ezekiel/2-3.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day.">Ezekiel 2:3</a> He speaks of them as heathen, so here He refuses to recognise them in their present state as really His people. (Comp. <a href="/exodus/32-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go, get you down; for your people, which you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:">Exodus 32:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-2.htm" title="Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them, When I bring the sword on a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:">Ezekiel 33:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-12.htm" title="Therefore, you son of man, say to the children of your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sins.">Ezekiel 33:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-17.htm" title="Yet the children of your people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.">Ezekiel 33:17</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm" title="Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.">Daniel 9:24</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-14.htm" title="Now I am come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.">Daniel 10:14</a>.) At the same time, there is thus indirectly suggested to the prophet a reminder that he is himself one of the same people, and needs therefore to be on his guard against the sin and obduracy which characterise them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ezekiel/3-11.htm" title="And go, get you to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus said the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear....">Ezekiel 3:11-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Go to them of the captivity — </span>Namely, those made captives with thyself in the reign of King Jehoiachin. <span class="ital">Then the spirit took me up — </span>Carried me from the place where I was before, when I saw the vision mentioned <a href="/context/ezekiel/1-3.htm" title="The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him....">Ezekiel 1:3-4</a>, to my countrymen and fellow-captives. <span class="ital">And I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing — </span>Emblematical, probably, of the great commotions and troubles he was to foretel, and which were to ensue.

Gracious souls can receive those truths of God with delight, which speak terror to the wicked. He must speak all that, and that only, which God spake to him. How can we better speak God's mind than with his words? If disappointed as to his people, he must not be offended. The Ninevites were wrought upon by Jonah's preaching, when Israel was unhumbled and unreformed. We must leave this unto the Divine sovereignty, and say, Lord, thy judgments are a great deep. They will not regard the word of the prophet, for they will not regard the rod of God. Christ promises to strengthen him.

And thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee, Be not stiff-necked like the stiff-necked race; open thy mouth, and eat what I give unto thee. <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>. Then I saw, and, lo, a hand outstretched towards me; and, lo, in the same a roll of a book. <a href="/ezekiel/2-10.htm">Ezekiel 2:10</a>. And He spread it out before me; the same was written upon the front and back: and there were written upon it lamentations, and sighing, and woe. <a href="/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1</a>. And He said to me: Son of man, what thou findest eat; eat the roll, and go and speak to the house of Israel. <a href="/ezekiel/3-2.htm">Ezekiel 3:2</a>. Then opened I my mouth, and He gave me this roll to eat. <a href="/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Ezekiel 3:3</a>. And said to me: Son of man, feed thy belly, and fill thy body with this roll which I give thee. And I ate it, and it was in my mouth as honey and sweetness. - The prophet is to announce to the people of Israel only that which the Lord inspires him to announce. This thought is embodied in symbol, in such a way that an outstretched hand reaches to him a book, which he is to swallow, and which also, at God's command, he does swallow; cf. <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>. This roll was inscribed on both sides with lamentations, sighing, and woe (&#1492;&#1497; is either abbreviated from &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;, not  equals  &#1488;&#1497;, or as Ewald, 101c, thinks, is only a more distinct form of &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; or &#1492;&#1493;). The meaning is not, that upon the roll was inscribed a multitude of mournful expressions of every kind, but that there was written upon it all that the prophet was to announce, and what we now read in his book. These contents were of a mournful nature, for they related to the destruction of the kingdom, the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple. That Ezekiel may look over the contents, the roll is spread out before his eyes, and then handed to him to be eaten, with the words, "Go and speak to the children of Israel," i.e., announce to the children of Israel what you have received into yourself, or as it is termed in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-4.htm">Ezekiel 3:4</a>, &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;, "my words." The words in <a href="/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Ezekiel 3:3</a> were spoken by God while handing to the prophet the roll to be eaten. He is not merely to eat, i.e., take it into his mouth, but he is to fill his body and belly therewith, i.e., he is to receive into his innermost being the word of God presented to him, to change it, as it were, into sap and blood. Whilst eating it, it was sweet in his mouth. The sweet taste must not, with Kliefoth, be explained away into a sweet "after-taste," and made to bear this reference, that the destruction of Jerusalem would be followed by a more glorious restoration. The roll, inscribed with lamentation, sorrow, and woe, tasted to him sweetly, because its contents was God's word, which sufficed for the joy and gladness of his heart (<a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a>); for it is "infinitely sweet and lovely to be the organ and spokesman of the Omnipotent," and even the most painful of divine truths possess to a spiritually-minded man a joyful and quickening side (Hengstenberg on <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>). To this it is added, that the divine penal judgments reveal not only the holiness and righteousness of God, but also prepare the way for the revelation of salvation, and minister to the saving of the soul. </body></html>
