All this was to convince Ezekiel, that the God who sent him had power to bear him out in his work. He was overwhelmed with grief for the sins and miseries of his people, and overpowered by the glory of the vision he had seen. And however retirement, meditation, and communion with God may be sweet, the servant of the Lord must prepare to serve his generation. The Lord told the prophet he had appointed him a watchman to the house of Israel. If we warn the wicked, we are not chargeable with their ruin. Though such passages refer to the national covenant made with Israel, they are equally to be applied to the final state of all men under every dispensation. We are not only to encourage and comfort those who appear to be righteous, but they are to be warned, for many have grown high-minded and secure, have fallen, and even died in their sins. Surely then the hearers of the gospel should desire warnings, and even reproofs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This passage anticipates the great moral principle of divine government <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18.htm">Ezekiel 18</a> that each man is individually responsible for his own actions, and will be judged according to these and these alone.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. warning &#8230; speakest to warn&#8212;The repetition implies that it is not enough to warn once in passing, but that the warning is to be inculcated continually (2Ti 4:2, "in season, out of season"; Ac 20:31, "night and day with tears").<p>save&#8212;Eze 2:5 had seemingly taken away all hope of salvation; but the reference there was to the mass of the people whose case was hopeless; a few individuals, however, were reclaimable.<p>die in &#8230; iniquity&#8212;(Joh 8:21, 24).

This intimation given to the prophet is represented as a threat spoken directly to the wicked. If the prophet as a watchman perceive this danger of death to the wicked and fails to warn him, the wicked shall die for his own sin indeed, but his blood will be upon the watchman. He that fails to save life kills; and blood will be required of him, of every man’s hand the blood of his brother. <a href="/context/proverbs/24-11.htm" title="If you forbear to deliver them that are drawn to death, and those that are ready to be slain;...">Proverbs 24:11-12</a>, “Deliver them that are carried away unto death … If thou sayest, Behold, we knew not this, Doth not he that weigheth the hearts consider it?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in his iniquity</span>] Perhaps: <span class="ital">through</span> his iniquity. It is of the nature of sin that it is made the instrument of its own punishment, <a href="/job/8-4.htm" title="If your children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;">Job 8:4</a>. “Warning” will naturally be of many kinds, suitable to those warned; some may be deterred and others allured from their evil.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou givest him not warning,</span> etc. The word, as in the parallels already referral to, is characteristic of Ezekiel, almost indeed, peculiar to him. <a href="/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a> may be noted as another instance of its use. When the watchman saw danger coming, he was to blow the trumpet (<a href="/ezekiel/33-3.htm">Ezekiel 33:3-6</a>). The prophet was to speak his warnings. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt surely die;</span> literally, <span class="accented">dying thou shalt die</span>. Were the words of <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> in the prophet's mind? <span class="cmt_word">To save his life;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for his life</span>, or <span class="accented">that he may live.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Shall die in his iniquity.</span> Do the words refer only to physical death coming as the punishment of iniquity? or do they point onward further to the judgment that follows death, the loss of the inheritance of eternal life which belongs to those whose names are written in the book of life? Looking to the tremendous responsibility implied in the words, we can hardly, I think, in spite of the questions which have been raised as to the belief of the Hebrews in the immortality of the soul, hesitate to accept the latter meaning. Ezekiel anticipates the teaching of <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>, if, indeed, that meaning was not already familiar to him in <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32, 33</a>. For "in" his iniquity we may, perhaps, read "because of." The negligence of the watchman does not avail to procure a full pardon for the evil doer. The degree in which it may extenuate his guilt depends on conditions known to God, but not to us. In any case, as in our Lord's words (<a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47, 48</a>), a man's knowledge and opportunities are the measure of his responsibility. But the unfaithful watchman has his responsibility. It is as though the blood of the sinner had been shed. His guilt may be described in the same words as that of Cain (<a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>). Compare St. Paul's words in <a href="/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a> and Acts 20:26 as echoes of Ezekiel's thought. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the Lord had pointed out to the prophet the difficulties of the call laid upon him, He prepared him for the performance of his office, by inspiring him with the divine word which he is to announce. - <a href="/ezekiel/2-8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8</a>. And thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee, Be not stiff-necked like the stiff-necked race; open thy mouth, and eat what I give unto thee. <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>. Then I saw, and, lo, a hand outstretched towards me; and, lo, in the same a roll of a book. <a href="/ezekiel/2-10.htm">Ezekiel 2:10</a>. And He spread it out before me; the same was written upon the front and back: and there were written upon it lamentations, and sighing, and woe. <a href="/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1</a>. And He said to me: Son of man, what thou findest eat; eat the roll, and go and speak to the house of Israel. <a href="/ezekiel/3-2.htm">Ezekiel 3:2</a>. Then opened I my mouth, and He gave me this roll to eat. <a href="/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Ezekiel 3:3</a>. And said to me: Son of man, feed thy belly, and fill thy body with this roll which I give thee. And I ate it, and it was in my mouth as honey and sweetness. - The prophet is to announce to the people of Israel only that which the Lord inspires him to announce. This thought is embodied in symbol, in such a way that an outstretched hand reaches to him a book, which he is to swallow, and which also, at God's command, he does swallow; cf. <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>. This roll was inscribed on both sides with lamentations, sighing, and woe (&#1492;&#1497; is either abbreviated from &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;, not  equals  &#1488;&#1497;, or as Ewald, 101c, thinks, is only a more distinct form of &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; or &#1492;&#1493;). The meaning is not, that upon the roll was inscribed a multitude of mournful expressions of every kind, but that there was written upon it all that the prophet was to announce, and what we now read in his book. These contents were of a mournful nature, for they related to the destruction of the kingdom, the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple. That Ezekiel may look over the contents, the roll is spread out before his eyes, and then handed to him to be eaten, with the words, "Go and speak to the children of Israel," i.e., announce to the children of Israel what you have received into yourself, or as it is termed in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-4.htm">Ezekiel 3:4</a>, &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;, "my words." The words in <a href="/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Ezekiel 3:3</a> were spoken by God while handing to the prophet the roll to be eaten. He is not merely to eat, i.e., take it into his mouth, but he is to fill his body and belly therewith, i.e., he is to receive into his innermost being the word of God presented to him, to change it, as it were, into sap and blood. Whilst eating it, it was sweet in his mouth. The sweet taste must not, with Kliefoth, be explained away into a sweet "after-taste," and made to bear this reference, that the destruction of Jerusalem would be followed by a more glorious restoration. The roll, inscribed with lamentation, sorrow, and woe, tasted to him sweetly, because its contents was God's word, which sufficed for the joy and gladness of his heart (<a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a>); for it is "infinitely sweet and lovely to be the organ and spokesman of the Omnipotent," and even the most painful of divine truths possess to a spiritually-minded man a joyful and quickening side (Hengstenberg on <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>). To this it is added, that the divine penal judgments reveal not only the holiness and righteousness of God, but also prepare the way for the revelation of salvation, and minister to the saving of the soul.</body></html>
