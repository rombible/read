Gracious souls can receive those truths of God with delight, which speak terror to the wicked. He must speak all that, and that only, which God spake to him. How can we better speak God's mind than with his words? If disappointed as to his people, he must not be offended. The Ninevites were wrought upon by Jonah's preaching, when Israel was unhumbled and unreformed. We must leave this unto the Divine sovereignty, and say, Lord, thy judgments are a great deep. They will not regard the word of the prophet, for they will not regard the rod of God. Christ promises to strengthen him.

The Prophet’s Particular Mission to the Exiles at Tel Abib<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Though Ezekiel’s mission, like that of all the prophets, was to the house of Israel as a whole (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/3-5.htm" title="For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;">Ezekiel 3:5</a></span>), yet immediately his work lay among the captives in the midst of whom he lived. It is remarkable, however, how little reference is made in his prophecies to the particular circumstances of the exiles. The attention of the prophet, as well as those around him in captivity, seems to have been engrossed by the events occurring in Palestine, and especially in the capital. And the truths spoken by him, though uttered in the ears of the exiles, bear reference to all Israel. Though he occasionally draws a distinction between those left in the land and the exiles carried away with Jehoiachin, of whom he was one (ch. <a href="/ezekiel/11-15.htm" title="Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: to us is this land given in possession.">Ezekiel 11:15</a>), in general he regards the exiles as representatives of Israel, and feels when addressing them that he is speaking to the whole house of Israel. In the gradual defining of his task more clearly these exiles are now referred to. He is bidden go to them of the captivity (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/3-11.htm" title="And go, get you to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus said the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.">Ezekiel 3:11</a></span>), and he came to them of the captivity to Tel Abib. And now that he is entering upon his ministry there comes to him: (1) the command anew to hear and receive into his heart the words that God shall speak to him (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/3-10.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.">Ezekiel 3:10</a></span>). (2) next the command to announce himself as a prophet of the Lord: thus saith the Lord (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/3-11.htm" title="And go, get you to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus said the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.">Ezekiel 3:11</a></span>). And (3) with this command comes the sense of the divine impulse carrying him forward to his service: then the spirit lifted me up … and I came to them of the captivity (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/3-12.htm" title="Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.">Ezekiel 3:12</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/3-14.htm" title="So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong on me....">Ezekiel 3:14-15</a></span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All my words,</span> etc. The stress lies on the first word. The prophet was not to pick and choose out of the message, but was to deliver "all the counsel of God" (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Take into thine heart,</span> etc. An inverted order of the two commands would, perhaps, have seemed more natural. What we actually find, however, is sufficiently suggestive. The message of Jehovah is first received into the inner depths of the soul, but in that stage it is vague, undefined, incommunicable. It needs to be clothed in articulate speech before it can be heard with the mental ear and passed on to others. The mouth speaks out of the fulness of the heart. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The calling of the prophet begins with the Lord describing to Ezekiel the people to whom He is sending him, in order to make him acquainted with the difficulties of his vocation, and to encourage him for the discharge of the same.  <a href="/ezekiel/2-3.htm">Ezekiel 2:3</a>. And He said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to the rebels who have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have fallen away from me, even until this very day. <a href="/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>. And the children are of hard face, and hardened heart. To them I send thee; and to them shalt thou speak: Thus says the Lord Jehovah. <a href="/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>. And they - they may hear thee or fail (to do so); for they are a stiff-necked race - they shall experience that a prophet has been in their midst. <a href="/ezekiel/2-6.htm">Ezekiel 2:6</a>. But thou, son of man, fear not before them, and be not afraid of their words, if thistles and thorns are found about thee, and thou sittest upon scorpions; fear not before their words, and tremble not before their face; for they are a stiff-necked race. <a href="/ezekiel/2-7.htm">Ezekiel 2:7</a>. And speak my words to them, whether they may hear or fail (to do so); for they are stiff-necked.<p>The children of Israel have become heathen, no longer a people of God, not even a heathen nation (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>), but &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, "heathens," that is, as being rebels against God. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (with the article) is not to be joined as an adjective to &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, which is without the article, but is employed substantively in the form of an apposition. They have rebelled against God in this, that they, like their fathers, have separated themselves from Jehovah down to this day (as regards &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;, see on <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; and &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;, as in the Pentateuch; cf. <a href="/leviticus/23-14.htm">Leviticus 23:14</a>; <a href="/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>, etc.). Like their fathers, the sons are rebellious, and, in addition, they are &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, of hard countenance"  equals  &#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1497;, "of hard brow" (<a href="/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>), i.e., impudent, without hiding the face, or lowering the look for shame. This shamelessness springs from hardness of heart. To these hardened sinners Ezekiel is to announce the word of the Lord. Whether they hear it or not (&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1493;&#1488;&#1501;, sive-sive, as in <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>), they shall in any case experience that a prophet has been amongst them. That they will neglect to hear is very probable, because they are a stiff-necked race (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, "house"  equals  family). The Vau before &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>) introduces the apodosis. &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is perfect, not present. This is demanded by the usus loquendi and the connection of the thought. The meaning is not: they shall now from his testimony that a prophet is there; but they shall experience from the result, viz., when the word announced by him will have been fulfilled, that a prophet has been amongst them. Ezekiel, therefore, is not to be prevented by fear of them and their words from delivering a testimony against their sins. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, &#1505;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, are not, with the older expositors, to be explained adjectively: "rebelles et renuentes," but are substantives. As regards &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, the signification "thorn" is placed beyond doubt by &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a>, and &#1505;&#1512;&#1489; in Aramaic does indeed denote "refractarius;" but this signification is a derived one, and inappropriate here. &#1505;&#1512;&#1489; is related to &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;, "to burn, to singe," and means "urtica," "stinging-nettle, thistle," as Donasch in Raschi has already explained it. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; is, according to the later usage, for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;, expressing the "by and with of association," and occurs frequently in Ezekiel. Thistles and thorns are emblems of dangerous, hostile men. The thought is strengthened by the words "to sit on (&#1488;&#1500; for &#1506;&#1500;) scorpions," as these animals inflict a painful and dangerous wound. For the similitude of dangerous men to scorpions, cf. Sir. 26:10, and other proof passages in Bochart, Hierozoic. III. p. 551f., ed. Rosenmll. </body></html>
