All this was to convince Ezekiel, that the God who sent him had power to bear him out in his work. He was overwhelmed with grief for the sins and miseries of his people, and overpowered by the glory of the vision he had seen. And however retirement, meditation, and communion with God may be sweet, the servant of the Lord must prepare to serve his generation. The Lord told the prophet he had appointed him a watchman to the house of Israel. If we warn the wicked, we are not chargeable with their ruin. Though such passages refer to the national covenant made with Israel, they are equally to be applied to the final state of all men under every dispensation. We are not only to encourage and comfort those who appear to be righteous, but they are to be warned, for many have grown high-minded and secure, have fallen, and even died in their sins.

For it seems the captive Jews were disposed of at different places, and there were some at this place; for this was the name of a place, as Jarchi and Kimchi observe; as were Telmelah, and Telharsa, <a href="/ezra/2-59.htm">Ezra 2:59</a>; it signifies "a heap of new fruit", and so the Vulgate Latin version renders it: not that there were such at this time here; and the captives were beating out the ripe ears of corn, as "abib" signifies; whence the month Abib has its name, and which was the first month with the Jews; whereas it was in the fourth month when Ezekiel was here, and there could no ears of new corn, <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; according to Junius, this Telabib was a tract in Mesopotamia, reaching from Mount Masius to the river Euphrates, and lay between two rivers, Chebar and Saocoras; and he thinks the captive Jews were placed here, partly that they might be secured safe from getting away, or returning from their captivity; and partly that they might secure and defend the place from enemies, it being through inundations uninhabited, and so exposed unto them: <p>that dwelt by the river of Chebar; See Gill on <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <p>and I sat where they sat; there is a double reading here; the "Cetib" or writing is  which Junius takes to be the name of a river the prophet calls Haesher, the same with Saocoras, connecting it with the preceding clause, "that dwelt by the river of Chebar and Haesher"; the "Keri" or marginal reading is  "and I sat" or "dwelt"; but both signify the same thing, Since is from  which in Chaldee signifies to dwell (s); and the "Keri" is confirmed by the Targum, which we follow. The sense is, that he placed himself among the captives, <p>and remained there astonished among them seven days: at the change of place and company; at the sad condition his people were in; and, above all, at the dreadful things he had to deliver to them. The Targum renders it, "silent"; through grief and trouble. So many days Job's friends kept silence, when they came to visit him, and saw his distress, <a href="/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>. Or he might be waiting all this time for orders and instructions to prophesy; or to prepare the people to attend with more reverence and earnestness, to hear what he had to say when he should break silence.

There was enough in the prophet’s circumstances to produce a conflict of feelings in his mind—the sin of Israel, who were yet his own people; the task before which he stood, and his close and awful communications with heaven. The simple feeling of bitterness and indignation which filled his mind when he newly left the presence of God became broken into a tumult of feelings when he saw the face of men. Zeal for God becomes tempered and humanized in actual service. Ezekiel felt himself a prophet a moment ago, now he feels himself a watchman (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm" title="Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.">Ezekiel 3:17</a></span> <span class="ital">seq</span>.).

Ezra sat in stupor only until the evening.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At Tel-Abib,</span> etc., We now enter on the first scene of the prophet's ministry. The LXX. leaves the proper name. The Vulgate rightly translates it as <span class="accented">acervus novarum frugum</span>, the "mound of ears of corn" (the meaning appears in the name of the Passover month, Abib). Luther gives, strangely enough, "where the almond trees stood, in the mouth Abib"). Jerome's suggestion, that here also there was a <span class="accented">nomen et omen.</span> and that those who shared Ezekiel's exile were regarded as the "firstfruits" of the future, is at least ingenious, and finds some support in <a href="/psalms/126-5.htm">Psalm 126:5, 6</a>. The place has not been identified, and its position depends on that of the river with which it is connected (see note on Ezekiel 1:1). The word "Tel" is commonly applied to the mounds formed out of masses of ruins, which are common all over the plains of Mesopotamia. The name in this case may suggest that the earth had gathered over it, and that it was cultivated. <span class="cmt_word">I sat where they sat</span>, etc. The ministry begins not with speech, but silence. Our Western habits hardly enable us to enter into the impressiveness of such a procedure. The conduct of Job's friends (<a href="/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>) presents a parallel, and as Ezekiel seems to have known that book (<a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</a>), he may have been influenced by it. Like actions meet us in <a href="/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3-5</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-19.htm">Daniel 4:19</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the Lord had pointed out to the prophet the difficulties of the call laid upon him, He prepared him for the performance of his office, by inspiring him with the divine word which he is to announce. - <a href="/ezekiel/2-8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8</a>. And thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee, Be not stiff-necked like the stiff-necked race; open thy mouth, and eat what I give unto thee. <a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>. Then I saw, and, lo, a hand outstretched towards me; and, lo, in the same a roll of a book. <a href="/ezekiel/2-10.htm">Ezekiel 2:10</a>. And He spread it out before me; the same was written upon the front and back: and there were written upon it lamentations, and sighing, and woe. <a href="/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1</a>. And He said to me: Son of man, what thou findest eat; eat the roll, and go and speak to the house of Israel. <a href="/ezekiel/3-2.htm">Ezekiel 3:2</a>. Then opened I my mouth, and He gave me this roll to eat. <a href="/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Ezekiel 3:3</a>. And said to me: Son of man, feed thy belly, and fill thy body with this roll which I give thee. And I ate it, and it was in my mouth as honey and sweetness. - The prophet is to announce to the people of Israel only that which the Lord inspires him to announce. This thought is embodied in symbol, in such a way that an outstretched hand reaches to him a book, which he is to swallow, and which also, at God's command, he does swallow; cf. <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>. This roll was inscribed on both sides with lamentations, sighing, and woe (&#1492;&#1497; is either abbreviated from &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;, not  equals  &#1488;&#1497;, or as Ewald, 101c, thinks, is only a more distinct form of &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; or &#1492;&#1493;). The meaning is not, that upon the roll was inscribed a multitude of mournful expressions of every kind, but that there was written upon it all that the prophet was to announce, and what we now read in his book. These contents were of a mournful nature, for they related to the destruction of the kingdom, the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple. That Ezekiel may look over the contents, the roll is spread out before his eyes, and then handed to him to be eaten, with the words, "Go and speak to the children of Israel," i.e., announce to the children of Israel what you have received into yourself, or as it is termed in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-4.htm">Ezekiel 3:4</a>, &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;, "my words." The words in <a href="/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Ezekiel 3:3</a> were spoken by God while handing to the prophet the roll to be eaten. He is not merely to eat, i.e., take it into his mouth, but he is to fill his body and belly therewith, i.e., he is to receive into his innermost being the word of God presented to him, to change it, as it were, into sap and blood. Whilst eating it, it was sweet in his mouth. The sweet taste must not, with Kliefoth, be explained away into a sweet "after-taste," and made to bear this reference, that the destruction of Jerusalem would be followed by a more glorious restoration. The roll, inscribed with lamentation, sorrow, and woe, tasted to him sweetly, because its contents was God's word, which sufficed for the joy and gladness of his heart (<a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a>); for it is "infinitely sweet and lovely to be the organ and spokesman of the Omnipotent," and even the most painful of divine truths possess to a spiritually-minded man a joyful and quickening side (Hengstenberg on <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>). To this it is added, that the divine penal judgments reveal not only the holiness and righteousness of God, but also prepare the way for the revelation of salvation, and minister to the saving of the soul.</body></html>
