The fame of Daniel’s wisdom was quickly spread over Chaldea, upon his being advanced to several posts of honour and dignity by Nebuchadnezzar. See <a href="/daniel/2-8.htm" title="The king answered and said, I know of certainty that you would gain the time, because you see the thing is gone from me.">Daniel 2:8</a>. So here the prophet in an ironical manner upbraids the vain boasts which the prince of Tyre made of his wisdom, and the policy of those about him, as if it exceeded the endowments of Daniel. The Phenicians, of whom the Tyrians were a colony, (see note on <a href="/isaiah/23-12.htm" title="And he said, You shall no more rejoice, O you oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shall you have no rest.">Isaiah 23:12</a>,) valued themselves for their wisdom and ingenuity, as being inventors of navigation, letters, and sciences. Compare <a href="/zechariah/9-2.htm" title="And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.">Zechariah 9:2</a>. <span class="ital">With thy wisdom, &c., thou hast gotten thee riches </span>— Thy skill in navigation and trade has increased thy wealth. <span class="ital">Behold, I will bring upon thee the terrible of the nations — </span>The Babylonians, who by their conquests have made themselves terrible to all the nations round about them. <span class="ital">They shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom — </span>They shall deface and destroy all the beautiful edifices which thou hast erected with admirable art, and every thing which thou valuest as ornamental or useful, beauteous or magnificent, even all the glory of thy kingdom. <span class="ital">They shall defile thy brightness </span>— They shall render thy kingdom, which is now flourishing and glorious, weak and contemptible. <span class="ital">Thou shalt die the deaths,</span> &c. — Thou shalt die the death of those who perished in the flood. The expression <span class="ital">deaths, </span>in the plural, intimates a still further punishment, even after the death of the body; such as that impious race experienced, and such as this haughty prince had well deserved by his mad pride and blasphemous impiety. And therefore with the same emphasis the prophet tells us, <a href="/ezekiel/28-10.htm" title="You shall die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 28:10</a>, <span class="ital">Thou shalt die the deaths, </span>the double death, <span class="ital">of the uncircumcised; </span>that is, of unbelievers and enemies to God. For circumcision being the rite which distinguished God’s chosen people from the heathen, <span class="ital">uncircumcised </span>is equivalent in sense to wicked or profane. So the Chaldee Paraphrase renders it here. “This is not the only place in this prophecy where the destruction by the deluge is alluded to: for this, and the fall of angels, being two of the greatest events that ever happened, and the most remarkable of God’s judgments, it was very natural for the prophets to recur to them, when they would raise their style in the description of the fall of empires and tyrants. See <a href="/context/ezekiel/26-19.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; When I shall make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep on you, and great waters shall cover you;...">Ezekiel 26:19-20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-26.htm" title="Your rowers have brought you into great waters: the east wind has broken you in the middle of the seas.">Ezekiel 27:26</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-32.htm" title="And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you, and lament over you, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the middle of the sea?">Ezekiel 27:32</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-34.htm" title="In the time when you shall be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters your merchandise and all your company in the middle of you shall fall.">Ezekiel 27:34</a>. As the style of this prophet is wonderfully adapted to the subject whereof he treats, so he compares the destruction of this famous maritime city to a vessel shipwrecked in the sea, and so sends its inhabitants to the <span class="ital">people of old times, </span>as he calls them, who were swallowed up in the universal deluge. Their prince he compares to the prince of the rebel angels, whose pride had given him such a dreadful fall.” See Peters on Job, p. 373, and notes on <a href="/ezekiel/28-14.htm" title="You are the anointed cherub that covers; and I have set you so: you were on the holy mountain of God; you have walked up and down in the middle of the stones of fire.">Ezekiel 28:14</a>. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-19 Ethbaal, or Ithobal, was the prince or king of Tyre; and being lifted up with excessive pride, he claimed Divine honours. Pride is peculiarly the sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, except that which the Lord gives, lead to happiness in this world or in that which is to come. The haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able to protect his people by his own power, and considered himself as equal to the inhabitants of heaven. If it were possible to dwell in the garden of Eden, or even to enter heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyed without a humble, holy, and spiritual mind. Especially all spiritual pride is of the devil.

That is, in his own opinion; or it is ironically said.

The Jews have a saying, that <p>"if all the wise men of the nations were in one scale, and Daniel in the other, he would weigh them all down.'' <p>And perhaps the fame of him had reached the king of Tyre, and yet he thought himself wiser than he; see <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/9-2.htm">Zechariah 9:2</a>, antichrist thinks himself wiser than Daniel, or any of the prophets and apostles; he is wise above that which is written, and takes upon him the sole interpretation of the Scriptures, and to fix the sense of them: <p>there is no secret that they can hide from thee; as he fancied; he had sagacity to penetrate into the councils of neighbouring princes, and discover all plots and intrigues against him; he understood all the "arcana" and secrets of government, and could counterwork the designs of his enemies. Antichrist pretends to know all mysteries, and solve all difficulties, and pass an infallible judgment on things; as if he was of the privy council of heaven, and nothing was transacted there but he was acquainted with it, and had full knowledge of the mind of God in all things. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, thou <i>art</i> wiser than <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:</span><p>(b) Thus he speaks by derision: for Daniel had declared notable signs of his wisdom in Babylon, when Ezekiel wrote this.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">wiser than Daniel</span>] Cf. on ch. <a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm" title="Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 14:14</a>.

Thus &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498; (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/27-18.htm">Ezekiel 27:18</a>), &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; (<a href="/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a>), and &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491;&#1498; (<a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15</a>), or &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1498; (<a href="/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a>), are interchanged with &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/27-24.htm">Ezekiel 27:24</a>), &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;&#1498; (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-20.htm">Ezekiel 27:20</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/27-23.htm">Ezekiel 27:23</a>), and &#1502;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; (<a href="/ezekiel/27-24.htm">Ezekiel 27:24</a>); and, again, &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-14.htm">Ezekiel 27:14</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>), &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;  (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/27-19.htm">Ezekiel 27:19</a>), with &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1498; (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>), and &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1498; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; (<a href="/ezekiel/27-19.htm">Ezekiel 27:19</a>), and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (<a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15</a>). The words &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;, participle of &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;, and &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;, from &#1512;&#1499;&#1500; morf, signify merchants, traders, who travel through different lands for purposes of trade. &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1514;, literally, the female trader; and &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;, literally, trade; then used as abstract for concrete, the tradesman or merchant. &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;, the travelling merchant. -  &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;, the female trader, a city carrying on trade. &#1502;&#1512;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;, trade or a place of trade, a commercial town. &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (pluralet.) does not mean a place of trade, market, and profits (Gesenius and others); but according to its derivation from &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;, to leave, relinquish, literally, leaving or giving up, and as Gusset. has correctly explained it, "that which you leave with another in the place of something else which he has given up to you." Ewald, in accordance with this explanation, has adopted the very appropriate rendering Absatz, or sale. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, with &#1489;, or with a double accusative, literally, to make thy sale with something, i.e., to pay or to give, i.e., pay, something as an equivalent for the sale; '&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1494;&#1489;, to give something for the sale, or the goods to be sold. &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, barter, goods bartered with &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, to give bartered goods, or carry on trade by barter.<p>The following are the countries and peoples enumerated: - &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, the Tyrian colony of Tarshish or Tartessus, in Hispania Baetica, which was celebrated for its wealth in silver (<a href="/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>), and, according to the passage before us, also supplied iron, tin, and lead (vid., Plin. Hist. nat. iii. 3 4, xxxiii. 6 31, xxiv. 14 41; Diod. Sic. v. 38). Further particulars concerning Tarshish are to be found in Movers, Phoeniz. II 2, pp. 588ff., and II 3, p. 36. - Javan, i.e., Jania, Greece or Greeks. - Tubal and Meshech are the Tibareni and Moschi of the ancients between the Black and Caspian Seas (see the comm. on <a href="/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>). They supplied souls of men, i.e., slaves, and things in brass. The slave trade was carried on most vigorously by the Ionians and Greeks (see <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/4-6.htm">Joel 4:6</a>, from which we learn that the Phoenicians sold prisoners of war to them); and both Greeks and Romans drew their largest supplies and the best slaves from the Pontus (for proofs of this, see Movers, II 3, pp. 81f.). It is probable that the principal supplies of brazen articles were furnished by the Tibareni and Moschi, as the Colchian mountains still contain an inexhaustible quantity of copper. In Greece, copper was found and wrought in Euboea alone; and the only other rich mines were in Cyprus (vid., Movers, II 3, pp. 66, 67). - <a href="/ezekiel/27-14.htm">Ezekiel 27:14</a>. "From the house of Togarmah they paid," i.e., they of the house of Togarmah paid. Togarmah is one of the names of the Armenians (see the comm. on <a href="/genesis/10-3.htm">Genesis 10:3</a>); and Strabo (XI 14. 9) mentions the wealth of Armenia in horses, whilst that in asses is attested by Herodotus (i. 194), so that we may safely infer that mules were also bred there. - <a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15</a>. The sons of Dedan, or the Dedanites, are, no doubt, the Dedanites mentioned in <a href="/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a> as descendants of Cush, who conducted the carrying trade between the Persian Gulf and Tyre, and whose caravans are mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>. Their relation to the Semitic Dedanites, who are evidently intended in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-20.htm">Ezekiel 27:20</a>, and by the inhabitants of Dedan mentioned in connection with Edom in <a href="/ezekiel/25-13.htm">Ezekiel 25:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-8.htm">Jeremiah 49:8</a>, is involved in obscurity (see the comm. on <a href="/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>). The combination with &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; and the articles of commerce which they brought to Tyre, point to a people of southern Arabia settled in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf. The many &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; are the islands and coasts of Arabia on the Persian Gulf and Erythraean Sea.<p>(Note: Movers (II 3, pp. 303ff.) adduces still further evidence in addition to that given above, namely, that "unquestionable traces of the ancient name have been preserved in the region in which the ancient Dedanites are represented as living, partly on the coast in the names Attana, Attene, which have been modified according to well-known laws, - the former, a commercial town on the Persian Gulf, visited by Roman merchants (Plin. vi. 32, 147); the latter, a tract of country opposite to the island of Tylos (Plin. l.c. 49), - and partly in the islands of the Persian Gulf" (p. 304).)<p>&#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491;&#1498;, the commerce of thy hand, i.e., as abstr. pro concr., those who were ready to thy hand as merchants. &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, ivory horns. This is the term applied to the elephants' tusks (shn) on account of their shape and resemblance to horns, just as Pliny (Hist. nat. xviii. 1) also speaks of cornua elephanti, although he says, in viii. 3((4), that an elephant's weapons, which Juba calls cornua, are more correctly to be called dentes.<p>(Note: The Ethiopians also call ivory Karna nage, i.e., cornu elephanti, and suppose that it is from horns, and not from tusks, that ivory comes (vid., Hiob Ludolph, Hist. Aeth. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10</a>).)<p>The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.. &#1492;&#1493;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, Keri &#1492;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, signifies &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; hebenum, ebony. The ancients obtained both productions partly from India, partly from Ethiopia (Plin. xii. 4 8). According to Dioscor. i. 130, the Ethiopian ebony was preferred to the Indian. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; to return payment (see the comm. on <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>).<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>, J. D. Michaelis, Ewald, Hitzig, and others read &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; for  &#1488;&#1512;&#1501;, after the lxx and Pesh., because Aram did not lie in the road from Dedan and the &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; to Israel (<a href="/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>), and it is not till <a href="/ezekiel/27-18.htm">Ezekiel 27:18</a> that Ezekiel reaches Aram. Moreover, the corruption &#1488;&#1512;&#1501; for &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; could arise all the more readily from the simple fact that the defective form &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; only occurs in Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/25-14.htm">Ezekiel 25:14</a>), and is altogether an extraordinary one. These reasons are undoubtedly worthy of consideration; still they are not conclusive, since the enumeration does not follow a strictly geographical order, inasmuch as Damascus is followed in <a href="/ezekiel/27-19.htm">Ezekiel 27:19</a>. by many of the tribes of Southern Arabia, so that Aram might stand, as Hvernick supposes, for Mesopotamian Aram, for which the articles mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a> would be quite as suitable as for Edom, whose chief city Petra was an important place of commerce and emporium for goods. &#1512;&#1489; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498;, the multitude of thy works, thy manufactures. Of the articles of commerce delivered by &#1488;&#1512;&#1501; , the red purple, embroidery, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (the Aramaean name for byssus, which appears, according to Movers, to have originally denoted a species of cotton), favour Aram, particularly Babylonia, rather than Edom. For the woven fabrics of Babylonia were celebrated from the earliest times (vid., Movers, II 3, pp. 260ff.); and Babylon was also the oldest and most important market for precious stones (vid., Movers, p. 266). &#1504;&#1508;&#1498; is the carbuncle (see the comm. on <a href="/exodus/28-18.htm">Exodus 28:18</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;, probably the ruby; in any case, a precious stone of brilliant splendour (vid., <a href="/isaiah/54-12.htm">Isaiah 54:12</a>). &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, corals or pearls (vid., Delitzsch on <a href="/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>). - Judah (<a href="/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>) delivered to Tyre wheat of Minnith, i.e., according to <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/11-33.htm">Judges 11:33</a>, an Ammonitish place, situated, according to the Onomast., four Roman miles from Heshbon in the direction of Philadelphia. That Ammonitis abounded in wheat, is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-5.htm">2 Chronicles 27:5</a>, although the land of Israel also supplied the Tyrians with wheat (<a href="/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>). The meaning of the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1491;&#1501;&#787;&#768;&#1489;&#1504;&#787;&#768;&#1489; cannot be definitely ascertained. The rendering confectionery is founded upon the Aramaean &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1511;, deliciari, and the Chaldee translation, &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, i.e., &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, according to Hesychius, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, or sweetmeats made from honey. Jerome renders it balsamum, after the &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; of the lxx; and in Hitzig's opinion, Pannaga (literally, a snake) is a name used in Sanscrit for a sweet-scented wood, which was employed in medicine as a cooling and strengthening drug (?). Honey (from bees) and oil are well-known productions of Palestine. &#1510;&#1512;&#1497; is balsam; whether resina or the true balsam grown in gardens about Jericho (opobalsamum), it is impossible to decide (see my Bibl. Archol. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/38.htm">1 Peter 38</a>, and Movers, II 3, pp. 220ff.). Damascus supplied Tyre with wine of Chelbon. &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; still exists in the village of Helbn, a place with many ruins, three hours and a half to the north of Damascus, in the midst of a valley of the same name, which is planted with vines wherever it is practicable, from whose grapes the best and most costly wine of the country is made (vid., Robinson, Biblical Researches). Even in ancient times this wine was so celebrated, that, according to Posidonius (in Athen. Deipnos. i. 22), the kings of Persia drank only Chalybonian wine from Damascus (vid., Strabo, XV 3. 22). &#1510;&#1502;&#1512; &#1510;&#1495;&#1512;, wool of dazzling whiteness; or, according to others, wool of Zachar, for which the Septuagint has &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x39c;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, Milesian wool.<p>(Note: According to Movers (II 3, p. 269), &#1510;&#1495;&#1512; is the Sicharia of Aethicus (Cosm. 108): Sicharia regio, quae postea Nabathaea, nuncupatur, silvestris valde, ubi Ismaelitae eminus, - an earlier name for the land of the Nabathaeans, who dwelt in olden time between Palestine and the Euphrates, and were celebrated for their wealth in flocks of sheep.)<p><a href="/ezekiel/27-19.htm">Ezekiel 27:19</a>. Various explanations have been given of the first three words. &#1493;&#1491;&#1503; is not to be altered into &#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1503;, as it has been by Ewald, both arbitrarily and unsuitably with <a href="/ezekiel/27-20.htm">Ezekiel 27:20</a> immediately following; nor is it to be rendered "and Dan." It is a decisive objection to this, that throughout the whole enumeration not a single land or people is introduced with the copula w. Vedan, which may be compared with the Vaheb of <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>, a place also mentioned only once, is the name of a tribe and tract of land not mentioned elsewhere in the Old Testament. Movers (p. 302) conjectures that it is the celebrated city of Aden (Arab. 'dn). Javan is also the name of an Arabian place or tribe; and, according to a notice in the Kamus, it is a place in Yemen. Tuch (Genesis, p. 210) supposes it to be a Greek (Ionian) settlement, the founders of which had been led by their enterprising spirit to cross the land of Egypt into Southern Arabia. For the purpose of distinguishing this Arabian Javan from Greece itself, or in order to define it more precisely, &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1500; is appended, which all the older translators have taken to be a proper name. According to the Masoretic pointing &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;, the word is, no doubt, to be regarded as a participle Pual of &#1488;&#1494;&#1500;, in the sense of spun, from &#1488;&#1494;&#1500;, to spin. But apart from the fact that it would be a surprising thing to find spun goods mentioned in connection with the trade of the Arabian tribes, the explanation itself could not be sustained from the usage of the language; for there is nothing in the dialects to confirm the idea that  &#1488;&#1494;&#1500; is a softened form of &#1506;&#1494;&#1500;, inasmuch as they have all &#1506;&#1494;&#1500; (Aram.) and gzl (Arab.), and the Talmudic &#1488;&#1494;&#1500;, texere, occurs first of all in the Gemara, and may possibly have been derived in the first instance from the Rabbinical rendering of our &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1494;&#1500; by "spun." Even the fact that the word is written with Shurek is against this explanation rather than in its favour; and in all probability its origin is to be traced to the simple circumstance, that in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-14.htm">Ezekiel 27:14</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a> the articles of commerce are always mentioned before &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, and in this verse they would appear to be omitted altogether, unless they are covered by the word &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1494;&#1500;. But we can very properly take the following words &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; as the object of the first hemistich, since the Masoretic accentuation is founded upon the idea that &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1494;&#1500; is to be taken as the object here. We therefore regard &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1500; as the only admissible pointing, and take &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1500; as a proper name, as in <a href="/genesis/10-27.htm">Genesis 10:27</a> : "from Uzal," the ancient name of Sanaa, the subsequent capital of Yemen. The productions mentioned bear this out. Forged or wrought iron, by which Tuch (l.c. p. 260) supposes that sword-blades from Yemen are chiefly intended, which were celebrated among the Arabs as much as the Indian. Cassia and calamus (see the comm. on <a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a> and <a href="/exodus/30-24.htm">Exodus 30:24</a>), two Indian productions, as Yemen traded with India from the very earliest times. - Dedan (<a href="/ezekiel/27-20.htm">Ezekiel 27:20</a>) is the inland people of that name, living in the neighbourhood of Edom (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/25-13.htm">Ezekiel 25:13</a>; see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15</a>). They furnished &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;, tapetes straguli, cloths for spreading out, most likely costly riding-cloths, like the middim of <a href="/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>. &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; and &#1511;&#1491;&#1512; represent the nomad tribes of central Arabia, the Bedouins. For &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; is never used in the Old Testament for the whole of Arabia; but, according to its derivation from &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, a steppe or desert, simply for the tribes living as nomads in the desert (as in <a href="/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-2.htm">Jeremiah 3:2</a>; cf. Ewald, Grammat. Arab. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/5.htm">1 Peter 5</a>). Kedar, descended from Ishmael, an Arabian nomad tribe, living in the desert between Arabia Petraea and Babylonia, the Cedrei of Pliny (see the comm. on <a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>). They supplied lambs, rams, and he-goats, from the abundance of their flocks, in return for the goods obtained from Tyre.<p><a href="/judges/5-22.htm">Judges 5:22</a>. Next to these the merchants of Sheba and Ragmah (&#1512;&#1506;&#1502;&#1492;) are mentioned. They were Arabs of Cushite descent (<a href="/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>) in south-eastern Arabia (Oman); for   ,&#1512;&#1506;&#1502;&#1492;&#788;&#x3a1;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, was in the modern province of Oman in the bay of the same name in the Persian Gulf. Their goods were all kinds of spices, precious stones, and gold, in which southern Arabia abounded. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, the chief or best of all perfumes (on this use of &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, see the comm. on <a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>; Sol 4:14), is most likely the genuine balsam, which grew in Yemen (Arabia felix), according to Diod. Sic. iii. 45, along with other costly spices, and grows there still; for Forskal found a shrub between Mecca and Medina, called Abu sham, which he believed to be the true balsam, and of which he has given a botanical account in his Flora Aeg. pp. 79, 80 (as Amyris opobalsamum), as well as of two other kinds. Precious stones, viz., onyx-stones, rubies, agates, and cornelians, are still found in the mountains of Hadramaut; and in Yemen also jaspers, crystals, and many good rubies (vid., Niebuhr, Descript. p. 125, and Seetzen in Zach's Monatl. Corresp. xix. p. 339). And, lastly, the wealth of Yemen in gold is too strongly attested by ancient writers to be called in question (cf. Bochart, Phal. II 28), although this precious metal is no found there now.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-23.htm">Ezekiel 27:23</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/27-24.htm">Ezekiel 27:24</a> the trade with Mesopotamia is mentioned. &#1495;&#1512;&#1503;, the Carrhae of the Romans in north-western Mesopotamia (see the comm. on <a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>), was situated at the crossing of the caravan-roads which intersect Mesopotamia; for it was at this point that the two caravan routes from Babylonia and the Delta of the Persian Gulf joined the old military and commercial road to Canaan (Movers, p. 247). The eastern route ran along the Tigris, where Calneh, the later Ktesiphon, and the most important commercial city. It is here called &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (Canneh), contracted from &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1504;&#1492; (see the comm. on <a href="/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>; <a href="/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>). The western route ran along the Euphrates, past the cities mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/27-23.htm">Ezekiel 27:23</a>. &#1506;&#1491;&#1503; is not the Syrian, but the Mesopotamian Eden (<a href="/2_kings/19-12.htm">2 Kings 19:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-12.htm">Isaiah 37:12</a>), the situation of which has not yet been determined, though Movers (p. 257) has sought for it in the Delta of the Euphrates and Tigris. The singular circumstance that the merchants of Sheba should be mentioned in connection with localities in Mesopotamia, which has given rise both to arbitrary alterations of the text and to various forced explanations, has been explained by Movers (p. 247 compared with p. 139) from a notice of Juba in Pliny's Hist. nat. xii. 17 (40), namely, that the Sabaeans, the inhabitants of the spice country, came with their goods from the Persian Gulf to Carrhae, where they held their yearly markets, and from which they were accustomed to proceed to Gabba (Gabala in Phoenicia) and Palestinian Syria. Consequently the merchants of Sabaea are mentioned as those who carried on the trade between Mesopotamia and Tyre, and are not unsuitably placed in the centre of those localities which formed the most important seats of trade on the two great commercial roads of Mesopotamia.<p>Asshur and Chilmad, as we have already observed, were on the western road which ran along the Euphrates. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1491; has already been discovered by Bochart (Phal. I 18) in the Charmande of Xenophon (Anab. i. 5. 10), and Sophaenetus (see Steph. Byz. s.v. &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;), a large and wealthy city in a desert region "beyond the river Euphrates." The Asshur mentioned along with Chilmad, in the midst of purely commercial cities, cannot be the land of Assyria, but must be the emporium Sura (Movers, p. 252), the present Essurieh, which stands upon the bank on this side of the Euphrates above Thapsacus and on the caravan route, which runs from Palmyra past Rusapha (Rezeph, <a href="/isaiah/37-12.htm">Isaiah 37:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-12.htm">2 Kings 19:12</a>) to Nicephorium or Rakka, then in a northerly direction to Haran, and bending southwards, runs along the bank of the river in the direction of Chilmad or Charmande (Ritter, Erdk. XI pp. 1081ff.). The articles of commerce from these emporia, which were brought to Tyre by Sabaean caravans, consisted of &#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, literally, articles of perfect beauty, either state-dresses (cf. &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1500;, <a href="/ezekiel/23-12.htm">Ezekiel 23:12</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>), or more generally, costly works of art (Hvernick). The omission of the copula &#1493; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497; is decisive is favour of the former, as we may infer from this that '&#1489;&#1490;&#1500; is intended as an explanatory apposition to &#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497; &#1514;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514; &#1493;&#1512;&#1511;&#1502;&#1492;, cloaks (&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; connected with &#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;) of hyacinth-purple and embroidery, for which Babylonia was celebrated (for proofs of this, see Movers, pp. 258ff.). The words which follow cannot be explained with certainty. All that is evident is, that '&#1493;&#1488;&#1512; '&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1495;&#1489; is appended to &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1504;&#1494;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; without a copula, as '&#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is to &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; in the first hemistich, and therefore, like the latter, is intended as an explanatory apposition. &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean either cloths or threads, but lines or cords. &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; signifies literally bound or would up; probably twisted, i.e., formed of several threads wound together or spun; and &#1488;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501;, firm, compact, from Arab. arz, to be drawn together. Consequently '&#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1494;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; can hardly have any other meaning than treasures of spun yarns, i.e., the most valuable yarns formed of different threads. For "treasures" is the only meaning which can be assigned to &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; with any certainty on philological grounds, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, Arab. brm, contorsit , is either yarn spun from several or various threads, or cloth woven from such threads. But the latter would not harmonize with &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. Movers (II 3, pp. 263ff.) adopts a similar conclusion, and adduces evidence that silk yarn, bombyx, and cotton came to Tyre through the Mesopotamian trade, and were there dyed in the splendid Tyrian purples, and woven into cloths, or brought for sale with the dyeing complete. All the other explanations which have been given of these difficult words are arbitrary and untenable; not only the Rabbinical rendering of &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1494;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, viz., chests of damask, but that of Ewald, "pockets of damask," and that proposed by Hartmann, Hvernick, and others, viz., girdles of various colours, &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;. In <a href="/ezekiel/27-25.htm">Ezekiel 27:25</a> the description is rounded off with a notice of the lever of this world-wide trade. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; cannot mean "walls" in this instance, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>, and like &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-11.htm">Job 24:11</a>, because the ships, through which Tyre became so rich, could not be called walls. The word signifies "caravans," after &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&</body></html>
