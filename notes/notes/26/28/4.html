Pride is peculiarly the sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, except that which the Lord gives, lead to happiness in this world or in that which is to come. The haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able to protect his people by his own power, and considered himself as equal to the inhabitants of heaven. If it were possible to dwell in the garden of Eden, or even to enter heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyed without a humble, holy, and spiritual mind. Especially all spiritual pride is of the devil. Those who indulge therein must expect to perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou art wiser than Daniel - The passage is one of strong irony.
