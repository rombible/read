<a href="/exodus/40-9.htm" title="And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shall hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.">Exodus 40:9</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Upon the holy mountain of God.—</span>The prophet still has his mind upon Mount Zion (comp. <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm" title="They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.">Isaiah 11:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm" title="Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.">Isaiah 56:7</a>), but yet the words are ironically spoken of Tyre as a venerated sanctuary, rising up from the sea.<p><span class= "bld">Stones of fire.</span>—An obvious explanation of this expression, given by many writers, is that it refers to the brilliant sparkling jewels on the robes in which the king walked. But if this were the case, the expression would be a strange one, and the connection implies a deeper and a religious meaning. It is better, therefore, to understand the imagery as similar to that in <a href="/revelation/2-1.htm" title="To the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things said he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the middle of the seven golden candlesticks;">Revelation 2:1</a>, and to suppose the prophet to have had in mind such a passage as <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>, where a paved work of sapphire stone appears as beneath the feet of God, while His glory is “like a devouring fire.” This would then be one of the ways in which the king of Tyre is ironically represented as assuming to himself God-like attributes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ezekiel/28-14.htm" title="You are the anointed cherub that covers; and I have set you so: you were on the holy mountain of God; you have walked up and down in the middle of the stones of fire....">Ezekiel 28:14-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth — </span>The prophet here alludes to the cherubim in the temple of Solomon, which were a part of the ark, being made of beaten gold, and therefore were with it anointed, and were very large, and covered the mercy-seat with their wings. The prince of Tyrus is here compared to one of these, on account of the high power which he bore among men, and his covering or protecting his people by that power. St. Jerome translates the expression, <span class="ital">The extended cherub that covereth: </span>that is, whose wings are <span class="ital">stretched out </span>to cover, &c., reading <span class="greekheb">ממשׁן</span>, <span class="ital">extended, </span>instead of <span class="greekheb">ממשׁח</span>, <span class="ital">anointed. And I have set thee so </span>— It was I myself that determined that thou shouldest be so great a king, and have a vast power to defend and protect thy people. But this prince, like too many of mankind, was insensible of the hand which raised him, and did not consider to whom he owed his power and glory. <span class="ital">Thou wast upon the holy mountain of God — </span>The image of the cherub is pursued. “Such was thy eminent distinction, that thou wast, as it were, placed in the temple of God on his holy mountain.” Or, thou wast placed in as secure a situation as if thou hadst been fixed on the holy mountain where the temple of God stands. <span class="ital">Thou hast walked, &c., in the midst of the stones of fire — </span>Thou hast, as it were, been placed among the twelve precious stones on the breast-plate of the high-priest. Or this obscure sentence may signify that this prince’s palace and his attendants were very richly adorned with precious stones, which shone with a burning brightness, like fire. Lowth thinks “the words allude to the high advancement of Satan in heaven before his fall, where he was placed in one of the highest orders of angels, such as were nearest in attending upon the Divine Majesty.” <span class="ital">Thou wast perfect in thy ways, till iniquity was found in thee </span>— “An exact description of the evangelical purity in which the devil was created, and in which he continued till, being lifted up with pride, he fell from his first estate.” “Whoever compares this place in Ezekiel with the parallel place in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm" title="How are you fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how are you cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!">Isaiah 14:12</a>, &c., where the downfall of the king of Babylon is foretold in the same prophetic language, will soon perceive that they throw a reciprocal light upon each other, and that the fall of angels is alluded to in both. The beauty and propriety of these allusions of the prophets will appear with greater lustre when it is considered that the host of heaven were the objects of the heathen idolatry; both the visible and invisible host, as well the angels as the lights of heaven; for the superstition seems to have been originally the same, as the worship of the heavenly bodies terminated in the worship of those angels, or intelligences, who were believed to animate and conduct them: and hence we see a reason why the angels were called <span class="ital">stars, </span>and <span class="ital">morning-stars, </span>in Scripture: as in <a href="/job/38-7.htm" title="When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?">Job 38:7</a>, and so here, the <span class="ital">covering cherub </span>is the same with <span class="ital">Lucifer, the son of the morning, </span>in Isaiah. Thus, while the prophets describe the overthrow of an idolatrous prince or state by a fallen angel, or a falling star, they only make their gods to tumble with them: see <span class="ital">Dissertation on Job, </span>p. 374.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-19 Ethbaal, or Ithobal, was the prince or king of Tyre; and being lifted up with excessive pride, he claimed Divine honours. Pride is peculiarly the sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, except that which the Lord gives, lead to happiness in this world or in that which is to come. The haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able to protect his people by his own power, and considered himself as equal to the inhabitants of heaven. If it were possible to dwell in the garden of Eden, or even to enter heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyed without a humble, holy, and spiritual mind. Especially all spiritual pride is of the devil.

"The cherub consecrated to the Lord by the anointing oil" [Fairbairn].<p>covereth&#8212;The imagery employed by Ezekiel as a priest is from the Jewish temple, wherein the cherubim overshadowed the mercy seat, as the king of Tyre, a demi-god in his own esteem, extended his protection over the interests of Tyre. The cherub&#8212;an ideal compound of the highest kinds of animal existence and the type of redeemed man in his ultimate state of perfection&#8212;is made the image of the king of Tyre, as if the beau ideal of humanity. The pretensions of Antichrist are the ulterior reference, of whom the king of Tyre is a type.

In allusion to the cherubim over the mercy seat, which covered it with their wings; and which, as the ark of the testimony and all the vessels of the tabernacle were anointed, were so likewise; in all probability the king of Tyre is called a "cherub" because of his wisdom and power; "anointed", because of his royal dignity; and "that covereth", because of his office, which was to protect his people; all which he either was, or ought to be, or was in his own opinion so: antichrist makes great boasts of his wisdom, power, and authority, as a teacher, pastor, or bishop, the cherubim being symbolical of the ministers of the word; and of his being anointed by men, that he may be the cover and shield of the church; and of his being the Lord's anointed, and the vicar of Christ, and head and protector of the church, as he calls himself (s). The Targum understands all this of regal power, and renders it, <p>"thou art a king anointed for a kingdom:'' <p>and I have set thee so; from whom all kings have their sceptres, crowns, and kingdoms; and by whom they reign; and who can put them down as well as set them up at his pleasure. It may be rendered, "I have given thee" (t); or suffered thee to be so, as the word "give" is often used; it is by divine permission that antichrist has taken such power to himself, and in judgment to them over whom he rules, who are given up to believe a lie; yea, God "put", or, as it is in the original text, "gave" it into the hearts of the kings to agree and give their kingdom to the beast, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/17-17.htm">Revelation 17:17</a>, <p>thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; not on Sinai, nor on Zion; on neither of which was the king of Tyre; nor was this literally true of him; for to say, as Kimchi does to illustrate it, that Hiram king of Tyre assisted Solomon with materials to build the temple, is very foreign; but this is true of the antitype of the king of Tyre, antichrist; who has set his foot on God's holy mountain the church; here he first appeared and stood, as before observed on the preceding verse: <p>thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire; which some understand of the precious stones with which the king of Tyre was adorned, which glittered like fire; though rather they design the people of God, those living lively stones of which the spiritual house is built; who, for their clear light, and burning zeal and love, may be said to be as stones of fire; and among these the bishop of Rome, or the antichristian king of Tyre, first walked: so Kimchi interprets them of the Israelites, who were a holy people; and Jarchi of the kings of Israel, who were as the ministering angels; the seraphim perhaps he means, so called from their burning and flaming love.

No meaning can be attached to anointed cherub, probably: cherub <span class="bld">with spreading wings.</span> The other phrase “that covereth” is used to describe the cherubim over the mercy-seat whose wings covered it and (at least in the temple of Solomon) extended from wall to wall of the most holy place (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm" title="And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.">Exodus 25:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/37-9.htm" title="And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seat were the faces of the cherubim.">Exodus 37:9</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-18.htm" title="And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.">1 Chronicles 28:18</a>).

The mountain here is the same as the garden of <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/28-13.htm" title="You have been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of your tabrets and of your pipes was prepared in you in the day that you were created.">Ezekiel 28:13</a></span>, cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/28-16.htm" title="By the multitude of your merchandise they have filled the middle of you with violence, and you have sinned: therefore I will cast you as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy you, O covering cherub, from the middle of the stones of fire.">Ezekiel 28:16</a></span>. It is the abode of God, where the cherub was and where the prince was placed on the day when he was created. The allusion to the mount of assembly in <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm" title="For you have said in your heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also on the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:">Isaiah 14:13</a> is obscure. The combinations of Del. (<span class="ital">Parad</span>.) and Jeremias (<span class="ital">Bab. Assyr.

Neither is there the slightest foundation for the supposition that the prophet compares the prince of Tyre to a Gryph guarding treasure upon the mountain of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hast walked up and down</span>] <span class="bld">didst walk</span> in the midst of (the) stones of fire.

The word for "anointed" is not found elsewhere, but is cognate in form with that which is commonly so rendered. The Vulgate, however, tracing it to another root, gives <span class="accented">extentus et protegens</span>, and is followed by Luther, Gesenius, Ewald, and others. Keil and Hengstenberg accept "anointed." The sequence of thought seems to be as follows: The splendor-of the King of Tyre had suggested the idea of Eden the garden of God. This, in its turn, led on to that of the cherub that was the warder of that garden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>). The Paradise of God is pictured as still existing, and the cherub - we remember how prominent the word and the thing had been in Ezekiel's thoughts (<a href="/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1-16</a>) - is there (according as we take the above words) either as its anointed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "consecrated," ruler, or as extending the protection of its overshadowing wings far and wide as the cherubim of the tabernacle extended their wings over the ark (comp. <a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-7.htm">1 Kings 8:7</a>). Those cherubim, we may remember, were actually anointed (<a href="/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a>). The King of Tyro boasted that he was, like them, consecrated to his office as king "by the grace of God." In that earthly Paradise the prophet saw the "holy mountain of God," the Olympus, so to speak, of the Hebrews, the throne of the Eternal (compare the Meru of India, the Albard of Iran, the Asgard of German poetry). Isaiah's words as to the King of Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13, 14</a>) present a suggestive parallel. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the stones of fire.</span> The words receive their interpretation partly from <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>; partly from <a href="/2_samuel/22-9.htm">2 Samuel 22:9, 15</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8, 12</a>; <a href="/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a>. The cherub's sword of fire is identified with the lightning-flash, and that in its turn with the thunderbolts of God. Out of the throne of God went thunders and lightnings (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). The "Flammantia maenia mundi" of Lucretius (1. 73) offers a suggestive parallel. The King of Tyre, like the King of Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13, 14</a>), is painted as exulting in that attribute of the Divine glory. </body></html>
