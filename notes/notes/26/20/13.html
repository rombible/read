The history of Israel in the wilderness is referred to in the new Testament as well as in the Old, for warning. God did great things for them. He gave them the law, and revived the ancient keeping of the sabbath day. Sabbaths are privileges; they are signs of our being his people. If we do the duty of the day, we shall find, to our comfort, it is the Lord that makes us holy, that is, truly happy, here; and prepares us to be happy, that is, perfectly holy, hereafter. The Israelites rebelled, and were left to the judgments they brought upon themselves.

Of direct violation of the sabbath we have but two recorded instances (<a href="/exodus/16-27.htm">Exodus 16:27</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32</a>); but the prophet looked below the surface, and would count a mere formal observance, that did not sanctify the sabbath, as a pollution of the holy day. (For parallel teaching in the prophets, see <a href="/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2-4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-27</a>; and later on in the history, probably as the result of their teaching, <a href="/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31-33</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15-22</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Then I said</span>.

Thy mother was like a vine, planted by the water in thy repose; it became a fruitful and rich in tendrils from many waters. <a href="/ezekiel/19-11.htm">Ezekiel 19:11</a>. And it had strong shoots for rulers' sceptres; and its growth ascended among the clouds, and was visible in its height in the multitude of its branches. <a href="/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a>. Then it was torn up in fury, cast to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit; its strong shoots were broken off, and withered; fire devoured them. <a href="/ezekiel/19-13.htm">Ezekiel 19:13</a>. And now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land. <a href="/ezekiel/19-14.htm">Ezekiel 19:14</a>. There goeth out fire from the shoot of its branches, devoureth its fruit, so that there is no more a strong shoot upon it, a sceptre for ruling. - A lamentation it is, and it will be for lamentation. - From the lamentable fate of the princes transported to Egypt and Babylon, the ode passes to a description of the fate, which the lion-like rapacity of the princes is preparing for the kingdom and people. Israel resembled a vine planted by the water. The difficult word &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1498; we agree with Hvernick and Kliefoth in tracing to the verb &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, to rest (<a href="/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>), and regard it as synonymous with &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497; in <a href="/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a> : "in thy repose," i.e., in the time of peaceful, undisturbed prosperity. For neither of the other renderings, "in thy blood" and "in thy likeness," yields a suitable meaning. The latter explanation, which originated with Raschi and Kimchi, is precluded by the fact that Ezekiel always uses the word &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; to express the idea of resemblance. - For the figure of the vine, compare <a href="/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>. This vine sent out strong shoots for rulers' sceptres; that is to say, it brought forth powerful kings, and grew up to a great height, even into the clouds. &#1506;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; signifies "cloud," lit., thicket of clouds, not only here, but in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-10.htm">Ezekiel 31:10</a>,<a href="/ezekiel/31-14.htm">Ezekiel 31:14</a>. The rendering "branches" or "thicket of foliage" is not suitable in any of these passages. The form of the word is not to be taken as that of a new plural of &#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, the plural of &#1506;&#1489;, which occurs in <a href="/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a> and <a href="/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>; but is the plural of &#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, an interlacing or thicket of foliage, and is simply transferred to the interlacing or piling up of the clouds. The clause '&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, and it appeared, was seen, or became visible, simply serves to depict still further the glorious and vigorous growth, and needs no such alteration as Hitzig proposes. This picture is followed in <a href="/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a>., without any particle of transition, by a description of the destruction of this vine. It was torn up in fury by the wrath of God, cast down to the ground, so that its fruit withered (compare the similar figures in <a href="/ezekiel/17-10.htm">Ezekiel 17:10</a>). &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; is used collectively, as equivalent to &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494; (<a href="/ezekiel/19-11.htm">Ezekiel 19:11</a>); and the suffix in &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is written in the singular on account of this collective use of &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;. The uprooting ends in the transplanting of the vine into a waste, dry, unwatered land, - in other words, in the transplanting of the people, Israel, into exile. The dry land is Babylon, so described as being a barren soil in which the kingdom of God could not flourish. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-14.htm">Ezekiel 19:14</a>, this catastrophe is occasioned by the princes. The fire, which devours the fruit of the vine so that it cannot send out any more branches, emanates &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;, from the shoot of its branches, i.e., from its branches, which are so prolific in shoots. &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; is the shoot which grew into rulers' sceptres, i.e., the royal family of the nation. The reference is to Zedekiah, whose treacherous breach of covenant (<a href="/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>) led to the overthrow of the kingdom and of the earthly monarchy. The picture from <a href="/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a> onwards is prophetic. The tearing up of the vine, and its transplantation into a dry land, had already commenced with the carrying away of Jeconiah; but it was not completed till the destruction of Jerusalem and the carrying away of Zedekiah, which were still in the future at the time when these words were uttered. - The clause '&#1511;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;  does not contain a concluding historical notice, as H&#1492;vernick supposes, but simply the finale of the lamentation, indicating the credibility of the prediction which it contains. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497; is prophetic, like the perfects from &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a> onwards; and the meaning is this: A lamentation forms the substance of the whole chapter; and it will lead to lamentation, when it is fulfilled. </body></html>
