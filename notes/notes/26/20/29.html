Another instance of the perversion of God's laws. When the Israelites first entered Canaan they were to set up the "tabernacle" on a "high place," and upon this and upon no other they were to worship Yahweh (<a href="/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a> ff; <a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>). But the Israelites followed the custom of the country, and set up idol-worship on every high hill, and the word "high place" ("Bannah," plural "Bamoth") became a by-word (compare "Bamoth-Baal," <a href="/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>). "Bamoth" occurs on the Moabitic stone, which records the erection of high places in honor of Chemosh. The name "Bamah" was thus a brand of the divine displeasure, and a memorial of the people's guilt.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

The very name implies the place is not that sanctioned by Me, and therefore your sacrifices even to ME there (much more those you offer to idols) are only a "provocation" to Me (Eze 20:28; De 12:1-5). David and others, it is true, sacrificed to God on high places, but it was under exceptional circumstances, and before the altar was set up on Mount Moriah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then; </span> when they were intent upon this horrid course of sin, God pleaded by his messengers, and prophets, and law, and some faithful priests, What mean you, that ye go to the high place? should you not go to the altar of God, and bring your sacrifices to the temple?

The Septuagint also leaves the word untranslated, and calls it Abama; and the Arabic version Abbana; so they called their altars after the Gentiles, by whom they are called  nor were they ashamed of it, but persisted in so calling them, from the first use of them to the present time.

The word <span class="ital">bamah</span>, “high-place,” has no certain etymology, though often used and at an early period, e.g. in David’s elegy on Saul (<a href="/2_samuel/1-19.htm" title="The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places: how are the mighty fallen!">2 Samuel 1:19</a>), and in Moabite (Mesha’s inscrip.). The prophet here introduces a punning and contemptuous derivation of the word. Jehovah asks “what (<span class="ital">mah</span>) is the high place whereunto ye go (<span class="ital">ba</span>),” and the prophet seems to consider the word composed of these two syllables. Some have supposed that “go” has the sense of “go in,” and that the allusion is to the immoralities practised on the high places (<a href="/amos/2-7.htm" title="That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in to the same maid, to profane my holy name:">Amos 2:7</a>; <a href="/context/hosea/4-13.htm" title="They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit prostitution, and your spouses shall commit adultery....">Hosea 4:13-14</a>). This idea does not seem expressed in the words; neither is there much probability in the conjecture that the words are borrowed by Ezek. from some older prophet (Ew.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The prophet’s view of the generation of the exodus differs from that of earlier prophets, e.g. <a href="/hosea/9-10.htm" title="I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves to that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.">Hosea 9:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm" title="Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said the LORD; I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals, when you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.">Jeremiah 2:2</a>. The generation in the wilderness was probably not a homogeneous one, and the narratives which we possess represent its conduct as various at different times. Two views might be taken of it, and Ezek. as his manner is takes the severer view.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is</span> <span class="cmt_word">the high place</span>, etc.? <span class="cmt_word">Bamah,</span> in the plural <span class="accented">Bamoth</span>, was the Hebrew for "high place." At first it was applied to the hill on which some local sanctuary stood (<a href="/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>), but was gradually extended, after the building of the temple as the one appointed sanctuary, to other places which were looked upon as sacred, and which became the scenes of an idolatrous and forbidden worship. Ezekiel emphasizes his scorn by a conjectural derivation of the word, as if derived from the two words <span class="accented">ba</span> ("go") and <span class="accented">mah</span> ("whither"); <span class="accented">or</span>, perhaps, <span class="accented">What comes?</span> (comp. <a href="/exodus/16-15.htm">Exodus 16:15</a> for a parallel derivation of the word <span class="accented">marones</span>). Taking the words in their ordinary sense, they seem to express only a slight degree of contempt. "What, then, is the place to which you go?" - what is the "whither" to which it leads? But I incline (with Ewald and Smend) to see in the word "go into" the meaning which it has in <a href="/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a> and Genesis 19:31, and elsewhere, as a euphemism for sexual union. So later the word "Bamah" becomes a witness that those who worship in the high place go there (as in ver. 30) to commit whoredom literally and spiritually. Its name showed that it was what I have called "a chapel of prostitution" (ch. 16:24, 25). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Behaviour of Israel in the Desert<p><a href="/ezekiel/20-10.htm">Ezekiel 20:10</a>.

But my eye looked with pity upon them, so that I did not destroy them, and make an end of them in the desert. - God gave laws at Sinai to the people whom He had brought out of Egypt, through which they were to be sanctified as His own people, that they might live before God. On <a href="/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11</a> compare <a href="/deuteronomy/30-16.htm">Deuteronomy 30:16</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>. <a href="/ezekiel/20-12.htm">Ezekiel 20:12</a> is taken almost word for word from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>, where God concludes the directions for His worship by urging upon the people in the most solemn manner the observance of His Sabbaths, and thereby pronounces the keeping of the Sabbath the kernel of all divine worship. And as in that passage we are to understand by the Sabbaths the actual weekly Sabbaths, and not the institutions of worship as a whole, so here we must retain the literal signification of the word. It is only of the Sabbath recurring every week, and not of all the fasts, that it could be said it was a sign between Jehovah and Israel. It was a sign, not as a token, that they who observed it were Israelites, as Hitzig supposes, but to know (that they might know) that Jehovah was sanctifying them, namely, by the Sabbath rest - as a refreshing and elevation of the mind, in which Israel was to have a foretaste of that blessed resting from all works to which the people of God was ultimately to attain (see the comm. on <a href="/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>). It is from this deeper signification of the Sabbath that the prominence given to the Sabbaths here is to be explained, and not from the outward circumstance that in exile, when the sacrificial worship was necessarily suspended, the keeping of the Sabbath as the only bond which united the Israelites, so far as the worship of God was concerned (Hitzig). Historical examples of the rebellion of Israel against the commandments of God in the desert are given in ex. E<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/32-1.htm">Zechariah 32:1-6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>; and of the desecration of the Sabbath, in ex.

For the threat referred to in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13</a>, compare <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11-12</a>. - <a href="/ezekiel/20-15.htm">Ezekiel 20:15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/20-16.htm">Ezekiel 20:16</a> are not a repetition of <a href="/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13</a> (Hitzig); nor do they introduce a limitation of <a href="/ezekiel/20-14.htm">Ezekiel 20:14</a> (Kliefoth). They simply relate what else God did to put bounds to the rebellion after He had revoked the decree to cut Israel off, at the intercession of Moses (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11-19</a>). He lifted His hand to the oath (<a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>.), that the generation which had come out of Egypt should not come into the land of Canaan, but should die in the wilderness. Therewith He looked with pity upon the people, so that He did not make an end of them by following up the threat with a promise that the children should enter the land. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/11-13.htm">Ezekiel 11:13</a>. </body></html>
