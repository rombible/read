The Sabbath, like circumcision, was an institution far older than the period here spoken of, but was now commanded anew, and made the especial pledge of the covenant between God and His people. The verse is a quotation from <a href="/exodus/31-13.htm" title="Speak you also to the children of Israel, saying, Truly my sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am the LORD that does sanctify you.">Exodus 31:13</a>; and every one must have remarked the great stress everywhere laid in the Old Testament upon the observance of the Sabbath, and the prominence given to it among the privileges of the Divine covenant. It is plain that the day is regarded not in its mere outward character, as a day of rest, but as “a sign” of the covenant, and a means of realising it in the study of God’s word, and the communion of the soul with Him. It is in these latter aspects also that the weekly day of rest still retains its inestimable value—that men “might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/20-12.htm" title="Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.">Ezekiel 20:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Moreover, I gave them my sabbaths — </span>Including the weekly sabbaths, the sabbatical years, and all the solemn days of divine worship, in which no servile work was to be done: <span class="ital">to be a sign between me and them</span> — A sign of their being peculiarly my people, and to distinguish them from all other people, as the worshippers of me, Jehovah, who <span class="ital">in six days made heaven and earth, and all things therein, and rested the seventh day; </span>and also of my delivering them out of their state of bondage in Egypt. <span class="ital">That they might know that I am the Lord that sanctifies them — </span>That by their resting on those days from their usual employments, and their coming together to wait upon me in the ordinances of my worship, they might become more acquainted with me, and with my will concerning them, and might receive a larger measure of my sanctifying grace. Observe, reader, 1st, Sabbaths are privileges, and are to be considered and improved as such. 2d, They are signs: it is a sign men have a sense of religion, and that there is some correspondence between them and God, while they make conscience of keeping holy the sabbath day. 3d, Sabbaths, if duly sanctified, are the means of our sanctification: if we do the duty of the day, we shall find to our comfort; <span class="ital">it is the Lord that sanctifies us; </span>makes us <span class="ital">holy, </span>that is, truly <span class="ital">happy, </span>here; and prepares us to be <span class="ital">happy, </span>that is, perfectly <span class="ital">holy, </span>hereafter.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:10-26. The history of Israel in the wilderness is referred to in the new Testament as well as in the Old, for warning. God did great things for them. He gave them the law, and revived the ancient keeping of the sabbath day. Sabbaths are privileges; they are signs of our being his people. If we do the duty of the day, we shall find, to our comfort, it is the Lord that makes us holy, that is, truly happy, here; and prepares us to be happy, that is, perfectly holy, hereafter. The Israelites rebelled, and were left to the judgments they brought upon themselves. God sometimes makes sin to be its own punishment, yet he is not the Author of sin: there needs no more to make men miserable, than to give them up to their own evil desires and passions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>. The Sabbath was a sign of a special people, commemorative of the work of creation, and hallowed to the honor of Yahweh, the covenant-God. As man honored God by keeping the Sabbath holy, so by the Sabbath, God "sanctified" Israel and marked them as a holy people. Therefore to profane the Sabbath was to abjure their Divine Governor.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. sabbaths, &#8230; a sign between me and them&#8212;a kind of sacramental pledge of the covenant of adoption between God and His people. The Sabbath is specified as a sample of the whole law, to show that the law is not merely precepts, but privileges, of which the Sabbath is one of the highest. Not that the Sabbath was first instituted at Sinai, as if it were an exclusively Jewish ordinance (Ge 2:2, 3), but it was then more formally enacted, when, owing to the apostasy of the world from the original revelation, one people was called out (De 5:15) to be the covenant-people of God.<p>sanctify them&#8212;The observance of the Sabbath contemplated by God was not a mere outward rest, but a spiritual dedication of the day to the glory of God and the good of man. Otherwise it would not be, as it is made, the pledge of universal sanctification (Ex 31:13-17; Isa 58:13, 14). Virtually it is said, all sanctity will flourish or decay, according as this ordinance is observed in its full spirituality or not.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I gave; </span> both commanded, and also sanctified, those portions of time to be holy rests. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My sabbaths; </span> either the weekly sabbath, which, recurring every seventh day, soon multiplied into many, and was to be the commemoration of God’s rest from his labour, Israel’s delivery out of Egypt, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm" title="And remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD your God brought you out there through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day.">Deu 5:15</a></span>, and an awakening of their hopes of the eternal rest with God; or it may, as most like it doth, include all the solemn days of God’s worship, every of which was a sabbath, and no work to be done in it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To be a sign</span> of their being peculiarly my people, select from all other, to walk with me, to rest in me, and receive more grace from me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That they might know:</span> this was a teaching sign, they might by other ways know, and by this also. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I am the Lord; </span> in this see my authority, and my holiness, who by such means do promote and attain such holy purposes and ends. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That sanctify them; </span> that have withdrawn them from the profane and common herd of the heathen, and made them by this relatively holy; or else, that have changed the heart, and filled it with holy, pure, and gracious inclinations, and so made them really holy. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover, also, I gave them my sabbaths,....

The people were commanded to “sanctify” the Sabbath, i.e. to dedicate it and keep it to the Lord. This dedication of a part of their time or life to Jehovah had a similar significance to the dedication of the first-fruits of the ground and the firstlings of their cattle; it was an acknowledgment that they were the Lord’s. It was the response on their side to the operation of Jehovah on his side in “sanctifying” them, or making them his own possession (end of <span class="ital">v</span>.) Thus the Sabbath was a “sign” or visible token that he was their God and they his people (<span class="ital"><a href="/ezekiel/20-20.htm" title="And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.">Ezekiel 20:20</a></span>); <a href="/context/exodus/31-13.htm" title="Speak you also to the children of Israel, saying, Truly my sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am the LORD that does sanctify you....">Exodus 31:13-14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-2.htm" title="Blessed is the man that does this, and the son of man that lays hold on it; that keeps the sabbath from polluting it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.">Isaiah 56:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-4.htm" title="For thus said the LORD to the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;">Isaiah 56:4</a>.

Thy mother was like a vine, planted by the water in thy repose; it became a fruitful and rich in tendrils from many waters. <a href="/ezekiel/19-11.htm">Ezekiel 19:11</a>. And it had strong shoots for rulers' sceptres; and its growth ascended among the clouds, and was visible in its height in the multitude of its branches. <a href="/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a>. Then it was torn up in fury, cast to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit; its strong shoots were broken off, and withered; fire devoured them. <a href="/ezekiel/19-13.htm">Ezekiel 19:13</a>. And now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land. <a href="/ezekiel/19-14.htm">Ezekiel 19:14</a>. There goeth out fire from the shoot of its branches, devoureth its fruit, so that there is no more a strong shoot upon it, a sceptre for ruling. - A lamentation it is, and it will be for lamentation. - From the lamentable fate of the princes transported to Egypt and Babylon, the ode passes to a description of the fate, which the lion-like rapacity of the princes is preparing for the kingdom and people. Israel resembled a vine planted by the water. The difficult word &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1498; we agree with Hvernick and Kliefoth in tracing to the verb &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, to rest (<a href="/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>), and regard it as synonymous with &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497; in <a href="/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a> : "in thy repose," i.e., in the time of peaceful, undisturbed prosperity. For neither of the other renderings, "in thy blood" and "in thy likeness," yields a suitable meaning. The latter explanation, which originated with Raschi and Kimchi, is precluded by the fact that Ezekiel always uses the word &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; to express the idea of resemblance. - For the figure of the vine, compare <a href="/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>. This vine sent out strong shoots for rulers' sceptres; that is to say, it brought forth powerful kings, and grew up to a great height, even into the clouds. &#1506;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; signifies "cloud," lit., thicket of clouds, not only here, but in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-10.htm">Ezekiel 31:10</a>,<a href="/ezekiel/31-14.htm">Ezekiel 31:14</a>. The rendering "branches" or "thicket of foliage" is not suitable in any of these passages. The form of the word is not to be taken as that of a new plural of &#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, the plural of &#1506;&#1489;, which occurs in <a href="/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a> and <a href="/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>; but is the plural of &#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, an interlacing or thicket of foliage, and is simply transferred to the interlacing or piling up of the clouds. The clause '&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, and it appeared, was seen, or became visible, simply serves to depict still further the glorious and vigorous growth, and needs no such alteration as Hitzig proposes. This picture is followed in <a href="/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a>., without any particle of transition, by a description of the destruction of this vine. It was torn up in fury by the wrath of God, cast down to the ground, so that its fruit withered (compare the similar figures in <a href="/ezekiel/17-10.htm">Ezekiel 17:10</a>). &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; is used collectively, as equivalent to &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494; (<a href="/ezekiel/19-11.htm">Ezekiel 19:11</a>); and the suffix in &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is written in the singular on account of this collective use of &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;. The uprooting ends in the transplanting of the vine into a waste, dry, unwatered land, - in other words, in the transplanting of the people, Israel, into exile. The dry land is Babylon, so described as being a barren soil in which the kingdom of God could not flourish. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-14.htm">Ezekiel 19:14</a>, this catastrophe is occasioned by the princes. The fire, which devours the fruit of the vine so that it cannot send out any more branches, emanates &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;, from the shoot of its branches, i.e., from its branches, which are so prolific in shoots. &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; is the shoot which grew into rulers' sceptres, i.e., the royal family of the nation. The reference is to Zedekiah, whose treacherous breach of covenant (<a href="/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>) led to the overthrow of the kingdom and of the earthly monarchy. The picture from <a href="/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a> onwards is prophetic. The tearing up of the vine, and its transplantation into a dry land, had already commenced with the carrying away of Jeconiah; but it was not completed till the destruction of Jerusalem and the carrying away of Zedekiah, which were still in the future at the time when these words were uttered. - The clause '&#1511;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;  does not contain a concluding historical notice, as H&#1492;vernick supposes, but simply the finale of the lamentation, indicating the credibility of the prediction which it contains. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497; is prophetic, like the perfects from &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a> onwards; and the meaning is this: A lamentation forms the substance of the whole chapter; and it will lead to lamentation, when it is fulfilled. </body></html>
