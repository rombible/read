So Herodotus (n) relates of the temple of Diana at Bubastis in Egypt, that at the entrance of it there were rivulets from the Nile, which flowed about it here and there, shaded with trees; and within were a vast grove of the largest trees, planted about the temple; and which he afterwards calls trees reaching to heaven: <p>and they offered there their sacrifices; either to the God of Israel, as some of them sometimes did, and which was sinful; for though they might offer sacrifices, as were commanded, to a right object, yet not in the proper place: or rather to their idols; and so the Septuagint and Arabic versions, <p>to their own gods; which they had made to themselves, and had chose and approved of: <p>and there they presented the provocation of their offering; or their offering which provoked the wrath of God against them; being such as either he had not appointed, or was offered in a wrong place, or the wrong object; than which nothing could be more provoking to him; it was giving his glory to another, and his praise to graven images: <p>there also they made their sweet saviour; incense to their deities. The Targum is the worship of their sacrifices: <p>and poured out there their drink offerings; libations of wine: all kind of sacrifices were offered up here by them; which shows to what lengths in idolatry they ran, and how dreadfully guilty they were. <p>(n) Euterpe: sive l. 2. c. 138. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{n}</span> <i>For</i> when I had brought them into the land, <i>for</i> which I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.</span><p>(n) Not only in the wilderness, when I brought them out of Egypt, but since I placed them in this land: which declares how prompt man's heart is to idolatry seeing that by no admonitions can he be drawn back.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. The prophet regards the worship on the high-places and under the evergreen trees as a Canaanitish usage adopted by Israel, as Deuteronomy 12. At the same time Israel usually employed the altars or chapels which they found for the service of Jehovah; but naturally many corruptions would creep into such service, and it might become little different from a service of Baal. In the oldest prophets, Amos and Hosea, it is the <span class="ital">kind</span> of worship at the high-places that is condemned, the revelry and heathenish merrymaking (<a href="/hosea/9-1.htm" title="Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for you have gone a whoring from your God, you have loved a reward on every corn floor.">Hosea 9:1</a>) the sensuousness (<a href="/hosea/8-13.htm" title="They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of my offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepts them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.">Hosea 8:13</a>; <a href="/amos/5-21.htm" title="I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.">Amos 5:21</a>), and the false conception Of deity implied in it (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm" title="For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.">Hosea 6:6</a>). The mere localities or multitude of altars do not seem assailed, except that the more there were of them the more sin was committed, because the whole worship was sinful (<a href="/hosea/8-11.htm" title="Because Ephraim has made many altars to sin, altars shall be to him to sin.">Hosea 8:11</a>; <a href="/amos/4-4.htm" title="Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:">Amos 4:4</a>). Later this impure worship was perceived to be inseparable from the high-places and these themselves came under condemnation. Ezekiel does not go further in his condemnation of the high hills and green trees than his predecessor Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm" title="For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bands; and you said, I will not transgress; when on every high hill and under every green tree you wander, playing the harlot.">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm" title="The LORD said also to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? she is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.">Jeremiah 3:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all the thick trees</span>] Evergreen and umbrageous trees appear to have been regarded as abodes of deity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">offered … their sacrifices</span>] Four words are employed: offerings of flesh, particularly the peace or thank-offerings; what is called their “offering” or oblation, a general word used of bloodless sacrifices as well as of others, possibly first-fruits and the like; their “sweet savour,” usually said of the odour of the flesh or fat burnt upon the altar, but also of the odour of meal-offerings (ch. <a href="/ezekiel/16-19.htm" title="My meat also which I gave you, fine flour, and oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you have even set it before them for a sweet smell: and thus it was, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 16:19</a>); and finally, drink-offerings. The clause “and there … provocation of their offering” is wanting in LXX. The term “offering” (Korban), found only in Lev., Numb., again in <a href="/ezekiel/40-43.htm" title="And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and on the tables was the flesh of the offering.">Ezekiel 40:43</a> (see there).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - It was a special aggravation of the sin that it was committed in the very land into which they had been brought by the oath (the "hand lifted up") of Jehovah, that it might be a holy land, a witness of the Divine righteousness to the nations round about.

But my eye looked with pity upon them, so that I did not destroy them, and make an end of them in the desert. - God gave laws at Sinai to the people whom He had brought out of Egypt, through which they were to be sanctified as His own people, that they might live before God. On <a href="/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11</a> compare <a href="/deuteronomy/30-16.htm">Deuteronomy 30:16</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>. <a href="/ezekiel/20-12.htm">Ezekiel 20:12</a> is taken almost word for word from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>, where God concludes the directions for His worship by urging upon the people in the most solemn manner the observance of His Sabbaths, and thereby pronounces the keeping of the Sabbath the kernel of all divine worship. And as in that passage we are to understand by the Sabbaths the actual weekly Sabbaths, and not the institutions of worship as a whole, so here we must retain the literal signification of the word. It is only of the Sabbath recurring every week, and not of all the fasts, that it could be said it was a sign between Jehovah and Israel. It was a sign, not as a token, that they who observed it were Israelites, as Hitzig supposes, but to know (that they might know) that Jehovah was sanctifying them, namely, by the Sabbath rest - as a refreshing and elevation of the mind, in which Israel was to have a foretaste of that blessed resting from all works to which the people of God was ultimately to attain (see the comm. on <a href="/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>). It is from this deeper signification of the Sabbath that the prominence given to the Sabbaths here is to be explained, and not from the outward circumstance that in exile, when the sacrificial worship was necessarily suspended, the keeping of the Sabbath as the only bond which united the Israelites, so far as the worship of God was concerned (Hitzig). Historical examples of the rebellion of Israel against the commandments of God in the desert are given in ex. E<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/32-1.htm">Zechariah 32:1-6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>; and of the desecration of the Sabbath, in ex. E<a href="/zechariah/16-27.htm">Zechariah 16:27</a> and <a href="/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32</a>. For the threat referred to in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13</a>, compare <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11-12</a>. - <a href="/ezekiel/20-15.htm">Ezekiel 20:15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/20-16.htm">Ezekiel 20:16</a> are not a repetition of <a href="/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13</a> (Hitzig); nor do they introduce a limitation of <a href="/ezekiel/20-14.htm">Ezekiel 20:14</a> (Kliefoth). They simply relate what else God did to put bounds to the rebellion after He had revoked the decree to cut Israel off, at the intercession of Moses (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11-19</a>). He lifted His hand to the oath (<a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>.), that the generation which had come out of Egypt should not come into the land of Canaan, but should die in the wilderness. Therewith He looked with pity upon the people, so that He did not make an end of them by following up the threat with a promise that the children should enter the land. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/11-13.htm">Ezekiel 11:13</a>. </body></html>
