Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And to the strangers - Here is quite a new feature in the distribution of the land. Not only the Israelites by descent, but those who join themselves to Israel by allegiance to the true God, shall have a right of inheritance. Here are opened out the blessings which were to accrue to the Gentiles through the seed of Abraham. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24</a>, following. The difference which existed under the old covenant between Jew and Gentile is now at last done away. But while pagandom thus unites itself with God's people, Israel is still as ever the chosen people, the center of this union. No new Church is founded side by side with the old. Pagandom is absorbed in Israel - the standard which God has set up for the nations - i. e., in the One True Church, which has subsisted from the beginning, and will subsist in eternity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/47.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. to the strangers&#8212;It is altogether unprecedented under the old covenant, that "strangers" should have "inheritance" among the tribes. There would not be room locally within Canaan for more than the tribes. The literal sense must therefore be modified, as expressing that Gentiles are not to be excluded from settling among the covenant-people, and that spiritually their privileges are not to be less than those of Israel (Ro 10:12; Ga 3:28; Eph 3:6; Col 3:11; Re 7:9, 10). Still, "sojourneth," in Eze 47:23, implies that in Canaan, the covenant people are regarded as at home, the strangers as settlers.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It shall come to pass:</span> this directs what they should do, as well as foretells the event that shall be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye shall divide it by lot; </span> so it was divided before, so it must again, for thus all controversies shall be prevented; thus he will choose their inheritance for them, for the disposition of the lot is of the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto you, </span> that are the natural seed of Abraham. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To the strangers that sojourn among you:</span> foreigners never had such privilege before; though they might dwell and trade among the Jews, yet they were excluded all hereditary right, could not purchase nor possess inheritances.

In the last days, under the Gospel dispensation: <p>that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you; who were Israelites, both by natural descent, and by the Spirit and grace of God: the Gospel was first preached to Israel after the flesh, and made effectual to the conversion of many of them; and the first churches were made up of them, and they shared all the blessings and privileges thereof; as they also will in the latter day, when converted: <p>and to the strangers that sojourn among them; not such as were strangers to spiritual and divine things; for this would contradict the rule in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-9.htm">Ezekiel 44:9</a>, but converted Gentiles, so called because of their natural descent and civil state, being, with respect to both, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel; yet were to be, as they have been, and will be, taken into the same Gospel church state with the believing Jews: <p>which shall beget children among you; not only in a natural, but in a spiritual sense; be the means of begetting many souls again to the lively hope of a glorious inheritance: <p>and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; that is, the children begotten by the Gentiles shall be considered all one as those of the children of Israel, being born again of the same Spirit and grace; and so have an equal right to the same privileges, and to which they shall be admitted: <p>they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel; this is a new thing, and what in a literal sense was never granted; for though in the times of Moses and onward, and by his direction from the Lord, such as have been called proselytes of the gate, and proselytes of righteousness, have been admitted to various privileges, by conforming to certain rules, rites, and ceremonies, yet never were allowed to have any inheritance in the land; and, after the captivity, Ezra and Nehemiah drove out the strangers, who by affinity with some had got among them: but this respects Gospel times, and the coalition of Jews and Gentiles in the same church state; where there is no difference, but Christ is all in all; where they are admitted to the same ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper; partake of the same blessings of grace, and promises of the word, and have an equal right to the heavenly inheritance: <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>, is the best commentary on this passage; which contains the same mystery the Apostle Paul was acquainted with, <p>that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the Gospel; See Gill on <a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>.

And he led me to the gate, the gate which looked toward the east: <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>. And behold the glory of the God of Israel came from the east, and its sound was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with His glory. <a href="/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3</a>. And the appearance which I saw, was to look at like the appearance which I saw when I came to destroy the city; and (there were) appearances like the appearance which I had seen by the river Chebar; and I fell down upon my face. <a href="/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>. And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate, the direction of which is toward the east. <a href="/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>. And wind lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house. <a href="/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6</a>. And I heard one speaking to me from the house, and there was a man standing by me. <a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>. And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I shall dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel for ever; and the house of Israel will no more defile my holy name, they and their kings, through their whoredom and through the corpses of their kings, their high places, <a href="/ezekiel/43-8.htm">Ezekiel 43:8</a>. When they set their threshold by my threshold, and their door-posts by my door-posts, and there was only the wall between me and them, and they defiled my holy name by their abominations which they did, so that I destroyed them in my wrath. <a href="/ezekiel/43-9.htm">Ezekiel 43:9</a>. Now will they remove their whoredom and the corpses of their kings from me, and I shall dwell in the midst of them for ever. <a href="/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10</a>. Thou, son of man, show to the house of Israel this house, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities, and may measure the well-measured building. <a href="/ezekiel/43-11.htm">Ezekiel 43:11</a>. And when they are ashamed of all that they have done, show them the picture of the house and its arrangement, and its goings out and in, and all its forms and all its statutes, and all its forms and all its laws; and write it before their eyes, that they may keep all its form and all its statutes and do them. <a href="/ezekiel/43-12.htm">Ezekiel 43:12</a>. This is the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain all its territory round about is most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. - The angel had shown the prophet the new sanctuary as already completed, and had measured it in his presence according to its several parts. But this building only became the house of God when Jehovah as the God of Israel consecrated it, to be the dwelling-place of His divine and gracious presence in the midst of His people, by the entrance of His divine glory into the house.<p>(Note: "The Lord appears, and fills the house with His own glory; showing that the house will not only be built, but will be filled with the power of God" (Theodoret).)<p>The description of the new temple closes, therefore, with this act of consecration. That the prophet might see this act of divine grace with his own eyes, the measuring man led him from the ground surrounding the temple (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-15.htm">Ezekiel 42:15-20</a>) back again to the east gate (<a href="/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1</a>). The allusion is to the eastern gate of the outer court; for it is not till <a href="/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a> that Ezekiel is taken into the inner court, and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>, he was brought back to the east gate of the outer court. Standing in front of this gate, he sees the glory of the God of Israel come by the way from the east with a great noise, and lighting up the earth with its splendour. The coming of the theophany from the east points back to <a href="/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>, where the Shechinah, when leaving the ancient temple, went out at the east gate and ascended to the summit of the mountain, which was situated on the east of Jerusalem. It was from the east, therefore, that it returned to enter the new temple. This fact is sufficient of itself to show that the present entrance of the divine glory into the new temple did not lay the foundation for a new and more exalted bond of grace, but was simply intended to restore the relation which had existed before the removal of Israel into captivity. The tabernacle and Solomon's temple had both been consecrated by Jehovah in the same manner as the seat of His throne of grace in Israel (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>; and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13-14</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1-3</a>, from which the expression &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; in <a href="/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a> has been borrowed). It is true that Hvernick, Kliefoth, and others find, along with this agreement, a difference in the fact that the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud in both the tabernacle and Solomon's temple; whereas here, on the contrary, it appeared in that peculiar form which Ezekiel had already repeatedly seen. But it does not follow that there was really a difference, because the cloud is not mentioned in the verses before us; for it is evident that the cloud was not wanting, even in the manifestation of the glory of God seen by Ezekiel, from the words found in <a href="/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3</a> : "The cloud filled the inner court, and the glory of Jehovah had risen up from the cherubim to the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the splendour of the glory of Jehovah." If, therefore, it is expressly attested in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3</a>, as even Kliefoth admits, that the appearance of God which entered the temple as like the appearance which Ezekiel saw by the Chaboras and before the destruction of the temple, and in connection with the last-mentioned appearance the cloud was visible along with the brilliant splendour of the divine doxa, the cloud will certainly not have been wanting when it entered the new temple; and the only reason why it is not expressly mentioned must be, that it did not present a contrast to the brilliant splendour, or tend to obscure the light of the glory of God, but as a shining cloud was simply the atmospheric clothing of the theophany.<p>If, then, the cloud did not present a contrast to the brilliancy of the divine glory, it cannot be inferred from the words, "and the earth shone with His glory," that there was any difference between this and the earlier manifestations of the divine glory at the consecration of the tabernacle and Solomon's temple; more especially as these words to not affirm that it became light on earth, but simply that the earth shone with the glory God, - that is to say, that it threw a bright light upon the earth as it passed along, - so that this remark simply serves to indicate the intensity of the brightness of this theophany. The words '&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493; &#1499;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;  are not to be understood, as we may learn from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>, as referring to a voice of the coming God, but describe the loud noise made by the moving of the theophany on account of the rustling of the wings of the cherubim. This resembled the roaring of mighty waves. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3</a>, the expression &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; ...&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;  is somewhat heavy in style, but is correct Hebrew; and the remark with which Hitzig seeks to justify his alteration of &#1493;&#1499;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; into &#1493;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, - namely, that &#1499;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; "would signify 'so the appearance,' whereas Ezekiel intends to explain the present appearance from the well-known earlier one," - is false so far as the usage of the language is concerned. When the Hebrew uses two &#1499;&#1468; in cases of comparison, which we are accustomed to express in German by so...wie (so...as), he always commences with the thing to which he compares another, and lets the thing which is to be compared follow afterwards. Thus, for example, in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>, &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;  does not affirm that it happens as to the righteous so to the wicked, but vice vers&#1490;, that it happens to the righteous as to the wicked; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/44-18.htm">Genesis 44:18</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498;  does not mean, for like thee so is Pharaoh, but "for thou art like Pharaoh." According to this genuine Hebrew expression, the present appearance of the divine glory is mentioned first in the verse before us, and then in the earlier one which the present resembled. And even the apparent pleonasm &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; vanishes if we render &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; by "look," - the look of the apparition which I saw was just like the apparition, etc. '&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; refers to the ecstatic transportation of the prophet to Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8.htm">Ezekiel 8-11</a>), to witness the destruction of the city (see more particularly <a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/9-1.htm">Ezekiel 9:1</a>.). "The prophet destroyed the city ideally by his prophecy, of which the fulfilment simply forms the objective reverse side" (Hitzig). &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is appended in loose apposition, - there were appearances, visions, - and the plural is to be taken as in &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>.

There can be no doubt that &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is Jehovah here, as in <a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>; though the commentators are divided in opinion whether Jehovah spoke directly to the prophet, or through the medium of the man who stood by his side. Hvernick presses the Hithpael &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, and imagines that Ezekiel heard God conversing within the sanctuary, in consequence of which the angel stood by his side; so that the words of God consisted chiefly in the command to communicate to Ezekiel the divine revelation which follows in <a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>. But this view is proved to be erroneous by the expression &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; which follows &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, and which Hvernick has overlooked. Kliefoth, on the other hand, is of opinion that the words contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>, which proceeded from the &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, were addressed to the prophet directly by God Himself; for he heard them before anything was said by the man, and neither here nor in what follows is the man said to have spoken. On the contrary, both here and in what follows, even in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>,<a href="/ezekiel/46-24.htm">Ezekiel 46:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6-7</a>, it is always God Himself who appears as the speaker, and the man simply as the prophet's guide. But this is also not correct. Such passages as <a href="/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/46-24.htm">Ezekiel 46:24</a> compared with <a href="/ezekiel/43-19.htm">Ezekiel 43:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-21.htm">Ezekiel 43:21</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8</a>, compared with <a href="/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>, show undeniably that the man who conducted the prophet also talked with him. Consequently, in the case referred to in the verse before us, we must also conclude that he who spoke to the prophet from the temple addressed him through the medium of the man who stood by his side, and that &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is the subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>; from which, however, it by no means follows that the &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; was also an angel, who spoke to the prophet, not from the most holy place, but simply from within the house, as Hitzig explains the matter. The meaning is rather, that Ezekiel heard God conversing with him from the sanctuary, whilst a man, i.e., an angel, stood by his side and spoke to him as follows. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is in that case not some angel merely who spoke in the name of Jehovah, but the angel of Jehovah, God's own speaker, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>.). But according to his outward habitus, this angel of the Lord, who is designated as &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, is identical with the angel who showed the prophet the temple, and measured it (<a href="/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a> onwards). For according to <a href="/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>. this &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; had also a measuring rod, and measured. The absence of the article from &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6</a>, which prevents Kliefoth from admitting this identity, does not indicate decidedly that a different man from the one mentioned before is introduced here as the prophet's attendant, but simply leaves the identity of this &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; with the former indefinite, so that it can only be inferred from the further course of events; because the point of importance here was neither to establish this identity by employing the article, nor to define the medium of the word of God more precisely, but simply to introduce the words which follow as the words of God Himself. The address commences with an explanation on the part of God that the temple into which the glory of the Lord had entered was the place of His throne, where He would dwell for ever among the sons of Israel. The &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; is a concise expression, in which &#1488;&#1514; is nota accus., and we have to supply in thought either &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; or &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;: "behold the place." &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;, the place of the soles of my feet (cf. <a href="/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>), is equivalent to the footstool of my feet in <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>. The ark of the covenant is called the footstool of God in <a href="/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a> and <a href="/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>; compare <a href="/psalms/99-5.htm">Psalm 99:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>, where this epithet may possibly be used to designate the temple. This also applies to the throne of Jehovah, since God was enthroned above the cherubim of the ark in the holy of holies (cf. <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>, etc.). In the sanctuary which Ezekiel saw, no reference is made to the ark of the covenant, and the silence with regard to this is hardly to be regarded as a mere omission to mention it, inasmuch as none of the things contained in the temple are mentioned with the exception of the altars, not even the table of shew-bread or the candlestick. The ark of the covenant is not mentioned, because, as is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Jeremiah 3:16</a>, in the Messianic times the ark of the covenant will not be remembered, neither will it be missed.<p>&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/37-28.htm">Ezekiel 37:28</a>. The promise culminates in this. &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; does not apply either to the tabernacle or to Solomon's temple, in which Jehovah also had His dwelling-place, though not for ever. These sanctuaries He left, and gave them up to destruction, because the Israelites had profaned His holy name by their idolatry. This will not take place any more after the erection of the new sanctuary. &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is not imperative, but a simple future: "they will no more defiled," because they come to a knowledge of their sins through the punitive judgment of exile, so that they become ashamed of them, and because the Lord will have poured out His Spirit upon them (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/37-23.htm">Ezekiel 37:23</a>., <a href="/ezekiel/39-29.htm">Ezekiel 39:29</a>). - Formerly, however (<a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>), they profaned the holy name of God by their spiritual whoredom (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>) and by dead idols, for which they erected high places in the immediate neighbourhood of the dwelling-place of Jehovah, that is to say, even in the temple courts, so that Jehovah was only separated from the idols by a wall. This is the general meaning of <a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-8.htm">Ezekiel 43:8</a>, in which the exposition of &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497;  is difficulty. Rosenm&#1516;ller, H&#1492;vernick, and others understand by the "corpses of their kings," the dead idols. Ewald, Hitzig, and Kliefoth, on the other hand, take the expression in a literal sense, as referring to the corpses of kings which had been buried near to the temple, so that the temple had been defiled by the proximity of these graves. But the latter view is precluded by the fact that not a single instance can be adduced of the burial of a king in the vicinity of the temple, since <a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a> contains no allusion to anything of the kind, and the tombs of the kings upon Zion were not so near to the temple that it could possibly be defiled in consequence. Moreover, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; cannot be reconciled with this view; and for that reason Ewald and Hitzig propose to read &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, "in their death." The attempt of Kliefoth, however, to defend the reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, by taking it as in apposition to &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; and not to &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, is a desperate remedy, which clearly shows the impossibility of connecting &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; with the "corpses of the kings." We therefore understand by &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497; the dead idols, in accordance with <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a> (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>); but by &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; we understand, not the idols, but the Israelitish kings, as in the case of the preceding &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;; partly because it cannot be shown that the plural &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; is ever used in the sense of idols (though the singular &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; is used of Baal in <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a> and <a href="/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>), and partly on account of the harshness involved in interpreting the two &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; when standing so close together, in the first instance of the kings, and in the second of the idols of Israel. The corpses of the kings are therefore the dead idols, for which the kings (for example, Manasseh) had built altars or high places (&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;) in the sanctuary, i.e., in the courts of the temple (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4-7</a>). The objection that &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; without anything further, such, for instance, as &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; sa ,ecnatsni rof ,hcus in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>, cannot signify the dead idols, will not bear examination, as the more precise definition which is wanting is supplied by the context, where idolatry is the point in question. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; without the preposition &#1489; is a loosely attached apposition to &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501;, which defines more precisely in what way the whoredom of the nation and the dead idols of the kings had amounted to a defiling of the house of the Lord, namely, from the fact that the people and the kings had erected temples of high places (ba&#770;moth) for dead idols by the side of the temple of the living God, and had placed them so close that the threshold and door-posts of these idol-temples touched the threshold and door-posts of the temple of Jehovah, and there was nothing but the wall of the temple (&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512;) between Jehovah and the carcase-gods. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; is explained in this way in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-8.htm">Ezekiel 43:8</a>, and then the defiling of the holy name of the Lord is mentioned again for the purpose of appending, by means of &#1493;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; (imperf. Piel of &#1499;&#1500;&#1492;), the allusion to the penal judgment which they had thereby brought upon themselves. <a href="/ezekiel/43-9.htm">Ezekiel 43:9</a>. Such profanation as this will not take place any more in time to come, and Jehovah will dwell for ever in the midst of Israel.<p>To lead Israel to this goal, Ezekiel is to show them the house (i.e., the temple). In this way are the further words of God in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10-12</a> attached to what goes before. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, show or make known the house, is equivalent to proclaim to the people the revelation concerning the new temple. In this were the Israelites to discern the magnitude of the grace of God, that they might blush at their evil deeds, and measure the well-measured building (&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, as in <a href="/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12</a>), i.e., carefully consider and ponder what the Lord had bestowed upon His people through this sanctuary, so that they might suffer themselves to be brought to repentance by means of its glory. And if they felt shame and repentance on account of their transgressions, Ezekiel was to show them the shape and arrangement of the sanctuary, with all its forms and ordinances, an write them out before their eyes, that they might have the picture of it impressed upon their minds, and keep the statutes thereof. In <a href="/ezekiel/43-11.htm">Ezekiel 43:11</a> the words are crowded together, to indicate that all the several parts and arrangements of the new temple are significant and worthy of being pondered and laid to heart. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; is the shape of the temple generally, its external form; &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, the internal arrangement as a whole. Both of these are noticed specifically by the allusion to the goings out and in, as well as to the forms (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;) of the separate parts, and their statutes and laws. &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; are the precepts concerning the things to be observed by Israel when appearing before the Lord in the temple, the regulations for divine worship. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, the instructions contained in these statutes for sanctification of life. The second &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; is omitted in the lxx and some of the Hebrew Codd., and has therefore been expunged as a gloss by Dathe, Hitzig, and other critics; but it is undoubtedly genuine, and in conformity with the intentional crowding together of words. - The admonition to keep and to observe everything carefully is closed in <a href="/ezekiel/43-12.htm">Ezekiel 43:12</a> with a statement of the fundamental law of the temple; that upon the lofty mountain the whole of its domain round about is to be most holy. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1492;&#1512; does not belong to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; ot g in the sense of the house which is to be built upon the top of the mountain, but to the contents of the thora&#770;h of this house. It is to stand upon the top of the mountain, and to be most holy in all its domain. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1492;&#1512; is to be understood in accordance with <a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493; points back to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;. Both by its situation upon a very high mountain, and also by the fact that not merely the inner sanctuary, and not merely the whole of the temple house, but also the whole of its surroundings (all its courts), are to be most holy, the new sanctuary is to be distinguished from the earlier one. What has been already stated - namely, that the temple shall not be profaned any more - is compressed into this clause; and by the repetition of the words, "this is the law of the house,"' the first section of this vision, viz., the description of the temple, is rounded off; whilst the command given to the prophet in <a href="/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-11.htm">Ezekiel 43:11</a>, to make known all the statutes and laws of this temple to the house of Israel, forms at the same time the transition to the section which follows. </body></html>
