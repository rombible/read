Christ is the Temple; and he is the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side. They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in the world, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend the motions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search into the things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood, as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; and some quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, as St. Paul did, adore the depth, Ro 11. It is wisdom to begin with that which is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard to be understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges of believers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit, abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the souls of men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leaves serve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word, though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal the diseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to him by his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites. There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek the blessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Out of the way of the gate northward - Rather, by the way of the northward gate. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/47.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 47<p>Eze 47:1-23. Vision of the Temple Waters. Borders and Division of The land.<p>The happy fruit to the earth at large of God's dwelling with Israel in holy fellowship is that the blessing is no longer restricted to the one people and locality, but is to be diffused with comprehensive catholicity through the whole world. So the plant from the cedar of Lebanon is represented as gathering under its shelter "all fowl of every wing" (Eze 17:23). Even the desert places of the earth shall be made fruitful by the healing waters of the Gospel (compare Isa 35:1).<p>1. waters&#8212;So Re 22:1, represents "the water of life as proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb." His throne was set up in the temple at Jerusalem (Eze 43:7). Thence it is to flow over the earth (Joe 3:18; Zec 13:1; 14:8). Messiah is the temple and the door; from His pierced side flow the living waters, ever increasing, both in the individual believer and in the heart. The fountains in the vicinity of Moriah suggested the image here. The waters flow eastward, that is, towards the Kedron, and thence towards the Jordan, and so along the Ghor into the Dead Sea. The main point in the picture is the rapid augmentation from a petty stream into a mighty river, not by the influx of side streams, but by its own self-supply from the sacred miraculous source in the temple [Henderson]. (Compare Ps 36:8, 9; 46:4; Isa 11:9; Hab 2:14). Searching into the things of God, we find some easy to understand, as the water up to the ankles; others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters up to the knees or loins; others beyond our reach, of which we can only adore the depth (Ro 11:33). The healing of the waters of the Dead Sea here answers to "there shall be no more curse" (Re 22:3; compare Zec 14:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/47.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then brought he me out of the inmost court, </span> where he saw the waters running under the threshold, and by the south side of the altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The way of the gate northward:</span> the east gate being shut, the prophet in this vision is led to the north gate, out of which he goeth into the next court, and so through them all, till he comes to the north gate of the outmost court. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Led me about; </span> caused him to go about from that gate to the east gate of the same court. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The way without; </span> not on the inside of the wall, but round on the outside of the wall, which will appear presently, and the reason why. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The utter gate; </span> the outmost north gate in the wall, that compassed the whole mountain of the Lord’s house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The way that looketh eastward; </span> when the prophet was come quite out of all the courts, and is on the outside of the last wall, he is turned from the north gate towards the east gate, and walks up to that gate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And, behold, </span> there he found the watercourse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">On the right side; </span> that is, on the south side.

Out of the inward court where he was, by the way of the north gate, the eastern gate being shut: <p>and led me about the way without unto the utter gate, by the way that looketh eastward; and from thence he had him round to the outward eastern gate, where he was at first, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>, to meet the flow of waters that came through the inward and outward courts eastward: <p>and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side; that is, on the south side of the gate, in a small quantity, and in a very still and easy way, like water out of the mouth of a vial, as the word (b) signifies. So Bartenora (c), who understands this gate of the water gate, interprets the right side of the south; and observes, that the prophet first saw the waters come out very small, like the horns of a locust; but when they came to this gate, they became like water as it flows out of the mouth of a small pitcher: and from this whole account of the waters, it is plain they cannot be understood literally, but figuratively; and which confirm this to be the sense of the whole vision. They may be applied unto, and serve to illustrate, the love of God; the secret spring of which is in the heart and will of God; ran under ground from all eternity; channelled in Christ; broke up and issued forth in the mission of him into the world, under the threshold of him, the door of the church; and in and by him, the altar, sacrifice, and propitiation; wherein the love of God in an especial manner is manifested; and which has its heights and depths, immeasurable and unfathomable, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>, these waters also may be applied to the grace of the Spirit of God in regeneration and conversion; which is compared to water, for its cleansing, fructifying, and refreshing nature; to "waters", for the abundance of it; and this flows from the God of all grace through Christ, and out of his fulness is gradually increased, and becomes a well, yea, rivers of living water, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>, but it seems best to understand them of the Gospel, and the doctrines of it; which, like water, cools those who are inflamed with the heat of the fiery law; extinguishes the thirst of sensible sinners, and refreshes them; cleanses and purifies their souls, which is instrumentally done with the washing of water by the word; and makes them fruitful and flourishing: this is not of men, but God; comes from heaven, the holy of holies; and out of the house and church of God; from Zion and Jerusalem, by Christ the door, and points to him the way; and is chiefly concerning him, the altar, his sacrifice and satisfaction, peace, atonement, and propitiation by him; see <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>. <p>(b) "manabant tanquam e phiala", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "phialabant", Junius; "destillabant", Cocceius, Starckius.
