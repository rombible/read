And ye shall satiate yourselves at my table with horses and riders, heroes and all kinds of men of war, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - To show how terrible the judgment upon Gog will be, Ezekiel depicts in three special ways the total destruction of his powerful forces. In the first place, the burning of all the weapons of the fallen foe will furnish the inhabitants of the land of Israel with wood for firing for seven years, so that there will be no necessity for them to fetch fuel from the field or from the forest (<a href="/ezekiel/39-9.htm">Ezekiel 39:9</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/39-10.htm">Ezekiel 39:10</a>). But Hvernick is wrong in supposing that the reason for burning the weapons is that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>, weapons of war are irreconcilable with the character of the Messianic times of peace. This is not referred to here; but the motive is the complete annihilation of the enemy, the removal of every trace of him. The prophet therefore crowds the words together for the purpose of enumerating every kind of weapon that was combustible, even to the hand-staves which men were accustomed to carry (cf. <a href="/numbers/22-27.htm">Numbers 22:27</a>). The quantity of the weapons will be so great, that they will supply the Israelites with all the fuel they need for seven years. The number seven in the seven years as well as in the seven months of burying (<a href="/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a>) is symbolical, stamping the overthrow as a punishment inflicted by God, the completion of a divine judgment.<p>With the gathering of the weapons for burning there is associated the plundering of the fallen foe (<a href="/ezekiel/39-10.htm">Ezekiel 39:10</a>), by which the Israelites do to the enemy what he intended to do to them (<a href="/ezekiel/38-12.htm">Ezekiel 38:12</a>), and the people of God obtain possession of the wealth of their foes (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/30-16.htm">Jeremiah 30:16</a>). In the second place, God will assign a large burying-place for the army of Gog in a valley of Israel, which is to be named in consequence "the multitude of Gog;" just as a city in that region will also be called Hamonah from this event. The Israelites will bury the fallen of Gog there for seven months long, and after the expiration of that time they will have the land explored by men specially appointed for the purpose, and bones that may still have been left unburied will be sought out, and they will have them interred by buriers of the dead, that the land may be thoroughly cleansed (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11-16</a>). &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, a place where there was a grave in Israel, i.e., a spot in which he might be buried in Israel. There are different opinions as to both the designation and the situation of this place. There is no foundation for the supposition that &#1490;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; derives its name from the mountains of Abarim in <a href="/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Deuteronomy 32:49</a> (Michaelis, Eichhorn), or that it signifies valley of the haughty ones (Ewald), or that there is an allusion to the valley mentioned in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a> (Hitzig), or the valley of Jehoshaphat (Kliefoth). The valley cannot even have derived its name (&#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;) from the &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, who passed through the land to search out the bones of the dead that still remained unburied, and have them interred (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-14.htm">Ezekiel 39:14</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/39-15.htm">Ezekiel 39:15</a>). For &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; cannot have any other meaning here than that which it has in the circumstantial clause which follows, where those who explored the land cannot possibly be intended, although even this clause is also obscure. The only other passage in which &#1495;&#1505;&#1501; occurs is <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>, where it signifies a muzzle, and in the Arabic it means to obstruct, or cut off; and hence, in the passage before us, probably, to stop the way. &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are not the Scythians (Hitzig), for the word &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; is never applied to their invasion of the land, but generally the travellers who pass through the land, or more especially those who cross from Peraea to Canaan. The valley of &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is no doubt the valley of the Jordan above the Dead Sea. The definition indicates this, viz., &#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;, on the front of the sea; not to the east of the sea, as it is generally rendered, for &#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514; never has this meaning (see the comm. on <a href="/genesis/2-14.htm">Genesis 2:14</a>). By &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; we cannot understand "the Mediterranean,"as the majority of the commentators have done, as there would then be no meaning in the words, since the whole of the land of Israel was situated to the east of the Mediterranean Sea. &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; is the Dead Sea, generally called &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a>); and &#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;, "on the front side of the (Dead) Sea," as looked at from Jerusalem, the central point of the land, is probably the valley of the Jordan, the principal crossing place from Gilead into Canaan proper, and the broadest part of the Jordan-valley, which was therefore well adapted to be the burial-place for the multitude of slaughtered foes. But in consequence of the army of Gog having there found its grave, this valley will in future block up the way to the travellers who desire to pass to and fro. This appears to be the meaning of the circumstantial clause.<p>From the fact that Gog's multitude is buried there, the valley itself will receive the name of Hamon-Gog. The Israelites will occupy seven months in burying them, so enormously great will be the number of the dead to be buried (<a href="/ezekiel/39-12.htm">Ezekiel 39:12</a>), and this labour will be for a name, i.e., for renown, to the whole nation. This does not mean, of course, "that it will be a source of honour to them to assist in this work;" nor is the renown to be sought in the fact, that as a privileged people, protected by God, they can possess the grave of Gog in their land (Hitzig), - a thought which is altogether remote, and perfectly foreign to Israelitish views; but the burying of Gog's multitude of troops will be for a name to the people of Israel, inasmuch as they thereby cleanse the land and manifest their zeal to show themselves a holy people by sweeping all uncleanness away. &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; is an accusative of time: on the day when I glorify myself. - <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-14.htm">Ezekiel 39:14</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/39-15.htm">Ezekiel 39:15</a>. The effort made to cleanse the land perfectly from the uncleanness arising from the bones of the dead will be so great, that after the great mass of the slain have been buried in seven months, there will be men specially appointed to bury the bones of the dead that still lie scattered here and there about the land. &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; are people who have a permanent duty to discharge. The participles &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are co-ordinate, and are written together asyndetos, men who go about the land, and men who bury with those who go about. That the words are to be understood in this sense is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-15.htm">Ezekiel 39:15</a>, according to which those who go about do not perform the task of burying, but simply search for bones that have been left, and put up a sign for the buriers of the dead. &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, with the subject indefinite; if one sees a human bone, he builds (erects) a &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, or stone, by the side of it (cf. <a href="/2_kings/23-17.htm">2 Kings 23:17</a>). - <a href="/ezekiel/39-16.htm">Ezekiel 39:16</a>. A city shall also receive the name of Hamonah, i.e., multitude or tumult. To &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;&#1470;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; we may easily supply &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; from the context, since this puts in the future the statement, "the name of the city is," for which no verb was required in Hebrew. In the last words, &#1493;&#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the main thought is finally repeated and the picture brought to a close. - <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-20</a>. In the third place, God will provide the birds of prey and beasts of prey with an abundant meal from this slaughter. This cannot be understood as signifying that only what remain of the corpses, and have not been cleared away in the manner depicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11-16</a>, will become the prey of wild beasts; but the beasts of prey will make their meal of the corpses before it is possible to bury them, since the burying cannot be effected immediately or all at once. - The several features in the picture, of the manner in which the enemies are to be destroyed till the last trace of them is gone, are not arranged in chronological order, but according to the subject-matter; and the thought that the slaughtered foes are to become the prey of wild beasts is mentioned last as being the more striking, because it is in this that their ignominious destruction culminates. To give due prominence to this thought, the birds and beasts of prey are summoned by God to gather together to the meal prepared for them. The picture given of it as a sacrificial meal is based upon <a href="/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>. In harmony with this picture the slaughtered foes are designated as fattened sacrificial beasts, rams, lambs, he-goats, bullocks; on which Grotius has correctly remarked, that "these names of animals, which were generally employed in the sacrifices, are to be understood as signifying different orders of men, chiefs, generals, soldiers, as the Chaldee also observes." </body></html>
