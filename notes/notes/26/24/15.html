And as Ezekiel wept not for his affliction, so neither should they weep for theirs.

The lesson which the history teaches is, in substance, the same as that of <a href="/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5</a>. The calamity that falls on the nation will swallow up all personal sorrow, but it is brought home to Ezekiel, who may have read those words with wonder, by a new and terrible experience. We are left to conjecture whether anything in the prophet's home life furnished a starting-point for the terrible message that was now borne in upon his soul. Had his wife been ill before? or, as the words, <span class="cmt_word">with a stroke</span>, suggest, did it fall on him, as a thunderbolt "out of the blue"? I mention, only to reject, the view that the wife's death belongs as much to the category of symbolic visions as the boiling cauldron. To me such a view seems to indicate an incapacity for entering into a prophet's life and calling as great as that which sees nothing but an allegory in the history of Gomer in <a href="/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2, 3</a>. We, who accept the Scripture record as we find it, may believe that Ezekiel was taught, as the earlier prophet, to interpret his work by his own personal experience. To Ezekiel himself the loss of one who is thus described as <span class="cmt_word">the desire</span> (or, <span class="accented">delight</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of his eyes</span> (the word is used of things in <a href="/1_kings/20-6.htm">1 Kings 20:6</a>, of young warriors in <a href="/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a>, of sons and daughters in Ver. 25), must have been, at first, as the crowning sorrow of his life; but the feelings of the patriot-prophet were stronger even than those of the husband, and his personal bereavement seemed as a small thing compared with the desolation of his country. He was to refrain from all conventional signs of mourning, from weeping and wailing, from the loud sighing (for <span class="cmt_word">forbear to cry</span>, read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">sigh, but not aloud</span>), from the head covered or sprinkled with ashes (<a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>), and from the bare feet (<a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>), from the covered lips (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>; <a href="/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>), which were "the trappings and the garb of woe" in such a case. <span class="cmt_word">Eat not the bread of men</span>. The words point to the custom, more or less common in all nations and at all times, of a funeral feast, like the <span class="accented">parentalia</span> of the Romans. Wine also was commonly part of such a feast (<a href="/jeremiah/16-7.htm">Jeremiah 16:7</a>). The primary idea of the custom seems to have been that the mourner's friends sent the materials for the feast as a token of their sympathy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the day on which the king of Babylon commenced the siege and blockade of Jerusalem, this event was revealed by God to Ezekiel on the Chaboras (<a href="/ezekiel/24-1.htm">Ezekiel 24:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/24-2.htm">Ezekiel 24:2</a>); and he was commanded to predict to the people through the medium of a parable the fate of the city and its inhabitants (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3-14</a>). God then foretold to him the death of his own wife, and commanded him to show no sign of mourning on account of it. His wife died the following evening, and he did as he was commanded. When he was asked by the people the reason of this, he explained to them, that what he was doing was symbolical of the way in which they were to act when Jerusalem fell (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15-24</a>). The fall would be announced to the prophet by a fugitive, and then he would no longer remain mute, but would speak to the people again (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-25.htm">Ezekiel 24:25-27</a>). - Apart, therefore, from the last three verses, this chapter contains two words of God, the first of which unfolds in a parable the approaching calamities, and the result of the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-1.htm">Ezekiel 24:1-14</a>); whilst the second typifies by means of a sign the pain and mourning of Israel, namely, of the exiles at the destruction of the city with its sanctuary and its inhabitants. These two words of God, being connected together by their contents, were addressed to the prophet on the same day, and that, as the introduction (<a href="/ezekiel/24-1.htm">Ezekiel 24:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/24-2.htm">Ezekiel 24:2</a>) expressly observes, the day on which the siege of Jerusalem by the king of Babylon began.<p>And the word of Jehovah came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/24-2.htm">Ezekiel 24:2</a>. Son of man, write for thyself the name of the day, this same day! The king of Babylon has fallen upon Jerusalem this same day. - The date given, namely, the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year after the carrying away of Jehoiachin (<a href="/ezekiel/1-2.htm">Ezekiel 1:2</a>), or what is the same thing, of the reign of Zedekiah, who was appointed king in his stead, is mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>, as the day on which Nebuchadnezzar blockaded the city of Jerusalem by throwing up a rampart; and after the captivity this day was still kept as a fast-day in consequence (<a href="/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a>). What was thus taking place at Jerusalem was revealed to Ezekiel on the Chaboras the very same day; and he was instructed to announce it to the exiles, "that they and the besieged might learn both from the time and the result, that the destruction of the city was not to be ascribed to chance or to the power of the Babylonians, but to the will of Him who had long ago foretold that, on account of the wickedness of the inhabitants, the city would be burned with fire; and that Ezekiel was a true prophet, because even when in Babylon, which was at so great a distance, he had known and had publicly announced the state of Jerusalem." The definite character of this prediction cannot be changed into a vaticinium post eventum, either by arbitrary explanations of the words, or by the unfounded hypothesis proposed by Hitzig, that the day was not set down in this definite form till after the event. - Writing the name of the day is equivalent to making a note of the day. The reason for this is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-2.htm">Ezekiel 24:2</a>, namely, because Nebuchadnezzar had fallen upon Jerusalem on that very day. &#1505;&#1502;&#1498; signifies to support, hold up (his hand); and hence both here and in <a href="/psalms/88-8.htm">Psalm 88:8</a> the meaning to press violently upon anything. The rendering "to draw near," which has been forced upon the word from the Syriac (Ges., Winer, and others), cannot be sustained. </body></html>
