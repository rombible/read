It signifies that they would remain hardened in their sins; and that the judgments of God would have no effect upon them to bring them to repentance; and that God would have no mercy on them, or pardon their sins: <p>bring it out piece by piece: the people that were in Jerusalem, of every class and rank, of every age and sex; suggesting that they should not be all destroyed at once, but some at one time, and some at another; some in one way, and some in another; some by famine, others by the pestilence, and others by the sword; some by sallying out upon the enemy; others by endeavouring to make their escape privately, and fall into their hands: <p>let no lot fall upon it; to save some, and destroy others, as is often done in war; signifying that all were destined to destruction, some way or another; and none should be spared; they that escaped the pestilence should die by famine; and they that escaped them both should die by the sword; and they that escaped all three should be carried into captivity.

The actual subject-matter of these verses is closely connected with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-16.htm">Ezekiel 23:16</a>, more especially in the designation of the sins as adultery and bloodshed (compare <a href="/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/23-45.htm">Ezekiel 23:45</a> with <a href="/ezekiel/16-38.htm">Ezekiel 16:38</a>). &#1504;&#1488;&#1507;, to commit adultery with the idols, whereby the idols are placed on a par with Jehovah as the husband of Israel (compare <a href="/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>). For the Moloch-worship in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37</a>, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20-21</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/20-31.htm">Ezekiel 20:31</a>. The desecration of the sanctuary (<a href="/ezekiel/23-38.htm">Ezekiel 23:38</a>) is more minutely defined in <a href="/ezekiel/23-39.htm">Ezekiel 23:39</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-38.htm">Ezekiel 23:38</a>, which has so offended the lxx and Hitzig that it is omitted by the former, while the latter proposes to strike it out as a gloss, is added for the purpose of designating the profanation of the sanctuary as contemporaneous with the Moloch-worship of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37</a>, as is evident from <a href="/ezekiel/23-39.htm">Ezekiel 23:39</a>. For the fact itself, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4-5</a>, <a href="/2_kings/21-7.htm">2 Kings 21:7</a>. The desecration of the Sabbaths, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/20-16.htm">Ezekiel 20:16</a>. For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-39.htm">Ezekiel 23:39</a>, compare <a href="/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21</a>. The words are not to be understood as signifying that they sacrificed children to Moloch in the temple, but simply that immediately after they had sacrificed children to Moloch, they went into the temple of Jehovah, that there they might worship Jehovah also, and thus placed Jehovah upon a par with Moloch. This was a profanation (&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;) of His sanctuary.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-40.htm">Ezekiel 23:40-44</a> the allusion is not to actual idolatry, but to the ungodly alliance into which Judah had entered with Chaldea. Judah sent ambassadors to Chaldea, and for the purpose of receiving the Chaldeans, adorned herself as a woman would do for the reception of her paramours. She seated herself upon a splendid divan, and in front of this there was a table spread, upon which stood the incense and the oil that she ought to have offered to Jehovah. This is the explanation which Kliefoth has correctly given of <a href="/ezekiel/23-40.htm">Ezekiel 23:40</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/23-41.htm">Ezekiel 23:41</a>. The emphatic &#1493;&#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="/ezekiel/23-40.htm">Ezekiel 23:40</a> is sufficient to show that the reference is to a new crime deserving of punishment. This cannot be idolatry, because the worship of Moloch has already been mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/23-38.htm">Ezekiel 23:38</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/23-39.htm">Ezekiel 23:39</a> as the worst of all the idolatrous abominations. Moreover, sending for (or to) men who come from afar does not apply to idolatry in the literal sense of the word; for men to whom the harlot sent messengers to invite them to come to her could not be idols for which she sent to a distant land. The allusion is rather to Assyrians or Chaldeans, and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-42.htm">Ezekiel 23:42</a>, it is the former who are referred to here (compare <a href="/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah 39:3</a>). There is no force in Hitzig's objection, namely, that the one woman sent to these, and that their being sent for and coming have already been disposed of in <a href="/ezekiel/23-16.htm">Ezekiel 23:16</a>. For the singulars in the last clause of <a href="/ezekiel/23-40.htm">Ezekiel 23:40</a> show that even here only one woman is said to have sent for the men. Again, &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492; might even be the third person singular, as this form does sometimes take the termination &#1504;&#1492; (vid., Ewald, 191c, and Ges. 47, Anm. 3). At the same time, there is nothing in the fact that the sending to Chaldea has already been mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/23-16.htm">Ezekiel 23:16</a> to preclude another allusion to the same circumstance from a different point of view. The woman adorned herself that she might secure the favour of the men for whom she had sent. &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500; is the Arabic khl, to paint the eyes with stibium (kohol). For the fact itself, see the remarks on <a href="/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a>. She then seated herself upon a cushion (not lay down upon a bed; for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; does not mean to lie down), and in front of this there was a table, spread with different kinds of food, upon which she placed incense and oil. The suffix to &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; refers to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1503;, and is to be taken as a neuter, which suits the table as a thing, whilst &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1503; generally takes the termination &#1493;&#1514; in the plural. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-41.htm">Ezekiel 23:41</a>, Ewald and Hvernick detect a description of the lectisternia of the licentious worship of the Babylonian Mylitta. But neither the sitting (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;) upon a cushion (divan), nor the position taken by the woman behind the table, harmonizes with this. As Hitzig has correctly observed, "if she has taken her seat upon a cushion, and has a table spread before her, she evidently intends to dine, and that with the men for whom she has adorned herself. The oil is meant for anointing at meal-time (<a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-17.htm">Proverbs 21:17</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>), and the incense for burning." "My incense and my oil" are the incense and oil given to her by God, which she ought to have devoted to His service, but had squandered upon herself and her foreign friends (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/16-18.htm">Ezekiel 16:18</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-10.htm">Hosea 2:10</a>). The oil, as the produce of the land of Palestine, was the gift of Jehovah; and although incense was not a production of Palestine, yet as the money with which Judah purchased it, or the goods bartered for it, were the fists of God, Jehovah could also call it His incense.<p><a href="/ezekiel/23-42.htm">Ezekiel 23:42</a> is very obscure. Such renderings of the first clause as et vox multitudinis exultantis in ea (Vulg)., and "the voice of a careless multitude within her" (Hvernick), can hardly be sustained. In every other passage in which &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; occurs, it does not signify the voice of a multitude, but a loud tumult; compare <a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-3.htm">Isaiah 33:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-14.htm">1 Samuel 4:14</a>, where &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; is used as synonymous with &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;. Even in cases where &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; is used for a multitude, it denotes a noisy, boisterous, tumultuous crowd. Consequently &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; cannot be taken as an adjective connected with &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, because a quiet tumult is a contradiction, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; does not mean either exultans or recklessly breaking loose (Hvernick), but simply living in quiet, peaceful and contented. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; must therefore be the predicate to &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;; the sound of the tumult or the loud noise was (or became) quiet, still. &#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, thereat (neuter, like &#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, thereby, <a href="/genesis/24-14.htm">Genesis 24:14</a>). The words which follow, '&#1493;&#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, are not to be taken with the preceding clause, as the connection would yield no sense. They belong to what follows. &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1512;&#1489; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; .swollof tah can only be the men who came from afar (<a href="/ezekiel/23-40.htm">Ezekiel 23:40</a>). In addition to these, there were brought, i.e., induced to come, topers from the desert. The Chetib &#1505;&#1493;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; is no doubt a participle of &#1505;&#1489;&#1488;, drinkers, topers; and the Hophal  &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; is chosen instead of the Kal &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, for the sake of the paronomasia, with &#1505;&#1493;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;. The former, therefore, can only be the Assyrians (&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="/ezekiel/23-5.htm">Ezekiel 23:5</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/23-7.htm">Ezekiel 23:7</a>), the latter (the topers) the Chaldeans (&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1489;&#1500;( sn, <a href="/ezekiel/23-15.htm">Ezekiel 23:15</a>). The epithet drinkers is a very appropriate one for the sons of Babylon; as Curtius (<a href="/ezekiel/23-1.htm">Ezekiel 23:1</a>) describes the Babylonians as maxime in vinum et quae ebrietatem sequuntur effusi. The phrase "from the desert" cannot indicate the home of these men, although &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; corresponds to &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-40.htm">Ezekiel 23:40</a>, but simply the place from which they came to Judah, namely, from the desert of Syria and Arabia, which separated Palestine from Babylon. These peoples decorated the arms of the harlots with clasps, and their heads with splendid wreaths (crowns). The plural suffixes indicate that the words apply to both women, and this is confirmed by the fact that they are both named in <a href="/ezekiel/23-44.htm">Ezekiel 23:44</a>. The subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is not merely the &#1505;&#1493;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, but also the &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511; eht osla in <a href="/ezekiel/23-40.htm">Ezekiel 23:40</a>. The thought is simply that Samaria and Judah had attained to wealth and earthly glory through their intercourse with these nations; the very gifts with which, according to <a href="/ezekiel/16-11.htm">Ezekiel 16:11</a>., Jehovah Himself had adorned His people. The meaning of the verse, therefore, when taken in its connection, appears to be the following: - When the Assyrians began to form alliances with Israel, quiet was the immediate result. The Chaldeans were afterwards added to these, so that through their adulterous intercourse with both these nations Israel and Judah acquired both wealth and glory. The sentence which God pronounced upon this conduct was, that Judah had sunk so deeply into adultery that it would be impossible for it ever to desist from the sin.<p>This is the way in which we understand <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-43.htm">Ezekiel 23:43</a>, connecting  &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;  with &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;: "I said concerning her who was debilitated with whoredom." &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, feminine of &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; fo enini, used up, worn out; see, for example, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/9-4.htm">Joshua 9:4-5</a>, where it is applied to clothes; here it is transferred to persons decayed, debilitated, in which sense the verb occurs in <a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>. &#1504;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, which is co-ordinated with &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, does not indicate the means by which the strength has been exhausted, but is an accusative of direction or reference, debilitated with regard to adultery, so as no longer to be capable of practising it.<p>(Note: The proposal of Ewald to take &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; &#1504;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; as an independent clause, "adultery to the devil," cannot be defended by the usage of the language; and that of Hitzig, "the withered hag practises adultery," is an unnatural invention, inasmuch as &#1500;, if taken as nota dativi, would give this meaning: the hag has (possesses) adultery as her property - and there is nothing to indicate that it should be taken as a question.)<p>In the next clause &#1506;&#1514;&#1468; , &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; is the subject to &#1497;&#1494;&#1504;&#1492;, and the Chetib is correct, the Keri being erroneous, and the result of false exposition. If &#1514;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; were the object to &#1497;&#1494;&#1504;&#1492;, so that the woman would be the subject, we should have the feminine &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1492;. But if, on the other hand, &#1514;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; is the subject, there is no necessity for this, whether we regard the word as a plural, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, or take it as a singular, as Ewald (259a) has done, inasmuch as in either case it is still an abstract, which might easily be preceded by the verb in the masculine form. &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; gives greater force, not only to the suffix, but also the noun - and that even she (her whoredom). The sin of whoredom is personified, or regarded as &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>), as a propensity to whoredom, which continues in all its force after the capacity of the woman herself is gone. - <a href="/ezekiel/23-44.htm">Ezekiel 23:44</a> contains the result of the foregoing description of the adulterous conduct of the two women, and this is followed in <a href="/ezekiel/23-45.htm">Ezekiel 23:45</a>. by an account of the attitude assumed by God, and the punishment of the sinful women. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;, with an indefinite subject, they (man, one) went to her. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;, the one woman, Oholibah. It is only in the apodosis that what has to be said is extended to both women. This is the only interpretation of <a href="/ezekiel/23-44.htm">Ezekiel 23:44</a> which does justice both to the verb &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; (imperfect with Vav consec. as the historical tense) and the perfect &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;. The plural &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1514; does not occur anywhere else. Hitzig would therefore alter it into the singular, as "unheard of," and confine the attribute to Oholibah, who is the only one mentioned in the first clause of the verse, and also in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-43.htm">Ezekiel 23:43</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-40.htm">Ezekiel 23:40</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/23-41.htm">Ezekiel 23:41</a>. The judgment upon the two sisters is to be executed by righteous men (<a href="/ezekiel/23-45.htm">Ezekiel 23:45</a>). The Chaldeans are not designated as righteous in contrast to the Israelites, but as the instruments of the punitive righteousness of God in this particular instance, executing just judgment upon the sinners for adultery and bloodshed (vid., <a href="/ezekiel/16-38.htm">Ezekiel 16:38</a>). The infinitives &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1514;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="/ezekiel/23-46.htm">Ezekiel 23:46</a> stand for the third person future. For other points, compare the commentary on <a href="/ezekiel/16-40.htm">Ezekiel 16:40</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/16-41.htm">Ezekiel 16:41</a>. The formula &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1494;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492; is derived from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, and has been explained in the exposition of that passage. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488; is the inf. abs. Piel. For the meaning of the word, see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/21-24.htm">Ezekiel 21:24</a>. From this judgment all women, i.e., all nations, are to take warning to desist from idolatry. &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is a mixed form, compounded of the Niphal and Hithpael, for &#1492;&#1514;&#1493;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, like &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-8.htm">Deuteronomy 21:8</a> (see the comm. in loc.). - For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-49.htm">Ezekiel 23:49</a>, vid., <a href="/ezekiel/16-58.htm">Ezekiel 16:58</a>. - The punishment is announced to both the women, Israel and Judah, as still in the future, although Oholah (Samaria) had been overtaken by the judgment a considerable time before. The explanation of this is to be found in the allegory itself, in which both kingdoms are represented as being sisters of one mother; and it may also be defended on the ground that the approaching destruction of Jerusalem and the kingdom of Judah affected the remnants of the kingdom of the ten tribes, which were still to be found in Palestine; whilst, on the other hand, the judgment was not restricted to the destruction of the two kingdoms, but also embraced the later judgments which fell upon the entire nation. </body></html>
