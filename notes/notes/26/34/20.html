By good pastures and deep waters, are meant the pure word of God and the dispensing of justice. The latter verses, 23-31, prophesy of Christ, and of the most glorious times of his church on earth. Under Him, as the good Shepherd, the church would be a blessing to all around. Christ, though excellent in himself, was as a tender plant out of a dry ground. Being the Tree of life, bearing all the fruits of salvation, he yields spiritual food to the souls of his people. Our constant desire and prayer should be, that there may be showers of blessings in every place where the truth of Christ is preached; and that all who profess the gospel may be filled with fruits of righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yahweh having promised to be a Ruler of His people, the administration of the divine kingdom is now described, as carried on by One King, the representative of David, whose dominion should fulfill all the promises originally made to the man after God's own heart. Ezekiel does not so much add to, as explain and develope, the original promise; and as the complete fulfillment of the spiritual blessings, which the prophets were guided to proclaim, was manifestly never realized in any temporal prosperity of the Jews, and never could and never can be realized in any earthly kingdom, we recognize throughout the Sacred Volume the one subject of all prophecy - the Righteous King, the Anointed Prince, the Son and the Lord of David.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. fat &#8230; lean&#8212;the rich oppressors &#8230; the humble poor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I, even I:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.">Ezekiel 34:11</a>,17</span>.

Thou then, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Ye rightly say, Our transgressions and our sins lie upon us, and in them we vanish away; how, then, can we live? <a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>. Say to them, As   truly as I live, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the sinner; but when the sinner turneth from his way, he shall live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways! for why will ye die, O house of Israel? <a href="/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12</a>. And thou, son of man, say to the sons of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous man will not deliver him in the day of his transgression, and the sinner will not fall through his sin in the day that he turneth from his sin, and the righteous man will not be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth. <a href="/ezekiel/33-13.htm">Ezekiel 33:13</a>. If I say to the righteous man that he shall live, and he relies upon his righteousness and does wrong, all his righteousnesses will not be remembered; and for his wrong that he has done, he will die. <a href="/ezekiel/33-14.htm">Ezekiel 33:14</a>. If I say to the sinner, Thou shalt die, and he turns from his sin, and does justice and righteousness, <a href="/ezekiel/33-15.htm">Ezekiel 33:15</a>. So that the wicked returns the pledge, restores what has been robbed, walks in the statutes of life without doing wrong, he will live, not die. <a href="/ezekiel/33-16.htm">Ezekiel 33:16</a>. All his sins which he has committed shall not be remembered against him; he has done justice and righteousness, he will live. <a href="/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17</a>. And the sons of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not right; but they - their way is not right. <a href="/ezekiel/33-18.htm">Ezekiel 33:18</a>. If the righteous man turneth from his righteousness and doeth wrong, he shall die thereby; <a href="/ezekiel/33-19.htm">Ezekiel 33:19</a>. But if the wicked man turneth from his wickedness and doeth right and righteousness, he will live thereby. <a href="/ezekiel/33-20.htm">Ezekiel 33:20</a>. And yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not right. I will judge you every one according to his ways, O house of Israel. - In <a href="/ezekiel/33-10.htm">Ezekiel 33:10</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a> the prophet's calling for the future is set before him, inasmuch as God instructs him to announce to those who are in despair on account of their sins the gracious will of the Lord. The threat contained in the law (<a href="/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>), &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;, of which Ezekiel had repeatedly reminded the people with warning, and, last of all, when predicting the conquest and destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans (compare <a href="/ezekiel/4-17.htm">Ezekiel 4:17</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>), had pressed heavily upon their heart, when the threatened judgment took place, so that they quote the words, not "in self-defence," as Hvernick erroneously supposes, but in despair of any deliverance. Ezekiel is to meet this despair of little faith by the announcement that the Lord has no pleasure in the death of the sinner, but desires his conversion and his life. Ezekiel had already set this word of grave before the people in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>, accompanied with the summons to salvation for them to lay to heart: there, it was done to overthrow the delusion that the present generation had to atone for the sins of the fathers; but here, to lift up the hearts of those who were despairing of salvation; and for this reason it is accompanied with the asseveration (wanting in <a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>): "as truly as I live, saith the Lord," and with the urgent appeal to repent and turn. But in order to preclude the abuse of this word of consolation by making it a ground of false confidence in their own righteousness, Ezekiel repeats in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12-20</a> the principal thoughts contained in that announcement (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20-32</a>) - namely, first of all, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12-16</a>, the thought that the righteousness of the righteous is of no avail to him if he gives himself up to the unrighteousness, and that the sinner will not perish on account of his sin if he turns from his wickedness and strives after righteousness (&#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; , <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12</a>, as in <a href="/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-15.htm">Jeremiah 6:15</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-24.htm">Ezekiel 18:24-25</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-21.htm">Ezekiel 18:21</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22</a>; and for <a href="/ezekiel/33-14.htm">Ezekiel 33:14</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-15.htm">Ezekiel 33:15</a>, more especially <a href="/ezekiel/18-5.htm">Ezekiel 18:5</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>); and then, secondly, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17-20</a>, the reproof of those who find fault with the way of the Lord (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-29.htm">Ezekiel 18:29-30</a>). </body></html>
