Under Him, as the good Shepherd, the church would be a blessing to all around. Christ, though excellent in himself, was as a tender plant out of a dry ground. Being the Tree of life, bearing all the fruits of salvation, he yields spiritual food to the souls of his people.

And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the tenth (month), on the fifth of the month after our being taken captive, there came to me a fugitive from Jerusalem, and said, The city is smitten. <a href="/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a>. And the hand of Jehovah had come upon me in the evening before the arrival of the fugitive, and He opened my mouth, till he came to me in the morning; and so was my mouth opened, and I was silent no more. - In these verses the fulfilment of the promise made by God to the prophet in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-25.htm">Ezekiel 24:25-27</a>, after the prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem, is recorded. The chronological datum, as to the precise time at which the messenger arrived with the account of the destruction of Jerusalem, serves to mark with precision the point of time at which the obstacle was removed, and the prophet was able to speak and prophesy without restraint. - The fact that the tidings of the destruction of Jerusalem, which took place in the fifth month of the eleventh year, are said to have only reached the exiles in the tenth month of the twelfth year, that is to say, nearly a year and a half after it occurred, does not warrant our following the Syriac, as Doederlein and Hitzig have done, calling in question the correctness of the text and substituting the eleventh year for the twelfth. With the distance at which Ezekiel was living, namely, in northern Mesopotamia, and with the fearful confusion which followed the catastrophe, a year and a half might very easily pass by before a fugitive arrived with the information. But Hitzig's assertion, that Ezekiel would contradict himself, inasmuch as, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-1.htm">Ezekiel 26:1-2</a>, he received intelligence of the affair in the eleventh year, is founded upon a misinterpretation of the passage quoted. It is not stated there that Ezekiel received this information through a fugitive or any man whatever, but simply that God had revealed to him the fall of Jerusalem even before it occurred. &#1500;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, after our being led away (<a href="/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40-1.htm">Ezekiel 40:1</a>), coincides with &#1500;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; in <a href="/ezekiel/1-2.htm">Ezekiel 1:2</a>. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;, smitten, i.e., conquered and destroyed, exterminated. In the clause '&#1493;&#1497;&#1491; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; , the verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; is a pluperfect, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; stands for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, according to the later usage. The formula indicates the translation of the prophet into an ecstatic state (see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>), in which his mouth was opened to speak, that is to say, the silence imposed upon him was taken away. The words, "till he came to me in the morning," etc., are not to be understood as signifying that the prophet's mouth had only been opened for the time from evening till morning; for this would be opposed to the following sentence. They simply affirm that the opening of the mouth took place before the arrival of the fugitive, the night before the morning of his arrival. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;, which follows, is an emphatic repetition, introduced as a link with which to connect the practically important statement that from that time forward he was not speechless any more. - It was in all probability shortly afterwards that Ezekiel was inspired with the word of God which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-23.htm">Ezekiel 33:23-33</a>, as we may infer from the contents of the word itself, which laid the foundation for the prophet's further prophesying. But nothing can be gathered from <a href="/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a> with regard to the time when this and the following words of God (as far as <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39.htm">Ezekiel 39</a>), of which no chronological data are given, were communicated to the prophet and uttered by him. His being "silent no more" by no means involves immediate or continuous speaking, but simply recalls the command to be speechless. There is no ground for the assumption that all these words of God were communicated to him in one night (Hvernick, Hengstenberg, and others), either in <a href="/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a> or in the contents of these divine revelations. </body></html>
