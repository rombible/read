It may be worth while to note, as modern English usage tends to limit the range of the word, that it is commonly used in the Old Testament of sheep rather than of kine (<a href="/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34-42</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-8.htm">Genesis 31:8-12</a>).

The words, at first, seem to point to a division like that of <a href="/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>, and may, perhaps, have suggested it. Here, however, the contrast lies, not between the sheep and goats as such, but between the strong and the weak of each class. The "rams" are as much the object of the shepherd's discipline of judgment as the "he-goats." Both stand as the representative of the rapacious self-seeking classes who oppressed the poor and needy, and, not content with being the first to feed on the pastures and to drink of the waters, trampled on the former and defiled the latter. So in the next verse the contrast lies between the "fat cattle," whether sheep or goats, and the "lean." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As watchman over Israel, Ezekiel is to announce to those who are despairing of the mercy of God, that the Lord will preserve from destruction those who turn from their sin, and lead them into life. - <a href="/ezekiel/33-10.htm">Ezekiel 33:10</a>.

The threat contained in the law (<a href="/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>), &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;, of which Ezekiel had repeatedly reminded the people with warning, and, last of all, when predicting the conquest and destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans (compare <a href="/ezekiel/4-17.htm">Ezekiel 4:17</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>), had pressed heavily upon their heart, when the threatened judgment took place, so that they quote the words, not "in self-defence," as Hvernick erroneously supposes, but in despair of any deliverance. Ezekiel is to meet this despair of little faith by the announcement that the Lord has no pleasure in the death of the sinner, but desires his conversion and his life. Ezekiel had already set this word of grave before the people in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>, accompanied with the summons to salvation for them to lay to heart: there, it was done to overthrow the delusion that the present generation had to atone for the sins of the fathers; but here, to lift up the hearts of those who were despairing of salvation; and for this reason it is accompanied with the asseveration (wanting in <a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>): "as truly as I live, saith the Lord," and with the urgent appeal to repent and turn. But in order to preclude the abuse of this word of consolation by making it a ground of false confidence in their own righteousness, Ezekiel repeats in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12-20</a> the principal thoughts contained in that announcement (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20-32</a>) - namely, first of all, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12-16</a>, the thought that the righteousness of the righteous is of no avail to him if he gives himself up to the unrighteousness, and that the sinner will not perish on account of his sin if he turns from his wickedness and strives after righteousness (&#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; , <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12</a>, as in <a href="/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-15.htm">Jeremiah 6:15</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-24.htm">Ezekiel 18:24-25</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-21.htm">Ezekiel 18:21</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22</a>; and for <a href="/ezekiel/33-14.htm">Ezekiel 33:14</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-15.htm">Ezekiel 33:15</a>, more especially <a href="/ezekiel/18-5.htm">Ezekiel 18:5</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>); and then, secondly, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17-20</a>, the reproof of those who find fault with the way of the Lord (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-29.htm">Ezekiel 18:29-30</a>). </body></html>
