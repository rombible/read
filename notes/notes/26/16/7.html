We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us.

Or, "made thee millions" (m); like the spires of grass in the field. This refers to the multiplication of the children of Israel in Egypt, especially after the death of Joseph, and even while they were sorely afflicted, and likewise in later times. Jacob went down to Egypt with seventy five persons only, but when his posterity returned from thence, they were above six hundred thousand that were able to go forth to war, <a href="/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>; see <a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>; <p>and thou hast increased and waxed great; and became large families, kindreds, and tribes, as the Targum interprets it; as a child grows up, and becomes adult: <p>and thou art come to excellent ornaments; or, "ornament of ornaments" (n); as a young woman, when she is grown up, comes to wear better and finer clothes than in infancy; perhaps there is an allusion to the jewels the Israelites brought out of Egypt with them: this may be applied to the laws, statutes, and ordinances given them, which were an "ornament of grace" unto them, <a href="/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>; <p>thy breasts are fashioned; swelled and stood out; were come to a proper size and shape, as in persons grown and marriageable; see Sol 8:10; <p>and thine hair is grown; an euphemism, expressive of puberty, which in females was at twelve years of age: <p>whereas thou wast naked and bare; in a state of infancy. Jarchi and Kimchi interpret this of the Israelites being without the commandments. The whole of what is here said, may be applied to quickened and converted persons, who grow in grace, and increase in spiritual knowledge; and are adorned with the ornaments of grace and good works; and attend to the word and ordinances, which are the church's breasts; who, while in their nature state, were naked and destitute of righteousness and grace. <p>(m) "millia dedi", Pagninus, Montanus; "in multa millia", Tigurine version; "in myriadem te auxi", Piscator; so Ben Melech.

The rest of the verse, however, continues the figure of the child growing up to womanhood. For “myriad” LXX. has “do thou grow” (imper.). This is not natural, but probably some word signifying “growth” should be read, “I gave thee growth like the herb of the field; and thou didst grow and wax great.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou art come … ornaments</span>] Thou <span class="bld">didst come</span> to excellent ornament, lit. ornament of ornaments. The connexion requires that “ornament” should mean graces and beauties of the person.

The rendering “beauty of cheeks” (Hitz.) rests upon the supposed sense of <a href="/psalms/32-9.htm" title="Be you not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near to you.">Psalm 32:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-5.htm" title="Who satisfies your mouth with good things; so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.">Psalm 103:5</a>.

The unattractive character of the early patriarchal history as written in Genesis is plain enough (Genesis 29-31, 38.). This unattractive character is set forth in the blood and pollution of the new-born infant, and the Lord’s care of them in their dependent and defenceless condition under the figure of his pity and adoption of the outcast child. The truth conveyed in the allegory is more delicately expressed by another writer: “The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all peoples; but because the Lord loved you” (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/7-7.htm" title="The LORD did not set his love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all people:...">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The tenses should be in the simple historic past: <span class="cmt_word">I caused; thou didst increase and wax great; thou attainedst,</span> and so on (Revised Version).

So Vulgate, <span class="accented">mundus muliebris.</span> Here, however, the external adorning comes in vers. 10, 11, and instead of the plural we have the dual. Hitzig is, perhaps, right in taking the phrase to refer to tide beauty of the cheeks, which are themselves the ornaments of the golden prime of wroth.

Son of man, what advantage has the wood of the vine over every wood, the vine-branch, which was among the trees of the forest? <a href="/ezekiel/15-3.htm">Ezekiel 15:3</a>. Is wood taken from it to use for any work? or do men take a peg from it to hang all kinds of vessels upon? <a href="/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a>. Behold, it is given to the fire to consume. If the fire has consumed its two ends, and the middle of it is scorched, will it then be fit for any work? <a href="/ezekiel/15-5.htm">Ezekiel 15:5</a>. Behold, when it is uninjured, it is not used for any work: how much less when the fire has consumed it and scorched it can it be still used for work? <a href="/ezekiel/15-6.htm">Ezekiel 15:6</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, As the wood of the vine among the wood of the forest, which I give to the fire to consume, so do I give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem, <a href="/ezekiel/15-7.htm">Ezekiel 15:7</a>. And direct my face against them. They have gone out of the fire, and the fire will consume them; that ye may learn that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them. <a href="/ezekiel/15-8.htm">Ezekiel 15:8</a>. And I make the land a desert, because they committed treachery, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - Israel is like the wood of the wild vine, which is put into the fire to burn, because it is good for nothing. From <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32-33</a> onwards, Israel is frequently compared to a vine or a vineyard (cf. <a href="/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>.; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), and always, with the exception of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>, to point out its degeneracy. This comparison lies at the foundation of the figure employed, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-2.htm">Ezekiel 15:2-5</a>, of the wood of the wild vine. This wood has no superiority over any other kind of wood. It cannot be used, like other timber, for any useful purposes; but is only fit to be burned, so that it is really inferior to all other wood (<a href="/ezekiel/15-2.htm">Ezekiel 15:2</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/15-3.htm">Ezekiel 15:3</a>). And if, in its perfect state, it cannot be used for anything, how much less when it is partially scorched and consumed (<a href="/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/15-5.htm">Ezekiel 15:5</a>)! &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, followed by &#1502;&#1503;, means, what is it above (&#1502;&#1503;, comparative)? - i.e., what superiority has it to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1509;, all kinds of wood? i.e., any other wood. '&#1492;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is in apposition to &#1506;&#1509; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1503;, and is not to be connected with &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1509;, as it has been by the lxx and Vulgate, - notwithstanding the Masoretic accentuation, - so as to mean every kind of fagot; for &#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; does not mean a fagot, but the tendril or branch of the vine (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>), which is still further defined by the following relative clause: to be a wood-vine, i.e., a wild vine, which bears only sour, uneatable grapes. The preterite &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; (which was; not, "is") may be explained from the idea that the vine had been fetched from the forest in order that its wood might be used. The answer given in <a href="/ezekiel/15-3.htm">Ezekiel 15:3</a> is, that this vine-wood cannot be used for any purpose whatever, not even as a peg for hanging any kind of domestic utensils upon (see comm. on <a href="/zechariah/10-4.htm">Zechariah 10:4</a>). It is too weak even for this. The object has to be supplied to &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492;: to make, or apply it, for any work. Because it cannot be used as timber, it is burned. A fresh thought is introduced in <a href="/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a> by the words '&#1488;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;. The two clauses in <a href="/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a> are to be connected together. The first supposes a case, from which the second is deduced as a conclusion. The question, "Is it fit for any work?" is determined in <a href="/ezekiel/15-5.htm">Ezekiel 15:5</a> in the negative. &#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;: as in <a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>. &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;: perfect; and &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;: imperfect, Niphal, of &#1495;&#1512;&#1512;, in the sense of, to be burned or scorched. The subject to wa&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512; is no doubt the wood, to which the suffix in &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; refers. At the same time, the two clauses are to be understood, in accordance with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a>, as relating to the burning of the ends and the scorching of the middle. - <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-6.htm">Ezekiel 15:6-8</a>. In the application of the parable, the only thing to which prominence is given, is the fact that God will deal with the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the same manner as with the vine-wood, which cannot be used for any kind of work. This implies that Israel resembles the wood of a forest-vine. As this possesses no superiority to other wood, but, on the contrary, is utterly useless, so Israel has no superiority to other nations, but is even worse than they, and therefore is given up to the fire. This is accounted for in <a href="/ezekiel/15-7.htm">Ezekiel 15:7</a> : "They have come out of the fire, and the fire will consume them" (the inhabitants of Jerusalem). These words are not to be interpreted proverbially, as meaning, "he who escapes one judgment falls into another" (Hvernick), but show the application of <a href="/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/15-5.htm">Ezekiel 15:5</a> to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Out of a fire one must come either burned or scorched. Israel has been in the fire already. It resembles a wild vine which has been consumed at both ends by the fire, while the middle has been scorched, and which is now about to be given up altogether to the fire. We must not restrict the fire, however, out of which it has come half consumed, to the capture of Jerusalem in the time of Jehoiachin, as Hitzig does, but must extend it to all the judgments which fell upon the covenant nation, from the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes to the catastrophe in the reign of Jehoiachin, and in consequence of which Israel now resembled a vine burned at both ends and scorched in the middle. The threat closes in the same manner as the previous one. Compare <a href="/ezekiel/15-7.htm">Ezekiel 15:7</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-8.htm">Ezekiel 14:8</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/15-8.htm">Ezekiel 15:8</a> with <a href="/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/14-13.htm">Ezekiel 14:13</a>. </body></html>
