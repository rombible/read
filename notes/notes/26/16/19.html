This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us.

Then I passed by thee, and saw thee stamping in thy blood, and said to thee, In thy blood live! and said to thee, In thy blood live! <a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>. I made thee into myriads as the growth of the field, and thou grewest and becamest tall, and camest to ornament of cheeks. The breasts expanded, and thy hair grew, whereas thou wast naked and bare. <a href="/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>. And I passed by thee, and saw thee, and, behold, it was thy time, the time of love; and I spread my wing over thee, and covered thy nakedness; and I swore to thee, and entered into covenant with thee, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, and thou becamest mine. <a href="/ezekiel/16-9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9</a>. And I bathed thee in water, and rinsed thy blood from thee, and anointed thee with oil. <a href="/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a>. And I clothed thee with embroidered work, and shod thee with morocco, and wrapped thee round with byssus, and covered thee with silk. <a href="/ezekiel/16-11.htm">Ezekiel 16:11</a>. I adorned thee with ornaments, and put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain around thy neck. <a href="/ezekiel/16-12.htm">Ezekiel 16:12</a>. And I gave thee a ring in thy nose, and earrings in thine ears, and a splendid crown upon thy head. <a href="/ezekiel/16-13.htm">Ezekiel 16:13</a>. And thou didst adorn thyself with gold and silver; and thy clothing was byssus, and silk, and embroidery. Wheaten-flour, and honey, and oil thou didst eat; and thou wast very beautiful; and didst thrive to regal dignity. <a href="/ezekiel/16-14.htm">Ezekiel 16:14</a>. Thy name went forth among the nations on account of thy beauty; for it was perfect through my glory, which I put upon thee, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - The description of what the Lord did for Israel in His compassionate love is divided into two sections by the repetition of the phrase "I passed by thee" (<a href="/ezekiel/16-6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>). The first embraces what God had done for the preservation and increase of the nation; the second, what He had done for the glorification of Israel, by adopting it as the people of His possession. When Israel was lying in the field as a neglected new-born child, the Lord passed by and adopted it, promising it life, and giving it strength to live. To bring out the magnitude of the compassion of God, the fact that the child was lying in its blood is mentioned again and again. The explanation to be given of &#1502;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505;&#1514; (the Hithpolel of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, to trample upon, tread under foot) is doubtful, arising from the difficulty of deciding whether the Hithpolel is to be taken in a passive or a reflective sense. The passive rendering, "trampled upon" (Umbreit), or ad conculcandum projectus, thrown down, to be trodden under foot (Gesenius, etc.), is open to the objection that the Hophal is used for this. We therefore prefer the reflective meaning, treading oneself, or stamping; as the objection offered to this, namely, that a new-born child thrown into a field would not be found stamping with the feet, has no force in an allegorical description. In the clause <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6</a>, which is written twice, the question arises whether &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; is to be taken with &#1495;&#1497;&#1497; or with &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; : I said to thee, "In thy blood live;" or, "I said to thee in thy blood, 'Live.' " We prefer the former, because it gives a more emphatic sense. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; is a concise expression; for although lying in thy blood, in which thou wouldst inevitably bleed to death, yet thou shalt live. Hitzig's proposal to connect &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; in the first clause with &#1495;&#1497;&#1497; , and in the second with &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, can hardly be entertained. A double construction of this kind is not required either by the repetition of &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500;&#1498;, or by the uniform position of &#1489;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; before &#1495;&#1497;&#1497; in both clauses, as compared with <a href="/1_kings/20-18.htm">1 Kings 20:18</a> and <a href="/isaiah/27-5.htm">Isaiah 27:5</a>.<p>In <a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a> the description of the real fact breaks through the allegory. The word of God &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;, live, was visibly fulfilled in the innumerable multiplication of Israel. But the allegory is resumed immediately. The child grew (&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, as in <a href="/genesis/21-20.htm">Genesis 21:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-16.htm">Deuteronomy 30:16</a>), and came into ornament of cheeks (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; with &#1489;&#1468;, to enter into a thing, as in <a href="/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>; not to proceed in, as Hitzig supposes). &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;, not most beautiful ornament, or highest charms, for &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; is not the plural of &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;; but according to the Chetib and most of the editions, with the tone upon the penultima, is equivalent to &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;, a dual form; so that &#1506;&#1491;&#1497; cannot mean ornament in this case, but, as in <a href="/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>, "the cheek," which is the traditional meaning (cf. Ges. Thes. p. 993). Ornament of cheeks is youthful freshness and beauty of face. The clauses which follow describe the arrival of puberty. &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, when applied to the breasts, means to expand, lit., to raise oneself up. &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;  equals  &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, pubes. The description given in these verses refers to the preservation and marvellous multiplication of Israel in Egypt, where the sons of Israel grew into a nation under the divine blessing. Still it was quite naked and bare (&#1506;&#1512;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; are substantives in the abstract sense of nakedness and bareness, used in the place of adjective to give greater emphasis). Naked and bare are figurative expressions for still destitute of either clothing or ornaments. This implies something more than "the poverty of the people in the wilderness attached to Egypt" (Hitzig). Nakedness represents deprivation of all the blessings of salvation with which the Lord endowed Israel and made it glorious, after He had adopted it as the people of His possession. In Egypt, Israel was living in a state of nature, destitute of the gracious revelations of God.</body></html>
