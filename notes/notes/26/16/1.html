This is done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death, educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty of the most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last received into favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge of these expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and places in which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they do to us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parable was well suited for that purpose.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Idolatry is frequently represented by the prophets under the figure of a wife's unfaithfulness to her husband. This image is here so portrayed, as to exhibit the aggravation of Israel's guilt by reason of her origin and early history. The original abode of the progenitors of the race was the land of Canaan, defiled with idolatry and moral corruption. Israel itself was like a child born in a polluted land, abandoned from its birth, left by its parents in the most utter neglect to the chance regard of any passer-by. Such was the state of the people in Egypt <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3-5</a>. On such a child the Lord looked with pity, tended, and adopted it. Under His care it grew up to be comely and beautiful, and the Lord joined it to Himself in that close union, which is figured by the bonds of wedlock. The covenants made under Moses and Joshua represent this alliance <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6-8</a>. In the reigns of David and Solomon, Israel shone with all the glory of temporal prosperity <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9-14</a>. The remainder of the history of the people when divided is, in the prophet's eye, a succession of defection and degradation marked by the erection of high places <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16-20</a>; by unholy alliances with foreign nations <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-26.htm">Ezekiel 16:26-33</a>. Such sins were soon to meet their due punishment. As an unfaithful wife was brought before the people, convicted, and stoned, so should the Lord make His people a gazing-stock to all the nations round about, deprive them of all their possessions and of their city, and cast them forth as exiles to be spoiled and destroyed in a foreign land <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-35.htm">Ezekiel 16:35-43</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 16<p>Eze 16:1-63.

This hope, which might be cherished by the people and by the elders who had come to the prophet, is now to be taken from the people by the word of God which follows, containing as it does the announcement, that if any land should sin so grievously against God by its apostasy, He would be driven to inflict upon it the punishments threatened by Moses against apostate Israel (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25-26</a>, and elsewhere), namely, to destroy both man and beast, and make the land a desert; it would be of no advantage to such a land to have certain righteous men, such as Noah, Daniel, and Job, living therein. For although these righteous men would be saved themselves, their righteousness could not possibly secure salvation for the sinners. The manner in which this thought is carried out in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-13.htm">Ezekiel 14:13-20</a> is, that four exterminating punishments are successively supposed to come upon the land and lay it waste; and in the case of every one, the words are repeated, that even righteous men, such as Noah, Daniel, and Job, would only save their own souls, and not one of the sinners. And thus, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21-23</a>, will the Lord act when He sends His judgments against Jerusalem; and He will execute them in such a manner that the necessity and righteousness of His acts shall be made manifest therein. - This word of God forms a supplementary side-piece to <a href="/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a> -43, where the Lord replies to the intercession of the prophet, that even the intercession of a Moses and a Samuel on behalf of the people would not avert the judgments which were suspended over them.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-12.htm">Ezekiel 14:12-20</a><p><a href="/ezekiel/14-12.htm">Ezekiel 14:12</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/14-13.htm">Ezekiel 14:13</a>. Son of man, if a land sin against me to act treacherously, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break in pieces for it the support of bread, and send famine into it, and cut off from it man and beast: <a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a>. And there should be these three men therein, Noah, Daniel, and Job, they would through their righteousness deliver their soul, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. <a href="/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15</a>. If I bring evil beasts into the land, so that they make it childless, and it become a desert, so that no one passeth through it because of the beasts: <a href="/ezekiel/14-16.htm">Ezekiel 14:16</a>. These three men therein, as I live, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, would not deliver sons and daughters; they only would be delivered, but the land would become a desert. <a href="/ezekiel/14-17.htm">Ezekiel 14:17</a>. Or I bring the sword into that land, and say, Let the sword go through the land; and I cut off from it man and beast: <a href="/ezekiel/14-18.htm">Ezekiel 14:18</a>. These three men therein, as I live, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, would not deliver sons and daughters, but they only would be delivered. <a href="/ezekiel/14-19.htm">Ezekiel 14:19</a>. Or I send pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast: <a href="/ezekiel/14-20.htm">Ezekiel 14:20</a>. Verily, Noah, Daniel, and Job, in the midst of it, as I live, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would only deliver their own soul through their righteousness. - &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; in <a href="/ezekiel/14-13.htm">Ezekiel 14:13</a> is intentionally left indefinite, that the thought may be expressed in the most general manner. On the other hand, the sin is very plainly defined as &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, literally, to cover, signifies to act in a secret or treacherous manner, especially towards Jehovah, either by apostasy from Him, in other words, by idolatry, or by withholding what is due to Him (see comm. on <a href="/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>). In the passage before us it is the treachery of apostasy from Him by idolatry that is intended. As the epithet used to denote the sin is taken from <a href="/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>, so the four punishments mentioned in the following verses, as well as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a>, are also taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, - viz. the breaking up of the staff of bread, from v. 26; the evil beasts, from <a href="/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22</a>; and the sword and pestilence, from v. 25. The three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, are named as examples of true righteousness of life, or &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/14-20.htm">Ezekiel 14:20</a>); i.e., according to Calvin's correct explanation, quicquid pertinet ad regulam sancte et juste vivendi. Noah is so described in <a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>; and Job, in the Book of <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-4.htm">Job 12:4</a>, etc.; and Daniel, in like manner, is mentioned in <a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>., <a href="/ezekiel/6-11.htm">Ezekiel 6:11</a>., as faithfully confessing his faith in his life. The fact that Daniel is named before Job does not warrant the conjecture that some other older Daniel is meant, of whom nothing is said in the history, and whose existence is merely postulated. For the enumeration is not intended to be chronological, but is arranged according to the subject-matter; the order being determined by the nature of the deliverance experienced by these men for their righteousness in the midst of great judgments. Consequently, as Hvernick and Kliefoth have shown, we have a climax here: Noah saved his family along with himself; Daniel was able to save his friends (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-17.htm">Daniel 2:17-18</a>); but Job, with his righteousness, was not even able to save his children. - The second judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15</a>) is introduced with &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, which, as a rule, supposes a case that is not expected to occur, or even regarded as possible; here, however, &#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is used as perfectly synonymous with &#1488;&#1501;. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; has no Mappik, because the tone is drawn back upon the penultima (see comm. on <a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-19.htm">Ezekiel 14:19</a>, the expression "to pour out my wrath in blood" is a pregnant one, for to pour out my wrath in such a manner that it is manifested in the shedding of blood or the destruction of life, for the life is in the blood. In this sense pestilence and blood were also associated in <a href="/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a>.<p>If we look closely at the four cases enumerated, we find the following difference in the statements concerning the deliverance of the righteous: that, in the first instance, it is simply stated that Noah, Daniel, and Job would save their soul, i.e., their life, by their righteousness; whereas, in the three others, it is declared that as truly as the Lord liveth they would not save either sons or daughters, but they alone would be delivered. The difference is not merely a rhetorical climax or progress in the address by means of asseveration and antithesis, but indicates a distinction in the thought. The first case is only intended to teach that in the approaching judgment the righteous would save their lives, i.e., that God would not sweep away the righteous with the ungodly. The three cases which follow are intended, on the other hand, to exemplify the truth that the righteousness of the righteous will be of no avail to the idolaters and apostates; since even such patterns of righteousness as Noah, Daniel, and Job would only save their own lives, and would not be able to save the lives of others also. This tallies with the omission of the asseveration in <a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a>. The first declaration, that God would deliver the righteous in the coming judgments, needed no asseveration, inasmuch as this truth was not called in question; but it was required in the case of the declaration that the righteousness of the righteous would bring no deliverance to the sinful nation, since this was the hope which the ungodly cherished, and it was this hope which was to be taken from them. The other differences which we find in the description given of the several cases are merely formal in their nature, and do not in any way affect the sense; e.g., the use of &#1500;&#1488;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-18.htm">Ezekiel 14:18</a>, instead of the particle &#1488;&#1501;, which is commonly employed in oaths, and which we find in <a href="/ezekiel/14-16.htm">Ezekiel 14:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/14-20.htm">Ezekiel 14:20</a>; the choice of the singular been &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-20.htm">Ezekiel 14:20</a>, in the place of the plural &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, used in <a href="/ezekiel/14-16.htm">Ezekiel 14:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/14-18.htm">Ezekiel 14:18</a>; and the variation in the expressions, &#1497;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; (<a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a>), &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; (<a href="/ezekiel/14-20.htm">Ezekiel 14:20</a>), and &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/ezekiel/14-16.htm">Ezekiel 14:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/14-18.htm">Ezekiel 14:18</a>), which Hitzig proposes to remove by altering the first two forms into the third, though without the slightest reason. For although the Piel occurs in <a href="/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a> in the sense of taking away or spoiling, and is not met with anywhere else in the sense of delivering, it may just as well be used in this sense, as the Hiphil has both significations.</body></html>
