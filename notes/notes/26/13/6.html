It may be that in this case the prophets and prophetesses were untrue to their own convictions, and wilfully declared what they knew to be false; or it may be that they simply uttered as God’s message that which they had persuaded themselves would be the issue. This point is not entirely clear from the passage, and is of secondary importance. What deserves to be carefully noted is the difference here made between subjective views of truth—that which conies “out of their own heart”—and those objective communications which God gave to His true prophets. This distinction has a most important bearing upon the whole subject of revelation, and establishes clearly the fact that the Scriptures look upon it as something expressly communicated to their writers, and not as a thing which could be the result of their own thought and reflection. He, therefore, who puts “Thus saith the Lord” before that which God has not in some objective way made known <span class= "ital">to</span> him, must fall under the condemnation pronounced here and elsewhere upon “the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak” (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm" title="But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ezekiel/13-6.htm" title="They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD said: and the LORD has not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word....">Ezekiel 13:6-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">They have seen vanity and lying divinations — </span>They have uttered false prophecies concerning peace and prosperity, pretending to have seen that which they did not see, and producing that as a divine truth which they knew to be a detestable lie. <span class="ital">They have made others — </span>Who were so simple as to believe them; <span class="ital">to hope that they would confirm the word — </span>Or rather, <span class="ital">that the word would be confirmed. </span>Their speaking with so much assurance made others confidently expect that the event would answer their predictions, and that the judgments which the true prophets had threatened in the name of God would never come, whereby they hardened those in sin whom they ought to have endeavoured to bring to repentance. <span class="ital">Therefore, because ye have spoken vanity — </span>Have uttered mere fictions and lies, with a view to your own advantage. <span class="ital">Behold, I am against you, saith the Lord God — </span>And who can be for you when I am against you? <span class="ital">And my hand shall be upon the prophets — </span>My power striking them so, that it shall be evident they fall under my displeasure; as Pelatiah, <a href="/ezekiel/11-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died.

Prophecy being an inward thing, a speaking by the spirit in the mind and to the mind, there was no external criterion, and while the true prophet had the witness in himself that he was true, the false prophet might not be aware that he was false (<a href="/jeremiah/23-21.htm" title="I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.">Jeremiah 23:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-31.htm" title="Behold, I am against the prophets, said the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He said.">Jeremiah 23:31</a>).

Some altogether denied that the prophecies would ever be fulfilled (<a href="/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>); others, who did not go so far as this, thought that it would be a long time before they came to pass (<a href="/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>). These doubts were fed by the lying statements of false prophets. For this reason the refutation of these sceptical opinions (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-21.htm">Ezekiel 12:21-28</a>) is followed in the next chapter by a stern reproof of the false prophets and prophetesses who led the people astray. - <a href="/ezekiel/12-21.htm">Ezekiel 12:21</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>. Son of man, what kind of proverb have ye in the land of Israel, that ye say, The days become long, and every prophecy comes to nothing? <a href="/ezekiel/12-23.htm">Ezekiel 12:23</a>. Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will put an end to this saying, and they shall say it no more in Israel; but say to them, The days are near, and the word of every prophecy. <a href="/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a>. For henceforth there shall be no vain prophecy and flattering soothsaying in the midst of the house of Israel. <a href="/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>. For I am Jehovah; I speak; the word which I speak will come to pass, and no longer be postponed; for in your days, O refractory generation, I speak a word and do it, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. -  Ma&#770;sha&#770;l, a proverb, saying current among the people, and constantly repeated as a truth. "The days become long," etc., i.e., the time is lengthening out, and yet the prophecy is not being fulfilled. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, perire, to come to nothing, to fail of fulfilment, is the opposite of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, to come, to be fulfilled. God will put an end to these sayings, by causing a very speedy fulfilment of the prophecy. The days are near, and every word of the prophecy, i.e., the days in which every word predicted shall come to pass. The reason for this is given in <a href="/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>, in two co-ordinate sentences, both of which are introduced with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. First, every false prophecy shall henceforth cease in Israel (<a href="/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a>); secondly, God will bring about the fulfilment of His own word, and that without delay (<a href="/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>). Different explanations have been given of the meaning of <a href="/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a>. Kliefoth proposes to take &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1505;&#1501; as the predicate to &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;: no prophecy in Israel shall be vain and flattering soothsaying, but all prophecy shall become true, i.e., be fulfilled. Such an explanation, however, is not only artificial and unnatural, since &#1502;&#1511;&#1505;&#1501; would be inserted as a predicate in a most unsuitable manner, but it contains this incongruity, that God would apply the term &#1502;&#1511;&#1505;&#1501;, soothsaying, to the predictions of prophets inspired by Himself. On the other hand, there is no force in the objection raised by Kliefoth to the ordinary rendering of the words, namely, that the statement that God was about to put an end to false prophecy in Israel would anticipate the substance of the sixth word of God (i.e., <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/13.htm">Ezekiel 13</a>). It is impossible to see why a thought should not be expressed here, and then still further expanded in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/13.htm">Ezekiel 13</a>. &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;, smooth, i.e., flattering (compare <a href="/hosea/10-2.htm">Hosea 10:2</a>; and for the prediction, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4-5</a>). The same reply serves also to overthrow the sceptical objection raised by the frivolous despisers of the prophet's words. Hence there is only a brief allusion made to them in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-26.htm">Ezekiel 12:26-28</a>. - <a href="/ezekiel/12-26.htm">Ezekiel 12:26</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>. Son of man, behold, the house of Israel saith, The vision that he seeth is for many days off, and he prophesies for distant times. <a href="/ezekiel/12-28.htm">Ezekiel 12:28</a>. Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, All my words shall be no longer postponed: the word which I shall speak shall come to pass, saith the Lord Jehovah. - The words are plain; and after what has already been said, they need no special explanation. <a href="/ezekiel/12-20.htm">Ezekiel 12:20</a> compare with <a href="/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>. </body></html>
