In a time of siege when there are gaps or breaches in the walls, it is the part of the leaders to go up to defend them, and to throw up works to stop the in-road of the enemy. Yahweh is now assailing His people as an enemy (compare <a href="/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-11.htm">Job 16:11-13</a>), and where are those who claim to be prophets, leaders of the people? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. not gone up into &#8230; gaps&#8212;metaphor from breaches made in a wall, to which the defenders ought to betake themselves in order to repel the entrance of the foe. The breach is that made in the theocracy through the nation's sin; and, unless it be made up, the vengeance of God will break in through it. Those who would advise the people to repentance are the restorers of the breach (Eze 22:30; Ps 106:23, 30).<p>hedge&#8212;the law of God (Ps 80:12; Isa 5:2, 5); by violating it, the people stripped themselves of the fence of God's protection and lay exposed to the foe. The false prophets did not try to repair the evil by bringing back the people to the law with good counsels, or by checking the bad with reproofs. These two duties answer to the double office of defenders in case of a breach made in a wall: (1) To repair the breach from within; (2) To oppose the foe from without.<p>to stand&#8212;that is, that the city may "stand."<p>in &#8230; day of &#8230; Lord&#8212;In the day of the battle which God wages against Israel for their sins, ye do not try to stay God's vengeance by prayers, and by leading the nation to repentance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Ye, vulpine prophets. As in a besieged city whose wall is broken down and the enemy ready to enter, a valiant, faithful, and vigilant soldier would run up into the breach to repel the enemy; so true prophets do partly by prayer, and partly by doctrine, and partly by personal reformation, labour to preserve God’s people. But, fox-like, they have shifted out of harm’s way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither made up the hedge:</span> the house of Israel is the Lord’s vineyard, through the hedge whereof many breaches are made, through which wild and wasting beasts come in and devour the grapes, and spoil the vines; but you have not stopped those breaches, but, fox-like, come in and pulled off the tender grapes, and done the most mischief; you have increased sin and danger thereby.

Or "breaches" (d); so the Targum. The allusion is to breaches made in the walls of a city when besieged; at which time those within gather together in great numbers to meet the enemy, and prevent his entrance by the breaches. These words are either spoken to the princes of Israel, the civil magistrates; or to the prophets, who seeing the sins of the people, like a mighty torrent, opening a breach for the wrath and judgments of God to pour in upon them, should have called them, and importunately pressed them to repentance and reformation, and to have put up their prayers, and made intercession to God for them; neither of which they did, and therefore are here blamed; see <a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>; <p>neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel; or a "fence", a fortification. The Vulgate Latin renders it, "a wall"; a new wall, which is generally made by the besieged within, when a breach is made upon them: it signifies the same as before. Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it of repentance and good works; and so the Targum, which paraphrases the words thus, <p>"neither have ye done for yourselves good works, to deprecate for the house of Israel, to stand to pray for them:'' <p>to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord: when he came forth in battle array against them, with great wrath and indignation, in the way of his righteous judgments.

If they had been true prophets they would have done two things: stood in the breach, and made a wall of defence for Israel. Without figure: these prophets knew neither what measures to adopt to stop the way of the invading dangers, nor what protective methods to recommend that the state might be successfully defended. They are hardly charged with want of personal courage when it is said they go not up into the breach; rather they wanted wisdom and insight, they had no measures to suggest which would repair or protect the fortunes of the people. Another prophet with more pathos describes the incompetence of Israel’s leaders in the day of her distress: “there was none to guide her among all the sons which she had brought forth; neither was there any to take her by the hand of all the sons that she had brought up” (<a href="/isaiah/51-18.htm" title="There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth; neither is there any that takes her by the hand of all the sons that she has brought up.">Isaiah 51:18</a>). No doubt the one measure to adopt was repentance and trust in the Lord; <a href="/amos/5-14.htm" title="Seek good, and not evil, that you may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as you have spoken.">Amos 5:14</a>, “Seek good, and not evil … and so the Lord, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye say.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The verse contains two distinct images.

The hedge of the vineyard of Israel had been broken through (<a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>), and they had done nothing to restore it (<a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>).
