Or thus, O Israel, thou art like the desert, spoiled and robbed, and thy false prophets, like foxes hungry and hunting for some prey, live upon what they can catch, but will be no more profitable to thee than foxes are to the wilderness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes of the deserts. The false prophets, as the Targum; these are called Israel's prophets, because received, embraced, and encouraged by them; not the Lord's, for they were not sent by him, nor had any messages from him; and such are comparable to foxes, for their craftiness and cunning, and lying in wait to deceive, as these seduced the Lord's people, <a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>; and such are false teachers, who walk in craftiness, and handle the word of God deceitfully, and are deceitful workers; and to foxes in the deserts, which are hungry and ravenous, and make a prey of whatsoever comes within their reach, as these prophets did of the people, <a href="/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>. Kimchi interprets "deserts" of breaches and ruinous places in the walls of a vineyard, where the foxes lie, or through which they enter into the vineyard and spoil it; as these false prophets entered in among the Israelites, like to a vineyard, and did them much hurt and damage, by insinuating themselves among the weak, and those of little faith, which the above writer compares to breaches in vineyards; see Sol 2:15. It may be the deserts may have respect to the land of Chaldea, where Israel was carried captive, and where these foxes, the false prophets, could play their part to advantage; not being under the notice and restraints of the sanhedrim at Jerusalem. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> in the deserts.</span><p>(b) Watching to destroy the vineyard.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">foxes in the deserts</span>] in <span class="bld">the waste places</span>, i.e. ruins. The prophets are like foxes; ruins are congenial to them; a condition of decay is their proper sphere; there they can burrow as their instincts prompt them. The main idea, however, is that their operations only increase the devastation and undermine and bring down anything that may yet be standing. In a declining and disastrous time the minds of men are excited and feed on the wildest schemes, and feeling themselves helpless they readily turn to those who pretend to speak to them in God’s name. And it only adds to their ruin when those to whom they turn have no higher wisdom than themselves.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like the foxes in the deserts<span class="accented">,</span> etc.</span> The points of comparison are manifold. The fox is cunning (<a href="/luke/13-32.htm">Luke 13:32</a>, where the term is applied to Herod Antipas). It spoils the vine and its fruits (<a href="/songs/2-15.htm">Song of Solomon 2:15</a>); it burrows among ruins (<a href="/nehemiah/4-3.htm">Nehemiah 4:3</a>; <a href="/lamentations/5-18.htm">Lamentations 5:18</a>). So the false prophets were crafty, laid waste the vineyard of the Lord of hosts (<a href="/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>), made their profit out of the ruin of Israel, and made that ruin worse. The 'Reineke Fuchs,' in satirizing the monks and priests of the sixteenth century under the same comparison, presents a curious, though probably unconscious,  analogue. In <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a> and <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a> wolves appear as the types of the false prophet. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Sign Depicting the Terrors and Consequences of the Conquest of Jerusalem<p><a href="/ezekiel/12-17.htm">Ezekiel 12:17</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/12-18.htm">Ezekiel 12:18</a>. Son of man, thou shalt eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and trouble; <a href="/ezekiel/12-19.htm">Ezekiel 12:19</a>.

And the inhabited cities become desolate, and the land will be laid waste; that ye may learn that I am Jehovah. - The carrying out of this sign is not mentioned; not that there is any doubt as to its having been done, but that it is simply taken for granted. The trouble and trembling could only be expressed by means of gesture. &#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, generally an earthquake or violent convulsion; here, simply shaking, synonymous with &#1512;&#1490;&#1494;&#1492;, trembling. "Bread and water" is the standing expression for food; so that even here the idea of scanty provisions is not to be sought therein. This idea is found merely in the signs of anxiety and trouble with which Ezekiel was to eat his food. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;  equals  '&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;, "upon the land," equivalent to "in the land." This is appended to show that the prophecy does not refer to those who had already been carried into exile, but to the inhabitants of Jerusalem who were still in the land. For the subject-matter, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16-17</a>. &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; indicates not the intention, "in order that," but the motive, "because." </body></html>
