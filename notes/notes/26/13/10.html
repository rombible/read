One of the false prophets would build a wall, set up of his own device—some vision as a defence against the warnings of calamity; and his fellows would join in his deceit by covering this wall “with untempered mortar.” The word is not the usual one for plaster, and indeed is used in this sense only in these verses and in <a href="/ezekiel/22-28.htm" title="And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar, seeing vanity, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus said the Lord GOD, when the LORD has not spoken.">Ezekiel 22:28</a>.

Calvin understands it of mortar mixed with sand and water only, the lime being left out. It is still a common practice in the East, as it has always been, to cover over their walls with stucco. In this case the other false prophets are represented as joining with the one who built the wall by covering over its weaknesses and defects with a fair-seeming plaster. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like to white washed sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.">Matthew 23:27</a>; <a href="/acts/23-3.htm" title="Then said Paul to him, God shall smite you, you white washed wall: for sit you to judge me after the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?">Acts 23:3</a>.)

Thus they obstructed and drew them out of the way of that repentance and reformation into which the other prophets were endeavouring to bring them. And, observe, reader, those are the most dangerous seducers who suggest to sinners that which tends to lessen their dread of sin, or their fear of God.

Who were so by profession; otherwise such who are truly the people of God, though they may be deceived in civil things, yet not in religious matters, at least not totally and finally; in this sense it is impossible to deceive the elect of God; but as false teachers are deceivers, they lie in wait, and use all means to deceive them, and do deceive nominal professors, which is resented by the Lord; and this is given as a reason of their punishment; and which is doubled, as in <a href="/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a>; to show the heinousness of their sin, and the certainty of their punishment: <p>saying, peace, and there was no peace; giving out that peace would be made with the king of Babylon; that the captives would return to their own land, where, with those that were in it, they would enjoy great prosperity; when no such thing came to pass, nor would; but the contrary was certain, by the predictions of the true prophets sent by the Lord: <p>and one built up a wall; one of the false prophets, and of the chief of them, gave out that Jerusalem would continue a walled city, and abide firm and impregnable against the Chaldean army, and would never be taken: <p>and, lo, others daubed it with untempered mortar; others of the false prophets, observing that what the first had delivered out was pleasing to the people, not only assented to it, but strongly affirmed it; and, with colourings and specious arguments, made it look more plausible and probable; when, alas! the whole was no other than like putting a parcel of loose stones or bricks together, and throwing some slushy stuff upon them, as, moistened sand without lime, or clay without straw, as the Targum and Vulgate Latin versions render it; which would never cement the bricks or stones together. R. Joseph Kimchi interprets it of bricks not burnt: so false teachers imitate the true ministers of the word, in preaching peace; but then they do not direct aright where it is to be had, which is only in Christ; or the proper persons, sinners pressed with the guilt of sin, and seeking for ease and peace in a right way; but publish it to those to whom it does not belong, for there is no peace to the wicked; and put them upon making peace themselves by their own works of righteousness, and their legal repentance, and outward humiliation; or promise it to them, though they have no faith in Christ, and are not sensible of their sin and danger: these men are builders, but not wise master builders; they do not build upon the foundation Christ, but build up a wall without him; leaving him out of the building who is the chief corner stone; deliver out some loose and unconnected doctrines, that are not according to the Scriptures, nor consistent with each other; and encourage the people to perform some loose duties and cold services, without the cement of faith and love; and which is no other than building upon the sand, or with it; though they fancy it to be a wall, a shelter, and protection to them, from the wrath and justice of God, and by which they shall climb up to heaven; which will prove a bowing wall, and a tottering fence; and in these mistakes they are buoyed up by false teachers, and are flattered as being in a fair way for eternal happiness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> Peace; and <i>there was</i> no peace; and one built up a <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered <i>mortar</i>:</span><p>(f) Read Geneva Jer 6:14<p>(g) While the true prophets prophesied the destruction of the city to bring the people to repentance, the false prophets spoke the contrary, and flattered them in their vanities, so that what one false prophet said<p>(which is here called the building of the wall) another false prophet would affirm, though he had neither opportunity nor good ground to hear him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10–16</span>.

When a weak man cannot originate anything himself, he acquires a certain credit (at least in his own eyes) by strong approval of the schemes of others, saying, Right! I give it my cordial approval, and indeed would have suggested it. What made the prophets whitewash the wall which the people built was partly the feeling that from the place they occupied they must do something, and maintain their credit as leaders even when being led; and partly perhaps that having no higher wisdom than the mass they quite honestly approved their policy.

For henceforth there shall be no vain prophecy and flattering soothsaying in the midst of the house of Israel. <a href="/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>. For I am Jehovah; I speak; the word which I speak will come to pass, and no longer be postponed; for in your days, O refractory generation, I speak a word and do it, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. -  Ma&#770;sha&#770;l, a proverb, saying current among the people, and constantly repeated as a truth. "The days become long," etc., i.e., the time is lengthening out, and yet the prophecy is not being fulfilled. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, perire, to come to nothing, to fail of fulfilment, is the opposite of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, to come, to be fulfilled. God will put an end to these sayings, by causing a very speedy fulfilment of the prophecy. The days are near, and every word of the prophecy, i.e., the days in which every word predicted shall come to pass. The reason for this is given in <a href="/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>, in two co-ordinate sentences, both of which are introduced with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. First, every false prophecy shall henceforth cease in Israel (<a href="/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a>); secondly, God will bring about the fulfilment of His own word, and that without delay (<a href="/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>). Different explanations have been given of the meaning of <a href="/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a>. Kliefoth proposes to take &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1505;&#1501; as the predicate to &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;: no prophecy in Israel shall be vain and flattering soothsaying, but all prophecy shall become true, i.e., be fulfilled. Such an explanation, however, is not only artificial and unnatural, since &#1502;&#1511;&#1505;&#1501; would be inserted as a predicate in a most unsuitable manner, but it contains this incongruity, that God would apply the term &#1502;&#1511;&#1505;&#1501;, soothsaying, to the predictions of prophets inspired by Himself. On the other hand, there is no force in the objection raised by Kliefoth to the ordinary rendering of the words, namely, that the statement that God was about to put an end to false prophecy in Israel would anticipate the substance of the sixth word of God (i.e., <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/13.htm">Ezekiel 13</a>). It is impossible to see why a thought should not be expressed here, and then still further expanded in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/13.htm">Ezekiel 13</a>. &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;, smooth, i.e., flattering (compare <a href="/hosea/10-2.htm">Hosea 10:2</a>; and for the prediction, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4-5</a>). The same reply serves also to overthrow the sceptical objection raised by the frivolous despisers of the prophet's words. Hence there is only a brief allusion made to them in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-26.htm">Ezekiel 12:26-28</a>. - <a href="/ezekiel/12-26.htm">Ezekiel 12:26</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>. Son of man, behold, the house of Israel saith, The vision that he seeth is for many days off, and he prophesies for distant times. <a href="/ezekiel/12-28.htm">Ezekiel 12:28</a>. Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, All my words shall be no longer postponed: the word which I shall speak shall come to pass, saith the Lord Jehovah. - The words are plain; and after what has already been said, they need no special explanation. <a href="/ezekiel/12-20.htm">Ezekiel 12:20</a> compare with <a href="/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>. </body></html>
