And I demolish the wall which ye have plastered, and cast it to the ground, that its foundation may be exposed, and it shall fall, and ye shall perish in the midst of it; and shall learn that I am Jehovah. <a href="/ezekiel/13-15.htm">Ezekiel 13:15</a>. And I will exhaust my wrath upon the wall, and upon those who plaster it; and will say to you, It is all over with the wall, and all over with those who plastered it; <a href="/ezekiel/13-16.htm">Ezekiel 13:16</a>. With the prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem, and saw visions of peace for her, though there is no peace, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - In <a href="/ezekiel/13-8.htm">Ezekiel 13:8</a> the punishment which is to fall upon the false prophets is threatened in general terms; and in <a href="/ezekiel/13-9.htm">Ezekiel 13:9</a> it is more specifically described in the form of a climax, rising higher and higher in the severity of its announcements. (1) They are no longer to form part of the council of the people of God; that is to say, they will lose their influential position among the people. (&#1505;&#1493;&#1491; is the sphere of counsellors, not the social sphere.) (2) Their names shall not be registered in the book of the house of Israel. The book of the house of Israel is the register in which the citizens of the kingdom of God are entered. Any one whose name was not admitted into this book, or was struck out of it, was separated thereby from the citizenship of Israel, and lost all the privileges which citizenship conferred. The figure of the book of life is a similar one (cf. <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>). For Israel is not referred to here with regard to its outward nationality, but as the people of God; so that exclusion from Israel was also exclusion from fellowship with God. The circumstance that it is not the erasure of their names from the book that is mentioned here, but their not being entered in the book at all, may be accounted for from the reference contained in the words to the founding of the new kingdom of God. The old theocracy was abolished, although Jerusalem was not yet destroyed. The covenant nation had fallen under the judgment; but out of that portion of Israel which was dispersed among the heathen, a remnant would be gathered together again, and having been brought back to its own land, would be made anew into a holy people of God (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>.). But the false prophets are not to be received into the citizenship of the new kingdom. (3) They are not even to come into the land of Israel; i.e., they are not merely to remain in exile, but to lose all share in the privileges and blessings of the kingdom of God. This judgment will come upon them because they lead astray the people of God, by proclaiming peace where there is no peace; i.e., by raising and cherishing false hopes of prosperity and peace, by which they encourage the people in their sinful lives, and lead them to imagine that all is well, and there is no judgment to be feared (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a> and <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>). The exposure of this offence is introduced by the solemn &#1497;&#1506;&#1503; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1506;&#1503;, because and because (cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a>); and the offence itself is exhibited by means of a figure.<p>When the people build a wall, the false prophets plaster the wall with lime. &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; (<a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>) refers to &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, and the clause is a circumstantial one. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500; signifies the plaster coating or cement of a wall, probably from the primary meaning of &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;, to stick or plaster over ( equals  &#1496;&#1508;&#1500;, conglutinare, to glue, or fasten together), from which the secondary meaning of weak, insipid, has sprung. The proper word for plaster or cement is &#1496;&#1497;&#1495; (<a href="/ezekiel/13-12.htm">Ezekiel 13:12</a>), and &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500; is probably chosen with an allusion to the tropical signification of that which is silly or absurd (<a href="/jeremiah/23-13.htm">Jeremiah 23:13</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14</a>). The meaning of the figure is intelligible enough. The people build up foolish hopes, and the prophets not only paint these hopes for them in splendid colours, but even predict their fulfilment, instead of denouncing their folly, pointing out to the people the perversity of their ways, and showing them that such sinful conduct must inevitably be followed by punishment and ruin. The plastering is therefore a figurative description of deceitful flattery or hypocrisy, i.e., the covering up of inward corruption by means of outward appearance (as in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a> and <a href="/acts/23-3.htm">Acts 23:3</a>). This figure leads the prophet to describe the judgment which they are bringing upon the nation and themselves, as a tempest accompanied with hail and pouring rain, which throws down the wall that has been erected and plastered over; and in connection with this figure he opens out this double thought: (1) the conduct of the people, which is encouraged by the false prophets, cannot last (<a href="/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/13-12.htm">Ezekiel 13:12</a>); and (2) when this work of theirs is overthrown, the false prophets themselves will also meet with the fate they deserve (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-13.htm">Ezekiel 13:13-16</a>). The threat of judgment commences with the short, energetic &#1493;&#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;, let it (the wall) fall, or it shall fall, with Vav to indicate the train of thought (Ewald, 347a). The subject is &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;, to which &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; suggests a resemblance in sound. In <a href="/ezekiel/13-12.htm">Ezekiel 13:12</a> this is predicted as the fate awaiting the plastered wall. In the description of the bursting storm the account passes with &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; (and ye) into a direct address; in other words, the description assumes the form of an appeal to the destructive forces of nature to burst forth with all their violence against the work plastered over by the prophets, and to destroy it. &#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496;&#1507; ., pouring rain; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>. &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; here and <a href="/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a> are hailstones. The word &#1488;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which is peculiar to Ezekiel, is probably &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>), with the Arabic article &#1488;&#1500;; ice, then crystal. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; , wind of storms, a hurricane or tempest. &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506; (<a href="/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>) is used intransitively, to break loose; but in <a href="/ezekiel/13-13.htm">Ezekiel 13:13</a> it is transitive, to cause to break loose. The active rendering adopted by Kliefoth, "the storm will rend," sc. the plaster of the wall, is inappropriate in <a href="/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>; for a tempest does not rend either the plaster or the wall, but throws the wall down. The translation which Kliefoth gives in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-13.htm">Ezekiel 13:13</a>, "I will rend by tempest," is at variance with both the language and the sense. Jehovah will cause this tempest to burst forth in His wrath and destroy the wall, and lay it level with the ground. The suffix in &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1492;&#1468; refers (ad sensum) to Jerusalem not to &#1511;&#1497;&#1512; (the wall), which is masculine, and has no &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1498; (midst). The words pass from the figure to the reality here; for the plastered wall is a symbol of Jerusalem, as the centre of the theocracy, which is to be destroyed, and to bury the lying prophets in its ruins. &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; (<a href="/ezekiel/13-15.htm">Ezekiel 13:15</a>) contains a play upon the word &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492; in <a href="/ezekiel/13-13.htm">Ezekiel 13:13</a>. By a new turn given to klh &#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, Ezekiel repeats the thought that the wrath of God is to destroy the wall and its plasterers; and through this repetition he rounds off the threat with the express declaration, that the false prophets who are ever preaching peace are the plasterers to whom he refers. </body></html>
