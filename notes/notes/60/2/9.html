All the most splendid titles of the old Israel belong in a fuller sense to these Hebrews who have joined the new Israel. In <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a> they are bidden to aim at being what here they are said to be. (Comp. <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A chosen generation.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">a chosen, </span>or <span class= "ital">elect race.</span> As originally the clan of Abraham was selected from among “all the families of the earth” (<a href="/amos/3-2.htm" title="You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.">Amos 3:2</a>), so out of the clan of Abraham after the flesh were these men selected to be a new clan, or race. They are not merely individuals selected one by one and left in isolation, but a tribe consolidated, only the bond henceforth is not merely one of common physical descent.<p><span class= "bld">A royal priesthood, an holy nation.</span>—These words are a direct quotation from <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a>, according to the LXX. version. The Hebrew has “a kingdom of priests,” as in <a href="/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a> (according to the best reading); which would mean, God’s organised empire, every member of which is a priest. Nor is the thought far different here. The word “royal” does not seem intended to imply that every Christian is a king, or of royal birth (though that, of course, may be shown from elsewhere), but describes his <span class= "ital">belonging</span> to the King as we might speak of the royal apartments, the royal borough, the royal establishment, or even of the royal servants. The substitution, therefore, of “royal priesthood” for “kingdom of priests” brings out more clearly the personal relation to the Personal King. But if the writer had said” royal priests,” the notion of organisation would have slipped out of sight altogether. By way of compensation, therefore, it is restored in the substitution of “priesthood” (see Note on <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>) instead of “priests.” This, and the next phrase, “an holy (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, consecrated) nation,” describe the whole Israelite nation as they stood beneath Mount Sinai. This must be taken into consideration in dealing with the doctrine of the Christian ministry. The sacerdotal office was as common to all Israelites under the Law as it is to all the new Israel under the Gospel.<p><span class= "bld">A peculiar people.</span>—This curious phrase is literally, <span class= "ital">a people for a special reservation.</span> It is, no doubt, intended to represent <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a>, though it differs both from the Greek and the Hebrew, the variation being due to a recollection of the Greek of two other passages of the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/43-21.htm" title="This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.">Isaiah 43:21</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm" title="And they shall be mine, said the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.">Malachi 3:17</a>). The word rendered “peculiar” means properly “making over and above,” and would be represented in Latin by the word <span class= "ital">peculium, </span>which means a man’s private pocket-money, as, for instance, the money a slave could make by working over hours, or such as a wife might have apart from her husband. When children speak of a thing being their “very own” it exactly expresses what we have here. From this sense of “making over and above,” by working out of hours, the word comes in other places to mean “earning by hard work,” in such a way as to establish peculiar rights of property over the thing earned. So in <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, where St. Paul is probably thinking of the passage of Isaiah above referred to, both the hard earning and the special possession are intended: “the Church of God, which He won so hard for His very own, by His own blood.” Here, perhaps, the thought of “earning” is less obvious, and it means “a people to be His very own.” Comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1Thessalonians 5:9</a>, and <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>, where (according to Dr. Lightfoot) it means “for a redemption which consists of taking possession of us for His own.”<p><span class= "bld">That ye should shew forth the praises.</span>—This is an adaptation, though not exactly according to the LXX., of <a href="/isaiah/43-21.htm" title="This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.">Isaiah 43:21</a>, which passage is brought to St. Peter’s mind by the word rendered “peculiar.” The word “praises” is put here in accordance with the English version there. The Greek means “virtues,” or “powers,” or “excellencies,” a rare word in the New Testament (see <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2Peter 1:3</a>). And the word for “shew forth,” which is nowhere else found in the New Testament, means by rights “to proclaim to those without what has taken place within.” This strict signification is very suitable here. St. Peter says that God has taken us for a people peculiarly near to Him, and the purpose is, not that we may stand within His courts and praise Him, but that we may carry to others the tidings of what we have been admitted to see. This was the true function of the old Israel, “Do My <span class= "ital">prophets</span> no harm” (<a href="/psalms/105-15.htm" title="Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.">Psalm 105:15</a>). They were not elect for their own sake, but to act as God’s exponents to the world. This function they abdicated by their selfish exclusiveness, and it has descended to the new Israel. St. Peter and St. Paul are at one.<p><span class= "bld">Of him who hath called you out of darkness.</span>—This is to be understood of the Father, not of Christ. For one thing, the act of calling is almost always ascribed in the New Testament to God Himself; and for another thing, it is probable that St. Peter regards our Lord as Head of this “people of God,” just as He is corner-stone of the Temple, and High Priest of the hierarchy. The act of calling (literally it is, <span class= "ital">‘who called, </span>not “who <span class= "ital">hath</span> called”) was that of sending the preachers of the gospel to them, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>St. Paul and his followers (comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1Peter 1:25</a>). Here again, then, we have St. Peter speaking in praise of St. Paul’s mission, and, indeed, speaking in the same tones of unbounded admiration: “His marvellous light.” But could Hebrew Christians be said to have gone through so great a change in becoming believers? Had they been in “darkness?” We may answer that St. Peter’s use of the word “marvellous” is no affectation of sympathy. He himself found the change to be what he here describes, therefore there is no difficulty in supposing that other Hebrews should have found it so too. Besides which, the state of the Jews immediately before Christ and without Him is often described as “darkness.” (See <a href="/matthew/4-16.htm" title="The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.">Matthew 4:16</a>; <a href="/luke/1-79.htm" title="To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.">Luke 1:79</a>.) This very passage is quoted a few years later by St. Clement of Rome (chap. 36), as applying to himself among others, and Dr. Lightfoot has clearly established that St. Clement was a Jew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/1_peter/2.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>1 Peter<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">MIRRORS OF GOD</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1 Peter 2:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Revised Version, instead of ‘praises,’ reads excellencies--and even that is but a feeble translation of the remarkable word here employed. For it is that usually rendered ‘virtues’; and by the word, of course, when applied to God, we mean the radiant excellencies and glories of His character, of which our earthly qualities, designated by the same name, are but as shadows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is, indeed, true that this same expression is employed in the Greek version of the Old Testament in Isaiah 43. in a verse which evidently was floating before Peter’s mind. ‘This people have I formed for Myself; they shall show forth My praise.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But even while that is admitted, it is to be observed that the expression here does not merely mean that the audible praise of God should be upon the lips of Christian people, but that their whole lives should, in a far deeper sense than that, be the manifestation of what the Apostle here calls ‘excellencies of God.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Here we get a wonderful glimpse into the heart of God.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Note the preceding words, in which the writer describes all God’s mercies to His people, making them ‘a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation’; a people ‘His own possession.’ All that is done for one specific purpose--’that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness.’ That is to say, the very aim of all God’s gracious manifestations of Himself is that the men who apprehend them should go forth into the world and show Him for what He is.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now that aim may be, and often has been, put so as to present an utterly hard and horrible notion. That God’s glory is His only motive may be so stated as to mean nearly an Almighty Selfishness, which is far liker the devil than God. People in old days did not always recognise the danger that lay in such a representation of what we call God’s motive for action. But if you think for a moment about this statement, all that appears hard and repellent drops clean away from it, and it turns out to be another way of saying, ‘God is Love.’ Because, what is there more characteristic of love than an earnest desire to communicate itself and to be manifested and beheld? And what is it that God reveals to the world for His own glory but the loftiest and most wondrous compassion, that cannot be wearied out, that cannot be provoked, and the most forgiving Omnipotence, that, in answer to all men’s wanderings and rebellions, only seeks to draw them to itself? That is what God wants to be known for. Is that hard and repellent? Does that make Him a great tyrant, who only wants to be abjectly worshipped? No; it makes Him the very embodiment and perfection of the purest love. Why does He desire that He should be known? for any good that it does to Him? No; except the good that even His creatures can do to Him when they gladden His paternal heart by recognising Him for what He is, the Infinite Lover of all souls.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the reason why He desires, most of all, that the light of His character may pour into every heart is because He would have every heart gladdened and blessed for ever by that received and believed light. So the hard saying that God’s own glory is His supreme end melts into ‘God is Love.’ The Infinite desires to communicate Himself, that by the communication men may be blessed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. There is another thing here, and that is, a wonderful glimpse of what Christian people are in the world for.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘This people have I formed for Myself,’ says the fundamental passage in Isaiah already referred to, ‘they shall show forth My praise.’ It was not worth while forming them except for that. It was still less worth while redeeming them except for that.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But you may say, ‘I am saved in order that I may enjoy all the blessings of salvation, immunities from fear and punishment, and the like.’ Yes! Certainly! But is that all? Or is it the main thing? I think not. There is not a creature in God’s universe so tiny, even although you cannot see it with a microscope, but that it has a claim on Him that made it for its well-being. That is very certain. And so my salvation--with all the blessedness for me that lies wrapped up and hived in that great word--my salvation is an adequate end with God, in all His dealing, and especially in His sending of Jesus Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But there is not a creature in the whole universe, though he were mightier than the archangels that stand nearest God’s throne, who is so great and independent that his happiness and well-being is the sole aim of God’s gifts to him. For every one of us the Apostle means the word, ‘No man liveth to himself’--he could not if he were to try--’and no man dieth to himself.’ Every man that receives anything from God is thereby made a steward to impart it to others. So we may say--and I speak now to you who profess to be Christians--’you were not saved for your own sakes.’ One might almost say that that was a by-end. You were saved--shall I say?--for God’s sake; and you were saved for man’s sake? Just as when you put a bit of leaven into a lump of dough, each grain of the lump, as it is leavened and transformed, becomes the medium for passing on the mysterious transforming influence to the particle beyond, so every one of us, if we have been brought out of darkness into marvellous light, have been so brought, not only that we may recreate and bathe our own eyes in the flooding sunshine, but that we may turn to our brothers and ask them to come too out of the doleful night into the cheerful, gladsome day. Every man that Jesus Christ conquers on the field He sends behind Him, and says, ‘Take rank in My army. Be My soldier.’ Every yard of line in a new railway when laid down is used to carry materials to make the next yard; and so the terminus is reached. Even so, Christian people were formed for Christ that they might show forth His praise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Look what a notion that gives us of the dignity of the Christian life, and of the special manifestation of God which is afforded to the world in it. You, if you love as you ought to do, are a witness of something far nobler in God than all the stars in the sky. You, if you set forth as becomes you His glorious character, have crowned the whole manifestation that He makes of Himself in Nature and in Providence. What people learn about God from a true Christian is a better revelation than has ever been made or can be made elsewhere. So the Bible talks about principalities and powers in heavenly places who have had nobody knows how many millenniums of intercourse with God, nobody knows how deep and intimate, learning from Christian people the manifold wisdom which had folds and folds in it that they had never unfolded and never could have done. ‘Ye are My witnesses,’ saith the Lord. Sun and stars tell of power, wisdom, and a whole host of majestic attributes. We are witnesses that ‘He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might He increaseth strength.’ Who was it that said<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital"> ‘‘Twas great to speak a world from naught,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Tis greater to redeem?’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Ye are saved that ye may show forth the praise of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvellous light.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Lastly, we have here a piece of stringent practical direction.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>All that I have been saying thus far refers to the way in which the very fact of a man’s being saved from his sin is a revelation of God’s mercy, love, and restoring power. But there are two sides to the thought of my text; and the one is that the very existence of Christian people in the world is a standing witness to the highest glory of God’s name; and the other is that there are characteristics which, as Christian men, we are bound to put forth, and which manifest in another fashion the excellencies of our redeeming God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The world takes its notions of God, most of all, from the people who say that they belong to God’s family. They read us a great deal more than they read the Bible. They see us; they only hear about Jesus Christ. ‘Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image’ nor any likeness of the Divine, but thou shalt make thyself an image of Him, that men looking at it may learn a little more of what He is. If we have any right to say that we are a royal priesthood, a chosen nation, God’s ‘possession,’ then there will be in us some likeness of Him to whom we belong stamped more or less perfectly upon our characters; and just as people cannot look at the sun, but may get some notion of its power when they gaze upon the rare beauty of the tinted clouds that lie round about it, if, in the poor, wet, cold mistiness of our lives there be caught, as it were, and tangled some stray beams of the sunshine, there will be colour and beauty there. A bit of worthless tallow may be saturated with a perfume which will make it worth its weight in gold. So our poor natures may be drenched with God and give Him forth fragrant and precious, and men may be drawn thereby. The witness of the life which is Godlike is the duty of Christian men and women in the world, and it is mainly what we are here for.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor does that exclude the other kind of showing forth the praises, by word and utterance, at fit times and to the right people. We are not all capable of that, in any public fashion; we are all capable of it in some fashion. There is no Christian that has not somebody to whom their words--they may be very simple and very feeble--will come as nobody else’s words can. Let us use these talents and these opportunities for the Master.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, above all, let us remember that none of these works--either the involuntary and unconscious exhibition of light and beauty and excellencies caught from Him; or the voluntary and vocal proclamations of the name of Him from whom we have caught them--can be done to any good purpose if any taint of self mingles with it. ‘Let your light so shine before men that they may behold your good works and glorify’--whom? you?--’your Father which is in heaven.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The harp-string gives out its note only on condition that, being touched, it vibrates, and ceases to be visible. Be you unseen, transparent, and the glory of the Lord shall shine through you.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_peter/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;...">1 Peter 2:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">But ye — Who have been born again of incorruptible seed, </span>and have <span class="ital">purified your souls by obeying the truth, </span>&c., (<a href="/context/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:...">1 Peter 1:22-23</a>,) and have <span class="ital">tasted that the Lord is gracious, </span>(<a href="/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1 Peter 2:3</a>,) and are <span class="ital">built up </span>upon him <span class="ital">as lively stories; ye, </span>who bear this character <span class="ital">are a chosen generation </span>— <span class="greekheb">Εκλελτον γενος</span>, <span class="ital">an elect race; </span>all such, and such only, have that title, and other titles of a similar import, in the New Testament.

A new life needs suitable food. Infants desire milk, and make the best endeavours for it which they are able to do; such must be a Christian's desires after the word of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is very merciful to us miserable sinners; and he has a fulness of grace. But even the best of God's servants, in this life, have only a taste of the consolations of God. Christ is called a Stone, to teach his servants that he is their protection and security, the foundation on which they are built. He is precious in the excellence of his nature, the dignity of his office, and the glory of his services. All true believers are a holy priesthood; sacred to God, serviceable to others, endowed with heavenly gifts and graces. But the most spiritual sacrifices of the best in prayer and praise are not acceptable, except through Jesus Christ. Christ is the chief Corner-stone, that unites the whole number of believers into one everlasting temple, and bears the weight of the whole fabric. Elected, or chosen, for a foundation that is everlasting. Precious beyond compare, by all that can give worth. To be built on Christ means, to believe in him; but in this many deceive themselves, they consider not what it is, nor the necessity of it, to partake of the salvation he has wrought. Though the frame of the world were falling to pieces, that man who is built on this foundation may hear it without fear. He shall not be confounded. The believing soul makes haste to Christ, but it never finds cause to hasten from him. All true Christians are a chosen generation; they make one family, a people distinct from the world: of another spirit, principle, and practice; which they could never be, if they were not chosen in Christ to be such, and sanctified by his Spirit. Their first state is a state of gross darkness, but they are called out of darkness into a state of joy, pleasure, and prosperity; that they should show forth the praises of the Lord by their profession of his truth, and their good conduct. How vast their obligations to Him who has made them his people, and has shown mercy to them! To be without this mercy is a woful state, though a man have all worldly enjoyments. And there is nothing that so kindly works repentance, as right thoughts of the mercy and love of God. Let us not dare to abuse and affront the free grace of God, if we mean to be saved by it; but let all who would be found among those who obtain mercy, walk as his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But ye are a chosen generation - In contradistinction from those who, by their disobedience, had rejected the Saviour as the foundation of hope. The people of God are often represented as his chosen or elected people. See the notes at <a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>.<p>A royal priesthood - See the notes at <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>. The meaning of this is, probably, that they "at once bore the dignity of kings, and the sanctity of priests" - Doddridge. Compare <a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; "And hath made us kings and priests unto God." See also <a href="/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>; "But ye shall be named priests of the Lord; men shall call ye ministers of our God." It may be, however, that the word royal is used only to denote the dignity of the priestly office which they sustained, or that they constituted, as it were, an entire nation or kingdom of priests. They were a kingdom over which he presided, and they were all priests; so that it might be said they were a kingdom of priests - a kingdom in which all the subjects were engaged in offering sacrifice to God. The expression appears to be taken from <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a> - "And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests" - and is such language as one who had been educated as a Jew would be likely to employ to set forth the dignity of those whom he regarded as the people of God.<p>An holy nation - This is also taken from <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>. The Hebrews were regarded as a nation consecrated to God; and now that they were cast off or rejected for their disobedience, the same language was properly applied to the people whom God had chosen in their place - the Christian church.<p>A peculiar people - Compare the notes at <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>. The margin here is purchased. The word "peculiar," in its common acceptation now, would mean that they were distinguished from others, or were singular. The reading in the margin would mean that they had been bought or redeemed. Both these things are so, but neither of them expresses the exact sense of the original. The Greek &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  laos eis peripoie&#772;sin) means, "a people for a possession;" that is, as pertaining to God. They are a people which he has secured as a possession, or as his own; a people, therefore, which belong to him, and to no other. In this sense they are special as being His; and, being such, it may be inferred that they should be special in the sense of being unlike others (unique) in their manner of life. But that idea is not necessarily in the text. There seems to be here also an allusion to <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>; "Ye shall be a peculiar treasure with me (Septuagint &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  laos periousios) above all people."<p>That ye should show forth the praises of him - Margin, "virtues." The Greek word (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;  arete&#772;) means properly "good quality, excellence" of any kind. It means here the excellences of God - His goodness, His wondrous deeds, or those things which make it proper to praise Him. This shows one great object for which they were redeemed. It was that they might proclaim the glory of God, and keep up the remembrance of His wondrous deeds in the earth. This is to be done:<p>(a) by proper ascriptions of praise to him in public, family, and social worship;<p>(b) by being always the avowed friends of God, ready ever to vindicate His government and ways;<p>(c) by endeavoring to make known His excellences to all those who are ignorant of Him; and,<p>(d) by such a life as shall constantly proclaim His praise - as the sun, the moon, the stars, the hills, the streams, the flowers do, showing what God does. The consistent life of a devoted Christian is a constant setting forth of the praise of God, showing to all that the God who has made him such is worthy to be loved.<p>Who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light - On the word called, see the notes at <a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>. Darkness is the emblem of ignorance, sin, and misery, and refers here to their condition before their conversion; light is the emblem of the opposite, and is a beautiful representation of the state of those who are brought to the knowledge of the gospel. See the notes at <a href="/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>. The word marvelous means wonderful; and the idea is, that the light of the gospel was such as was unusual, or not to be found elsewhere, as that excites wonder or surprise which we are not accustomed to see. The primary reference here is, undoubtedly, to those who had been pagans, and to the great change which had been produced by their having been brought to the knowledge of the truth as revealed in the gospel; and, in regard to this, no one can doubt that the one state deserved to be characterized as darkness, and the other as light. The contrast was as great as that between midnight and noonday. But what is here said is substantially correct of all who are converted, and is often as strikingly true of those who have been brought up in Christian lands, as of those who have lived among the pagans. The change in conversion is often so great and so rapid, the views and feelings are so different before and after conversion, that it seems like a sudden transition from midnight to noon. In all cases, also, of true conversion, though the change may not be so striking, or apparently so sudden, there is a change of which this may be regarded as substantially an accurate description. In many cases the convert can adopt this language in all its fulness, as descriptive of his own conversion; in all cases of genuine conversion it is true that each one can say that he has been called from a state in which his mind was dark to one in which it is comparatively clear. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Peter, with characteristic boldness, brands as darkness what all the world calls light; reason, without the Holy Spirit, in spite of its vaunted power, is spiritual darkness.

The allusion is throughout to the people of Israel in general, who, in an external way, were all that is here said; but was only true in a spiritual sense of such as were chosen and called among the Jews: and who were a "generation or kindred"; being regenerate, or through abundant mercy begotten, and of an incorruptible seed born again; and were akin to God, he being their Father, and they his children by adopting grace, and which was made manifest by their new birth; and also akin to Christ, he being their head, husband, Father, and brother, and they his members, spouse, children, and brethren; and to the saints, being of the same household and family in heaven and in earth; having the same Father, Lord, Spirit, faith, baptism, and they all brethren: and they were a "chosen" generation or kindred; being famous, and in high esteem with God, and accounted by him for a generation; he having chosen them above all kindreds, tongues, people, and nations, and that from all eternity; and of his own sovereign good will and pleasure; and not on account of their faith, holiness, and good works; and to special benefits, to the relation and kindred they are in, to grace here, and glory hereafter; to regeneration and sanctification, and to salvation and eternal life; just as Israel, as a nation, were chosen above all others, because of the love of God to them, and for no other reason, to many external privileges and favours, which others did not enjoy: now the apostle mentions this character first, because God's eternal election is the source and spring of all spiritual blessings, which provides and secures them, and according to which they are bestowed, and with which they are inseparably connected: <p>a royal priesthood; referring to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>, where the Israelites are called a "kingdom of priests"; which the Chaldee paraphrase renders, kings, priests; see <a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a> a character which one of the Jewish commentators says (y) shall return to the Jews , "in time to come"; and well agrees with all the people of Christ, whether Jews or Gentiles, who are all of them kings, through their relation to Christ; and at the present time have a kingdom which cannot be moved, or taken away from them; being not only brought into the Gospel dispensation, the kingdom of the Messiah, and having a right to all the privileges and immunities of it, but have also the kingdom of grace set up within them, or grace, as a reigning principle, implanted in them; which lies not in anything external, but in righteousness and true holiness, in inward peace, and spiritual joy; and they have the power of kings over sin, Satan, and the world; and the riches of kings, being possessed of the riches of grace now, and entitled to the riches of glory in another world; they live like kings, they wear royal apparel, the robe of Christ's righteousness; they sit at the king's table, and feed on royal dainties; and are attended on as kings, angels being their life guards, and ministering spirits to them; and hereafter they shall reign with Christ on earth, and that for the space of a thousand years, and, after that, for ever: being raised up from a low estate, to inherit the crown of glory, to wear the crown of life and righteousness, and possess the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world, of which they are now heirs: and they are "priests", as well as kings; being made so by Christ, and through his priestly office; are anointed with the Holy Ghost, and sanctified by his grace, and allowed to draw near to God, and offer up by Christ their spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise; and are enabled and assisted to offer up the sacrifice of a broken heart, and their bodies also, and even their lives when called to it; the allusion is to the kingdom and priesthood being formerly together, and which met in Christ, <a href="/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a> and in his people. The Jews were wont to call the priestly dignity and office , "the crown of the priesthood" (z): <p>an holy nation; referring to the same place in <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a> where the Israelites are so called, being separated by God from other nations, and legally and externally sanctified by him; as all the true Israel of God are sanctified, or set apart by God the Father, in eternal election, to real and perfect holiness; and are sanctified or cleansed from sin, by the blood and sacrifice of Christ; and are internally sanctified by the Spirit of God; have principles of holiness wrought in them, from whence they live holy lives and conversations: <p>a peculiar people; as the Israelites are called a "peculiar treasure", <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a> to which the reference is: God's elect are a peculiar people, to whom he bears a peculiar love; they are chosen by him to be a special people above all others, and have peculiar blessings bestowed on them, and peculiar care is taken of them; they are the Lord's,  his treasure, his jewels, his portion and inheritance, and therefore he will preserve and save them; they are a people for acquisition, purchase, and possession, as the words may be rendered; whom God has obtained, procured, and purchased for himself, with the precious blood of his Son; hence the Syriac version renders them, , "a redeemed company": the same with the church God has purchased with his blood, <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a> and the purchased possession, <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a> and which are redeemed and purified to be, and appear to be a peculiar people, zealous of good works, <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a> the end of all which grace being bestowed upon them in election, redemption, and regeneration, is, <p>that ye should show forth the praises of him; that is, God, who has chosen them into a spiritual kindred and relation, made them kings and priests, sanctified them by his Spirit, and redeemed them by his Son, as a peculiar people; all which laid them under obligation to show forth with their lips, and in their lives and conversations, his "virtues": we read, "praises"; and so the Syriac version; that is, the power, wisdom, goodness, love, grace, and mercy of God, and the commendations of them, displayed in the above instances: the apostle seems to have his eye on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-21.htm">Isaiah 43:21</a>, where the Septuagint use the same word for "praise", as here: next follows a periphrasis of God, and in it an argument, or reason for speaking of his virtues, and showing forth his praise: <p>who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; which is to be understood, not of an external call by the ministry of the word only; for many are called in this sense, who are not chosen, redeemed, and sanctified; but of an internal, special, powerful, holy, and heavenly calling, by the Spirit and grace of God: and this is, "out of darkness"; out of the darkness of the law, under the former dispensation, which was as night, in comparison of the Gospel day; and out of that darkness which the Jews were particularly in, in and about the coming of Christ, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and the spirituality of the law; having lost all right notions of the Messiah, and the true sense of the Scriptures, and were carried away with the traditions of the elders, and led by blind guides, the Scribes and Pharisees; out of this darkness, as well as what is common to men, in a state of unregeneracy, having no sight of themselves, their sin, and misery, nor knowledge of divine things, of God in Christ, and of salvation by him, and of the work of the Spirit upon the heart, they were called, <p>into his marvellous light: by which they saw the exceeding sinfulness of sin, the insufficiency of their righteousness, their need of Christ, and salvation by him; and astonishing it was to them, that they who were born blind, and were brought up in darkness, and were darkness itself, should be made light in the Lord; and the objects they saw were amazing to them; everything in a spiritual way was marvellous in their eyes; especially the sun of righteousness, the light of the world, and also the wonderful things out of the law, or doctrine of Christ, the Gospel, and the surprising love and grace of God, in the whole, and in the several parts of their salvation: it was with them, as if a child, from the moment of its birth, was shut up in a dungeon, where there was not the least crevice to let in the least degree of light, and should continue here till at years of maturity, and then be brought out at once, at noonday, the sun shining in its full strength and glory, when that particularly, and all objects about him, must strike him with wonder and surprise. The Syriac version renders it, "his most excellent light"; the apostle seems to refer to the form of praise and thanksgiving used by the Jews, at the time of the passover; who say (a), <p>"we are bound to confess, to praise, to glorify, &amp;c. him who hath done for our fathers, and for us, all these wonders; he hath brought us out of bondage to liberty; from sorrow to joy, and from mourning to a good day,  , "and out of darkness into great light"; and from subjection unto redemption. <p>This was also part of their morning prayer (b), <p>"I confess before thee, O my God, and the God of my fathers, that thou hast brought me out of darkness into light. <p>And it is to be observed, that the third Sephira, or number, in the Jewish Cabalistic tree, which answers to the third Person in the Trinity, among other names, is called, "marvellous light" (c), <p>(y) Baal Hatturim in loc.

The nature of believers, as such, is described by the same predicates which were originally applied to the O.

Schott justly remarks that “what in <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a> had been expressed in the form of an exhortation, is here predicated of the Christians as an already present condition.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γένος ἐκλεκτόν</span>] after <a href="/isaiah/43-20.htm" title="The beast of the field shall honor me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.">Isaiah 43:20</a> (<span class="greekheb">עַמִּי בְחִירִי</span>, LXX.: <span class="greekheb">γένος μου τὸ ἐκλεκτόν</span>); cf. also <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a> ff.; <a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm" title="You are my witnesses, said the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that you may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/44-1.htm" title="Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:...">Isaiah 44:1-2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-4.htm" title="For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my elect, I have even called you by your name: I have surnamed you, though you have not known me.">Isaiah 45:4</a>, etc. This first designation sets forth that the Christians, in virtue of God’s love, have been elected to be a people which no longer belongs to this world; cf. chap. <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1 Peter 1:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">βασίλειον ἱεράτευμα</span>] after <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a>, LXX. (in Hebrew <span class="greekheb">מַמְלֶכֶת בֹּהֲנִים</span>, “a kingdom of priests”); most interpreters take it as simple combination of the two ideas: “kings and priests.” Still it is more correct to regard <span class="greekheb">ἱεράτευμα</span> as the principal idea (cf. <a href="/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1 Peter 2:3</a>), and <span class="greekheb">βασίλειον</span> as a more precise definition: “a royal priesthood.” Several commentators explain: “a priesthood possessing a royal character,” inasmuch as it not only offers up sacrifices (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a>), but exercises sway (over the world); cf. <a href="/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm" title="And have made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.">Revelation 5:10</a> (Wiesinger). Weiss (p. 125), on the other hand: “a priesthood serving Jehovah the King, just as we speak of the royal household.” Since all the other predicates express the belonging to God, the second explanation deserves the preference, only it must be modified so far as to include in <span class="greekheb">βασίλ</span>. not only the relation of service, but that also of belonging to and participation in the glory of the king founded thereon. Schott is not justified in assuming that Peter did not intend to convey the force of the Greek, but that of the Hebrew expression: <span class="greekheb">מַמְלֶכֶת בֹּהֲנִים</span>, namely: “a kingdom which consists of priests.” It is inadequate to understand, with Hofmann, by the term: “a priesthood of princely honours,” or <span class="greekheb">βασίλειον</span> as equal to, magnificus, splendidus (Aretius, Hottinger, etc.), or to find in it the expression of the highest freedom[126] (subject only to God) (de Wette).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΘΝΟς ἍΓΙΟΝ</span></span></span>] in like manner after <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.

The words following show that the apostle had this last passage chiefly in his mind; still it must be noted that this idea is contained already in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a> (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΑῸς ΠΕΡΙΟΎΣΙΟς</span></span></span>). <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΠΟΊΗΣΙς</span></span></span> is strictly the <span class="ital">acquiring</span> (<a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a>); here, what is <span class="ital">acquired, possession</span>; neither destinatus (Vorstius) nor positus (Calovius) is to be supplied to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς</span></span></span>, they would not correspond with the sense; <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς</span></span></span> is here to be explained from <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm" title="And they shall be mine, said the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.">Malachi 3:17</a>, LXX.: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΣΟΝΤΑΊ ΜΟΙ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΕἸς ΠΕΡΙΠΟΊΗΣΙΝ</span></span></span>; on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἾΝΑΙ ΕἸς</span></span></span>, cf.

Schott attributes to this expression an eschatological reference, explaining: “a people destined for appropriation, for acquisition;” this is incorrect, for, understood thus, it would fall out of all analogy with the other expressions. The apostle does not here state to what the Christian church is destined, but what she already is; “her complete liberation from all cosmic powers is not,” as Brückner justly remarks, “an acquiring on God’s side, but only the final redemption of those whom He already possesses.” Schott’s assertion, that in the N.

Schott thinks that <span class="greekheb">ἔθνος</span> includes within it a reference to the intellectual and moral characteristics of the people, and that <span class="greekheb">λαός</span> points to its being gathered together under one Lord. In this urging of distinctions—which are not even correctly drawn—is to be found the reason why Schott exchanges the Greek expression <span class="greekheb">βασιλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἱεράτευμα</span> for the Hebrew, because <span class="greekheb">ἱεράτευμα</span> is not analogous to the other three designations, whilst <span class="greekheb">βασίλεια</span> is so, as a national community.—Peter certainly, in selecting these expressions, did not reflect on the original distinction of the ideas, but made use of them simply as they were presented to him in the O.

The comparison of Melchizedek with Christ perhaps underlies the appropriation of the title.—<span class="greekheb">ἔθνος ἅγιον</span>, to the Jew familiar, with the use of <span class="greekheb">ἔθνη</span> for Gentiles, as much a paradox as <span class="ital">Christ crucified</span>. But <span class="greekheb">λαός</span>, the common rendering of <span class="greekheb">עם</span> in this connexion is wanted below, and St. Peter is content to follow his authority.—<span class="greekheb">λαὸς εἰς περιποίησιν</span>, <span class="ital">a people for possession</span> = <span class="greekheb">עם סגלה</span>. The source of the Greek phrase is <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm" title="And they shall be mine, said the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.">Malachi 3:17</a>, but the Hebrew title variously rendered occurs in the two great passages drawn upon.

In Isa. <span class="greekheb">τὰς ἀρετάς μου</span> stands for <span class="greekheb">תהלהי</span> <span class="ital">my praise</span>; and this sense reappears in Esther 14:10. <span class="greekheb">ἀνοῖξαι στόμα ἐθνῶν εἰς ἀρετάς ματαίων</span>, <span class="ital">the praises of idols</span>. Elsewhere it stands for <span class="greekheb">הוד</span>. <span class="ital">glory</span> (<a href="/habakkuk/3-3.htm" title="God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.">Habakkuk 3:3</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-13.htm" title="Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.">Zechariah 6:13</a>). In the books of Maccabees (especially the fourth) it has its ordinary sense of <span class="ital">virtue</span>, which cannot be excluded altogether here. The whole clause is in fact the pivot on which the Epistle turns. Hitherto Peter has addressed himself to the Christians and their mutual relations, now he turns to consider their relations to the outside world (<a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1 Peter 1:2</a> f.).

The “chosen generation” comes from <a href="/isaiah/43-20.htm" title="The beast of the field shall honor me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.">Isaiah 43:20</a>, the “royal priesthood” from the LXX. of <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a>, where the English version has more accurately “a kingdom of priests.” We note the recurrence of the thought in <a href="/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm" title="And have made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.">Revelation 5:10</a>. The same passage supplies the “holy nation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a peculiar people</span>] This somewhat singular word calls for a special note. The English translators appear to have used the term in its strictly etymological and almost forensic sense. The people of Christ, like Israel of old, were thought of as the special <span class="ital">peculium</span>, the possession, or property, of God. The adjective, however, has acquired in common usage so different a meaning that it would be better to translate the words, <span class="bld">a people for a special possession</span>. The noun or the cognate verb is found in the LXX. of the “<span class="ital">special</span> people” of <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, in the “jewels” of <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm" title="And they shall be mine, said the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.">Malachi 3:17</a>. The context shews however that <a href="/isaiah/43-21.htm" title="This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.">Isaiah 43:21</a> was most prominently in the Apostle’s thoughts, “This people have I formed for myself (or, <span class="bld">gained as a possession for myself</span>); they shall shew forth my praise.” In <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a> the noun is rendered by “purchased possession,” in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>, <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>, by “obtaining,” in <a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a> by “saving.” The primary idea of the Greek verb is that of acquiring for oneself by purchase or otherwise, and the noun accordingly denotes either the act of acquiring or that which is so acquired. Cranmer’s Bible gives “a people which are won:” the Rhemish Version “a people of purchase.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you</span>] The word for “praises” is that commonly used by Greek ethical writers for “virtue,” and is so rendered in <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm" title="Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.">Php 4:8</a> and <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2 Peter 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2 Peter 1:5</a>. St Peter’s choice of the term was determined apparently, as intimated in the preceding note, by its use in the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/43-21.htm" title="This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.">Isaiah 43:21</a>. Here, since the associations of the word in English hardly allow us to speak of the “virtues” of God, “excellences” would perhaps be a more adequate rendering: the Greek word, though connected both by Greek ethical writers (Aristot. <span class="ital">Eth. Nicom</span>. iii. 1) and by St Paul (<a href="/philippians/4-8.htm" title="Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.">Php 4:8</a>) with the thought of praise, cannot well itself have that meaning. The almost uniform reference, throughout the New Testament, of the act of calling to the Father, justifies the conclusion that St Peter so thinks of it here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Darkness is, of course, the natural symbol for man’s ignorance of God (comp. <a href="/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>, <a href="/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>, <a href="/context/ephesians/5-8.htm" title="For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:...">Ephesians 5:8-13</a>, <a href="/romans/13-12.htm" title="The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.">Romans 13:12</a>), as light is for the true knowledge of Him. The epithet “marvellous,” or <span class="bld">wonderful</span>, as applied to that light is peculiar to St Peter. Looking to the stress laid on the glory of the Transfiguration in <a href="/context/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty....">2 Peter 1:16-18</a>, we may, perhaps, see in this passage the impression which had been made upon him by what he had then seen of the “marvellous light” of the Eternal. Into that light, of which what he had seen was but the outward symbol, not he only but all who believed in Christ had now been called.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1 Peter 2:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὑμεῖς δὲ</span>, <span class="ital">but ye</span>) Supply <span class="ital">are</span>.

The words, "a chosen generation" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>), are from <a href="/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The Cornerstone is elect, precious; the living stones built thereupon are elect likewise. The whole Christian Church is addressed as an elect race, one race, because all its members are begotten again of the one Father. <span class="cmt_word">A royal priesthood</span>. Instead of "holy," as in ver. 5, St. Peter has here the epithet "royal." He follows the Septuagint Version of <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; the Hebrew has "a kingdom of priests." The word "royal" may mean that God's elect shall sit with Christ in his throne, and reign with him (<a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>), and that in some sense they reign with him now over their lower nature, their desires and appetites; or, more probably, the priesthood of Christians is called "royal" because it belongs to the King - "a priesthood serving Jehovah the King, just as we speak of 'the royal household'" (Weiss, quoted by Huther). <span class="cmt_word">An holy nation.</span> Also from <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>. The Israelites were a holy nation as separated from the heathen and consecrated to God's service by circumcision. Christians of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, are one nation under one King, separated to his service, dedicated to him in holy baptism. <span class="cmt_word">A peculiar people</span>. The Greek words. <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, represent the words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, of <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, translated by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "a special people" (Authorized Version). St. Paul also has this translation in <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> in <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm">Malachi 3:17</a> is rendered by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>  <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, by the Authorized Version "my jewels."

God says of them, in <a href="/isaiah/43-21.htm">Isaiah 43:21</a>, "This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise;" rendered by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, God hath now chosen us Christians to be the Israel of God; the Christian Church is his <span class="accented">peeulium</span>, his treasure, "a people for God's own possession" (Revised Version). The literal meaning of the Greek words used by St. Peter is "a people for acquisition," or "for keeping safe," the verb having the sense of "gaining, acquiring," and also that of "preserving, keeping for one's self" (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>; also <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>, "The Church of God, which he purchased (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) with his own blood"). <span class="cmt_word">That ye should show forth the praises of him.</span> That ye should tell out, publish abroad. The verb is found nowhere else in the New Testament. The word translated "praises" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, literally, "virtues"), so very common in classical writers, occurs in the New Testament only here, <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3, 5</a>, and <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>. Here St. Peter is quoting from the Septuagint Version of <a href="/isaiah/43-21.htm">Isaiah 43:21</a> (the word is similarly used in <a href="/isaiah/42-12.htm">Isaiah 42:12</a> and Isaiah 63:7). Perhaps the best rendering is that of the Revised Version, "excellencies." <span class="cmt_word">Who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</span> He had chosen them before the foundation of the world; he called them when they received the gospel: "Whom he did predestinate, them he also called." He called them out of the darkness of ignorance and sin. The Gentiles walked in utter darkness, in less measure the Jews also. The light of his presence is marvelous, wonderful; those who walk in that light feel something of its irradiating glory. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_peter/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Generation (&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Better, Rev., race: a body with a common life and descent.<p>Nation (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;).
