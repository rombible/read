And, The laborer is worthy of his reward.">1Timothy 5:18</a>, to “muzzle” or “gag,” implying that there is something of the animal about these “foolish men.” The same contempt appears in each word of the clause, even down to “men,” which might be rendered “people” or “creatures.” The word for “ignorance” implies a stolid and wilful ignorance, and is so used by heathen authors, as well as very markedly in the only other place in the New Testament, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-34.htm" title="Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.">1Corinthians 15:34</a>. “Foolish,” too, contains moral reprobation, <a href="/luke/11-40.htm" title="You fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?">Luke 11:40</a>; <a href="/luke/12-20.htm" title="But God said to him, You fool, this night your soul shall be required of you: then whose shall those things be, which you have provided?">Luke 12:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-36.htm" title="You fool, that which you sow is not quickened, except it die:">1Corinthians 15:36</a>. suggesting <span class= "ital">thoughtlessness</span> rather than <span class= "ital">senselessness.</span> The definite article is also used in the Greek (as in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.">2Thessalonians 3:2</a>), and again seems to indicate that St. Peter had some particular enemies in view who had brought the charges. This accusation was evidently one of a <span class= "ital">political</span> nature; and, indeed, history shows us that the hostility of the empire to the faith was entirely based on the corporate nature of the Christian religion.

Regard to those duties is the will of God, consequently, the Christian's duty, and the way to silence the base slanders of ignorant and foolish men. Christians must endeavour, in all relations, to behave aright, that they do not make their liberty a cloak or covering for any wickedness, or for the neglect of duty; but they must remember that they are servants of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For so is the will of God - That is, it is in accordance with the divine will that in this way you should put them to silence.<p>That with well doing - By a life of uprightness and benevolence.<p>Ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men - See the notes at <a href="/titus/2-8.htm">Titus 2:8</a>. The reference here is to men who brought charges against Christians, by accusing them of being inimical to the government, or insubordinate, or guilty of crimes. Such charges, it is well known, were often brought against them by their enemies in the early ages of Christianity. Peter says they were brought by foolish men, perhaps using the word foolish in the sense of evil-disposed, or wicked, as it is often used in the Bible. Yet, though there might be malice at the bottom, the charges were really based on ignorance. They were not thoroughly acquainted with the principles of the Christian religion; and the way to meet those charges was to act in every way as became good citizens, and so as "to live them down." One of the best ways of meeting the accusations of our enemies is to lead a life of strict integrity. It is not easy for the wicked to reply to this argument. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

The Gentiles were very ignorant of these things, and very foolish in their imaginations about religious affairs; and from this their ignorance and folly arose calumnies, reflections, and censures upon the people of God; they neither knew God, nor them, nor true religion, and reproached what they understood not, and for want of knowing it: now the apostle signified, that it was the declared will of God that his people should so behave in civil life, that their enemies should be entirely confounded, and silenced, and have nothing to say against them; the word signifies to be muzzled, to have the mouth shut up, as with a bit or bridle; it is used in <a href="/matthew/22-12.htm">Matthew 22:12</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{19}</span> For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</span><p>(19) He declares the first argument more amply, showing that Christian liberty does among all things least or not at all consist in this, that is, to cast off the bridle of laws (as at that time some altogether unskilful in the kingdom of God reported) but rather in this, that living holy lives according to the will of God, we should reveal to all men, that the gospel is not a cloak for sin and wickedness, seeing we are free of this sort, that yet we are still the servants of God, and not of sin.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_peter/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_peter/2-15.htm" title="For so is the will of God, that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:">1 Peter 2:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>] gives the ground of the exhortation: <span class="greekheb">ὑποτάγητε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὕτως ἐστὶν τὸ θέλημα τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>] with <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span>; cf.
