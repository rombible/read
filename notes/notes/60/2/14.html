Of course the person “by” whom they are here said to be (from time to time) “sent” is Cæsar, not “the Lord.” The persons to whom the letter is addressed would have very little to do with Cæsar himself directly, their submission would be chiefly shown to the lieutenants. Yet how personal was the Imperial government, even in details, is shown in Pliny’s letters; the very letter before that in which he asks how to deal with the Christians of Bithynia requests Trajan’s leave to cover in an unhealthy beck in the town of Amastris.<p><span class= "bld">For the punishment of evildoers.</span>—St. Peter credits Roman imperialism (rightly in the main) with having as its aim the promotion of moral behaviour among its subjects. The word for “punishment” is that which is translated “vengeance” in <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm" title="In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:">2Thessalonians 1:8</a>, and implies forcing the malefactors to make satisfaction to those whom they had wronged, the “avenger” being, of course, quite disinterested. The “praise” which here, as in <a href="/romans/13-3.htm" title="For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Will you then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same:">Romans 13:3</a>, is said to have been bestowed by the government on welldoers, must mean the solid praise of preferments, which is hardly so marked a feature of government as the foregoing. Be it observed that neither St. Peter nor St. Paul lay down any exceptions to the rule of complete obedience. They refuse to contemplate, at least to formulate, the occasions when disobedience may be necessary. Obedience is the first thing to learn, and when they have learnt it, they will know of themselves when to disobey. St. Peter himself stands to all time as the type of magnificent disobedience (<a href="/acts/4-19.htm" title="But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, judge you.">Acts 4:19</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:13-17 A Christian conversation must be honest; which it cannot be, if there is not a just and careful discharge of all relative duties: the apostle here treats of these distinctly. Regard to those duties is the will of God, consequently, the Christian's duty, and the way to silence the base slanders of ignorant and foolish men. Christians must endeavour, in all relations, to behave aright, that they do not make their liberty a cloak or covering for any wickedness, or for the neglect of duty; but they must remember that they are servants of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or unto governors - Subordinate officers, appointed by the chief magistrate, over provinces. Perhaps Roman proconsuls are here particularly intended.<p>As unto them that are sent by him - By the king, or the Roman emperor. They represent the supreme power.<p>For the punishment of evil doers - One of the leading ends of government. "The Roman governors had the power of life and death in such conquered provinces as those mentioned in <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>" - Doddridge. Ulpian, the celebrated Roman lawyer, who flourished two hundred years after Christ, thus describes the power of the governors of the Roman provinces: "It is the duty of a good and vigilant president to see to it that his province be peaceable and quiet. And that he ought to make diligent search after sacrilegious persons, robbers, man-stealers, and thieves, and to punish everyone according to their guilt." Again, "They who govern whole provinces, have the power of sending to the mines." And again," The presidents of provinces have the highest authority, next to the emperor." Peter has described the office of the Roman governors in language nearly resembling that of Ulpian. See Lardner's Credibility, (Works, i. 77, edit. 8vo., Lond. 1829)<p>And for the praise of them that do well - Praise here stands opposed to punishment, and means commendation, applause, reward. That is, it is a part of their business to reward in a suitable manner those who are upright and virtuous as citizens. This would be by protecting their persons and property; by defending their rights, and, perhaps, by admitting those to share the honors and emoluments of office who showed that they were worthy to be trusted. It is as important a part of the functions of magistracy to protect the innocent, as it is to punish the wicked. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. governors&#8212;subordinate to the emperor, "sent," or delegated by C&aelig;sar to preside over the provinces.<p>for the punishment&#8212;No tyranny ever has been so unprincipled as that some appearance of equity was not maintained in it; however corrupt a government be, God never suffers it to be so much so as not to be better than anarchy [Calvin]. Although bad kings often oppress the good, yet that is scarcely ever done by public authority (and it is of what is done by public authority that Peter speaks), save under the mask of right. Tyranny harasses many, but anarchy overwhelms the whole state [Horneius]. The only justifiable exception is in cases where obedience to the earthly king plainly involves disobedience to the express command of the King of kings.<p>praise of them that do well&#8212;Every government recognizes the excellence of truly Christian subjects. Thus Pliny, in his letter to the Emperor Trajan, acknowledges, "I have found in them nothing else save a perverse and extravagant superstition." The recognition in the long run mitigates persecution (1Pe 3:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_peter/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Or unto governors; </span> he seems immediately to intend the governors of provinces under the Roman emperors, such as Pilate, Felix, Festus were in Judea, Sergius Paulus in Cyprus, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/13-7.htm" title="Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.">Acts 13:7</a></span>; and other places; see <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/3-1.htm" title="Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,">Luke 3:1</a></span>; but so as to imply, under the name of governors, all inferior magistrates, as under the name of king he doth all supreme. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As unto them that are sent by him; </span> either: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Will you then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same:...">Romans 13:3-4</a>, will be noticed as another interesting coincidence in the teaching of the two Apostles. Both alike recognise that even an imperfect and corrupt government works, on the whole, for a greater good than lawless anarchy. Both therefore are against revolutionary attempts to destroy an established order. It has, of course, to be remembered that the Christian citizens of a Christian country now stand in a different position, in relation to the state, from that occupied by the disciples of the Apostolic Church, and have therefore different duties and responsibilities; among others, that of defending the “ordinance” or “institution” under which they live, whether that institution be monarchical or republican in its form, against open or insidious aggression.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/2-14.htm" title="Or to governors, as to them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.">1 Peter 2:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀγαθοποιῶν</span>, <span class="ital">those that do well</span>) A word of frequent occurrence in this Epistle.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or unto governors, as ante them that are sent by him</span>; literally, <span class="accented">through him</span>. Some commentators, following Calvin, understand the pronoun of the Lord. Certainly, governors are sent through him; he "ordereth all things, both in heaven and earth." But it seems more natural in this place to refer the pronoun to the nearer substantive, the king; it was through the Roman emperor that the various governors, legates, etc., were sent from time to time (as the Greek present participle implies) to administer the provinces. <span class="cmt_word">For the punish-meat of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well.</span> Observe the close resemblance to <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3, 4</a>. St. Peter recognizes the Roman sense of justice which we see in men like Festus and Gallio. At first the Jews were the persecutors of the Christians; the Roman magistrates were their protectors.
