They knew that they spoke “concerning a salvation,” but they did not know the <span class= "ital">details.</span> The present passage is perhaps the most striking in the whole New Testament in regard to the doctrine of prophetic inspiration. Assuming that the prophets did not speak simply of their own human calculation, but somehow under the influence of the Divine Spirit, we are brought to face the question, <span class= "ital">how far</span> their utterances were their own, and how far suggested to them from on high. The doctrine of Montanism, which has not altogether died out of the Church yet, asserts that from first to last prophecy is superhuman; that every word and letter is forced upon the man by a power not his own, which leaves him no choice. God, and God alone, is responsible for every syllable. The human will and intelligence need not even concur in the message they deliver, nor even be conscious that they are delivering it. Thus Montanus makes God to say through him: “Lo, man is as a lyre, and I am as that which strikes the chords: the man is unconscious, and I alone wake.” On the other hand, some of the early opponents of Montanism went so far as to say that the inspired writers had a clear and immediate perception, a complete insight into the mysteries which they foretold,—that Isaiah, for instance, saw, as plainly as we do, Mary and Jesus in his prophecy of Immanuel. Our present verses show a doctrine between the two. The prophets find themselves impelled to say words which they are conscious of choosing and using, but which they feel to have a deeper meaning than they themselves were conscious of intending. It is clear to them (<a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>) that what they meant primarily as applying to present circumstances, was in reality being overruled by the Spirit to apply more fully to the future. But what that future was they struggled, and half in vain, to know. We may apply to them what Keble says of the Greek poets:—<p>“As little children lisp, and tell of Heaven,<p>So thoughts beyond their thoughts to those high bards were given.”<p><span class= "bld">What, or what manner of time.</span>—If this be right, it must mean, “what exact or approximate date.” But the simplest translation would be, <span class= "ital">to whom, or what period, the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing.</span> This would give new significance to the sentence. They were aware that they were speaking of a <span class= "ital">Messiah</span>; but who the man should be who would hold that office, or at what period of their history he would arise, this was what they longed to know. They foresaw a Christ, but they could not foresee Jesus; they could give to their Christ no definite position in future history. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/22-42.htm" title="Saying, What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, The son of David.">Matthew 22:42</a>; <a href="/luke/3-15.htm" title="And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;">Luke 3:15</a>; <a href="/luke/23-35.htm" title="And the people stood beholding.

But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?">John 7:41</a>; <a href="/acts/2-36.htm" title="Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.">Acts 2:36</a>, and often.)<p><span class= "bld">The Spirit of Christ</span> <span class= "bld">which was in them.</span>—They are conscious of a power <span class= "ital">within</span> them which is not themselves, “moving” them. And this power is described as “the Spirit of Christ.” Now, observe that a change has come over St. Peter’s way of speaking. Hitherto, he has always said, “Jesus Christ,” his object being to keep constantly before the eyes of these Hebrews the truth which he was the first man to enunciate, viz., “<span class= "ital">Thou</span> art the Christ” (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm" title="And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.">Matthew 16:16</a>), that <span class= "ital">Jesus</span> was the person who fulfilled all that was expected of the Messiah. “Christ” is not once used by St. Peter (as it is often by St. Paul) as a proper name: it always marks the office, not the person. Therefore we may not prove by this expression two doctrines, however true they may be in themselves, which are commonly sought to be supported by it, viz., the preexistence of our Lord, and the procession of the Holy Ghost from Him as well as from the Father. In spite of a well-quoted passage in Barnabas (1 Peter 5), “The prophets had the gift from Him, and prophesied of Him,” it cannot here mean, “the Holy Ghost given them by our Lord Himself.” Besides, it is theologically incorrect to say that Christ as the Anointed had any pre-existence, except as an indefinite hope in the minds of the Hebrews. The <span class= "ital">Son, </span>the unincarnate Word, pre-existed, but it is Apollinarianism to say that <span class= "ital">Jesus</span> had any existence before the Incarnation,—still more Christ, since it may be doubted whether the Incarnate Word became “Christ” until His baptism. That, at least, appears to be St. Peter’s doctrine (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm" title="How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.">Acts 10:38</a>). “The Spirit of Messiah,” then, at any rate when applied to the ages before Christ came, must have a different meaning. Probably not exactly “the Spirit that was to anoint and be in the Messiah,” but rather, “the Messiah-spirit” or “the Messianic spirit.” The prophets wondered who the man was, and where he would live, to whom this Messianic inspiration which they felt within was pointing. St. Peter himself, we repeat, was the first person who fully knew the answer.<p><span class= "bld">When it testified beforehand.</span>—A much more solemn word in the original than it looks in the English, and used by no other writer than St. Peter. It does not mean simply, “when it <span class= "ital">bore</span> witness beforehand;” but “testifying” means an appeal to Heaven to mark and record the words so spoken: “when with a solemn appeal it announced beforehand.” Was he not thinking of the awful appeal in <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm" title="And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that lives for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.">Daniel 12:7</a>?<p><span class= "bld">The sufferings of Christ.</span>—This unduly contracts the fulness of the Greek, which reads, <span class= "ital">the sufferings for Christ</span> (just as we had before “the grace for you”), <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, “these sufferings in reserve for Messiah.” The Old Testament passages which may be supposed to be chiefly indicated are Isaiah 53 and (still more) <a href="/context/daniel/9-24.htm" title="Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.">Daniel 9:24-26</a>. If it be asked how St. Peter <span class= "ital">knew</span> that the prophets had these longings and doubts, we answer, that it was not only a probable <span class= "ital">guess, </span>but the result of a study of Daniel, who records again and again the prophetic agony of his search into the future. Beware of treating the title “Christ” as a proper name. <span class= "ital">Eight</span> out of the <span class= "ital">ten</span> times that St. Peter uses the word by itself, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>without “Jesus” or “the Lord,” it is in direct connection with <span class= "ital">suffering</span> (here, and in <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1Peter 2:21</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-1.htm" title="For as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;">1Peter 4:1</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/4-13.htm" title="But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.">1Peter 4:13-14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-1.htm" title="The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:">1Peter 5:1</a>). Conversely, he <span class= "ital">never</span> speaks of the sufferings of <span class= "ital">Jesus</span> Christ. That is to say, he loves to dwell upon the Passion of our Lord, not in its <span class= "ital">personal</span> but its <span class= "ital">official</span> aspect. The striking point is that the <span class= "ital">Messiah</span> should have suffered thus. It was especially necessary to show this in any effort to retain the faith of the <span class= "ital">Hebrews.</span> Comp. <a href="/context/luke/24-26.htm" title="Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?">Luke 24:26-46</a> (Peter present); <a href="/acts/3-18.htm" title="But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he has so fulfilled.">Acts 3:18</a> (Peter speaking); <a href="/acts/17-3.htm" title="Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach to you, is Christ.">Acts 17:3</a> (to Hebrews); <a href="/acts/26-23.htm" title="That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show light to the people, and to the Gentiles.">Acts 26:23</a>. And we can see a reason for the insistence in St. Peter’s history. The very same day, apparently, when he had announced his belief that Jesus was the Messiah, he took Him to task for speaking of sufferings and shame. He never could forget the reprimand, like a sword-cut, which he received. The whole Epistle may be said to be an expansion of what Jesus said in answer (<a href="/context/matthew/16-23.htm" title="But he turned, and said to Peter, Get you behind me, Satan: you are an offense to me: for you mind not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.">Matthew 16:23-27</a>). Some commentators include in this phrase of “the sufferings in reserve for Messiah,” the thought of the sufferings of the Church as well; but it seems far-fetched, especially when we see the true meaning of the word “Christ.” Finally, we may add, that some would join very closely together the words for “signify” and “testifying beforehand,” which would give us this sense: “examining, in reserve for <span class= "ital">whom, </span>or for what period, the Spirit, with its solemn appeal beforehand, was pointing out these sufferings in reserve for Messiah.” This is possible, and keeps the same sense, but it unnecessarily complicates the sentence.<p><span class= "bld">And the glory that should follow.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">and the glories after them.</span> The plural “glories” corresponds to the plural “sufferings,”—the one as multiform <span class= "ital">as</span> the other; resurrection, ascension, reassumption of the divine glory (<a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>), triumphs of Church history, restitution of all things. The sufferings and subsequent glories of the Christ form, of course, together the whole of the gospel.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:10-12 Jesus Christ was the main subject of the prophets' studies. Their inquiry into the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow, would lead to a view of the whole gospel, the sum whereof is, That Christ Jesus was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification. God is pleased to answer our necessities rather than our requests. The doctrine of the prophets, and that of the apostles, exactly agree, as coming from the same Spirit of God. The gospel is the ministration of the Spirit; its success depends upon his operation and blessing. Let us then search diligently those Scriptures which contain the doctrines of salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Searching what - That is, examining their own predictions with care, to ascertain what they meant. They studied them as we do the predictions which others have made; and though the prophets were the medium through which the truth was made known, yet their own predictions became a subject of careful investigation to themselves. The expression used here in the original, rendered "what," (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  eis tina,) literally, "unto what," may mean, so far as the Greek is concerned, either "what time," or "what people," or "what person;" that is, with reference to what person the prophecies were really uttered. The latter, it seems to me, is the correct interpretation, meaning that they inquired in regard to him, who he would be, what would be his character, and what would be the nature of the work which he would perform. There can be no doubt that they understood that their predictions related to the Messiah; but still it is not improper to suppose that it was with them an interesting inquiry what sort of a person he would be, and what would be the nature of the work which he would perform.<p>This interpretation of the phrase &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  eis tina, (unto what or whom) it should be observed, however, is not that which is commonly given of the passage. Bloomfield, Rosenmuller, Doddridge, Whitby, Benson, and Grotius suppose it to refer to time, meaning that they inquired at what time, or when these things would occur. Macknight thinks it refers "to people," (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  laon,) meaning that they diligently inquired what people would put him to death. But the most obvious interpretation is that which I have suggested above, meaning that they made particular inquiry to whom their prophecies related - what was his rank and character, and what was to be the nature of his work. What would be a more natural inquiry for them than this? What would be more important? And how interesting is the thought that when Isaiah, for example, had given utterance to the sublime predictions which we now have of the Messiah, in his prophecies, he sat himself down with the spirit of a little child, to learn by prayer and study, what was fully implied in the amazing words which the Spirit had taught him to record! How much of mystery might seem still to hang around the subject And how intent would such a mind be to know what was the full import of those words!<p>Or what manner of time - This phrase, in Greek, (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  poion kairon,) would properly relate, not to the exact time when these things would occur, but to the character or condition of the age when they would take place; perhaps referring to the state of the world at that period, the preparation to receive the gospel, and the probable manner in which the great message would be received. Perhaps, however, the inquiry in their minds pertained to the time when the predictions would be fulfilled, as well as to the condition of the world when the event takes place. The meaning of the Greek phrase would not exclude this latter sense. There are not unfrequent indications of time in the prophets, (compare <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a> ff) and these indications were of so clear a character, that when the Saviour actually appeared there was a general expectation that the event would then occur. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/2-9.htm">Matthew 2:9</a>.<p>The Spirit of Christ which was in them - This does not prove that they knew that this was the Spirit of Christ, but is only a declaration of Peter that it was actually so. It is not probable that the prophets distinctly understood that the Spirit of inspiration, by which they were led to foretell future events, was especially the Spirit of Christ. They understood that they were inspired; but there is no intimation, with which I am acquainted, in their writings, that they regarded themselves as inspired by the Messiah. It was not improper, however, for Peter to say that the Spirit by which they were influenced was in fact the Spirit of Christ, so called because that Spirit which suggested these future events to them was given as the great Medium of all revealed truth to the world. Compare <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>, <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>.

They saw clearly that the Messiah was to suffer; and doubtless this was the common doctrine of the prophets, and the common expectation of the pious part of the Jewish nation. Yet it is not necessary to suppose that they had clear apprehensions of his sufferings, or were able to reconcile all that was said on that subject with what was said of his glory and his triumphs. There was much about those sufferings which they wished to learn, as there is much still which we desire to know. We have no reason to suppose that there were any views of the sufferings of the Messiah communicated to the prophets except what we now have in the Old Testament; and to see the force of what Peter says, we ought to imagine what would be our views of him if all that we have known of Christ as history were obliterated, and we had only the knowledge which we could derive from the Old Testament. As has been already intimated, it is probable that they studied their own predictions, just as we would study them if we had not the advantage of applying to them the facts which have actually occurred.<p>And the glory that should follow - That is, they saw that there would be glory which would be the result of his sufferings, but they did not clearly see what it would be. They had some knowledge that he would be raised from the dead, (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-8.htm">Psalm 16:8-11</a>; Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-25.htm">Acts 2:25-28</a>) they knew that he would "see of the travail of his soul, and would be satisfied," <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a> they had some large views of the effects of the gospel on the nations of the earth, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7-8</a>; 60; 66. But there were many things respecting his glorification which it cannot be supposed they clearly understood; and it is reasonable to presume that they made the comparatively few and obscure intimations in their own writings in relation to this, the subject of profound and prayerful inquiry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. what&#8212;Greek, "In reference to what, or what manner of time."

The prophets made a very diligent inquiry into the exact time when Christ should come to work out the salvation of his people; to whom it was made known that his coming should be before the sceptre, or tribe of Judah, and all civil government in it, ceased; and before the second temple was destroyed, into which the Messiah, the messenger of the covenant, was to come, as the Lord and proprietor of it; and that it should be seventy weeks, or 490 years, from a date given in <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a> as it was revealed to the Prophet Daniel; who particularly inquired, and diligently searched into this matter, and was eminently a man of desires this way, as he is styled, <a href="/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a> and they not only searched into the exact time, but into the manner and quality of the time when the Saviour should come; and foretold that it would be, with respect to the nations of the world, a time of profound peace; with respect to the Jews, that it would be a time of great blindness, ignorance, unbelief, and hardness of heart; that such would be that generation, or age, for wickedness and barbarity, as could not be declared and expressed; and that few would believe the report of the Gospel; and that the Messiah would be rejected of men, and be wounded, bruised, and put to death; and with respect to the Gentiles, that the Gospel would be preached to them, and that they should seek to Christ, be gathered to him, and hope and trust in him; and that the followers of the Messiah should be persecuted, and greatly distressed, and yet comforted and sustained; and this should be the face of the times, and the state of things, when the salvation should be revealed: and all this, and much more, <p>the Spirit of Christ in them did signify; or "make manifest": from whence it appears, that Christ then existed, as he did before there were any prophets, and even from everlasting, being the eternal God; and that the Spirit is from him, as well as from the Father; and as here, so he is often by the Jews (a) called , "the Spirit of the Messiah", or "Christ"; and that the Spirit is truly God, since he could declare beforehand the exact time of Christ's coming, and the finality of the age in which he came, as well as bear a previous testimony to his sufferings and glory; as also, that he was in the prophets, and they were inspired by him, and spake as he moved and directed them: <p>when, it testified before hand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.

Not so de Wette, who finds in it merely the expression of the view “that the work of redemption is the same in both the O. and N. T., and that the Spirit of God at work in the former is identical with the Spirit of Christ;” and Weiss (pp. 247–249), who explains the name thus: that the Spirit which was at work in the prophets was the same as “that which Christ received at His baptism, and since then has possessed;” similarly Schmid also (<span class="ital">bibl. Theol</span>. p. 163), “the Spirit of God which in after time worked in the person of Christ.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Weiss seeks to prove, indeed, that “Christ had in the pre-existent Messianic Spirit an ideal, or in <span class="ital">a certain sense</span> a real pre-existence,”—but in this way reflex ideas are attributed to the apostles, which certainly lay far from their mind. Besides, Weiss himself admits that in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-9.htm" title="Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.">1 Corinthians 10:9</a>, reference is made to the pre-existent Christ; but it cannot be concluded from <a href="/acts/2-36.htm" title="Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.">Acts 2:36</a> that Peter did not believe it. Schott, too, in his interpretation, does not abstain from introducing many results of modern thought, when he designates <span class="greekheb">τὸ πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>. here as the Spirit “of the Mediator continually approaching the consummation of salvation(!), but as yet supernaturally concealed in God.” Steinmeyer does not touch the question of the pre-existence of Christ; he finds an adequate explanation of the expression in the remark of Bengel, although he takes <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span> as a subject. gen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">προμαρτυρόμενον</span>] This verb. compos. occurs nowhere else in the N. T., and in none of the classical writers; the simplex means properly: “to call to witness;” then, “to swear to, to attest;” <span class="greekheb">προμαρτύρεσθαι</span> is therefore: “<span class="ital">to attest beforehand</span>.”[72]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The object of <span class="greekheb">ἐδήλου</span> … <span class="greekheb">προμαρτ</span>. is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΕἸς ΧΡΙΣΤῸΝ ΠΑΘΉΜΑΤΑ ΚΑῚ ΤᾺς ΜΕΤᾺ ΤΑῦΤΑ ΔΌΞΑς</span></span></span>] On this Luther remarks, that it can be understood of both kinds of suffering, of those which Christ Himself bore, as well as of those which we endure. The majority of interpreters conceive the reference to be to the former: Oecumenius, Theophyl., Erasmus, Grotius, Aretius, Piscator (cf. <a href="/luke/24-26.htm" title="Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?">Luke 24:26</a>), Vorstius, Hensler, Stolz, Hottinger, Knapp, Steiger, de Wette, Brückner, Steinmeyer, Wiesinger, Weiss, Luthardt, Schott, Fronmüller, Hofmann, etc.; but not so Calvin: non tractat Petr. quod Christo sit proprium, sed de universali ecclesiae statu disserit; Bolten and Clericus explain it of the sufferings of the Christians; the same position is taken up in the first edition of this commentary. Since the main tendency of the paragraph, <a href="/context/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:...">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>, is to give special prominence to the glorious nature of the believers’ <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΩΤΗΡΊΑ</span></span></span>, the latter view <span class="ital">is favoured</span> by the connection of thought. But, on the other hand, there is nothing opposed to the assumption, that the apostle here mentions the facts on which the <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span> is founded, as the substance of the testimony of the Spirit of God in the prophets. The expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΕἸς ΧΡΙΣΤῸΝ ΠΑΘΉΜΑΤΑ</span></span></span> too, which must be interpreted on the analogy of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ΕἸς ὙΜᾶς ΧΆΡΙΤΟς</span></span></span>, goes to show that by it are to be understood <span class="ital">the sufferings which were ordained or appointed to Christ</span> (Wiesinger).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the plural <span class="greekheb">τὰς</span> … <span class="greekheb">δόξας</span>, Bengel says: Plurale: gloria resurrectionis, gloria ascensionis, gloria judicii extremi et regni coelestis; thus also Grotius, de Wette, Steiger, Wiesinger, Weiss, Schott. But it might be more correct to explain the plural in this way, that as the one suffering of Christ comprehends in it a plurality of sufferings, so does His <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑ</span></span></span> a plurality of glories. Hofmann: “by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΘΉΜΑΤΑ</span></span></span> is to be understood the manifold afflictions in which the one suffering of Christ consisted, while the manifold glorifyings which go to make up His glory are included under <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑΙ</span></span></span>.”[73] Besides, it must be noted that the suffering of Christ is always designated by the plural <span class="greekheb">παθήματα</span> (with the exception of in <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>, where we have: <span class="greekheb">τὸ πάθημα τοῦ θανάτου</span>), but His glory always by the singular <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As the <span class="greekheb">παθήματα</span> and <span class="greekheb">δόξαι</span>, of Christ are the object of <span class="greekheb">ἐδήλου προμαρτυρόμενον</span>, so by <span class="greekheb">καιρός</span>, to which the <span class="greekheb">ἐρευνᾷν</span> of the prophets was directed, <span class="ital">the</span> time is referred to when this salvation would actually be accomplished. For this reason, then, <span class="greekheb">ἐξηρεύνησαν</span>, <a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1 Peter 1:10</a>, cannot again be repeated in <span class="greekheb">ἐρευνῶντες</span> (Wiesinger, Schott), as if the <span class="greekheb">εἰς τίνα</span> … <span class="greekheb">καιρόν</span> referred directly to the appearance of the <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span>; the apostle’s thought is rather this, that in their search as to the time of the sufferings, etc. of Christ, the prophets had before their eyes, as that with respect to which they sought to obtain knowledge, the <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span> of which believers were to be made partakers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[72] Schott justly remarks that <span class="greekheb">δηλοῦν</span> and <span class="greekheb">προμαρτύρεσθαι</span> are not identical with <span class="greekheb">προφητεύειν</span>, but that they denote the “action of the Spirit,” by means of which “He communicated to the prophets the prophecies after which they were to inquire.” But he is evidently mistaken when he asserts that this identification takes place in the above interpretation.—Nor is Schott warranted in supposing that in <span class="greekheb">προμαρ</span>. the apostle emphatically shows that the manner of communication “was a revelation in the form of <span class="ital">speech</span>, and not an inward vision.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[73] Hofmann’s opinion, that Peter had chiefly in his mind the passages in <a href="/context/isaiah/49-6.htm" title="And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth....">Isaiah 49:6-7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-15.htm" title="So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.">Isaiah 52:15</a>, arises from the fact that he applies <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> specially to the Gentiles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Definite corroboration of the ideas here expressed is to be found in the Book of Daniel, chap. <a href="/daniel/12-4.htm" title="But you, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.">Daniel 12:4</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/12-9.htm" title="And he said, Go your way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end....">Daniel 12:9-10</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-13.htm" title="But go you your way till the end be: for you shall rest, and stand in your lot at the end of the days.">Daniel 12:13</a>. The fundamental presupposition is, that the “<span class="ital">when</span>” of the fulfilment was unknown to the prophets; according to <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1 Peter 1:12</a>, all that was revealed to them was, that it would take place only in the times to come. De Wette asserts too much when he says, that searching as to the time cannot be predicated of the genuine prophets of ancient Judaism, but of Daniel only, who pondered over the seventy years of Jeremiah. But although the words of Daniel may have given occasion for the apostle’s statement, still that statement is not incapable of justification. If the apostles searched as to the time when the promises of Christ would receive accomplishment, why should it not be presupposed that similarly the prophets, too, inquired into that which the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα Χριστοῦ</span> testified beforehand to them, more especially as to the <span class="greekheb">καιρός</span> of its fulfilment?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_peter/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1 Peter 1:11</a>.

He combines with it as its proper Scripture, the prophecy of Enoch (ix. 1) <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀκούσαντες οἱ τέσσαρες μεγάλοι ἀρχάγγελοι</span> … <span class="greekheb">παρέ κυψαν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐκ τῶν ἁγίων τοῦ αὐρανοῦ</span>. St. Paul spiritualises the idea “to me … this grace was given to preach to the Gentiles … in order that now might be made known to the principalities and the authorities in heavenly places by means of the Church the very-varied wisdom of God” (<a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a> ff.). St. Peter reproduces faithfully the simplicity of the original and represents this longing as still unsatisfied since the Church is not yet perfect or complete. It thus becomes part of the sympathetic groaning and travailing of the whole creation (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm" title="For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.">Romans 8:22</a> f.). In <a href="/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a> St. Peter states on the same authority that Christ preached to the spirits in prison; adding that when he ascended all angels were subjected to Him. The apparent contradiction is due to the discrepancy between the ideal and its gradual realisation and not to an imperfect coordination of these conceptions of the universal sovereignty of God. See <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a> f., <a href="/hebrews/2-7.htm" title="You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:">Hebrews 2:7</a> f., <span class="ital">not yet do we see</span> …—<span class="greekheb">παρακύψαι</span> has lost its suggestion of peeping through its use in the LXX for <span class="greekheb">שקף</span> <span class="ital">look forth</span> though it is not employed by them in the places where God is said to <span class="ital">look down from</span> heaven (<a href="/psalms/14-2.htm" title="The LORD looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.">Psalm 14:2</a>, etc.). The patristic commentators seem to hold by the Evangelist rather than the Apostle in respect to the saying, as they refer exclusively for illustration to the O.T. figures, Moses (<a href="/hebrews/11-26.htm" title="Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward.">Hebrews 11:26</a>), Isaiah (<a href="/john/12-41.htm" title="These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.">John 12:41</a>).

That the angels of Peter are due to Enoch and secondary seems to be borne out by the Targum of <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm" title="All things are full of labor; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>, “In all the words that are prepared (about) to come to pass in the world the ancient prophets wearied themselves and could not find their ends”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[144] Codex Mosquensis (sæc. ix.), edited by Matthæi in 1782.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[145] Codex Ephraemi (sæc. v.), the Paris palimpsest, edited by Tischendorf in 1843.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">searching what, or what manner of time</span>] The two words have each a distinct force, the first indicating the wish of men to fix the date of the coming of the Lord absolutely, the second to determine the note or character of the <span class="bld">season</span> of its approach. Of that craving we find examples in the question “wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” which was met by our Lord with the answer “It is not for you to know the times and the seasons” (<a href="/context/acts/1-6.htm" title="When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?...">Acts 1:6-7</a>), in the over-heated expectations which St Paul checks in <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,...">2 Thessalonians 2:1-12</a>, in the hopes that were met by the mocking scorn which St Peter himself rebukes in <a href="/context/2_peter/3-3.htm" title="Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,...">2 Peter 3:3-8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Spirit of Christ which was in them</span>] It will hardly be questioned that the name thus given to the Spirit, as compared with <a href="/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.">Romans 8:9</a> and <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>, primarily suggests the thought of prophets who were living and working in the Christian Church rather than of those of the older Church of Israel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when it testified beforehand the sufferings</span>] To the English readers these words naturally seem decisive in favour of the current interpretation, and against that which is here suggested. But they seem so only because they are a mistranslation of the original. When St Peter wishes to speak of the “sufferings <span class="ital">of</span> Christ,” he uses a different construction (chap. <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm" title="But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.">1 Peter 4:13</a>, <a href="/1_peter/5-1.htm" title="The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:">1 Peter 5:1</a>), as St Paul does (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>). Here the phrase, as has been noticed above, is different. St Peter speaks of <span class="bld">the sufferings (which pass on) unto Christ</span>. The thought is identical with that of St Paul’s, expressed in terms so analogous that it is a marvel that their bearing on this passage should have escaped the notice of commentators. “As the sufferings of Christ abound toward us,” St Paul says (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>), “so also does our consolation.” He thinks of the communion between Christ and His people as involving their participation in His sufferings. Is it not obvious that St Peter presents in almost identical phraseology the converse of that thought, and that the “sufferings” spoken of are those which the disciples were enduring for Christ, and which he thinks of as shared by Him, flowing over to Him? That predictions of such sufferings, sometimes general, sometimes personal, entered largely into the teaching of the prophets of the New Testament we see from <a href="/acts/11-28.htm" title="And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.">Acts 11:28</a>; <a href="/acts/20-23.htm" title="Save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.">Acts 20:23</a>; <a href="/acts/21-11.htm" title="And when he was come to us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus said the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that ownes this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.">Acts 21:11</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-3.htm" title="You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.">2 Timothy 2:3</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm" title="If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:">2 Timothy 2:12</a>.

The Authorized Version neglects the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>. The apostle says that the Spirit of Christ dwelt in the prophets. The words <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> cannot mean "the Spirit which bears witness of Christ," as Bengel and others. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ (see <a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>). He is not only sent from the Father by the Son, but he proceedeth from the Father and the Son. This important statement involves also the pre-existence and the Divinity of Christ (comp. <a href="/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56, 58</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="/jude/1-5.htm">Jude 1:5</a>, in the best-supported reading). The prophets felt within them the working of the Spirit. They knew that the mysterious voice which filled their souls was his voice. Its utterances were not always clear; they were sometimes obscure and mystical, but the heart of the prophets was stirred to the utmost; they sought with earnest prayer and devout thought into the purposes of God announced in the revelation. Especially they asked, as the apostles asked the Lord on the Mount of Olives, "When shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming?" At what time would the Messiah be revealed? What would be the distinctive character, the marks, the signs, of that time? "Prophetae ab ipso habentes donum in ilium prophetarunt" ('Ep. Barnab.,' 100. 5). When it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow; rather, <span class="accented">the sufferings for Christ</span> (destined for Christ), <span class="accented">and the glories after these</span>. Compare St. Peter's speech (<a href="/acts/3-18.htm">Acts 3:18</a>), "Those things which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled." So St. Paul, in his speech before King Agrippa (<a href="/acts/26-22.htm">Acts 26:22, 23</a>), asserts that he had said "none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead." The doctrine of a suffering Messiah was a stumbling-block to the Jews. The apostles could not understand it till after the Savior's resurrection; Peter himself had recoiled from it with horror, and had been rebuked by the Lord (<a href="/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22, 23</a>); now, taught by the Spirit, he understands the foreshadowings of the sufferings of Christ, which the Spirit of Christ had testified to the prophets. The Lord himself had expounded, on the day of his resurrection, the things concerning himself, beginning at Moses and all the prophets: "Ought not Christ," he said, "to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?" (<a href="/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>). Some think that St. Peter is referring mainly to the prophets of the New Testament, and that the words, "the sufferings of Christ," are to be understood mystically of Christ suffering in his Church, as "the afflictions of Christ" in <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>. But the context does not require this explanation, and the parallel passages quoted above seem to preclude it. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Did signify (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Imperfect tense: better, was declaring, all along through the prophetic age, in successive prophets. See the same verb in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-14.htm">2 Peter 1:14</a> :.<p>When it testified beforehand (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here in New Testament.<p>Of Christ (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., unto Christ. So Rev., in margin. The sufferings destined for Christ, as in <a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10</a> he speaks of the grace, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;, unto you; i.e., destined to come unto you. Peter was especially concerned to show that the sufferings of Christ were in fulfilment of prophecy, because it was a subject of dispute with the Jews whether the Christ was to suffer (<a href="/acts/3-18.htm">Acts 3:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/26-22.htm">Acts 26:22</a>, <a href="/acts/26-23.htm">Acts 26:23</a>).<p>The glory (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., correctly, the glories. The plural is used to indicate the successive steps of his glorification; the glory of his resurrection and ascension, of the last judgment, and of the kingdom of heaven. </body></html>
