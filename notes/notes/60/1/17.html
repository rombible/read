(See Note on <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1Thessalonians 4:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Ye call on the Father.</span>—We might paraphrase by “if you use the Lord’s Prayer.” (Refer again to <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-14.htm" title="As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:">1Peter 1:14</a>.) The word seems not only to mean “if you <span class= "ital">appeal</span> to the Father,” but “if you appeal to the Father by the <span class= "ital">title</span> of Father.” (Comp. <a href="/romans/8-15.htm" title="For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Who without respect of persons judgeth.</span>—This “judgeth,” or <span class= "ital">decideth, </span>refers not only to the great judgment of the last day, but is used in reference to the word “if ye <span class= "ital">call upon</span> the Father.” That word has a forensic sense (in which it is used in <a href="/acts/25-11.htm" title="For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.">Acts 25:11</a>) of lodging an <span class= "ital">appeal, </span>and every time we lodge our appeal to the Father on the ground of His Fatherhood, He decides the case, but decides it without favour—makes no allowance to our wrong doing on the ground of being His regenerate children, and certainly none on the ground of being of the Hebrew race. That this last notion finds place here we may see from St. Peter’s words in <a href="/context/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:">Acts 10:34-35</a>. He decides “according to every man’s work”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>upon the individual merits of the case before Him. The man’s “work” (not “works”) embraces all his conduct in the lump, as a single performance, which is either good on the whole or bad on the whole.<p><span class= "bld">Pass the time . . . in fear.</span>—The word for “pass” really is the same as the “conversation” of <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm" title="But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;">1Peter 1:15</a>, and is intended to take our thought back to it: “As obedient children, be holy in every part of your conduct; and if you wish for favour from the Father, see that that conduct is characterised by <span class= "ital">fear.” “</span>This fear,” says Archbishop Leighton, “is not cowardice (nor superstition, we may add); it drowns all lower fears, and begets true fortitude; the righteous dare do anything but offend God. Moses was bold and fearless in dealing with a proud and wicked king, but when God appeared he said (as the Apostle informs us), ‘I exceedingly fear and quake.’“ This extract well contrasts with the meaning which some would apparently thrust into the word “fear,” as though it meant that the position of the Christians, as “aliens” in the midst of a hostile world, required a timid attitude towards man. The “fear” of the <span class= "ital">Father</span> may be seen in the first two clauses of the Lord’s Prayer itself.<p><span class= "bld">Your sojourning.</span>—See on <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>, “strangers.” Because the word is metaphorical here and in <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>, is no reason why the similar word should be so there, in quite a different context. The expression here sets a limit for the discipline of fear, and at the same time suggests a reason for it—children though they are, they are not yet entered on their “inheritance” (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1Peter 1:4</a>), and have to secure it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/1_peter/1.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>1 Peter<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">FATHER AND JUDGE</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_peter/1-17.htm" title="And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:">1 Peter 1:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘If ye call on Him as Father,’ when ye pray, say, ‘Our Father which art in heaven.’ One can scarcely help supposing that the Apostle is here, as in several other places in his letter, alluding to words that are stamped ineffaceably upon his memory, because they had dropped from Christ’s lips. At all events, whether there is here a distinct allusion to what we call the Lord’s Prayer or no, it is here recognised as the universal characteristic of Christian people that their prayers are addressed to God in the character of Father. So that we may say that there is no Christianity which does not recognise and rejoice in appealing to the paternal relationship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, then, I suppose in Peter’s days, as in our days, there were people that so fell in love with one aspect of the Divine nature that they had no eyes for any other; and who so magnified the thought of the Father that they forgot the thought of the Judge. That error has been committed over and over again in all ages, so that the Church as a whole, one may say, has gone swaying from one extreme to the other, and has rent these two conceptions widely apart, and sometimes has been foolish enough to pit them against each other instead of doing as Peter does here, braiding them together as both conspiring to one result, the production in the Christian heart of a wholesome awe. If ye call on Him as Father ‘who, without respect of persons, judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So then, look at this twofold aspect of God’s character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Both these conceptions ought to be present, flamingly and vividly, burning there before him, to every Christian man. ‘Ye call Him Father,’ but the Father is the Judge. True, the Judge is Father, but Peter reminds us that whatever blessed truths may be hived in that great Name of Father, to be drawn thence by devout meditation and filial love, there is not included in it the thought of weak-minded indulgence to His children, in any of their sins, nor any unlikelihood of inflicting penal consequences on a rebellious child. ‘Father’ does not exclude ‘Judge,’ ‘and without respect of persons He judgeth.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Without respect of persons’--the word is a somewhat unusual New Testament one, but it has special appropriateness and emphasis on Peter’s lips. Do you remember who it was that said, and on what occasion he said it: ‘Now I perceive that God is no respecter of persons’? It was Peter when he had learned the lesson on the housetop at Joppa, looking out over the Mediterranean, and had it enforced by Cornelius’ message. The great thought that had blazed upon him as a new discovery on that never-be-forgotten occasion, comes before him again, and this unfamiliar word comes with it, and he says, ‘without respect of persons He judges.’ Mountains are elevated, valleys are depressed and sunken, but I fancy that the difference between the top of Mount Everest and the gorge through which the Jordan runs would scarcely be perceptible if you were standing on the sun. Thus, ‘without respect of persons,’ great men and little, rich men and poor, educated men and illiterate, people that perch themselves on their little stools and think themselves high above their fellows: they are all on one dead level in the eye of the Judge. And this question is as to the quality of the work and not as to the dignity of the doer. ‘Without respect of persons’ implies universality as well as impartiality. If a Christian man has been ever so near God, and then goes away from Him, he is judged notwithstanding his past nearness. And if a poor soul, all crusted over with his sins and leprous with the foulness of long-standing iniquity, comes to God and asks for pardon, he is judged according to his penitence, ‘without respect of persons.’ That great hand holds an even balance. And though the strictness of the judicial process may have its solemn and its awful aspect, it has also its blessed and its comforting one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, do not run away with the notion that the Apostle is speaking here of that great White Throne and the future judgment that for many of us lies, inoperative on our creeds, on the other side of the great cleft of death. That is a solemn thought, but it is not Peter’s thought here. If any of you can refer to the original, you will see that even more strongly than in our English version, though quite sufficiently strongly there, the conception is brought out of a continuous Divine judgment running along, all through a man’s life, side by side with his work. The judgment here meant is not all clotted together, as it were, in that final act of judgment, leaving the previous life without it, but it runs all through the ages, all through each man’s days. I beseech you to ponder that thought, that at each moment of each of our lives an estimate of the moral character of each of our deeds is present to the Divine mind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Of course we believe that,’ you say. ‘That is commonplace; not worth talking about.’ Ah! but because we believe it, as of course, we slip out of thinking about it and letting it affect our lives. And what I desire to do for you, dear friends, and for myself, is just to put emphasis on the one half of that little word ‘judgeth’ and ask you to take its three last letters and lay them on your minds. Do we feel that, moment by moment, these little spurs of bad temper, these little gusts of worldliness, that tiny, evanescent sting of pride and devildom which has passed across or been fixed in our minds, are all present to God, and that He has judged them already, in the double sense that He has appraised their value and estimated their bearing upon our characters, and that He has set in motion some of the consequences which we shall have to reap?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Oh! one sometimes wishes that people did not so much believe in a future judgment, in so far as it obscures to them the solemn thought of a present and a continuous one. ‘Verily, there is a God that judgeth in the earth,’ and, of course, all these provisional decisions, which are like the documents that in Scotch law are said to ‘precognosce the case,’ are all laid away in the archives of heaven, and will be produced, docketed and in order, at the last for each of us. Christian people sometimes abuse the doctrine of justification by faith as if it meant that Christians at the last were not to be judged. But they are, and there is such a thing as ‘salvation yet so as by fire,’ and such a thing as salvation in fulness. Do not let filial confidence drive out legitimate fear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He ‘judges according to every man’s work.’ I do not think it is extravagant attention to niceties to ask you to notice that the Apostle does not say ‘works,’ but ‘work’; as if all the separate actions were gathered into a great whole, as indeed they are, because they are all the products of one mind and character. The trend and drift, so to speak, of our life, rather than its isolated actions and the underlying motives, in their solemn totality and unity, these are the materials of this Divine judgment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, let me say a word about the disposition which the Apostle enjoins upon us in the view of these facts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Judge is the Father, the Father is the Judge. The one statement proclaims the merciful, compassionate, paternal judgment, the other the judicial Fatherhood. And what comes from the combination of these two ideas, which thus modify and illuminate one another? ‘Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.’ What a descent that sounds from the earlier verses of the letter: ‘In whom, though now ye see Him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.’ Down from those heights of ‘joy unspeakable,’ and ‘already glorified,’ the apostle drops plump into this dungeon: ‘Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.’ Of course, I need not remind you that the ‘fear’ here is not the ‘fear which hath torment’; in fact, I do not think that it is a fear that refers to God at all. It is not a sentiment or emotion of which God is the object. It is not the reverent awe which often appears in Scripture as ‘the fear of God,’ which is a kind of shorthand expression for all modes of devout sentiment and emotion; but it is a fear, knowing our own weakness and the strong temptations that are round us, of falling into sin. That is the one thing to be afraid of in this world. If a man rightly understood what he is here for, then the only thing that he would be terrified for would be that he should miss the purpose of his being here and lose his hold of God thereby. There is nothing else worth being afraid of, but that is worth being afraid of. It is not slavish dread, nor is it cowardice, but the well-grounded emotion of men that know themselves too well to be confident and know the world too well to be daring and presumptuous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Don’t you think that Peter had had a pretty rough experience in his life that had taught him the wisdom of such an exhortation? And does it not strike you as very beautiful that it should come, of all people in the world, from his lips? The man that had said, ‘Though all should forsake Thee, yet will not I.’ ‘Why cannot I follow Thee now?’ ‘Bid me come to Thee on the water.’ ‘This be far from Thee, Lord, it shall not be unto Thee’--the man that had whipped out his sword in the garden, in a spasm of foolish affection, now, in his quiet old age, when he has learnt the lesson of failures and follies and sins and repentance, says in effect: ‘Remember me, and do not you be presumptuous.’ ‘Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.’ ‘If I had known myself a little better, and been a little more afraid of myself, I should not have made such a fool of myself or such shipwreck of my faithfulness.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Dear friends, no mature Christian is so advanced as that he does not need this reminder, and no Christian novice is so feeble as that, keeping obedient to this precept, he will not be victorious over all his evils. The strongest needs to fear; the weakest, fearing, is safe. For such fearfulness is indispensable to safety. It is all very well to go along with sail extended and a careless look-out. But if, for instance, a captain keeps such when he is making the mouth of the Red Sea where there are a narrow channel and jagged rocks and a strong current, if he has not every man at his quarters and everything ready to let go and stop in a moment, he will be sure to be on the reefs before he has tried the experiment often. And the only safety for any of us is ever to be on the watch, and to dread our own weakness. ‘Blessed is the man that feareth always.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such carefulness over conduct and heart is fully compatible with all the blessed emotions to which it seems at first antagonistic. There is no discord between the phrase that I have quoted about ‘joy unspeakable and full of glory,’ and this temper, but rather the two help one another. And such blended confidence and fear are the parents of courage. The man that is afraid that he will do wrong and so hurt himself and grieve his Saviour, is the man that will never be afraid of anything else. Martyrs have gone to the stake ‘fearing not them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do,’ because they were so afraid to sin against God that they were not afraid to die rather than to do it. And that is the temper that you and I should have. Let that one fear, like Moses’ rod, swallow up all the other serpents and make our hearts impervious to any other dread.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Pass the time of your sojourning.’ You do not live in your own country, you are in an alien land. You are passing through it. Troops on the march in an enemy’s country, unless they are led by an idiot, will send out clouds of scouts in front and on the wings to give timeous warning of any attempted assault. If we cheerily and carelessly go through this world as if we were marching in a land where there were no foes, there is nothing before us but defeat at the last. Only let us remember that sleepless watchfulness is needed only in this time of sojourning, and that when we get to our own country there is no need for such patrols and advance guards and rearguards and men on the flank as were essential when we were on the march. People that grow exotic plants here in England keep them in glass houses. But when they are taken to their native soil the glass would be an impertinence. As long as we are here we have to wear our armour, but when we get yonder the armour can safely be put off and the white robes that had to be tucked up under it lest they should be soiled by the muddy ways can be let down, for they will gather no pollution from the golden streets. The gates of that city do not need to be shut, day nor night. For when sin has ceased and our liability to yield to temptation has been exchanged for fixed adhesion to the Lord Himself, then, and not till then, is it safe to put aside the armour of godly fear and to walk, unguarded and unarmed, in the land of perpetual peace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_peter/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_peter/1-17.htm" title="And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:">1 Peter 1:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">And if ye call on the Father </span>— With an expectation of being heard; or, as you desire or expect audience and acceptance at God’s hands; <span class="ital">who, without respect of persons </span>— Which can have no place with God; see note on <a href="/romans/2-11.htm" title="For there is no respect of persons with God.">Romans 2:11</a>; <span class="ital">judgeth according to every man’s work </span>— According to the tenor of his life and conversation; <span class="ital">pass the time of your sojourning </span>— The short season of your abode on earth; <span class="ital">in fear </span>— In the reverential and awful fear of God, in an humble and loving fear of offending him, in a watchful fear of your spiritual enemies, and in a jealous fear of yourselves, lest a promise being left you of entering into his rest, you should, through lukewarmness, sloth, and indolence, or through levity, carelessness, and negligence, after all, come short of it. This fear is a proper companion and guard of hope. The word <span class="greekheb">παροικια</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">sojourning, </span>properly signifies the stay which travellers make in a place while finishing some business. The term, therefore, is applied with great propriety to the abode of the children of God in the present world, as it signifies that this earth is not their home, and that they are to remain in it only a short time. See on <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm" title="These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.">Hebrews 11:13</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Holy confidence in God as a Father, and awful fear of him as a Judge, agree together; and to regard God always as a Judge, makes him dear to us as a Father. If believers do evil, God will visit them with corrections. Then, let Christians not doubt God's faithfulness to his promises, nor give way to enslaving dread of his wrath, but let them reverence his holiness. The fearless professor is defenceless, and Satan takes him captive at his will; the desponding professor has no heart to avail himself of his advantages, and is easily brought to surrender. The price paid for man's redemption was the precious blood of Christ. Not only openly wicked, but unprofitable conversation is highly dangerous, though it may plead custom. It is folly to resolve, I will live and die in such a way, because my forefathers did so. God had purposes of special favour toward his people, long before he made manifest such grace unto them. But the clearness of light, the supports of faith, the power of ordinances, are all much greater since Christ came upon earth, than they were before. The comfort is, that being by faith made one with Christ, his present glory is an assurance that where he is we shall be also, Joh 14:3. The soul must be purified, before it can give up its own desires and indulgences. And the word of God planted in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is a means of spiritual life, stirring up to our duty, working a total change in the dispositions and affections of the soul, till it brings to eternal life. In contrast with the excellence of the renewed spiritual man, as born again, observe the vanity of the natural man. In his life, and in his fall, he is like grass, the flower of grass, which soon withers and dies away. We should hear, and thus receive and love, the holy, living word, and rather hazard all than lose it; and we must banish all other things from the place due to it. We should lodge it in our hearts as our only treasures here, and the certain pledge of the treasure of glory laid up for believers in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And if ye call on the Father - That is, if you are true Christians, or truly pious - piety being represented in the Scriptures as calling on God, or as the worship of God.

He who is your Father, is also your Judge&#8212;a thought which may well inspire reverential fear. Theophylact observes, A double fear is mentioned in Scripture: (1) elementary, causing one to become serious; (2) perfective: the latter is here the motive by which Peter urges them as sons of God to be obedient. Fear is not here opposed to assurance, but to carnal security: fear producing vigilant caution lest we offend God and backslide. "Fear and hope flow from the same fountain: fear prevents us from falling away from hope" [Bengel]. Though love has no fear IN it, yet in our present state of imperfect love, it needs to have fear going ALONG WITH It as a subordinate principle. This fear drowns all other fears. The believer fears God, and so has none else to fear. Not to fear God is the greatest baseness and folly. The martyrs' more than mere human courage flowed from this.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And if; </span> this particle is used here, and frequently elsewhere, not as a note of doubting, but by way of assertion, and supposition of a thing known. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye call on the Father; </span> either this is to be meant of invocation, their calling on God in prayer; and then the sense is: If you be servants and worshippers of the Father; prayer being many times put for the whole worship of God, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/43-22.htm" title="But you have not called on me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of me, O Israel.">Isaiah 43:22</a> <a href="/acts/9-11.htm" title="And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prays,">Acts 9:11</a></span>: or, of their calling God, Father, as <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/6-9.htm" title="After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.">Matthew 6:9</a></span>; and then the sense is: If you would be counted God’s children, <span class="bld"><a href="/james/2-7.htm" title="Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which you are called?">Jam 2:7</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who, without respect of persons; </span> and so will no more excuse you that are Jews, and descended from Abraham, than those that are born of Gentile parents, <span class="bld"><a href="/job/34-19.htm" title="How much less to him that accepts not the persons of princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.">Job 34:19</a> <a href="/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:">Acts 10:34</a> <a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm" title="And, you masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.">Ephesians 6:9</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Judgeth; </span> and so is not a Father only, but a Judge, and that a most righteous one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">According to every man’s work; </span> i.e. works, the singular number put for the plural, as <span class="bld"><a href="/james/1-25.htm" title="But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.">Jam 1:25</a></span>: see <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/2-6.htm" title="Who will render to every man according to his deeds:">Romans 2:6</a> <a href="/job/34-11.htm" title="For the work of a man shall he render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.">Job 34:11</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Pass the time of your sojourning here; </span> the word signifies the temporary abode of a man in a place where he was not born, or doth not ordinarily reside; such being the condition of believers in the world, that they are sojourners, not citizens of it; they are travelling through it to their Father’s house and heavenly country, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm" title="By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:">Hebrews 11:9</a>,10,13,16</span>.

Of Christ, and of all the saints; or "seeing" ye do. This is a fresh argument, engaging to holiness of life and conversation. Invocation of God includes the whole worship of him, the performance of every outward duty, and the exercise of every inward grace, particularly it designs prayer; and whoever are concerned in one, or the other, God will be sanctified by all them that draw nigh unto him: or the phrase may here intend an asserting God to be their Father, under the influence of the spirit of adoption; and all such that do claim so near a relation to God ought to honour and obey him, and to be followers of him: whoever call God their Father, and themselves his children, ought to be careful that they do not blaspheme, or cause to be blasphemed, that worthy name by which they are called: <p>who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work. This is another reason why men should be holy, taken from the general judgment; for this God that is a Father, is also a judge. There is a judgment after death, which is sure and certain, and reaches to all persons and things; and though the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son, yet he will judge everyone by that man Christ, whom he has ordained to be the Judge of quick and dead: before his judgment seat all must stand, where they will be impartially, and without respect of persons, tried; no account will be had of what nation and place they are, whether Jews or Gentiles, or of this, or the other country, unless to aggravate or lessen their condemnation; for it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, for Sodom and Gomorrah, than for such who have been favoured with a Gospel revelation, and believe it not; nor from what parents they have descended, for the soul that sins, that shall die; nor of what age and sex they are, small and great shall stand before him; nor of what state and condition, rich or poor, high or low, bond or free; or of what religious sect and denomination, or whether they have conformed to some external things or not; no regard will be had to any outward appearance or profession. The Judge will not judge according to the sight of the eyes, and outward view of things; for he looks on the heart, and knows the secret springs of all actions; and according thereunto will he judge and pass the sentence; and therefore what manner of persons ought men to be, in all holy conversation and godliness? Hence it follows, <p>pass the time of your sojourning here in fear; the people of God in this world are "sojourners", as all their fathers were; they are not natives of the place in, which they are; though they are in the world, they are not of it; they were natives of it by their first birth, but by their second they are born again from above, and so, belong to another place; they are of another country, even an heavenly one; are citizens of another city, a city which, has foundations, whose builder and maker is God, their citizenship is in heaven; and there is their Father's house, which is not made with hands, and is eternal; and there lies their estate, their inheritance; and though they dwell here below, neither their settlement nor their satisfaction are here; they reckon themselves not at home while they are on earth, and are strangers in it, to the men of the world, and they to them; with whom they have not, or at least ought not to have, any fellowship. It is indeed but for a "time", that they are sojourners, not an eternity; which time is fixed, and is very short, and will be quickly gone; it is but a little while, and Christ wilt come and take them home to his Father's house, where they shall be for ever with him; for it is only here on earth that they are pilgrims and strangers: and while they are so they should spend their time "in fear"; not of men nor of devils, nor of death and judgment, hell and eternal damnation; for such a fear is not consistent with the love of God shed abroad in the heart, and is the effect of the law, and not encouraged by the Gospel; is in natural men, yea, in devils themselves; but in the fear of God, and which springs from the grace of God, and is increased by it; is consistent with the strongest acts of faith, and with the greatest expressions of spiritual joy; is opposite to pride and self-confidence, and includes the whole worship of God, external and internal, and a religious conversation, in humility and lowliness of mind. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> And if ye <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning <i>here</i> in fear:</span><p>(10) As before he distinguished true faith and hope from false, so does he now obedience, setting the quick and sharp sight of God, against an outward mask, and earnest reverence against vain severity.<p>(i) If you will be called the sons of that father.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_peter/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_peter/1-17.htm" title="And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:">1 Peter 1:17</a>.

"If" does not imply doubt; it introduces an hypothesis which, being taken for granted, involves a duty. Apparently there is here a reference to the Lord's Prayer, as in <a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>. You call on God as your Father; then pass your time in fear (comp. <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>, "If I be a Father, where is mine honor?"). He called you first; now ye call on him. The translation of the Revised Version is more exact than the Authorized Version, "If ye call on him as Father." Who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work. The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, rendered "without respect of persons," occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; but the thought is familiar. St. Peter himself had said, when he was sent to receive Cornelius into the Church, "Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons" (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>). The disciples of the Pharisees had said the same of our Lord (<a href="/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>; comp. also <a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>; <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1-4</a>). The Lord said (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>), "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son." But the Father is "Fens judicii," as Didymus says (quoted by Alford), "judicante Filio, Pater est qu;. judicat," for the Son judges as his Delegate; as it was through the Son that the Father made the worlds. He judges according to every man's work, regarding, not distinctions of rank, or wealth, or nationality, but only the character of the work. Observe that the word "work" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is in the singular number, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>. God judges according to every man's work as a whole, according to the whole scope and meaning of his life as issuing from the one governing principle, whether faith or selfishness. So Bengel, "Unius hominis unum est opus, bouum malumve." Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear. The verb here, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, corresponds with the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> ("conversation") of ver. 15; both might be rendered (as Dean Plumptre suggests) by "conduct" (noun or verb) - "in all your conduct" in ver. 15; and here, "conduct yourselves." The word "sojourning" reminds us of ver. 1 of this chapter and of <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>, in which last place we have the corresponding Greek word. We are sojourners here, life is short; but the character of that short life determines our eternal condition; therefore live in fear. St. John says, "Perfect love casteth out fear;" but there is no contradiction, as some have said, between the two holy apostles; for the fear which cannot coexist with perfect love (it may in various measures coexist with imperfect love) is slavish fear, selfish fear of death and punishment. The fear which St. Peter and St. Paul (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>) commend is holy fear - the fear of a son for a loving father, the fear of displeasing God before whom we walk, God who gave his blessed Son to die for us, God who will judge us at the last. This fear is not cowardice. Our Lord said (<a href="/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>), "Be not afraid of them that kill the body....  Fear him," etc. They who fear God need fear nothing else but God. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>If ye call on the Father - judgeth<p>More correctly, Rev., If ye call on him as Father; the point being that God is to be invoked, not only as Father, but as Judge.<p>Without respect of persons (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Here only.

The constituents of the compound word, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the countenance, and &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;, to receive, are found in <a href="/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>; and the word is the Old-Testament formula to accept or to raise the face of another; opposed to making the countenance fall (<a href="/job/29-24.htm">Job 29:24</a>; <a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5</a>).

In the Old Testament it is, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, "a neutral expression involving no subsidiary notion of partiality, and is much oftener found in a good than in a bad sense.
