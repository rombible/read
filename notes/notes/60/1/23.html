(Comp., for the argument, <a href="/1_john/5-1.htm" title="Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him.">1John 5:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">By the word of God.</span>—“Seed,” in the beginning of the clause, is more literally the act of <span class= "ital">sowing, </span>or <span class= "ital">engendering, </span>which sowing is carried on “through the living and abiding word of God,” this “word of God” being the actual seed sown. The “seed” of all existence is the spoken Word of God, the expressed will and meaning of creative thought (<a href="/psalms/33-6.htm" title="By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.">Psalm 33:6</a>); and so here, even when spoken mediately, through the lips of men (as explained in <a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1Peter 1:25</a>), it is that which begets men afresh. God creates afresh, though men speak the creative word for Him, just as “it is He that hath made us,” although He does so through natural laws and human powers. The “Word of God” here is, no doubt, the preaching of the gospel, but especially, as it would seem, the preaching of the Resurrection (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>), or of the sufferings and glories of Messiah (<a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>), the “truth” of the last verse. The part taken by “the Word” in the sacrament of regeneration may be seen again in <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,">Ephesians 5:26</a> and <a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>; in connection with the other sacrament we may also refer to <a href="/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.">John 6:63</a>. “Incorruptible” (<span class= "ital">i.e., imperishable</span>; see <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1Peter 1:4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18</a>) finds a more energetic paraphrase here in “living and abiding” (the words “for ever” not being part of the true text). The former epithet is a favourite with St. Peter (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>, <a href="/context/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4-5</a>), and is perhaps borrowed from this place by the author to the Hebrews, in connection with the “word of God” (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a>).

If believers do evil, God will visit them with corrections. Then, let Christians not doubt God's faithfulness to his promises, nor give way to enslaving dread of his wrath, but let them reverence his holiness. The fearless professor is defenceless, and Satan takes him captive at his will; the desponding professor has no heart to avail himself of his advantages, and is easily brought to surrender. The price paid for man's redemption was the precious blood of Christ. Not only openly wicked, but unprofitable conversation is highly dangerous, though it may plead custom. It is folly to resolve, I will live and die in such a way, because my forefathers did so. God had purposes of special favour toward his people, long before he made manifest such grace unto them. But the clearness of light, the supports of faith, the power of ordinances, are all much greater since Christ came upon earth, than they were before. The comfort is, that being by faith made one with Christ, his present glory is an assurance that where he is we shall be also, Joh 14:3. The soul must be purified, before it can give up its own desires and indulgences. And the word of God planted in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is a means of spiritual life, stirring up to our duty, working a total change in the dispositions and affections of the soul, till it brings to eternal life. In contrast with the excellence of the renewed spiritual man, as born again, observe the vanity of the natural man. In his life, and in his fall, he is like grass, the flower of grass, which soon withers and dies away. We should hear, and thus receive and love, the holy, living word, and rather hazard all than lose it; and we must banish all other things from the place due to it. We should lodge it in our hearts as our only treasures here, and the certain pledge of the treasure of glory laid up for believers in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Being born again - See the notes at <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>.<p>Not of corruptible seed - "Not by virtue of any descent from human parents" - Doddridge. The result of such a birth, or of being begotten in this way - for so the word rendered "born again" more properly signifies - is only corruption and decay. We are begotten only to die. There is no permanent, enduring life produced by that. It is in this sense that this is spoken of as, "corruptible seed," because it results in decay and death. The word here rendered "seed" - &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;  spora - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament.<p>But of incorruptible - By truth, communicating a living principle to the soul which can never decay.

Compare the notes at <a href="/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>. It is the uniform doctrine of the Scriptures that divine truth is made the instrument of quickening the soul into spiritual life.<p>Which liveth and abideth forever - This expression may either refer to God, as living forever, or to the word of God, as being forever true. Critics are about equally divided in the interpretation. The Greek will bear either construction. Most of the recent critics incline to the latter opinion - that it refers to the word of God, or to his doctrine. So Rosenmuller, Doddridge, Bloomfield, Wolf, Macknight, Clarke. It seems to me, however, that the more natural construction of the Greek is to refer it to God, as ever-living or enduring; and this interpretation agrees well with the connection. The idea then is, that as God is ever-living, that which is produced directly by him in the human soul, by the instrumentality of truth, may be expected also to endure forever. It will not be like the offspring of human parents, themselves mortal, liable to early and certain decay, but may be expected to be as enduring as its ever-living Creator. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. Christian brotherhood flows from our new birth of an imperishable seed, the abiding word of God. This is the consideration urged here to lead us to exercise brotherly love. As natural relationship gives rise to natural affection, so spiritual relationship gives rise to spiritual, and therefore abiding love, even as the seed from which it springs is abiding, not transitory as earthly things.<p>of &#8230; of &#8230; by&#8212;"The word of God" is not the material of the spiritual new birth, but its mean or medium. By means of the word the man receives the incorruptible seed of the Holy Spirit, and so becomes one "born again": Joh 3:3-5, "born of water and the Spirit": as there is but one Greek article to the two nouns, the close connection of the sign and the grace, or new birth signified is implied. The word is the remote and anterior instrument; baptism, the proximate and sacramental instrument. The word is the instrument in relation to the individual; baptism, in relation to the Church as a society (Jas 1:18). We are born again of the Spirit, yet not without the use of means, but by the word of God. The word is not the beggeting principle itself, but only that by which it works: the vehicle of the mysterious germinating power [Alford].<p>which liveth and abideth for ever&#8212;It is because the Spirit of God accompanies it that the word carries in it the germ of life. They who are so born again live and abide for ever, in contrast to those who sow to the flesh. "The Gospel bears incorruptible fruits, not dead works, because it is itself incorruptible" [Bengel]. The word is an eternal divine power. For though the voice or speech vanishes, there still remains the kernel, the truth comprehended in the voice. This sinks into the heart and is living; yea, it is God Himself. So God to Moses, Ex 4:12, "I will be with thy mouth" [Luther]. The life is in God, yet it is communicated to us through the word. "The Gospel shall never cease, though its ministry shall" [Calovius]. The abiding resurrection glory is always connected with our regeneration by the Spirit. Regeneration beginning with renewing man's soul at the resurrection, passes on to the body, then to the whole world of nature.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Being born again:</span> this may refer either: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

As they were of God, according to his abundant mercy, by the resurrection of Christ, to a lively hope of a glorious inheritance; as in <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a> and therefore seeing they were brethren in a spiritual relation, they ought to love as brethren; being children of the same Father, belonging to the same family and household, having the same spirit, and the same nature and disposition, and being members one of another, and heirs of the same grace and glory; and not only so, but were taught of God their Father, in regeneration, to love one another: it became them highly, therefore, to exercise that grace, and particularly since they were born, <p>not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible; referring not to seed cast into the earth, which first corrupts and dies, and then is quickened, and rises, and brings forth fruit; but to human seed, and which the Jews call , "the filthy drop" (k); which is in itself corrupt, and is corrupted, and whereby the corruption of human nature is propagated; for whatsoever is born of the flesh is carnal and corrupt; and so the apostle has reference to the first birth, or natural generation of men, in which they are polluted and depraved, and confirms what the evangelist says, <a href="/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a> that regenerate persons are not "born of blood"; or become new creatures, and holy men, by their natural descent, or first birth, be it from whom it will; for all men are of one blood originally, and that is tainted with sin; nor by the will of fallen creatures, of corruptible men, themselves or others; but of water, and of the Spirit, of the grace of the Spirit of God, which is seed pure and incorruptible, having no mixture or taint of sin, nor any degree of pollution in it, and which remains so; nor can it be corrupted by all the wickedness there is in man's heart; nor by all the pollutions of the world, or temptations of Satan; and this seed is conveyed into the heart by the Spirit of God, in regeneration, and it contains all grace in it, <p>by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever; for the incorruptible seed, and the ever living and abiding word, are two distinct things; though interpreters generally confound them: and by "the word of God" is either meant the essential Word, the Lord Jesus Christ; who is concerned in regeneration as well as the Father and the Spirit; by whose resurrection, and in consequence of it, the elect of God are begotten again; and who, as the Word, is able to build up all the sanctified ones, and give them the inheritance they are born heirs unto: or the Gospel, the word of truth, which is made use of as a means of begetting souls again; and the rather, since it seems to be so interpreted, <a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm">1 Peter 1:25</a> the phrases, "which liveth and abideth forever", may be either read in connection only with "God", and as descriptive of him, who is the living God, is from everlasting to everlasting, in distinction from idols; and here added, to show that he can give power and efficacy to his word, to regenerate and quicken, and will continue to preserve and make it useful to all his saving purposes; so Jarchi explains the passage in <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a> after referred to, "the word of our God shall stand for ever", <p>"because he lives and abides, and it is in his power to confirm it therefore it follows, "O Zion, that bringeth good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain"; for because he lives forever, this promise is published. <p>Or else with the word of God, and is true both of Christ, and of the Gospel. Christ is the Word which lives; in him, as such, is life; he has life in himself as God, as man, and as Mediator; and is the author of life, natural, spiritual, and, eternal; and abides for ever in his person, without any change; and in his offices and grace, and righteousness; he abides a priest continually, has an unchangeable priesthood, and ever lives to make intercession, and of his kingdom there is no end: the same is said of the "Memra", or Word of God, in the Chaldee paraphrase on <a href="/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a> "I am God",  "my word abideth for ever": compare <a href="/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>. The Gospel also may be said to live, in opposition to the law, which is the killing letter; and because it points out the way of life and salvation to sinners; and is a means of quickening dead sinners, and of ingenerating that faith by which men live on Christ; and of revealing to them that righteousness which is unto justification of life; and of supporting and maintaining spiritual life in them; and of reviving drooping saints; the Syriac version renders it, "the living Word of God": and it remains, and will abide; all its promises, blessings, doctrines, and ordinances, are lasting; it will continue in the world until all the elect of God are gathered in, until the second coming of Christ, and to the end of the world; notwithstanding all the persecutions of men, and cunning, craft of false teachers, and all the ridicule and contempt it is treated with by mockers and scoffers: and will abide in the effects of it, in the hearts of the saints, to all eternity, <p>(k) Pirke Abot, c. 3. sect. 1. &amp; Bartenora in ib.

Luther: “as those who are born afresh;” cf. <a href="/1_john/4-7.htm" title="Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God.">1 John 4:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-1.htm" title="Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him.">1 John 5:1</a>.

On the other hand, the difference of the prepositions points to a distinction to which, from the fact that <span class="greekheb">σπορά</span> is a figurative, <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> a real appellative (Gerhard, Weiss, Schott[103]), justice has not yet been done. The use of the two prepositions is to be understood by supposing a different relation of the same thing (of the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>) to the regeneration; in <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span> we have its point of departure, and not merely its “originating cause” (Hofmann[104]); we have the word of God looked upon as the principle implanted in man working newness of life (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΛΌΓΟς ἜΜΦΥΤΟς</span></span></span>, <a href="/james/1-21.htm" title="Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.">Jam 1:21</a>); <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΆ</span></span></span>, on the other hand, points to the outward instrumentality by which the new life is effected.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΛΌΓΟΥ ΖῶΝΤΟς ΘΕΟῦ ΚΑῚ ΜΈΝΟΝΤΟς</span></span></span>] refers back to <a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1 Peter 1:22</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τῇ ὙΠΑΚΟῇ Τῆς ἈΛΗΘ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>; the Christian is laid under obligation to continued sanctification <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ὙΠ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, inasmuch as he has been begotten again to newness of being, by the word of God, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the word of truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λόγος Θεοῦ</span> is every word of divine revelation; here especially the word which, originating in God, proclaims Christ, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the gospel.

The superaddition of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΟΝΤΟς</span></span></span> arises from the circumstance that this attribute is deduced from the previous one, and is brought in so as to prepare the way for the passage of Scripture (<a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1 Peter 1:25</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΕΙ</span></span></span>) (de Wette[105]). The characteristics specified by these attributes are applicable to the word of God, not in its form, but in its inner substance. It is <span class="ital">living</span> in essence as in effect, and it is <span class="ital">enduring</span>, not only in that its results are eternal, but because itself never perishes. If the subjoined <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα</span> be spurious, then without it the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΕΙΝ</span></span></span> must not be limited to the <span class="ital">present</span> life.[106]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[103] Weiss is of opinion that, as an explanation of the metaphor, <span class="greekheb">διά</span> only can be employed with <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>, not <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>, which belongs exclusively to the figure. This is, however, incorrect; <span class="greekheb">διά</span> would doubtless not have been suited to <span class="greekheb">σπορά</span>, but <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> might very well have been used with <span class="greekheb">λόγου</span> (Cf. <a href="/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a>), indeed, <span class="ital">must</span> have been so if the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> itself were regarded as <span class="greekheb">σπορά</span>. The two prepositions express, each of them, a different relation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[104] Also in the passages quoted by Hofmann, <a href="/john/1-13.htm" title="Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.">John 1:13</a>; <a href="/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a>, <a href="/matthew/1-18.htm" title="Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.">Matthew 1:18</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> indicates more than a mere causal action.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[105] Hofmann strangely enough explains the position of <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> by assuming it to be placed as an apposition between the two predicates to which it serves as basis; he accordingly thinks the words should be written thus: <span class="greekheb">διὰ λόγου ζῶντος</span>, <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ μένοντος</span>(!).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[106] The word, as the revelation of the Spirit, is eternal, although changeable, according to its form; to the word also applies what Paul says, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm" title="So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.">1 Corinthians 15:54</a> : this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality. Luther admirably says: “The word is an eternal, divine power. For although voice and speech pass away, the kernel remains, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the understanding, the truth which the voice contained. Just as, when I put to my lips a cup which contains wine, I drink the wine, although I thrust not the cup down my throat. Thus it is with the word which the voice utters; it drops into the heart and becomes living, although the voice remains outside and passes away. Therefore it is indeed a divine power, it is God Himself.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_peter/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm" title="Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and stays for ever.">1 Peter 1:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀναγεγεννημένοι</span>.

The “corruptible seed” is that which is the cause of man’s natural birth, and the preposition which St Peter uses exactly expresses this thought of an originating cause. In the second clause, on the other hand, he uses the preposition which distinctly expresses instrumentality. The “word of God” is that <span class="bld">through</span> which God, the author of the new life, calls that life into being.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever</span>] The Greek order of the words leaves it doubtful whether the two predicates belong to “the word,” or to “God,” but the sequence of thought is decisive in favour of connecting them with the former. They are used to shew that the word of God, which is the seed of the new birth, is, as has been said, incorruptible. They prepare the way for the emphatic reiteration in <a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1 Peter 1:25</a>, that the “word of the Lord” endureth for ever, the same word being used in the Greek as for the “abideth” of this verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is obvious that the word of God is more here than any written book, more than any oral teaching of the Gospel, however mighty that teaching might be in its effects. If we cannot say that St Peter uses the term LOGOS with precisely the same significance as St John (<a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>), it is yet clear that he thinks of it as a divine, eternal, creative power, working in and on the soul of man. It was “the word of the Lord” which had thus come to the prophets of old, of which the Psalmist had spoken as “a lamp unto his feet,” and “a light unto his path” (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm" title="Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path.">Psalm 119:105</a>). St Peter’s use of the term stands on the same level as that of the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews, who speaks of “the word of God” as “quick and powerful … a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart” (<a href="/context/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart....">Hebrews 4:12-13</a>). It is, i.e., nothing less than God manifested as speaking to the soul of man, a manifestation of which either the preached or the written word may be the instrument, but which may work independently of both, and is not to be identified with either.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm" title="Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and stays for ever.">1 Peter 1:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀναγεγεννημένοι</span>, <span class="ital">being born again</span>) Hence their brotherhood.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ σπορᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">of sowing</span>) The Word of God is <span class="ital">the seed</span>, <span class="greekheb">σπόρος</span>: the preaching of the Word of God, the <span class="ital">sowing</span>, <span class="greekheb">σπορά</span>.

St. Peter repeats the verb used already in ver. 3. It is the highest argument for brotherly love; the children of the one Father are all brethren; they should "love as brethren" (<a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>). Not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. The word used here (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) means, properly, "sowing;" but, like <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/luke/8-11.htm">Luke 8:11</a>), it stands also for the seed; and here the epithets "corruptible" and "incorruptible" seem to necessitate this second meaning. In the passage quoted from St. Luke, the seed (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is identified with the Word. "The seed is the Word of God." Here there seems to be a distinction. God's elect are begotten again of incorruptible seed through the  Word. The use of different prepositions, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> apparently implies a difference between the seed and the Word. In the conversation with Nicodemus the Lord had said, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." And he continues, "That which is born of the flesh [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which seems to correspond with the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of St. Peter] is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;" where the Greek words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "that which is begotten of the Spirit," correspond very nearly with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "those who are begotten again of incorruptible seed." Then the incorruptible seed is the Holy Spirit of God, the Source of all spiritual life; it is the Spirit that "beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God;" "To be spiritually minded is life." Comp. <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>, "Whosoever is born of God (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) cloth not commit sin: for his seed (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) abideth in him: and he cannot sin because he is born of God"). There is a different explanation of this last passage: "God's seed, that is, his children, abide in him." But on the whole, it seems to be parallel with this verse, and to teach the same doctrine, that the first gift of the Spirit is the germ of spiritual life, and that that precious germ, abiding in the true children of God, lives and energizes "till we come... unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (<a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>). But if the Holy Spirit of God is, in the deepest sense, the Seed of the new birth, the Word is the instrument. God's elect are begotten again <span class="accented">through</span> the Word, the Word preached, heard, read, pronounced in holy baptism. The Word preached by St. Peter on the great Day of Pentecost was the means by which three thousand souls were led to be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (comp. <a href="/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>, "Of his own will begat he us with the Word of truth"). Again, the Word preached derives its power from the personal Word, from him who is the Word of God. "All things were made through him" (John L 3; <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>); and as the first creation was through him, so is the new creation. He is "the Beginning of the creation of God" (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>); for he is our Life, the life hidden in the heart. He is the Word of life: "He that hath the Son hath life" (<a href="/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>); "Through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father" (<a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>). It is through the Lord Jesus Christ that we receive the grace of the new birth. The words, "which liveth and abideth," may be connected with the Divine Name: "God, who liveth and abideth; "or, as in our version, with "the Word." The last connection seems most suitable here (comp. ver. 25, "The Word of the Lord abideth for ever;" and <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, "The Word of God is quick and powerful'). The most ancient manuscripts omit the words, "forever." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Being born again (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., having been begotten again.
