which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a> expounds the words “prophesied of the grace in reserve for you.” That is to say, the revelation here spoken of is not a special revelation sent in answer to their laborious musings, but rather the very thing which occasioned them; the perplexity consisted in feeling that God had a further meaning for their words. And the exact limits of the revelation are mentioned: they were shown that they spoke for the benefit of futurity, and no more! What a “trial of faith!” What a sublime disappointment! (<a href="/hebrews/11-40.htm" title="God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.">Hebrews 11:40</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Unto us.</span>—Far the better reading is, <span class= "ital">unto you.</span> It is a distinct characteristic of this Epistle, that “we,” “us,” “our,” are so seldom used (in the best text) where they might have been expected. Where St. Paul throws in his own sympathy, and puts himself on a footing with those whom he addresses, St. Peter utters his lofty pastoral from above. There are but four places in the Epistle (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1Peter 4:17</a>) where he associates himself thus with his brethren, and one of those (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>) is really a quotation, and one (<a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>) at best a very doubtful reading. The same tendency may be observed in his speech (<a href="/acts/15-7.htm" title="And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Men and brothers, you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.">Acts 15:7</a>), where the right reading is “made choice among <span class= "ital">you.</span>”<p><span class= "bld">The things.</span>—In the original simply <span class= "ital">them;</span> so that a semicolon might better follow than a comma, and <span class= "ital">which things</span> be put instead of “which.” The most natural thing is to suppose that the pronoun represents the preceding “sufferings in reserve for Messiah and the glories after.” In what sense, then, could the prophets “minister,” either to themselves or to us, the sufferings and glories of Messiah? The word is one which signifies a servant bringing to his master the things which he needs—commonly used (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/john/12-2.htm" title="There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.">John 12:2</a>) of serving up a meal; and the prophets are said to <span class= "ital">serve</span> the Messianic sufferings and glories to us, to wait upon us with them, to present them to our use and study and comfort. (Comp. <a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm" title="As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.">1Peter 4:10</a>.) When it says, however, that they ministered them “<span class= "ital">not</span> to themselves but to us,” we must not suppose that they derived <span class= "ital">no</span> comfort from their predictions (see <a href="/john/8-56.htm" title="Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.">John 8:56</a>): the “not” must be taken in the same sense as in “I will have mercy and not sacrifice” (<a href="/matthew/9-13.htm" title="But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.">Matthew 9:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Which are now reported unto you.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">which things</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the gospel story) <span class= "ital">now</span> (in contrast with the days of the prophets) <span class= "ital">were</span> (not “are”) <span class= "ital">openly declared to you</span> (in all their details, in contrast with the dim and vague way in which they were seen before). Such is the force of this compound Greek verb in <a href="/john/4-25.htm" title="The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.">John 4:25</a>; <a href="/acts/19-18.htm" title="And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.">Acts 19:18</a>; <a href="/acts/20-20.htm" title="And how I kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,">Acts 20:20</a>; <a href="/acts/20-27.htm" title="For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.">Acts 20:27</a>.<p><span class= "bld">By them that have preached.</span>—More correctly, <span class= "ital">through those who preached;</span> the difference being that St. Peter is referring to the <span class= "ital">first</span> bearers of the gospel to those parts, not to <span class= "ital">all</span> who from that time to the date of the Letter had preached. This is a point well worth noticing. The phrase seems to show that St. Peter himself was not of the number. Perhaps half the churches which received the Letter looked to St. Paul as their founder. (See last Note on <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>.) Here, then, we find the Rock-Apostle authoritatively setting his seal to the teaching of his junior colleague, just as he does in the Second Epistle (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15</a>). It seems to imply that these Jewish Christians were beginning to feel a reaction from St. Paul’s evangelical teaching<span class= "ital">;</span> and the Apostle of the Circumcision is called in to enforce what the Apostle of the Uncircumcision had taught. The revolt of the Hebrew Christians in <span class= "ital">Asia</span> from evangelical teaching appears again at a still later period (<a href="/revelation/2-9.htm" title="I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.">Revelation 2:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-9.htm" title="Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.">Revelation 3:9</a>). It was, perhaps, only with <span class= "ital">Jewish</span> Christians that such an appeal from St. Paul to St. Peter would be made, and need not imply superiority throughout the whole Church. St. Peter’s perfect concurrence with St. Paul here is a sufficient contradiction to the Tubingen theory of their irreconcilable divergence—only the Tubingen school reject the Epistle on the ground that it makes the Apostles too harmonious!<p><span class= "bld">With the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.</span>—The magnificent phrase seems meant to contrast the <span class= "ital">full</span> effusion of the Spirit now, with His limited working in the prophets (<a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1Peter 1:11</a>). But it contains more teaching than this. The tense of the participle “sent” is such as might without violence be rendered “sent once and for ever,” “sent in a moment.” Now, remember that almost undoubtedly some of the recipients of the Letter (see last Note on <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>) were eye-witnesses of His being “sent” to St. Peter and the rest on the Day of Pentecost. St. Peter, then, here claims for St. Paul (and St. Silas perhaps) the very same inspiration with which himself was furnished. And as here he claims full inspiration for St. Paul’s <span class= "ital">preaching, </span>so he does afterwards for his <span class= "ital">writing</span> (<a href="/2_peter/3-15.htm" title="And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given to him has written to you;">2Peter 3:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Which things the angels.</span>—The “which things” here is grammatically parallel to the “which things” of the last sentence, and therefore would mean “the sufferings of Messiah and the glories after.” But logically we have to go back to the beginning of <a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10</a> : “Do I say that <span class= "ital">prophets, </span>who had the mysteries of our redemption on their lips, yet pored in vain to catch the detailed meaning which you catch? Nay; angels (not “<span class= "ital">the</span> angels”), who were present at every detail, and bore an active part in it all (see <a href="/matthew/1-20.htm" title="But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, you son of David, fear not to take to you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-11.htm" title="Then the devil leaves him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him.">Matthew 4:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-2.htm" title="And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it.">Matthew 28:2</a>; <a href="/luke/1-26.htm" title="And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,">Luke 1:26</a>; <a href="/luke/2-9.htm" title="And, see, the angel of the Lord came on them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.">Luke 2:9</a>; <a href="/luke/22-43.htm" title="And there appeared an angel to him from heaven, strengthening him.">Luke 22:43</a>; <a href="/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>),—<span class= "ital">angels, </span>of whom He ‘was <span class= "ital">seen</span>’ (<a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>),—covet now to exchange places with you that they may gaze into the mystery.” The word which has here shrunk into our word “to look into,” means really, <span class= "ital">to bend aside to see.</span> In its literal sense it occurs in <a href="/john/20-5.htm" title="And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.">John 20:5</a>; <a href="/john/20-11.htm" title="But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,">John 20:11</a>, and in <a href="/luke/24-12.htm" title="Then arose Peter, and ran to the sepulcher; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.">Luke 24:12</a> (a verse not found in the best text), of people standing at the side of the cave so as not to get in their own light, and stooping sideways to peer in. Metaphorically it is used in <a href="/james/1-25.htm" title="But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.">James 1:25</a>, where see Note. It seems to mean a strained attention to something which has caught your eye somewhat out of your usual line of sight. Here then, the intention is to show that we are in a better position to understand the mysteries of redemption, not only than prophets, but also than angels; and they covet to stoop from their own point of view to ours. And why so? Not because of the inherent mysteriousness of the union of the two natures in Christ, for of that they are as intelligent as we, or more so; but because they are incapable of fully understanding <span class= "ital">human</span> nature, flesh and blood, with its temptations and pains, its need of a Saviour. In Francia’s great picture, the two angels kneel by weeping Mary and dead Christ without a trace of grief on their countenances. The Son of God Himself only became capable of entering into our infirmities through becoming flesh, and experiencing the same (<a href="/hebrews/2-16.htm" title="For truly he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.">Hebrews 2:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-18.htm" title="For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.">Hebrews 2:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>). Several passages show us that the tragedy of human history is by no means enacted only for the benefit of the actors, but as a lesson (possibly, as Archbishop Whately pointed out, only a single <span class= "ital">illustration</span> out of many in one lesson) for the instruction of unfallen spirits (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm" title="For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.">1Corinthians 4:9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>). Our present passage has impressed itself on Christian lyrics as much, perhaps, as any in the New Testament. Charles Wesley well strikes the meaning in many of his poems: as—<p>“Ask the Father’s Wisdom how,<p>Him that did the means ordain;<p>Angels round our altars <span class= "ital">bow</span><p>To search it out in vain;”<p>or again—<p>“Angels in <span class= "ital">fixt amazement</span><p>Around our altars hover,<p>With <span class= "ital">eager gaze</span> adore the grace<p>Of our Eternal Lover.”<p>Though very possibly the divine intention of the cherubim over the mercy-seat (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm" title="And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.">Exodus 25:20</a>) may have been to symbolise that which is here said, yet it is not to be thought that St. Peter was consciously thinking of the symbol.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_peter/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1 Peter 1:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Unto whom </span>— So searching; <span class="ital">it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us </span>— Not so much for their own benefit as for ours, to whose time the accomplishment of their prophecies was reserved; <span class="ital">they did minister the things which are now reported unto you </span>— Performed the office of foretelling the things, the accomplishment whereof has been declared unto you. In other words, that they did not so much by their predictions serve themselves or that generation, as they have served us, who now enjoy what they only saw afar off. <span class="ital">With the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven </span>— Confirmed by the inward powerful testimony of the Holy Ghost, as well as the mighty effusion of his miraculous gifts. <span class="ital">Which things the angels desire to look into </span>— To obtain a more perfect insight into, and knowledge of, as being matters of their admiration and delight, because in them the manifold wisdom of God is displayed, and by them the salvation of men is procured and effected, which they rejoice in. The expression, <span class="ital">the angels desire to look into, </span>is literally, <span class="ital">to stoop down to. </span>“But <span class="ital">stooping </span>being the action of one who desires to look narrowly into a thing, it properly means <span class="ital">to look attentively. </span>The omission of the article before <span class="greekheb">αγγελοι</span>, <span class="ital">angels, </span>renders the meaning more grand. Not any particular species of angels, but all the different orders of them, desire to look into the things foretold by the prophets, and preached by the apostles. See <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>. This earnest desire of the angels to contemplate the sufferings of Christ, was emblematically signified by the cherubim placed in the inward tabernacle, with their faces turned down toward the <span class="ital">mercy-seat, </span><a href="/exodus/25-20.htm" title="And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.">Exodus 25:20</a>. To that emblem there is a plain allusion in the word <span class="greekheb">παρακυψαι </span>here, <span class="ital">to stoop. </span>The apostle’s meaning is, If our salvation, and the means by which it is accomplished, are of such importance as to merit the attention of angels, how much more do they merit our attention, who are so much interested in them!” — Macknight.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here is a beautiful gradation: prophets, righteous men, kings, desired to hear and see the things which Christ did and taught, <a href="/matthew/13-17.htm" title="For truly I say to you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them.">Matthew 13:17</a>; but what the Holy Ghost taught concerning Christ, the very angels long to understand.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:10-12 Jesus Christ was the main subject of the prophets' studies. Their inquiry into the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow, would lead to a view of the whole gospel, the sum whereof is, That Christ Jesus was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification. God is pleased to answer our necessities rather than our requests. The doctrine of the prophets, and that of the apostles, exactly agree, as coming from the same Spirit of God. The gospel is the ministration of the Spirit; its success depends upon his operation and blessing. Let us then search diligently those Scriptures which contain the doctrines of salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto whom it was revealed - They were not permitted to know fully the import of the predictions which they were made the instruments of communicating to mankind, but they understood that they were intended for the benefit of future ages.<p>That not unto themselves - We are not to suppose that they derived no benefit from their own predictions; for, as far as they understood the truth, it was as much adapted to sanctify and comfort them as it is us now: but the meaning is, that their messages had reference mainly to future times, and that the full benefit of them would be experienced only in distant ages. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39-40</a>.<p>Unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you - Not unto us by name, but their ministrations had reference to the times of the Messiah; and those to whom Peter wrote, in common with all Christians, were those who were to enjoy the fruits of the communications which they made. The word reported means announced, or made known.<p>By them that have preached the gospel unto you - The apostles, who have made known unto you, in their true sense, the things which the prophets predicted, the import of which they themselves were so desirous of understanding.<p>With the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven - Accompanied by the influences of the Holy Spirit bearing those truths to the heart, and confirming them to the soul. It was the same Spirit which inspired the prophets which conveyed those truths to the souls of the early Christians, and which discloses them to true believers in every age. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13-14</a>; <a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44-45</a>. The object of Peter by thus referring to the prophets, and to the interest which they took in the things which those to whom he wrote now enjoyed, seems to have been, to impress on them a deep sense of the value of the gospel, and of the great privileges which they enjoyed. They were reaping the benefit of all the labors of the prophets. They were permitted to see truth clearly, which the prophets themselves saw only obscurely. They were, in many respects, more favored than even those holy men had been. It was for them that the prophets had spoken the word of the Lord: for them and their salvation that a long line of the most holy men that the world ever saw, had lived, and toiled, and suffered; and while they themselves had not been allowed to understand the fall import of their own predictions, the most humble believer was permitted to see what the most distinguished prophet never saw. See <a href="/matthew/13-17.htm">Matthew 13:17</a>.<p>Which things the angels desire to look into - The object of this reference to the angels is the same as that to the prophets. It is to impress on Christians a sense of the value of that gospel which they had received, and to show them the greatness of their privileges in being made partakers of it. It had excited the deepest interest among the most holy men on earth, and even among the inhabitants of the skies. They were enjoying the full revelation of what even the angels had desired more fully to understand, and to comprehend which they had employed their great powers of investigation. The things which are here referred to, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;  eis ha - unto which) are those which the prophets were so desirous to understand - the great truths respecting the sufferings of Christ, the glory which would follow, and the nature and effects of the gospel. In all the events pertaining to the redemption of a world they felt a deep interest.<p>The word which is rendered "to look," (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  parakupsai,) is rendered "stooping down," and "stooped down," in <a href="/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/20-5.htm">John 20:5</a>, <a href="/john/20-11.htm">John 20:11</a>; looketh, in <a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>; and look, in the place before us. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It properly means, to stoop down near by anything; to bend forward near, in order to look at anything more closely - Robinson, Lexicon. It would denote that state where one, who was before at so great a distance that he could not clearly see an object, should draw nearer, stooping down in order that he might observe it more distinctly. It is possible, as Grotius supposes, that there may be an allusion here to the posture of the cherubim over the mercy-seat, represented as looking down with an intense gaze, as if to behold what was in the ark. But it is not necessary to suppose that this is the allusion, nor is it absolutely certain that that was the posture of the cherubim. See the notes at <a href="/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>. All that is necessarily implied in the language is, that the angels had an intense desire to look into these things; that they contemplated them with interest and fixed attention, like one who comes near to an object, and looks narrowly upon it. In illustration of this sentiment, we may make the following suggestions:<p>I. The angels, doubtless, desire to look into all the manifestations of the character of God, wherever those manifestations are made:<p>(1) It is not unreasonable to suppose that, to a great degree, they acquire the knowledge of God as all other creatures do. They are not omniscient, and cannot be supposed to comprehend at a glance all his doings.<p>(2) they doubtless employ their faculties, substantially as we do, in the investigation of truth; that is, from things known they seek to learn those that are even unknown.<p>(3) it is not unreasonable to suppose that there are many things in relation to the divine character and plans, which they do not yet understand. They know, undoubtedly, much more than we do; but there are plans and purposes of God which are yet made known to none of his creatures. No one can doubt that these plans and purposes must be the object of the attentive study of all holy created minds.<p>(4) they doubtless feel a great interest in the welfare of other beings - of their fellow-creatures, wherever they are. There is in the universe one great brotherhood, embracing all the creatures of God.<p>(5) they cannot but feel a deep interest in man - a fallen creature, tempted, suffering, dying, and exposed to eternal death. This they have shown in every period of the world's history. See the notes at <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>.<p>II. It is probable, that in each one of the worlds which God has made, there is some unique manifestation of his glory and character; something which is not to be found at all in any other world, or, if found, not in so great perfection; and that the angels would feel a deep interest in all these manifestations, and would desire to look into them:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Not only was the future revealed to them, but this also, that these revelations of the future were given them not for themselves, but for our good in Gospel times. This, so far from disheartening, only quickened them in unselfishly testifying in the Spirit for the partial good of their own generation (only of believers), and for the full benefit of posterity. Contrast in Gospel times, Re 22:10. Not that their prophecies were unattended with spiritual instruction as to the Redeemer to their own generation, but the full light was not to be given till Messiah should come; it was well that they should have this "revealed" to them, lest they should be disheartened in not clearly discovering with all their inquiry and search the full particulars of the coming "salvation." To Daniel (Da 9:25, 26) the "time" was revealed. Our immense privileges are thus brought forth by contrast with theirs, notwithstanding that they had the great honor of Christ's Spirit speaking in them; and this, as an incentive to still greater earnestness on our part than even they manifested (1Pe 1:13, &c.).<p>us&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read "you," as in 1Pe 1:10. This verse implies that we, Christians, may understand the prophecies by the Spirit's aid in their most important part, namely, so far as they have been already fulfilled.<p>with the Holy Ghost sent down&#8212;on Pentecost. The oldest manuscripts omit Greek preposition en, that is, "in"; then translate, "by." The Evangelists speaking by the Holy Spirit were infallible witnesses. "The Spirit of Christ" was in the prophets also (1Pe 1:11), but not manifestly, as in the case of the Christian Church and its first preachers, "SENT down from heaven." How favored are we in being ministered to, as to "salvation," by prophets and apostles alike, the latter now announcing the same things as actually fulfilled which the former foretold.<p>which things&#8212;"the things now reported unto you" by the evangelistic preachers "Christ's sufferings and the glory that should follow" (1Pe 1:11, 12).<p>angels&#8212;still higher than "the prophets" (1Pe 1:10). Angels do not any more than ourselves possess an INTUITIVE knowledge of redemption. "To look into" in Greek is literally, "to bend over so as to look deeply into and see to the bottom of a thing." See on [2612]Jas 1:25, on same word. As the cherubim stood bending over the mercy seat, the emblem of redemption, in the holiest place, so the angels intently gaze upon and desire to fathom the depths of "the great mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels" (1Ti 3:16). Their "ministry to the heirs of salvation" naturally disposes them to wish to penetrate this mystery as reflecting such glory on the love, justice, wisdom, and power of their and our God and Lord. They can know it only through its manifestation in the Church, as they personally have not the direct share in it that we have. "Angels have only the contrast between good and evil, without the power of conversion from sin to righteousness: witnessing such conversion in the Church, they long to penetrate the knowledge of the means whereby it is brought about" [Hofman in Alford].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto whom; </span> unto which prophets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">It was revealed; </span> viz. by the Spirit of Christ that was in them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That not unto themselves; </span> who lived before Christ’s coming in the flesh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But unto us; </span> not only apostles, but believers, who live since Christ came. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They did minister; </span> declare and foretell.

The salvation they searched and inquired into, and the grace of it; the time of its being wrought out, and what sort of times they would be when Christ should come, both to the church, and to the world, among Jews and Gentiles; as also what cruel sufferings the Messiah should undergo, and what great glory should be put upon him afterwards: <p>that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister. The Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, read "unto you"; and so do some copies. Not that they were ignorant of the things they searched into, and were revealed unto them, and they prophesied of; as the Jews sometimes say (c) of them, <p>"that they prophesied, and knew not what they prophesied of; <p>though it is not to be supposed that they had such clear and distinct ideas of things as saints have now under the Gospel dispensation; yet they knew much of the grace of the Gospel, and had the comfort of it, and a view of interest in the great salvation, and saw the day of Christ afar off with pleasure: nor that they did not minister, and were not useful to the saints of the age in which they lived; for their prophecies concerning Christ, and salvation by him, were particularly calculated for their spiritual refreshment and comfort, and the support of their faith and hope under afflictive circumstances; but then they were not to have their accomplishment in their times; for though they sometimes speak of them, because of the certainty of them, as if they were already done, yet they knew they were not to be brought about until the last days; and therefore what was written by them, was written for our learning and instruction chiefly and principally, on whom the ends of the world are come; and though they were both profitable to themselves, and others that lived with them, yet they are more so to the saints under the Gospel dispensations, who are able to compare prophesies and facts together: even <p>the things which are now reported unto you; as accomplished facts; such as relate to the person and offices of Christ, and salvation wrought out by him; to his incarnation, obedience, sufferings, death, resurrection, ascension into heaven, and session at the right hand of God; of all which there is a true and faithful report made in the Gospel: <p>by them that have preached the Gospel unto you; meaning himself, and the rest of the apostles, who had been called, and qualified, and sent out by Christ to preach glad tidings, and publish peace, which they had done in the several parts of the world, both to Jew and Gentile: <p>with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; by Christ from the Father, particularly at the day of Pentecost, when the apostles had an extraordinary and plentiful effusion of the Spirit, qualifying them to preach the Gospel to which they were called and sent: and thus, as the great salvation is commended, from the concern that the prophets of old had in it, so from the preaching of it by the apostles, who were influenced and guided by the same Spirit of Christ as they were, and in a far greater manner; and this salvation is still more commended from the great regard the blessed angels have unto it: <p>which things the angels desire to look into. The Vulgate Latin version reads, "into whom"; either into the Holy Spirit, and the things of the Spirit, which he testified in the prophets, and published by the apostles; or rather into Christ, his person, offices, and grace, the allusion being to the cherubim on the mercy seat, a type of Christ, which looked to one another, and to the mercy seat, <a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a> and was true of them in the days of Christ's flesh, when they ascended and descended on the son of man, <a href="/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a> and when he rose from the dead, and went to heaven; for then was he seen and gazed on by angels, as he now is, <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a> or "into which things": so the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read; namely, the sufferings of Christ, and the glories following; the great mystery of redemption and salvation by Christ; the several doctrines of the Gospel, in which the glory of the grace, wisdom, righteousness, truth, and power of God is displayed; things they are highly delighted with, take pleasure in the contemplation of, and desire to have a greater knowledge of, and acquaintance with: they sung glory to God in the highest at the incarnation of Christ; they rejoice at the conversion of a sinner; and disdain not to be ministering spirits to the heirs of salvation; and learn of the church the manifold wisdom of God; which may serve greatly to commend the excellency of Gospel truths, and engage us in the study of them, <p>(c) T.

The addition of this clause brings prominently forward the idea, not that the work of salvation is a mystery,—concealed even from the angels,—but that that which has been proclaimed to the readers is something so glorious that even the angels had a wish and a longing to see what was its fashion, and what the course of its development (cf. <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>). Nor is it implied in <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμοῦσι</span> that “the angels cannot attain to a knowledge of the economy of salvation” (Schott). It is more than doubtful whether there be here any reference to <a href="/exodus/25-20.htm" title="And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.">Exodus 25:20</a>, as several interpreters assume.

Steinmeyer admits that <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is not to he taken <span class="greekheb">αἰτιολογικῶς</span>, but denies at the same time that it states the argumentum <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἀποκαλύψεως</span>; he assumes an inversion, which is to be resolved thus: <span class="greekheb">οἷς ἀπεκαλύφθη</span> (<span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span>, namely <span class="greekheb">τὰ παθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόξαι Χρ</span>.) <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἑαυτοῖς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ὅτι ὑμῖν διηκόνουν αὐτά</span>, and then interprets: h. e. quibus manifestata sunt, non in ipsorum commodum, sed quia nobis ea ministrare jussi erant.

What is meant, still keeping to the line of interpretation here adopted, is that the prophets who had these previsions, at once of the coming sufferings and coming glories of the Church, had not carried on their ministering work for themselves, bounded, i.e., as by local and personal interests, but with a view to those even of the most distant members of the great family of God.

The prophets, doubtless, like Abraham, rejoiced to see the day of Christ; they saw it by faith, and were glad (<a href="/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>); but they saw it in the far distance; they desired to see and hear what the apostles saw and heard, but the time was not yet (see <a href="/matthew/13-16.htm">Matthew 13:16, 17</a>). <span class="accented">They did minister the things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they were made the instruments of revealing them; they presented them to the devout for their spiritual food and support.

St. Peter claims for those who evangelized Asia Minor (St. Paul and his companions) the same authority which was possessed by the ancient prophets; they preached as fulfilled the great truths which the prophets foretold as future. The Spirit of Christ was in the prophets; the same Spirit worked and preached through the apostles; nay, he dwelt in them in fuller measure, for he had been sent down from heaven on the great Day of Pentecost, and it was by his aid that the apostles and evangelists preached. Which things the angels desire to look into. The salvation which God's elect receive is so full of glory and mysterious beauty, that not only did the prophets of old search diligently, but even an gels (there is no article) desire to look into it. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "to stoop sideways;" it is used of persons standing outside a place who stoop in order to look in. "The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> of the verb," says Huther, "indicates that the angels stand outside the work of redemption, inasmuch as it is not for them, but for man (cf. <a href="/hebrews/2-16.htm">Hebrews 2:16</a>)." The same verb occurs in <a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>; <a href="/john/20-5.htm">John 20:5, 11</a>; <a href="/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>, in which last place it is used of Peter himself, when he stooped to look into the empty sepulcher on the morning of the Lord's resurrection. St. Paul has a similar thought in <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>, "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God." The attitude of the golden cherubim, whose wings covered the mercy-seat and whose faces were toward it (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>), seems to imply the same rapt, reverent attention. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Did minister (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;)<p>Imperfect tense, were ministering.

It occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>, describing him who looks into the perfect law of liberty as into a mirror; and in <a href="/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/20-5.htm">John 20:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/20-11.htm">John 20:11</a>, of Peter and John and Mary stooping and looking into the empty tomb. Possibly the memory of this incident unconsciously suggested the word to Peter. The phrase illustrates Peter's habitual emphasis upon the testimony of sight (see Introduction). Bengel acutely notes the hint in &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, beside, that the angels contemplate the work of salvation from without, as spectators and not as participants.
