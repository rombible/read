Notice that it is not “Jesus,” but “Christ,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Messiah. No price short of the “blood,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the death, of the Messiah could free the Jews from the thraldom of their “vain conversation.” (Comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1Peter 1:2</a> and Note.) How Christ’s death freed them from it is not explained here; but we may give a twofold explanation, as we did of His resurrection being our regeneration, in <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>. Historically it did so, because when they came to realise that their Messiah could only reach His glories through suffering it gave them a new insight into the whole meaning of the system under which they had been brought up. It did also, however, doubtless, in a more mysterious way, such as we cannot imagine, procure in God’s sight their emancipation; and the following verses show that again St. Peter is thinking more of the theological than of the phenomenal side of the occurrence.<p><span class= "bld">As of a lamb without blemish and without spot</span>.—We might roughly paraphrase it by, “as of a sacrificial victim, to the sufficiency of whose offering no exception can be taken.” The word “as” shows that in St. Peter’s mind the notion of a “sacrifice,” in reference to the atonement, was only a simile, or metaphor, just as it was with the notion of “ransom.” Once more observe that the sacrifice was offered to effect a redemption which for the readers had already taken place. (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>.) The primary thought in mentioning a “lamb” is, of course, that of sacrifice; but when we come to consider why that particular sacrificial animal was named rather than another, it is, no doubt, for two reasons. First, because of the whiteness, the helplessness, the youth, the innocence, and patience, which make it a natural symbol of our Lord. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Ecce Homo, </span>p. 6, ed. 3.) The second reason is to be found in St. Peter’s own life. The first thing that we know in his history was a putting together of those two words—Messiah, and the Lamb (<a href="/john/1-36.htm" title="And looking on Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!">John 1:36</a>; <a href="/context/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40-41</a>). Neither he nor St. John (see <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) ever forgot that cry of the Baptist. They, no doubt, understood that cry to refer, not primarily to the Paschal, or any other sacrifice, but to <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm" title="He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.">Isaiah 53:7</a>, and perhaps to <a href="/genesis/22-8.htm" title="And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.">Genesis 22:8</a>. A word in the next verse will make it clearer that St. Peter really had the Baptist consciously before his mind when he thus wrote.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:17-25 Holy confidence in God as a Father, and awful fear of him as a Judge, agree together; and to regard God always as a Judge, makes him dear to us as a Father. If believers do evil, God will visit them with corrections. Then, let Christians not doubt God's faithfulness to his promises, nor give way to enslaving dread of his wrath, but let them reverence his holiness. The fearless professor is defenceless, and Satan takes him captive at his will; the desponding professor has no heart to avail himself of his advantages, and is easily brought to surrender. The price paid for man's redemption was the precious blood of Christ. Not only openly wicked, but unprofitable conversation is highly dangerous, though it may plead custom. It is folly to resolve, I will live and die in such a way, because my forefathers did so. God had purposes of special favour toward his people, long before he made manifest such grace unto them. But the clearness of light, the supports of faith, the power of ordinances, are all much greater since Christ came upon earth, than they were before. The comfort is, that being by faith made one with Christ, his present glory is an assurance that where he is we shall be also, Joh 14:3. The soul must be purified, before it can give up its own desires and indulgences. And the word of God planted in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is a means of spiritual life, stirring up to our duty, working a total change in the dispositions and affections of the soul, till it brings to eternal life. In contrast with the excellence of the renewed spiritual man, as born again, observe the vanity of the natural man. In his life, and in his fall, he is like grass, the flower of grass, which soon withers and dies away. We should hear, and thus receive and love, the holy, living word, and rather hazard all than lose it; and we must banish all other things from the place due to it. We should lodge it in our hearts as our only treasures here, and the certain pledge of the treasure of glory laid up for believers in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But with the precious blood of Christ - On the use of the word blood, and the reason why the efficacy of the atonement is said to be in the blood, see the notes at <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>.

Christ was prophesied of as a Redeemer under the Old Testament, <a href="/isaiah/59-20.htm">Isaiah 59:20</a> and the Jews frequently ascribe redemption to the word of the Lord God (f); and which the apostle here attributes to the blood of Christ; whose blood is the same with ours, only not tainted with sin; the blood of an innocent person, and of one who is God, as well as man, and was freely shed in the room and stead of his people, and so a sufficient price for their redemption: and it may truly be said to be "precious": as it is to God, to whom it is a sweet smelling sacrifice, and with which he is well pleased; not that he takes delight in the mere effusion of his blood, but as this is the ransom price, and the atonement of his chosen ones; and so it is to all them that believe, since by it they are justified; through it they have the forgiveness of their sins; their peace and reconciliation with God is made by it; and by it they are sanctified, and have boldness to enter into the holiest of all: and this blood of Christ, by which they are redeemed, <p>is of a lamb without spot and blemish; Christ is comparable to any lamb, for the innocence of his nature, the meekness of his disposition and deportment, and for his patience under sufferings and in death; and to the lambs of the daily sacrifice, which were typical of the continual and constant virtue and efficacy of his sacrifice to take away sin; and particularly to the paschal lamb, he being the true passover sacrificed for us; and which, as also the lambs of the daily sacrifice, and all others, were to be without spot and blemish: and in which they prefigured Christ, who is without the stain of original, and the spot and blemish of actual sin; and so was a very fit person to be a sacrifice for sin, and a Redeemer of his people. The Jews have a notion, that the redemption of the Israelites out of Egypt, when a lamb without blemish was taken, and sacrificed and eaten, had a respect to the future redemption by the Messiah; and which, they say (g), was to be in the same time of the year; that as they were redeemed in Nisan, the month in which the passover was kept, so they were to be redeemed in the same month: and indeed at that time, and in that month, was redemption obtained by the blood of Christ. Of the former, the Targumist in <a href="/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a> says, <p>"I have redeemed them by my word, on the fifteenth day of the month Nisan, and have given silver shekels, the atonement of their souls. <p>It is observable that the Hebrew word signifies both "blood" and "money", or price; whether some reference may not be had to this here, since both are included here, may be considered, <p>(f) Targum in Hos. i. 7. &amp; iii. 2. &amp; in Joel ii. 17.

The precise designation: <span class="ital">a lamb</span>, was probably suggested to Peter by <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm" title="He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.">Isaiah 53:7</a> (cf. chap. <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm" title="Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:">1 Peter 2:22</a> ff.); from this it must not, however, be inferred, with Weiss (p. 227 ff.) and Schott, that there is nowhere here any reference to the idea of sacrifice. For although the passage in Isaiah compares the servant of God to a lamb simply on account of the patience he exhibited in the midst of his sufferings, still it is based so wholly on the idea of sacrifice, and the sufferings of Christ are so expressly presented as propitiatory, that it is easily explainable how, with this passage applied to Him, Christ could have been thought of precisely as a <span class="ital">sacrificial</span> lamb. Doubtless it is not Peter’s intention to give special prominence to the fact that Christ is the <span class="ital">sacrificial</span> lamb designated by Isaiah’s prophecy; for in that case the definite article would not have been wanting (cf. <a href="/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>, and Meyer <span class="ital">in loc</span>.); but alluding to the above passage, Peter styles Him generally a <span class="ital">lamb</span>,—which, however, he conceives as a <span class="ital">sacrificial</span> lamb. There is no direct allusion (Wiesinger) here to the paschal lamb (de Wette-Brückner, Schott); the want of the article forbids it. Hofmann, though he has justly recognised this, still firmly holds by the reference to the paschal lamb;—only in thus far, however, that he terms the slaying of it “the occurrence” which “was here present to the apostle’s mind.”[92] But the fact that the blood of this lamb did not serve to ransom Israel out of Egypt, but to preserve them from the destroying angel, is opposed to any such allusion. Further, it must not be left unnoticed that in the N.

(Wiesinger). All the commentators construe <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span> with what precedes, Hofmann only excepted, who separates it therefrom, and connects it with what follows, taking <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ προεγνωσμένου κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. as an absolute genitive (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> “in that … Christ … was foreordained,” etc.). But this construction does not specify by whose blood the redemption was accomplished, nor does it give a clear logical connection between the thought of the participial and that of the principal clause.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[91] If <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> be taken as instituting a comparison, there then arises the singular thought, that the blood of Christ is as precious as that of a lamb without blemish. Hofmann, indeed, avoids this conclusion by supplying to <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> not <span class="greekheb">τιμίῳ αἵματι</span>, but <span class="greekheb">αἵματι</span> only, and observes that the shedding of blood <span class="ital">alone</span> (not the shedding of precious blood) is compared to the slaying of a spotless lamb; but there is not the slightest justification for thus separating <span class="greekheb">τιμίῳ</span> from <span class="greekheb">αἵματι</span>. The apostle would in some way hare indicated it by prefixing at least a simple <span class="greekheb">αἵματι</span> to <span class="greekheb">ἀμνοῦ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[92] Hofmann says: “The meaning is not, that the same was done to Christ as to the paschal lamb, but the recollection of the paschal lamb explains only how Peter came to compare the shedding of Christ’s blood with the shedding of the blood of a spotless lamb.”—As to whether the paschal lamb should be considered as a sacrificial lamb (Keil on Genesis 12.) or not, is a matter of dispute, which cannot be decided here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[93] Schott, in opposition to this, asserts: “this blood can <span class="ital">redeem</span> because it is that of the divine Mediator (<span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span>), but <span class="ital">it is valuable</span> in that it is the blood of an innocent Saint.” This is, however, erroneous, since this blood has power to redeem only, because Christ shed it as a sacrifice for propitiation. But it is not clear why this blood should not even have its full worth from the fact that it is the blood of the Mediator.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It must be observed that whilst the power of propitiation, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of blotting out sin, is attributed to the blood of the sacrifice, <a href="/leviticus/16-11.htm" title="And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:">Leviticus 16:11</a>, the blood of Christ is here specified as the means by which we are redeemed from the <span class="greekheb">ματαία ἀναστροφή</span>. From this it must not be concluded, with Weiss (p. 279), that the blood of Christ is not regarded here as the blood of offering, inasmuch “as the sacrifice can have an expiatory, but not a redemptory worth;”—for the two are in no way opposed to each other. The expiation is nothing different from the redemption, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> ransom from the guilt by the blood freely shed. <span class="ital">The</span> redemption, however, which is here spoken of, though doubtless not identical with expiation, is yet a necessary condition of it,—a circumstance which Pfleiderer also fails to observe, when he says that the passage has reference only “to the putting away of a life of sin, to moral improvement, not to expiation of the guilt of sin.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_peter/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1 Peter 1:19</a>.

But the description <span class="ital">perfect</span> (<span class="greekheb">τέλειον תמים</span>) is glossed by <span class="greekheb">ἀμώμου</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm" title="Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:">Hebrews 12:14</a>), which is the common translation of <span class="greekheb">תמים</span> in this connection, and <span class="greekheb">ἀσπίλου</span> which summarises the description of sacrificial victims generally (<span class="ital">v.</span> <a href="/leviticus/22-22.htm" title="Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a running sore, or scurvy, or scabbed, you shall not offer these to the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to the LORD.">Leviticus 22:22</a>, etc.). <span class="greekheb">ἀμωμος</span> would be unintelligible to the Gentile, because it has acquired a peculiar meaning from the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">מום</span> <span class="ital">blemish</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἄσπιλος</span> is used by Symmachus in <a href="/job/15-15.htm" title="Behold, he puts no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight.">Job 15:15</a>, for <span class="greekheb">זכך</span>.

Better, <span class="bld">with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot</span>, [even that] <span class="bld">of Christ</span>. That blood, the life which it represented, poured out upon the cross, took its place among the things that were not corruptible, and is contrasted accordingly with the “silver” and the “gold.” With the exception of the substitution of the “blood which is the life” for the life itself, the thought is identical with that of the two passages (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>, <a href="/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>) already referred to. The minds of the disciples had been directed to the “blood” thus understood, as connected with remission of sins, in what we know as the words of institution at the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>, <a href="/mark/14-24.htm" title="And he said to them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.">Mark 14:24</a>, <a href="/luke/22-20.htm" title="Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.">Luke 22:20</a>). In the blood being that of a “lamb,” we trace the impression made on the mind of the Apostle by the words which the Baptist had spoken in the hearing of St John (<a href="/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>), and which are reproduced with so much vividness in the Apocalypse (<a href="/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-12.htm" title="Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.">Revelation 5:12</a>). The question meets us, and is not easy to answer, To what special sacrifice ordained in the law of Moses do they refer? The epithet “without blemish” seems to point to the Paschal lamb (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm" title="Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: you shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:">Exodus 12:5</a>), but neither of the adjectives which St Peter uses is found in the LXX. version in connexion with the Passover. As connected with the deliverance of Israel both from the angel of death and from their bondage in Egypt, the blood so shed might well come to be thought of as the instrument of redemption. Had a lamb been sacrificed on the day of Atonement, that would have seemed the natural type of the death of Christ, but there the victim was a goat (<a href="/leviticus/16-7.htm" title="And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 16:7</a>); the daily morning and evening sacrifice of a lamb (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm" title="Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.">Exodus 29:38</a>) fails as being unconnected with any special act of redeeming love. On the whole, perhaps, it is best to think of the comparison, suggested originally by the Baptist’s words, as pointing to the fact that whatever typical significance had attached to the lamb in any part of the complex ritual of the law had now been realised in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1 Peter 1:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τιμίῳ</span>, <span class="ital">precious</span>) The blood of Christ is <span class="ital">incorruptible</span>, <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1 Peter 1:18</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>, <span class="ital">as</span>) This explains the reason[11] for his use of the word <span class="ital">precious</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀμώμου</span>, <span class="ital">without blemish</span>) Jesus Christ had <span class="ital">in Himself</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀμώμου</span>) no taint of evil.—<span class="greekheb">ἀσπίλου</span>, <span class="ital">without spot</span>) Nor did He contract any stain <span class="ital">from without</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀσπίλου</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[11] This is an instance of the figure Ætiologia, which is used to express the reason why we make use of any particular proposition or assertion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot</span>, (<span class="accented">even the blood</span>) <span class="accented">of Christ</span>. <span class="accented">Precious</span>, as opposed to the "corruptible things" of ver. 18; it is precious, because it is the blood of Christ. Christ's holy body saw not corruption; gold and silver must perish at last; the precious blood in its virtue and efficacy abideth evermore. The blood of Christ is compared with that of a lamb. The lambs and other animals offered as sacrifices were to be without blemish (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-19.htm">Leviticus 22:19, 20, 21</a>); Christ was without sin, pure, harmless, undefiled. The blood of animals could never take away sin; yet it is written, "The life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement for the soul" (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). That blood prefigured the precious blood of Christ, which cleanseth from all sin. The sacrifices of the Law directed the faith of the pious Israelite to the one great Sacrifice, the Propitiation for the sins of the whole world. Probably St. Peter derived the comparison from the well-remembered words of the Baptist, reported by his brother Andrew, "Behold the Lamb of God!" The reference may be to the Paschal lamb ("Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us," <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>) - the blood of that lamb cannot, indeed, be regarded as a ransom from Egyptian bondage, but it saved the Israelites from the destroying angel - or to any sacrificial lamb. The apostle seems to be passing from the idea of ransom or price to that of expiation. The verb "ye were redeemed," the silver and gold, direct the thoughts to price; the blood and the lamb, to expiation. The two ideas are closely connected; the two illustrations combined give a fuller view of the blessed meaning of the Savior's death than either of them alone could do. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_peter/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>But with the precious blood of Christ<p>The word &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, of Christ, stands at the end of the sentence, and is emphatic.
