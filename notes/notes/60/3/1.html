Here, again, the form in the original is participial, joining this injunction on to <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1Peter 2:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1Peter 2:18</a>, where the word is the same in Greek, “wives, in the same way submitting yourselves.” Whether this imposes for all time upon Christian wives as complete a submission towards their husbands as is here enjoined might perhaps be questioned, because the special reason for the command in this place was to allay suspicions engendered by the boldness with which Christianity proclaimed the freedom of the individual. St. Peter has just been giving injunctions for absolute submission, even to injustice, on the part of slaves; and the progress of Christianity has abolished slavery altogether. The measure of the Christian wife’s submission may safely be left to her own enlightened conscience, guided by other passages of the New Testament not written, like this, for a special emergency.<p><span class= "bld">Your own husbands.</span>—This does not order submission to the husband in contrast to submission to other directors, but rather gives a <span class= "ital">reason</span> for obedience. “The Christian wife that hath love to God,” says Leighton, “though her husband be not so comely, or so wise, or any way so amiable, as many others, yet because he is her <span class= "ital">own husband, </span>and because of the Lord’s command in the general, and His providence in the particular disposal of His own, therefore she loves and obeys.”<p><span class= "bld">That if any obey not the word.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">in order that even supposing some </span>(<span class= "ital">at present</span>)<span class= "ital"> disobey the word. “</span>The word” is, of course, the Gospel, the declaration of the fulfilment of the prophecies in Jesus. And those who “disobey the word” are, according to constant usage, the Jews. The present verb is used of the Jews in <a href="/acts/14-2.htm" title="But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brothers.">Acts 14:2</a>; <a href="/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>; <a href="/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9</a>; <a href="/romans/10-21.htm" title="But to Israel he said, All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.">Romans 10:21</a>; <a href="/romans/11-31.htm" title="Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.">Romans 11:31</a>; <a href="/romans/15-31.htm" title="That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;">Romans 15:31</a>, besides St. Peter’s own use in <a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1Peter 4:17</a>. The only places where it is distinctly used of others are <a href="/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a> (of Jew and Gentile together), <a href="/romans/11-30.htm" title="For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:">Romans 11:30</a> (where the Gentiles are compared with the Jews), <a href="/hebrews/3-18.htm" title="And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?">Hebrews 3:18</a> (of the Israelites in the wilderness), <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm" title="By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.">Hebrews 11:31</a> (of the men of Jericho), <a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm" title="Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.">1Peter 3:20</a> (of the refractory antediluvians). In any case it must mean a wilful refusal to submit to the Word, in spite of being intellectually convinced. (See especially <a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>.) For every reason, therefore, it is more probable that the case here supposed is that of Hebrew (Christian) women, married to men of their own race who reject the gospel.<p><span class= "bld">They also may . . .</span>—The order here is not so neat as in the original, and it spoils the point to insert the definite article before “word.” It should run, <span class= "ital">In order that</span> . . . <span class= "ital">through their wives’ conversation, without a word, they may</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">shall</span>)<span class= "ital"> be gained.</span> There is something almost playful in the substitution of “their wives” instead of “you,” and in the “without a word” contrasted with “the word” before. St. Peter seems to enjoy laying the little innocent plot. He was himself, as the Prayer Book reminds us, a married man. And what he means here, is not that those who have resisted the public preaching in the synagogues, should even without that public preaching be won; rather, that though the gospel as uttered verbally only provokes them to opposition, the gospel as submissively <span class= "ital">acted</span> by their wives, without a word said on the matter, ought to convert them. “This model of submission and humility,” says M. Renan, meaning the Lamb of God, “is made by Peter the law for all classes of Christian society. The wife above all, without setting up for a preacher (<span class= "ital">sans faire la précheuse</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>ought, by the discreet charm of her piety, to be the great missionary of the faith.” The word rendered “won” keeps up the playfulness of that which goes before; it means “to turn a profit,” and there is just enough of <span class= "ital">ruse</span> in it to make the enforcement of submission to a husband of opposed religious views seem an enticing little speculation. The tense of the original verb indicates that the scheme is certain to succeed. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm" title="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-19.htm" title="For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more.">1Corinthians 9:19-20</a>.) Archbishop Leighton points out that in Hebrew the name of the book of “Ecclesiastes; or, the Preacher,” is a feminine, and the same is the case in <a href="/psalms/68-11.htm" title="The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.">Psalm 68:11</a>, and elsewhere.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_peter/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;...">1 Peter 3:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Likewise </span>— As I have exhorted servants to be in subjection to their masters, I in like manner say, <span class="ital">Ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands </span>— In all things just and lawful; <span class="ital">that if any </span>(he speaks tenderly) <span class="ital">obey not the word </span>— Disbelieve and reject the gospel; <span class="ital">they also may, without the word </span>— Though they neglect or reject that means of grace; <span class="ital">be won by the conversation </span>— The good behaviour <span class="ital">of the wives </span>— That is, be gained over to Christ. “Here St. Peter wisely intimates to the women, that the silent, but powerful persuasion of a becoming behaviour, would be more effectual in winning their unbelieving husbands to embrace the gospel, than many arguments, proposed perhaps with heat, for the purpose of convincing them. For when the husbands found what a happy influence the gospel had in making their wives sweet-tempered and dutiful in every respect, they could not but entertain a good opinion of a religion which produced such excellent effects.” <span class="ital">While, </span>with admiration and increasing love, <span class="ital">they </span>daily <span class="ital">behold your chaste </span>and spotless <span class="ital">conversation coupled with fear </span>— With a dutiful, respectful, obliging conduct, and a care not to displease.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-7 The wife must discharge her duty to her own husband, though he obey not the word. We daily see how narrowly evil men watch the ways and lives of professors of religion. Putting on of apparel is not forbidden, but vanity and costliness in ornament. Religious people should take care that all their behaviour answers to their profession. But how few know the right measure and bounds of those two necessaries of life, food and raiment! Unless poverty is our carver, and cuts us short, there is scarcely any one who does not desire something beyond what is good for us. Far more are beholden to the lowliness of their state, than the lowliness of their mind; and many will not be so bounded, but lavish their time and money upon trifles. The apostle directs Christian females to put on something not corruptible, that beautifies the soul, even the graces of God's Holy Spirit. A true Christian's chief care lies in right ordering his own spirit. This will do more to fix the affections, and excite the esteem of a husband, than studied ornaments or fashionable apparel, attended by a froward and quarrelsome temper. Christians ought to do their duty to one another, from a willing mind, and in obedience to the command of God. Wives should be subject to their husbands, not from dread and amazement, but from desire to do well, and please God. The husband's duty to the wife implies giving due respect unto her, and maintaining her authority, protecting her, and placing trust in her. They are heirs together of all the blessings of this life and that which is to come, and should live peaceably one with another. Prayer sweetens their converse. And it is not enough that they pray with the family, but husband and wife together by themselves, and with their children. Those who are acquainted with prayer, find such unspeakable sweetness in it, that they will not be hindered therein. That you may pray much, live holily; and that you may live holily, be much in prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands - On the duty here enjoined, see the <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3-9</a> notes, and <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22</a> note.<p>That, if any obey not the word - The word of God; the gospel. That is, if any wives have husbands who are not true Christians. This would be likely to occur when the gospel was first preached, as it does now, by the fact that wives might be converted, though their husbands were not. It cannot be inferred from this, that after they themselves had become Christians they had married unbelieving husbands. The term "word" here refers particularly to the gospel as preached; and the idea is, that if they were regardless of that gospel when preached - if they would not attend on preaching, or if they were unaffected by it, or if they openly rejected it, there might be hope still that they would be converted by the Christian influence of a wife at home. In such cases, a duty of special importance devolves on the wife.<p>They also may without the word be won - In some other way than by preaching. This I does not mean that they would be converted independently of the influence of truth - for truth is always the instrument of conversion, <a href="/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>; <a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>; but that it was to be by another influence than preaching.<p>By the conversation of the wives - By the conduct or deportment of their wives. See the notes at <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>. The word conversation, in the Scriptures, is never confined, as it is now with us, to oral discourse, but denotes conduct in general. It includes indeed "conversation" as the word is now used, but it embraces also much more - including everything that we do. The meaning here is, that the habitual deportment of the wife was to be such as to show the reality and power of religion; to show that it had such influence on her temper, her words, her whole deportment, as to demonstrate that it was from God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>1Pe 3:1-22.

Every time that obedience is enjoined upon women to their husbands, the Greek, "idios," "one's own peculiarly," is used, while the wives of men are designated only by heauton, "of themselves." Feeling the need of leaning on one stronger than herself, the wife (especially if joined to an unbeliever) might be tempted, though only spiritually, to enter into that relation with another in which she ought to stand to "her own spouse (1Co 14:34, 35, "Let them ask their own [idious] husbands at home"); an attachment to the person of the teacher might thus spring up, which, without being in the common sense spiritual adultery, would still weaken in its spiritual basis the married relation [Steiger].<p>that, if&#8212;Greek, "that even if."

"Unspoken acting is more powerful than unperformed speaking" [ŒCUMENIUS]. "A soul converted is gained to itself, to the pastor, wife, or husband, who sought it, and to Jesus Christ; added to His treasury who thought not His own precious blood too dear to lay out for this gain" [Leighton]. "The discreet wife would choose first of all to persuade her husband to share with her in the things which lead to blessedness; but if this be impossible, let her then alone diligently press after virtue, in all things obeying him so as to do nothing at any time against his will, except in such things as are essential to virtue and salvation" [Clement of Alexandria].<span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;...">1 Peter 3:1-7</a></span> The apostle teacheth the duty of wives and husbands,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_peter/3-8.htm" title="Finally, be you all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brothers, be pitiful, be courteous:...">1 Peter 3:8-13</a></span> exhorting all men to unity and love, and to return good<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>for evil,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_peter/3-14.htm" title="But and if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;...">1 Peter 3:14-18</a></span> to suffer boldly for righteousness’ sake, and to give<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>a reason of their hope with meekness and fear;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>taking especial care to suffer, as Christ did, for<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>well-doing, and not for evil-doing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1 Peter 3:19</a>,20</span> The preaching of Christ by his Spirit to the old world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 3:21</a>,22</span> After what manner Christian baptism saveth us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To your own husbands; </span> this he adds both to mitigate the difficulty of the duty, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">subjection, </span> in that they were their <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">own</span> husbands to whom they were to be subject, and likewise to bound and circumscribe their obedience, that it was to be only to their own husbands, not to others; and so while he persuades them to subjection, he cautions them against unchastity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That if any obey not the word; </span> the word of the gospel.

The apostle, though he includes all wives, and exhorts them in general to subjection to their own husbands, yet has a particular regard to such as had unbelieving husbands, and who, on that account, were scrupulous of living with them, and of being in subjection to them; and therefore, as the Apostle Paul also did, he advises them to abide with them, and behave well to them, using much the same argument as he does in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10</a>. <p>they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; for though the ordinary way and means of conversion is the word, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word; yet it may be sometimes done without it; or however by the agreeable conversation of professors, and so of religious wives, the hearts of such as were averse to Christianity, and the Gospel, as unbelieving husbands, may be so softened, and wrought upon, as to entertain a better opinion of it, and in process of time be inclined to hear and attend it; the consequence of which may prove their conversion, which is a gaming, or winning of souls; and which, as it is for their good, is for the glory of Christ; for as every soul that is delivered from the power of darkness, and is translated into the kingdom of Christ, is a loss to Satan, it is a gain to Christ, and to his church.

It is self-evident,—although many interpreters have discussed the question at considerable length,—that the subjection of the wife to the husband is of quite a different kind from that of the slave to the master.

The Apostle passes from the all but universal relation of the master and the slave as one element of social life, to the other, yet more universal, and involving from the Roman point of view almost as great a subordination, of husband and wife. Here also it was his object to impress on men and women, especially on the latter, the thought that the doctrine of Christ was no element of disorder. The stress which he lays on their duties may be fairly taken as indicating the prominence of women among the converts to the new faith. Of that prominence we have sufficient evidence in the narrative of the Acts (actsr 16:13, <a href="/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>; <a href="/acts/17-12.htm" title="Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.">Acts 17:12</a>). In what follows we have again a reproduction of the teaching of St Paul (<a href="/context/ephesians/5-22.htm" title="Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord....">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-18.htm" title=" Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.">Colossians 3:18</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1 Timothy 2:9</a>). It is not without interest to recall the fact that Aristotle makes the two relations of which St Peter speaks, that of husband and wife, that of master and slave, the germ-cells, as it were, out of which all political society has been developed (Arist. <span class="ital">Pol</span>. i. 2).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be in subjection to your own husbands</span>] The use of the Greek adjective for “own” is not intended, as some interpreters have thought, to emphasize a contrast between obedience rendered to their own husbands and that which they might be tempted to give to others, but rather to lay stress on the fact that their husbands, because they were such, had a right to expect the due measure of obedience in all things lawful. The words that follow indicate the frequency of the cases in which the wife only was a convert. The Greek text runs “that <span class="bld">even</span> if any obey not the word,” as though, in some cases at least, it might be expected that husband and wife would both have been converted together. In “the word” we have the familiar collective expression for the whole doctrine of the Gospel. The Greek verb for “obey not” implies, as in chap. <a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm" title="To you therefore which believe he is precious: but to them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,">1 Peter 2:7</a>, <a href="/acts/14-2.htm" title="But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brothers.">Acts 14:2</a>, <a href="/hebrews/3-18.htm" title="And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?">Hebrews 3:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm" title="By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.">Hebrews 11:31</a>, a positive antagonism rather than the mere absence of belief and obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives</span>] The Greek for “word” has no article, and the probable meaning is not “without the open preaching of the word of Christ,” but rather, <span class="bld">without speech, without a word [being uttered]</span>. On “conversation,” see note on chap. <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm" title="But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;">1 Peter 1:15</a>. Here, where “conversation” is used as the direct antithesis to speech, the contrast between the new and the old meanings of the word is seen with a singular vividness. The silent preaching of conduct is what the Apostle relied on as a more effective instrument of conversion than any argument or debate. In the verb “be won,” literally, <span class="bld">be gained over</span>, we have the same word as that used by St Paul in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-19.htm" title="For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more....">1 Corinthians 9:19-20</a>, and by our Lord, in teaching which must have made a special impression on St Peter’s mind, in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm" title="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1 Peter 3:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὑποτασσόμενοι</span>, <span class="ital">subject</span>) In the progress of the discourse, by a change of construction which is full of character, the participle is put for the imperative: <a href="/context/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered....">1 Peter 3:7-8</a>.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ εἴ τινες</span>, <span class="ital">even if any</span>) Peter speaks with mildness.—<span class="greekheb">λόγῳ</span>· <span class="greekheb">λόγου</span>, <span class="ital">the word: word</span>) Used in a double sense by the figure[23] Antanaclasis: in the former place, <span class="ital">the Gospel</span> is signified; in the latter, <span class="ital">discourse</span>.

There must have been Christian masters in Asia Minor, as is plain from <a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>. But we notice that St. Paul, though he has a few words for masters, addresses slaves at much greater length. Probably Christian masters were comparatively few, while large numbers of slaves had embraced the religion which could do so much to comfort and elevate the oppressed. Again, the immediate purpose of the apostle is to inculcate submission to authority; therefore, having enforced upon Christian servants the example of their Lord, he proceeds to speak of the duty of Christian wives. Christianity was in its infancy; it was to be the means of abolishing slavery, and of raising woman to her proper place in society; but as yet slaves were cruelly oppressed, and women were ill treated and despised. Aristotle tells us that among the barbarians (and a large proportion of the population in the greater part of Asia Minor was barbarian, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> non-Greek) the woman and the slave hold the same rank ('Pol.,' I. 2:4). In Greek communities the case was different; but even among the Greeks women occupied a very subordinate position. Christianity would introduce a great and sweeping change in the relations of the sexes, as well as in the relations of master and slave. But the change must be gradual, not violent; it must be brought about by the softening and purifying influences of religion, not by revolt against recognized customs and established authority. Indeed, Christianity would introduce an element of division - the Lord had said so (<a href="/luke/12-51.htm">Luke 12:51-53</a>); families would be divided. It could not be otherwise; Christians must not set even family ties above the love of Christ. But Christian wives must be peacemakers; they must, as far as possible, live at peace even with unbelieving husbands. They would often have much ill treatment to endure in those coarse, cruel days; they must bear it with the quiet strength of gentleness. <span class="cmt_word">Be in subjection to your own husbands</span>; literally, <span class="accented">submitting yourselves.</span> The participle, as in <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>, seems to look back to the imperative, "submit yourselves," in <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>. The present participle implies that this voluntary submission is to be habitual. The adjective "your own" (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) emphasizes the duty. <span class="cmt_word">That, if any obey not the Word, they also may without the Word be won by the conversation of the wives</span>. There is a well-supported reading, "Even if any." Husband and wife would often be converted together; but if this should not be the case, and if the unbelieving husband should set himself in direct opposition to the Word of God (for the words "believe not" have more than a negative meaning, as in <a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a>), still Christian wives must submit themselves. They must do this for the glory of God, and with the hope of saving their husbands' souls; that those unbelieving husbands may be won to Christ and to everlasting life by the silent eloquence of the quiet self-restraint and holy behavior of their wives, without argument or preaching on the wives' part. A self-denying holy life will do more to win those with whom we live in close intercourse than even holy words, and much more than debate and controversy. This seems to be the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> rather than the other possible interpretation, "without the preaching of the Word." <span class="accented">Be won</span>; literally, <span class="accented">be gained.</span> Each soul converted is a gain to Christ, to the kingdom of heaven, to itself, in this case also to the wife who is the happy instrument of saving her husband (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19, 20</a>). The word rendered "conversation" here, as elsewhere, means "conduct, behavior." (Compare, on the whole subject, the teaching of St. Paul, <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9-11</a>.) <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_peter/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Likewise (&#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., in like manner; better, because likewise in popular speech has, wrongly, the sense of also.
