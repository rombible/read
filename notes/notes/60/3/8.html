St. Peter has not, however, forgotten the <span class= "ital">purpose</span> with which the former rules were given; his thought is still how to produce a right impression on the unbelieving world, although some of these injunctions touch only <span class= "ital">internal</span> relations between members of the Church. “By this shall <span class= "ital">all men</span>” says our Lord, “know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love <span class= "ital">one to another”</span> (<a href="/john/13-35.htm" title="By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.">John 13:35</a>); and, again, “That <span class= "ital">they</span> all may be <span class= "ital">one</span> . . . that the <span class= "ital">world</span> may believe that thou hast sent me” (<a href="/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.">John 17:21</a>). Accordingly, this verse, like <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1Peter 3:7</a>, is attached to <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1Peter 2:13</a>, and should be translated, <span class= "ital">Finally, being all.</span><p><span class= "bld">Of one mind.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">unanimous.</span> Though the Greek word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, the duty is enjoined often, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/romans/12-16.htm" title="Be of the same mind one toward another.

It involves an agreement not only in doctrine but in practical aims, the affections of all being in the same direction. This unanimity requires <span class= "ital">expression</span> to be conscious, and therefore it strikes at the root of the reserve by which Christian people do not open out their hearts to each other in the matter of religion. Such unity of mind is no product of indifference, which Leighton describes as “not a knitting together, but a freezing together, as cold congregates all bodies how heterogeneous soever, sticks, stones, and water.”<p><span class= "bld">Having compassion one of another.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">sympathetic.</span> The word “compassion” has lost the meaning which it once had, and signifies little more than pity. Here the command includes the “rejoicing with them that do rejoice,” as much as the “weeping with them that weep” (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm" title="Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.">Romans 12:15</a>). The same word only occurs again in <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-34.htm" title="For you had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.">Hebrews 10:34</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Love as brethren.</span>—Again a single adjective, <span class= "ital">fraternal, </span>or, loving the brethren.

It differs from “sympathetic “in being limited to yearnings over the afflicted. Strangely enough, in profane Greek, the word is only found to mean “strong-hearted.”<p><span class= "bld">Be courteous.</span>—The injunction is so charming, and so appropriate in the mouth of St. Peter, that one is almost loth to correct the reading, and substitute (undoubtedly the right word) <span class= "ital">humble-minded.</span> This adjective brings us back to that mutual <span class= "ital">subjection</span> and complaisance which is the main subject of all these rules.

If any man desires to live comfortably on earth, or to possess eternal life in heaven, he must bridle his tongue from wicked, abusive, or deceitful words. He must forsake and keep far from evil actions, do all the good he can, and seek peace with all men. For God, all-wise and every where present, watches over the righteous, and takes care of them. None could or should harm those who copied the example of Christ, who is perfect goodness, and did good to others as his followers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Finally - As the last direction, or as general counsel in reference to your conduct in all the relations of life. The apostle had specified most of the important relations which Christians sustain, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-7</a>; and he now gives a general direction in regard to their conduct in all those relations.<p>Be ye all of one mind - See the notes at <a href="/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>. The word used here (&#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  homophro&#772;n) does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means, of the same mind; like-minded; and the object is to secure harmony in their views and feelings.<p>Having compassion one of another - "Sympathizing," (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  sumpatheis;) entering into one another's feelings, and evincing a regard for each other's welfare. See the notes at <a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>. Compare <a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>; <a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>. The Greek word used here does occur not elsewhere in the New Testament. It describes that state of mind which exists when we enter into the feelings of others as if they were our own, as the different parts of the body are affected by that which affects one. See the notes at <a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>.<p>Love as brethren - Margin, "loving to the;" that is, the brethren. The Greek word (&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  philadelphos) does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means loving one's brethren; that is, loving each other as Christian brethren - Robinson, Lexicon. Thus, it enforces the duty so often enjoined in the New Testament, that of love to Christians as brethren of the same family. See the notes at <a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>. Compare <a href="/hebrews/13-1.htm">Hebrews 13:1</a>; <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>.<p>Be pitiful - The word used here (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  eusplangchnos) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, except in <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>, where it is rendered "tender-hearted." See the notes at that verse.<p>Be courteous - This word also &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  (philophro&#772;n) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means "friendly-minded, kind, courteous." Later editions of the New Testament, instead of this, read (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  tapeinophrones) of a lowly or humble mind. See Hahn. The sense is not materially varied. In the one word, the idea of "friendliness" is the one that prevails; in the other, that of "humility." Christianity requires both of these virtues, and either word enforces an important injunction. The authority is in favor of the latter reading; and though Christianity requires that we should be courteous and gentlemanly in our treatment of others, this text can hardly be relied on as a prooftext of that point. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Not that the apostle was about to conclude his epistle; but having finished his exhortations respecting the obedience of subjects to magistrates, and of servants to their masters, and the duties incumbent on husbands and wives, he proceeds to sum up what he had further to say, in general rules; which regarded all sorts of Christians, magistrates and subjects, masters and servants, husbands and wives, parents and children, old and young, rich and poor, of whatsoever state, age, sex, or condition; and so the Arabic version renders it, "the sum of the commandment is"; and the Ethiopic version, "the sum of all is this"; namely, what follows; "be ye all of one mind"; whatever difference there might be in their natural and civil relation and character; and which is to be understood not of the sameness of affection to one another, or of an humble and condescending spirit, disposition, and carriage to each other, for these are expressed in some following exhortations; but of sameness of judgment with respect to the doctrines and ordinances of the Gospel, in which saints should be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment; for as the church is but one body, of which Christ is the head, there should be but one mind in it; even as there is but one Spirit of God, who convinces, enlightens, and leads into truth; and but one heart and way, given to fear the Lord; and there is but one hope of our calling, or to which we are called; and one way to it, and therefore ought to agree in everything respecting the way, the truth, and the life; though in things which do not, should bear with one another; and there is but one Lord, who gives the same laws and ordinances to one as to another, and which are to be kept alike by all; and there is but one faith, one doctrine of faith, which is uniform and all of a piece, and but one rule and standard of faith, the sacred Scriptures, and but one baptism, to be administered in the same way, and upon the same sort of subjects, and in the same name of the Father, Son, and Spirit; and but one God and Father of all; all belong to the same family, and therefore should preserve a unity of spirit and mind, and speak the same things; which is necessary to carry on the worship of God, honourably and regularly, to the glorifying of him, and for the peace, comfort, and safety of the churches of Christ: <p>having compassion one of another; or sympathizing with each other, both in prosperity and adversity, whether in temporal or spiritual things; rejoicing with them that rejoice in Christ, make their boast of him, and have communion with him, and who are also blessed with health of body, and a competency of the good things of this life; and weeping with them that weep for the loss of goods, relations, &amp;c. and being in bonds and afflictions; or because of sin, the absence of Christ, and the temptations of Satan; and being concerned also for such who are fallen into immorality, or error, and heresy; endeavouring to restore them out of the one or the other, in a spirit of meekness and tenderness: to all which they should be engaged by the example of Christ, the sympathizing high priest; by the consideration of the divine compassion to them, both in a providential way, and in a way of grace; and on account of their union and relation to each other, as members of the same body: <p>love as brethren; not in a natural and civil, but in a spiritual relation, being children of God, and brethren of Christ, and in a Gospel church state; and whose love to each other ought to be universal, fervent, without dissimulation, and as Christ has loved them; and which should show itself in praying for each other, in bearing one another's burdens, in forgiving each other, in admonishing in love, and building up one another on their most holy faith, and communicating to each other both in temporals and spirituals: and of a very excellent nature is it; it is the bond of perfectness, and evidence of regeneration; the glory and ornament of a profession, and without which it is nothing; and what renders the communion of the saints with each other pleasant and profitable, comfortable to themselves, and honourable in the eyes of others; and to which they should be induced from the consideration of the love of God and Christ unto them, and from their relation to each other, as brethren: <p>be pitiful; to those that are in distress; put on bowels of mercy, and relieve and succour them, distributing cheerfully to their necessities: <p>be courteous; gentle and affable, carrying it friendly to one another, seeking those things which may be most agreeable to each other, shunning all moroseness, stiffness, and incivility. The Vulgate Latin version renders it by two words, "modest, humble": not proud, haughty, and overbearing, but condescending to each other, and to men of low estates; and so the Syriac version renders it, "kind and meek". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> Finally, <i>be ye</i> all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, <i>be</i> pitiful, <i>be</i> courteous:</span><p>(10) He turns to common exhortations, and commends harmony and whatever things pertain to the maintenance of peace and mutual love.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_peter/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm" title="Finally, be you all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brothers, be pitiful, be courteous:">1 Peter 3:8</a>.

In the classics <span class="greekheb">ταπεινόφρων</span> means “mean-spirited and faint-hearted.” The word <span class="greekheb">φιλόφρονες</span> (spurious here) is explained by Gerhard: qui student facere ea quae alteri amica sunt et grata. The first three expressions show the loving relation in which Christians stand to each other; the last two (or three), the conduct of Christians towards all without distinction (Hofmann).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_peter/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm" title="Finally, be you all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brothers, be pitiful, be courteous:">1 Peter 3:8</a> f.

The adjective for “of one mind” (not found elsewhere in the New Testament) implies, like the corresponding verb in <a href="/romans/12-16.htm" title="Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate.

That for “having compassion one of another” (this also used only by St Peter in the New Testament) exactly answers, as describing the temper that rejoices with those that rejoice and weeps with them that weep, to our word <span class="bld">sympathizing</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">love as brethren</span>] Here also we have an adjective peculiar to St Peter. The corresponding substantive has met us in ch. <a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1 Peter 1:22</a>. It may mean either what the English version gives, or “lovers of the brethren.” On the whole the latter meaning seems preferable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">pitiful</span>] The history of the word, literally meaning “good-hearted,” affords an interesting illustration of the influence of Christian thought. It was used by Greek writers, especially Greek medical writers, such as Hippocrates (p. 89 c), to describe what we should call the sanguine or courageous temperament. By St Peter and St Paul (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm" title="And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.">Ephesians 4:32</a>), it is used, as the context in each case shews, for the emotional temper which shews itself in pity and affection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be courteous</span>] The MSS. present two readings, one of which, “courteous” or better, perhaps, <span class="bld">friendly</span>, is a fair rendering, and the other a word not found elsewhere, but meaning “lowly” or “humble,” and corresponding to the noun “humility” in <a href="/acts/20-19.htm" title="Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm" title="Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.">Php 2:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder.

St. Peter is bringing to a close the exhortations to submission, which depend on the imperative in <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>.

In Hippocrates, quoted by Huther, it is used literally of one whose viscera are healthy; it is also sometimes used figuratively, as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; "goodhearted" with the heathen would mean "brave;" with Christian writers "tender," "pitiful."
