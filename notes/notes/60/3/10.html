If any man desires to live comfortably on earth, or to possess eternal life in heaven, he must bridle his tongue from wicked, abusive, or deceitful words. He must forsake and keep far from evil actions, do all the good he can, and seek peace with all men. For God, all-wise and every where present, watches over the righteous, and takes care of them. None could or should harm those who copied the example of Christ, who is perfect goodness, and did good to others as his followers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he that will love life - Greek, "He willing, (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  thelo&#772;n,) or that wills to love life." It implies that there is some positive desire to live; some active wish that life should be prolonged. This whole passage <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-10.htm">1 Peter 3:10-12</a> is taken, with some slight variations, from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34-12.htm">Psalm 34:12-16</a>. In the Psalm this expression is, "What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?" The sense is substantially the same. It is implied here that it is right to love life, and to desire many days. The desire of this is referred to by the psalmist and by the apostle, without any expression of disapprobation, and the way is shown by which length of days may be secured. Life is a blessing; a precious gift of God. We are taught so to regard it by the instinctive feelings of our nature; for we are so made as to love it, and to dread its extinction. Though we should be prepared to resign it when God commands, yet there are important reasons why we should desire to live. Among them are the following:<p>(1) Because, as already intimated, life, as such, is to be regarded as a blessing. We instinctively shrink back from death, as one of the greatest evils; we shudder at the thought of annihilation. It is not wrong to love that, in proper degree, which, by our very nature, we are prompted to love; and we are but acting out one of the universal laws which our Creator has impressed on us, when, with proper submission to his will, we seek "to lengthen out our days as far as possible.<p>(2) that we may see the works of God, and survey the wonders of his hand on earth. The world is full of wonders, evincing the wisdom and goodness of the Deity; and the longest life, nay, many such lives as are allotted to us here, could be well employed in studying his works and ways.<p>(3) that we may make preparation for eternity. Man may, indeed, make preparation in a very brief period; but the longest life is not too much to examine and settle the question whether we have a well-founded hope of heaven. If man had nothing else to do, the longest life could be well employed in inquiries that grow out of the question whether we are suited for the world to come. In the possibility, too, of being deceived, and in view of the awful consequences that will result from deception, it is desirable that length of days should be given us that we may bring the subject to the severest test, and so determine it, that we may go sure to the changeless world.<p>(4) that we may do good to others. We may, indeed, do good in another world; but there are ways of doing good which are probably confined to this. What good we may do hereafter to the inhabitants of distant worlds, or what ministrations, in company with angels, or without them, we may exercise toward the friends of God on earth after we leave it, we do not know; but there are certain things which we are morally certain we shall not be permitted to do in the future world. We shall not:<p>(a) personally labor for the salvation of sinners, by conversation and other direct efforts;<p>(b) we shall not illustrate the influence of religion by example in sustaining us in trials, subduing and controlling our passions, and making us dead to the world;<p>(c) we shall not be permitted to pray for our impenitent friends and kindred, as we may now;<p>(d) we shall not have the opportunity of contributing of our substance for the spread of the gospel, or of going personally to preach the gospel to the perishing;<p>(e) we shall not be employed in instructing the ignorant, in advocating the cause of the oppressed and the wronged, in seeking to remove the fetters from the slave, in dispensing mercy to the insane, or in visiting the prisoner in his lonely cell;<p>(f) we shall not have it in our power to address a kind word to an impenitent child, or seek to guide him in paths of truth, purity, and salvation.<p>What we can do personally and directly for the salvation of others is to be done in this world; and, considering how much there is to be done, and how useful life may be on the earth, it is an object which we should desire, that our days may be lengthened out, and should use all proper means that it may be done. While we should ever be ready and willing to depart when God calls us to go; while we should not wish to linger on these mortal shores beyond the time when we may be useful to others, yet, as long as he permits us to live, we should regard life as a blessing, and should pray that, if it be his will, we may not be cut down in the midst of our way.<p>"Love not thy life, nor hate; but what thou livest.<p>Live well; how long, or short, permit to heaven."<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. will love&#8212;Greek, "wishes to love."

Although the exhortations of the apostle refer more particularly to the conduct of Christians towards their persecutors, yet they are not confined to this, but go beyond it (in opposition to Schott).—<a href="/1_peter/3-12.htm" title="For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.">1 Peter 3:12</a>. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ὈΦΘΑΛΜΟῚ ΚΥΡΊΟΥ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>] <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ</span></span></span> is inserted by the apostle in order to mark more precisely the connection of thought. The exhortations are founded on a reference to the manner of God’s dealings. On the first hemistich Bengel remarks: inde vitam habent et dies bonos. The apostle omits the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ἘΞΟΛΟΘΡΕῦΣΑΙ ἘΚ Γῆς ΤῸ ΜΝΗΜΌΣΥΝΟΝ ΑὐΤῶΝ</span></span></span> in the Psalm, added to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΌΣΩΠΟΝ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΚΑΚΆ</span></span></span> (not because, as de Wette thinks, he considered them too strong), and thus deprives the last member of the verse of a nearer definition. Calvin, Grotius, Beza, de Wette, accordingly take the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΊ</span></span></span> of this member in a sense different from that which it has in the first, namely, as conveying the idea of “punishment,” equivalent to “against;” this, however, is arbitrary. Hensler, Augusti, and Steiger find in all three members the expression of “attentive observation” only; but this view—itself, according to the thought, inadequate—is opposed by the particle <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΈ</span></span></span>, which indicates rather a contrast, and is not to be translated, with Hensler, by “but also.” If, now, the antithesis be not contained in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΊ</span></span></span>, it can be sought for only in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΌΣΩΠΟΝ</span></span></span>, which, though in itself doubtless a vox media (comp. <a href="/context/numbers/6-25.htm" title="The LORD make his face shine on you, and be gracious to you:...">Numbers 6:25-26</a>; <a href="/psalms/4-7.htm" title="You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.">Psalm 4:7</a>), is nevertheless in this passage of the Psalms to be thought of as one full of wrath, and, as such, was present to the mind of the apostle. Strictly speaking, indeed, this should have been expressed; but not necessarily so, since the antithesis between this and the preceding member of the verse makes it sufficiently apparent. A similar interpretation is given by Wiesinger, Brückner, and Schott.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[185] In the original Hebrew the passage is:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[186] Similarly already the <span class="ital">Glossa interl.</span>: qui vult ostendere, se dilectionem habere.—Lorinus thinks that the combination of the two words serves to intensify the idea: si recte dicitur quis concupiseere, desiderare (<a href="/psalms/118-20.htm" title="This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.">Psalm 118:20</a>), quidni velle, quod est verbum generale, amare? Innuit duplicatio non solum vehementiam desiderii amorisve, sed infirmitatem quoque carnis revocantis subinde voluntatem, ne ita velit acriter et assiduo. But in <a href="/psalms/118-20.htm" title="This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.">Psalm 118:20</a> (Vulg.: concupivit anima mea desiderare justificationes tuas) the connection is different from here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>מִי־הָאִישׁ הֶחָפֵץ חַיִּים<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>אֹהֵב יָמִים לִרְאוֹת טוֹב.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_peter/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/1_peter/3-10.htm" title="For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:...">1 Peter 3:10-12</a> = <a href="/context/psalms/34-12.htm" title="What man is he that desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good?...">Psalm 34:12-17</a> a. introduced by mere <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> as familiar. The lips of Christians who wish to love life must be free from cursing and from guile as were Christ’s (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Isa. <span class="ital">apud</span> ii. 23). If Jehovah is to hear their petition as He heard Christ’s they also must turn from evil and do good (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθοποιεῖν</span> above) seeking peace within and without the Church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10–12</span>. <span class="ital">For he that will love life</span>] The three verses are from the LXX. version of <a href="/context/psalms/34-12.htm" title="What man is he that desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good?...">Psalm 34:12-16</a>. It is characteristic of St Peter that he thus quotes from the Old Testament without any formula of citation. (See <a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm" title="But it is happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.">2 Peter 2:22</a>.) In this case, however, the quotation does not agree with the extant text of the LXX. which gives “What man is he that would fain have life, loving good days?” The English version of the first clause hardly expresses the force of the Greek, which gives literally, <span class="bld">he that willeth to love life</span>. The combination may have been chosen to express the strength of the yearning for life in its lower or higher forms which the words imply, or more probably that the object wished for is not mere life, as such, but a life that a man can love, instead of hating with the hatred that is engendered, on the one hand, by the satiety of the pleasure seeker, and on the other, by bitterness and wrath. It need hardly be said that the Apostle uses the words of the Psalmist in a higher meaning. “Life” with him is “life eternal,” and the “good days” are not those of outward prosperity, but of the peace that passeth understanding.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">let him refrain his tongue from evil</span>] The last words were probably those which determined the choice of the quotation. In itself it is, of course, inclusive of the “guile,” which follows in the second clause, but here it follows the laws of antithetical parallelism which prevail in Hebrew Poetry, and must be understood of open evil, such as the “railing” which the Apostle had just condemned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/3-10.htm" title="For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:">1 Peter 3:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ γὰρ θέλων ζωὴν ἀγαπᾷν καὶ ἰθεῖν ἡμέρας ἀγαθὰς</span>, <span class="ital">he who wishes to love life and to see good days</span>) If you wish, says Peter, to taste of that inheritance, you must abstain from evil in speaking and in practice. <a href="/context/psalms/34-12.htm" title="What man is he that desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good?...">Psalm 34:12-16</a>, Septuagint: <span class="greekheb">Τίς ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος ὁ θέλων ζωὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀγκπῶν ἡμέρας ἰδεῖν ἀγαθάς</span>; <span class="ital">What man is there who wishes life, loving to see good days?</span> And thus the Hebrew has it in that passage, and the Syriac Version in this. Peter, without altering the sense, imparts to it fresh vivacity: <span class="greekheb">θέλων ζωὴν ἀγαπᾷν</span>, <span class="ital">who wishes so to live, that he may not be wearied of life</span>. Opposed to this is <span class="greekheb">ἐμίσησα τὴν ζωὴν</span>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-17.htm" title="Therefore I hated life; because the work that is worked under the sun is grievous to me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 2:17</a>; that is, <span class="ital">I became weary of life</span>.

Perhaps the meaning is best given by Bengel, "Qui vult ita vivere, nt ipsum non taedeat vitro" - " Who wishes to live so that he will not weary of life;" so that he may love it, so that he may have a life really worth living. There is a love of life which can only lead to the loss of the true life (<a href="/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>). St. Peter is teaching us to love life wisely, not with that selfish love which Christ condemns. <span class="cmt_word">And see good days</span>. Not necessarily in outward prosperity, but in the favor of God; days of suffering may be good days in the truest souse. <span class="cmt_word">Let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.</span> We have here the usual parallelism of Hebrew poetry. The word "refrain" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, literally, "let him make it cease") implies a natural tendency to sins against charity. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_peter/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Will love (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Not the future tense of love, but the verb to will, with the infinitive: he that desires or means to love.
