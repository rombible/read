Where God gives grace to be humble, he will give wisdom, faith, and holiness. To be humble, and subject to our reconciled God, will bring greater comfort to the soul than the gratification of pride and ambition. But it is to be in due time; not in thy fancied time, but God's own wisely appointed time. Does he wait, and wilt not thou? What difficulties will not the firm belief of his wisdom, power, and goodness get over! Then be humble under his hand. Cast all you care; personal cares, family cares, cares for the present, and cares for the future, for yourselves, for others, for the church, on God. These are burdensome, and often very sinful, when they arise from unbelief and distrust, when they torture and distract the mind, unfit us for duties, and hinder our delight in the service of God. The remedy is, to cast our care upon God, and leave every event to his wise and gracious disposal. Firm belief that the Divine will and counsels are right, calms the spirit of a man. Truly the godly too often forget this, and fret themselves to no purpose. Refer all to God's disposal. The golden mines of all spiritual comfort and good are wholly his, and the Spirit itself. Then, will he not furnish what is fit for us, if we humbly attend on him, and lay the care of providing for us, upon his wisdom and love? The whole design of Satan is to devour and destroy souls. He always is contriving whom he may insnare to eternal ruin. Our duty plainly is, to be sober; to govern both the outward and the inward man by the rules of temperance. To be vigilant; suspicious of constant danger from this spiritual enemy, watchful and diligent to prevent his designs. Be stedfast, or solid, by faith. A man cannot fight upon a quagmire, there is no standing without firm ground to tread upon; this faith alone furnishes. It lifts the soul to the firm advanced ground of the promises, and fixes it there. The consideration of what others suffer, is proper to encourage us to bear our share in any affliction; and in whatever form Satan assaults us, or by whatever means, we may know that our brethren experience the same.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be sober - While you cast your cares Upon God, and have no anxiety on that score, let your solicitude be directed to another point. Do not doubt that he is able and willing to support and befriend you, but be watchful against your foes. See the word used here fully explained in the notes at <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>.<p>Be vigilant - This word (&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  gre&#772;goreo&#772;) is everywhere else in the New Testament rendered "watch."

It means that we should exercise careful circumspection, as one does when he is in danger. In reference to the matter here referred to, it means that we are to be on our guard against the wiles and the power of the evil one.<p>Your adversary the devil - Your enemy; he who is opposed to you. Satan opposes man in his best interests. He resists his efforts to do good; his purposes to return to God; his attempts to secure his own salvation. There is no more appropriate appellation that can be given to him than to say that he resists all our efforts to obey God and to secure the salvation of our own souls.<p>As a roaring lion - Compare <a href="/revelation/12-12.htm">Revelation 12:12</a>. Sometimes Satan is represented as transforming himself into an angel of light, (see the notes at <a href="/2_corinthians/11-14.htm">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>); and sometimes, as here, as a roaring lion: denoting the efforts which he makes to alarm and overpower us. The lion here is not the crouching lion - the lion stealthfully creeping toward his foe - but it is the raging monarch of the woods, who by his terrible roar would intimidate all so that they might become an easy prey. The particular thing referred to here, doubtless, is persecution, resembling in its terrors a roaring lion. When error comes in; when seductive arts abound; when the world allures and charms the representation of the character of the foe is not of the roaring lion, but of the silent influence of an enemy that has clothed himself in the garb of an angel of light, <a href="/2_corinthians/11-14.htm">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>.<p>Walketh about, seeking whom he may devour - "Naturalists have observed that a lion roars when he is roused with hunger, for then he is most fierce, and most eagerly seeks his prey.

The apostle had exhorted to each of these before; see <a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a> but thought fit to repeat them; sobriety and watchfulness being exceeding necessary and useful in the Christian life; and the one cannot well be without the other: unless a man is sober in body and mind, he will not be watchful, either over himself or others, or against the snares of sin, Satan, and the world; and if he is not on his watch and guard, he is liable to every sin and temptation. The Syriac version renders the words, "watch", and "be ye mindful", or "remember"; watch with diligence, care, and industry, keeping a good lookout, minding and observing everything that presents, and remembering the power and cunning of the enemy; and the Ethiopic version renders them thus, "be ye prudent, and cause your heart to understand"; referring them not to temperance of body, but sobriety of mind, and to a prudent conduct and behaviour, as having a subtle as well as a malicious enemy to deal with: <p>because your adversary the devil; he who is a defamer and calumniator; who accuses God to men, and men to God, and is therefore styled the accuser of the brethren; he is the saints' avowed and implacable enemy. Satan is an enemy to mankind in general, but more especially to the seed of the woman, to Christ personal, and to Christ mystical, to all the elect of God: the word here used is a forensic term, and signifies a court adversary, or one that litigates a point in law, or opposes another in an action or suit at law. The Jews (c) have adopted this word into their language, and explain it by , "a law adversary", or one that has a suit of law depending against another. Satan accuses men of the breach of the law, and pleads that justice might take place, and punishment be inflicted, and which he pursues with great violence and diligence: <p>as a roaring lion; so called, both on account of his strength, and also because of his rage, malice, and cruelty, which he breathes out against the saints, who, though he cannot destroy them, will do all he can to terrify and affright them; so the young lions in <a href="/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a> are, by the Cabalistic Jews (d), understood of devils; to which, for the above reasons, they may be truly compared: <p>walketh about; to and fro in the earth; see <a href="/job/1-7.htm">Job 1:7</a> as a lion runs about here and there, when almost famished with hunger; and it also denotes the insidious methods, wiles, and stratagems Satan takes to surprise men, and get an advantage of them: he takes a tour, and comes round upon them, upon the back of them, at an unawares, so that they have need to be always sober, and upon their guard: <p>seeking whom he may devour; this is the end of his walking about: and the like is expressed in the Targum on <a href="/job/1-7.htm">Job 1:7</a><p>"and Satan answered before the Lord, and said, from going about in the earth , "to search into the works" of the children of men, and from walking in it;'' <p>that so he might have something to accuse them of, and they fall a prey into his hands. This is the work he is continually employed in; he is always seeking to do mischief, either to the souls, or bodies, or estates of men, especially the former; though he can do nothing in either respect without a permission, not unless he "may"; and though this, with respect to body and estate, is sometimes granted, as in the case of Job, yet never with respect to the souls of any of God's elect, which are safe in Christ's hands, and out of his reach; this hinders not but that saints should be sober and watchful. <p>(c) Yalkut Simeoni, par. 2. fol. 41. 4.

The word denotes strictly an opponent in a court of justice; but it occurs also in a general sense as “adversary.” Schott would retain the original application, after <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1</a> ff., <a href="/revelation/12-10.htm" title="And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brothers is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.">Revelation 12:10</a>, in that “the devil will, as it were, compel God to declare in condemnatory judgment that the Christians have forfeited salvation;” but there is no allusion to the divine judgment here, the <span class="greekheb">καταπίνειν</span> is rather indicated as the aim of the devil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς λέων ὠρυόμενος</span>]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[276] <span class="greekheb">ὠρύεσθαι</span> peculiariter dicitur <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ λιμῷ κλαιόντων λύκων</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἢ λεόντων</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἢ κυνῶν</span> (Hesych.), cf. <a href="/psalms/104-21.htm" title="The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.">Psalm 104:21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">περιπατεῖ</span> (<a href="/job/1-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, From where come you?

The tense used here implies an immediate act, as though he said, “Rouse yourselves to sobriety and watchfulness,” rather than a continuous state. The first word has the strict meaning of abstinence from that which inebriates. See note on chap. <a href="/1_peter/4-7.htm" title="But the end of all things is at hand: be you therefore sober, and watch to prayer.">1 Peter 4:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because your adversary the devil</span>] The word for “adversary” is the same as that used in <a href="/matthew/5-25.htm" title="Agree with your adversary quickly, whiles you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.">Matthew 5:25</a>, and carries with it the sense of a plaintiff or accuser in a trial before a judge. The Greek word for “devil’ (<span class="greekheb">διάβολος</span>), uniformly used in the LXX. for the Hebrew “Satan,” expresses the same thought, with the implied addition that the charge is false and calumnious. The comparison with the lion has its starting-point, perhaps, in <a href="/isaiah/38-13.htm" title="I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night will you make an end of me.">Isaiah 38:13</a>, where, however, it is used of God as visiting men with pain and sickness; or <a href="/psalms/22-21.htm" title="Save me from the lion's mouth: for you have heard me from the horns of the unicorns.">Psalm 22:21</a>, where its use is more closely parallel with the present passage. The use of the same verb for “roaring” in the LXX. of <a href="/psalms/22-13.htm" title="They gaped on me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.">Psalm 22:13</a> confirms the inference that that Psalm—the first words of which, it will be remembered, had been uttered by our Lord upon the cross—was present to St Peter’s mind. The word for “devour,” literally, <span class="bld">gulp down</span> or <span class="bld">swallow</span>, implies the thought of total destruction. It is probable, wide and general as the words are in themselves, that the special form of attack of which the Apostle thought was that of the persecution then raging, and of which, though human agents were prominent in it, Satan was regarded as the real instigator. Comp. <a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm" title="Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.">2 Timothy 4:17</a>.

The imperatives are aorist, as in <a href="/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>; and, as there, either imply that the exhortation was needed by the readers, or are used to express vividly the necessity of instant attention. <span class="cmt_word">Because your adversary the devil.</span> The conjunction "because" is omitted in the best manuscripts. The asyndeten, as in the last clause, increases the emphasis. The word rendered "adversary" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means properly an opponent in a lawsuit, as in <a href="/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>; but it is also used generally for "adversary," and so is a translation of the Hebrew word <span class="accented">Satan</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, devil, means "slanderer," "false accuser." <span class="cmt_word">As a roaring lion</span>. He is called a serpent to denote his subtlety, a lion to express his fierceness and strength. The word rendered "roaring" <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used especially of the cries of wild beasts when ravenous with hunger (see <a href="/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a>; and comp. <a href="/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Walketh about, seeking whom he may devour</span> (comp. <a href="/job/1-7.htm">Job 1:7</a>; <a href="/job/2-2.htm">Job 2:2</a>). The words express the restless energy of the wicked one. He cannot touch those who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation; but he walketh about, looking eagerly after any lost sheep that may have wandered from the fold. He roars in the craving of his heart for prey, like a hungry lion, seeking whom he may devour, or (for the reading here is somewhat uncertain) to devour some one, or simply to devour. The Greek word means literally "to drink down;" it implies utter destruction. It is the word in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>, "Death is swallowed up <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> in victory."

The one lion comes to conquer, the other to hurt." Seven Hebrew words are used for this animal; six to describe his movements and four to describe his roar. He is mentioned in the Bible about one hundred and thirty times. In <a href="//biblehub.com/job/4-10.htm">Job 4:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/4-11.htm">Job 4:11</a>, five different words are used for him.
