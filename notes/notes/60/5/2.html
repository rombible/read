It is the verb used in <a href="/john/21-16.htm" title="He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my sheep.">John 21:16</a>, not that in the 15th and 17th verses. There can be hardly any doubt that St. Peter was thinking of that scene when he issued these directions. Our Lord had committed into his hands all His sheep and lambs, without restriction of age or country, to be fed and shepherded; and now the time was approaching when he would have to “put off this tabernacle” (<a href="/2_peter/1-14.htm" title="Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me.">2Peter 1:14</a>), and he here takes order that “after his decease” the charge committed to him. may be fulfilled. He still shepherds the flock by proxy. Two other points must be mentioned, which bring this passage into connection with the charge given by St. Paul to the Ephesian elders (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>), which was very probably known to St. Peter. (1) St. Peter calls it “the flock <span class= "ital">of God.</span>” Textual critics are much divided on the reading in <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, but, on the whole, the Received reading seems the best supported: “the Church of God which He hath purchased with His own blood.” At the same time, St. Peter is in remembrance how Christ had said, “Feed <span class= "ital">My</span> sheep.” It may be fairly thought, therefore, when we see St. Peter’s own theology in <a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1Peter 1:25</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1Peter 2:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15</a>, that when he writes, “Feed the flock <span class= "ital">of God,” </span>his thoughts turn to the Second Person of the Holy Trinity rather than to the First. (2) Hooker well points out, on <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, the <span class= "ital">unity</span> of the flock. Though there were many elders in Ephesus, there was but one flock they fed between them. So now, all over Asia Minor, it was but one flock. St. Peter, to whom the flock throughout the whole world was committed, saw it as a whole, but the elders to whom he writes had only to look to that part of the one flock which was “among them.” The marginal rendering is against the order of the Greek words, and does not suit the context so well when the context is rightly understood.<p><span class= "bld">Taking the oversight thereof</span>.—It is exceedingly doubtful whether these words form part of the original text or not. If they do, the translation unduly limits the meaning, which would be better expressed by “maintaining (or, <span class= "ital">exercising</span>) the oversight,” or “performing the duties of bishops,” for he is addressing men who were already ordained. By this time the word “bishop” had not become a fixed title of one special office, though the office itself was in existence.<p><span class= "bld">Not by constraint, but willingly.</span>—Why should this exhortation be given so prominently? It is hardly to be thought that St. Peter had in view the humility which led men to adopt such strange methods of avoiding the responsibility of the priesthood as we find resorted to by Chrysostom and Ambrose. Much more probably he is thinking of the actual <span class= "ital">danger</span> to life and property of being “ringleaders of the sect” (<a href="/acts/24-5.htm" title="For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:">Acts 24:5</a>), which would lead cowardly bishops to throw up their office. He is not treating of the motives which should lead a man to accept the position. He speaks to persons who already <span class= "ital">hold</span> the office, and urges them not to leave the flock, like hirelings, when they see the persecution coming on. Several of the best authorities add,” but willingly, according to God.” It was God, that is, who put them in that station, and they must not need the compulsion of their laity, or of the rest of the episcopate, or of the Apostles, to keep them at their post.<p><span class= "bld">Not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.</span>—The opposite vice to that on which he has just passed sentence. Some, who had no fears, might be tempted to retain the office by the good salary which the Church gave, or might threaten to resign if their salaries were not raised in proportion to their risk. The “ready mind,” of which the Apostle speaks, means the love of the work itself, which should be the sole motive in seeking, or performing, the gospel ministry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_peter/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1 Peter 5:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Feed the flock of God </span>— Both by doctrine and discipline; <span class="ital">which is among you </span>— Namely, the churches of Christ, which you are called to preside over; <span class="ital">taking the oversight thereof </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">επισκοπουντες</span>, <span class="ital">discharging the episcopal office. </span>By this it appears that those who are styled <span class="ital">bishops, </span>from their having the oversight of others, and also <span class="ital">presbyters, </span>or <span class="ital">elders, </span>are spoken of as the same persons. <span class="ital">Not by constraint</span> — Unwillingly, as if it were a burden; <span class="ital">but willingly </span>— “In the first age, when the profession of the gospel exposed men to persecution, and when the persecutions fell more especially on the bishops, it may easily be imagined that some who were appointed to that office would undertake it unwillingly; not only because they were not disposed to do the duties thereof diligently, but because they were not willing to suffer.” <span class="ital">Not for filthy lucre </span>— Which, if it be the motive of acting, is filthy beyond expression. The apostle means also, not for a maintenance; for the sake of which merely, or chiefly, no one should undertake the pastoral office. They that preach the gospel may <span class="ital">live by the gospel, </span>but no one ought to engage in such a work merely that he may live by it. “O consider this, ye that leave one flock and go to another, merely ‘because there is more gain, a larger salary!’ Is it not astonishing that men ‘can see no harm in this?’ That it is not only practised, but avowed, all over the nation?” — Wesley. <span class="ital">But of a ready mind </span>— With a sincere desire to glorify God, and to save the souls of men. In the Syriac version, the word <span class="greekheb">προθυμως</span>, here used, is translated <span class="ital">toto corde, with the whole heart. </span>Dr. Benson’s observation on this verse is, “How severely are they here condemned, who feed themselves and not the flock; who take the patrimony of the church, and commit the care of souls to others, to whom they allow a very small share of that plenty which they have for doing little.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-4 The apostle Peter does not command, but exhorts. He does not claim power to rule over all pastors and churches. It was the peculiar honour of Peter and a few more, to be witnesses of Christ's sufferings; but it is the privilege of all true Christians to partake of the glory that shall be revealed. These poor, dispersed, suffering Christians, were the flock of God, redeemed to God by the great Shepherd, living in holy love and communion, according to the will of God. They are also dignified with the title of God's heritage or clergy; his peculiar lot, chosen for his own people, to enjoy his special favour, and to do him special service. Christ is the chief Shepherd of the whole flock and heritage of God. And all faithful ministers will receive a crown of unfading glory, infinitely better and more honourable than all the authority, wealth, and pleasure of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Feed the flock of God - Discharge the duties of a shepherd toward the flock. On the word "feed," see the notes at <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a>. It is a word which Peter would be likely to remember, from the solemn manner in which the injunction to perform the duty was laid on him by the Saviour. The direction means to take such an oversight of the church as a shepherd is accustomed to take of his flock. See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm">John 10:1-16</a>.<p>Which is among you - Margin, as much as in you is. The translation in the text is the more correct. It means the churches which were among them, or over which they were called to preside.<p>Taking the oversight thereof - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  episkopountes. The fair translation of this word is, "discharging the episcopal office"; and the word implies all that is always implied by the word "bishop" in the New Testament. This idea should have been expressed in the translation. The meaning is not merely to take the oversight - for that might be done in a subordinate sense by anyone in office; but it is to take such an oversight as is implied in the episcopate, or by the word "bishop." The words "episcopate," "episcopal," and "episcopacy," are merely the Greek word used here and its correlatives transferred to our language. The sense is that of overseeing; taking the oversight of; looking after, as of a flock; and the word has originally no reference to what is now spoken of as especially the episcopal office. It is a word strictly applicable to any minister of religion, or officer of a church. In the passage before us this duty was to be performed by those who, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/5-1.htm">1 Peter 5:1</a>, are called presbyters, or elders; and this is one of the numerous passages in the New Testament which prove that all that is properly implied in the performance of the episcopal functions pertained to those who were called presbyters, or elders. If so, there was no higher grade of ministers to which the special duties of the episcopate were to be entrusted; that is, there was no class of officers corresponding to those who are now called "bishops." Compare the notes at <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>.<p>Not by constraint, but willingly - Not as if you felt that a heavy yoke was imposed on you, or a burden from which you would gladly be discharged. Go cheerfully to your duty as a work which you love, and act like a freeman in it, and not as a slave. Arduous as are the labors of the ministry, yet there is no work on earth in which a man can and should labor more cheerfully.<p>Not for filthy lucre - Shameful or dishonorable gain. See the notes at <a href="/1_timothy/3-3.htm">1 Timothy 3:3</a>.<p>But of a ready mind - Cheerfully, promptly. We are to labor in this work, not under the influence of the desire of gain, but from the promptings of love. There is all the difference conceivable between one who does a thing because he is paid for it, and one who does it from love - between, for example, the manner in which one attends on us when we are sick who loves us, and one who is merely hired to do it. Such a difference is there in the spirit with which one who is actuated by mercenary motives, and one whose heart is in the work, will engage in the ministry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Feed&#8212;Greek, "Tend as a shepherd," by discipline and doctrine. Lead, feed, heed: by prayer, exhortation, government, and example. The dignity is marked by the term "elder"; the duties of the office, to tend or oversee, by "bishop." Peter has in mind Christ's injunction to him, "Feed (tend) My sheep &#8230; Feed (pasture) My lambs" (Joh 21:16). He invites the elders to share with him the same duty (compare Ac 20:28).

Some read, "as much as in you is"; that is, to the utmost of your power, according to your abilities, referring to the manner of feeding the flock, doing it in the best way they are capable of; but the phrase is rather descriptive of the flock to be fed, which points it out, and distinguishes it from all others, and for which they should have a particular regard; it being the flock, as the Syriac version renders it, which "is delivered unto you"; which was committed to their care, and they were made overseers of, and stood in a special relation to; wherefore it was incumbent on them to regard them, so as they did not, and were not obliged to regard, any other distinct flock: by "the flock of God"; or, "of Christ", as some copies read, is meant, not the whole world, which Philo the Jew (r) calls the greatest and most perfect,   , "flock of the true God"; but the church of God, over which they were elders or pastors, consisting of Christ's sheep and lambs, he ordered Peter to feed, as he now does his fellow elders; and because they are the flock of God, which he has chosen, distinguished, and separated from the rest of the world, and has made the care and charge of Christ; put them into his hands, whence they are called the sheep of his hand; which he has purchased with his blood, and effectually called by his grace, and returned them to himself, the Shepherd and Bishop of souls, who before were as sheep going astray, and folded them together in a Gospel church state; all this is a reason, and a strong one, why they should be fed; not with every wind of doctrine, which blows up the pride of human nature, and swells men with vain conceits of themselves; nor with the chaff of human doctrines; nor with trifling and speculative notions; but with knowledge and understanding of divine and evangelical truths, with the words of faith and sound doctrine, with the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ; with the Gospel of the grace of God, which contains milk for babes, and meat for strong men; and with a crucified Christ himself, who is the bread of life, and whose flesh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed; by directing them to his person, blood, and righteousness, to live by faith on; by preaching the doctrines of peace and pardon by his blood, atonement and satisfaction by his sacrifice, and justification by his righteousness, and complete salvation by his obedience and death: in short, feeding includes the whole of the pastor's work, the ministry of the word, the administration of ordinances, and the rule and government of the church, in the several branches of it; for the same word signifies to rule as to feed; and which work is further expressed by <p>taking the oversight thereof; that is, of the flock; or "take the care of it", as the Syriac version renders it, and adds, "spiritually"; in a spiritual manner; which is an interpretation of the phrase: an acting the part of a bishop or overseer of it, as the word signifies; looking diligently to it, inspecting into the various cases of the members of the church; using diligence to know the state of the flock, and performing all the offices of a careful shepherd; as feeding the flock; and not themselves; strengthening the diseased; healing the sick; binding up that which was broken; bringing again that which was driven away, and seeking that which was lost; watching over them that they go not astray; and restoring of them in the spirit of meekness, when they are gone out of the way; and overlooking both their practices and their principles; admonishing, reproving them for sin, as the case requires; and preserving them, as much as in them lies, from wolves, and beasts of prey; from false teachers, and from all errors and heresies: all which is to be done, <p>not by constraint; or with force, in a rigorous and severe manner; for this may be understood actively of pastors not forcing their flock, over driving them, or ruling them with force and cruelty, complained of in <a href="/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a> or passively, of their being forced to feed the flock, and superintend it; as such may be said to be, who enter into the ministry, and continue in it, because obliged to it for want of a livelihood, and not knowing how to get one any other way; or through the pressing instances of relations, acquaintance, and friends; this ought not to be a matter of necessity, but of choice; they should be induced to it by no other necessity than what Christ has laid upon them, by calling them to the work, and furnishing them for it with the gifts of his Spirit; and should engage and continue in it by no other constraint than that of his love; wherefore it follows, <p>but willingly. The Vulgate Latin version adds, "according to God", and so some copies; according to the will of God, and agreeably to his word; and the Ethiopic version renders it, "with equity for God"; with all uprightness and integrity, for the sake of the honour and glory of God; this should be done with all a man's heart and soul, and should spring from pure love to Christ; for no man is fit to feed Christ's lambs and sheep but those who sincerely love him; see <a href="//biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a>, and from a cordial and affectionate concern for the good of souls; and from, an hearty desire unto, and delight in, the work itself; otherwise all he does will be as a task and burden; he will do it grudgingly, and with negligence, and will murmur under it, at least secretly. The Arabic version renders it, "watching, not forced watches, but willing ones". This contrast of phrases seems to be Jewish, or Rabbinical (s); it is a tradition of the Rabbans; <p>"blood which is defiled, and they sprinkle it ignorantly, it is accepted; presumptuously, not accepted; of what things are these said? of a private person; but of a congregation, whether ignorantly or presumptuously, it is accepted; and of a stranger, whether ignorantly or presumptuously,   , "whether by constraint or willingly", it is not accepted:'' <p>it follows here, <p>not for filthy lucre; not from a covetous disposition, which is a filthy one; and for the sake of gaining money, and amassing wealth and riches, as the false prophets in Isaiah's time, who were never satisfied; and the false teachers in the apostle's time, who, through covetousness, made merchandise of men, and supposed that gain was godliness; whereas there is no such thing as serving God and mammon; and as the work of the ministry should not be entered upon, and continued in, with any such sordid view; so neither for the sake of gaining glory and applause, a presidency, and chief place in the churches, and a name among the ministers of the Gospel, and credit and esteem among men: <p>but of a ready mind; or, "from the whole heart", as the Syriac version renders it; and in a cheerful view of reproaches and persecutions, of the loss of credit and reputation, of worldly substance, and of life itself; and with a sincere concern for the glory of God, and the good of immortal souls; being ready to do everything with cheerfulness, that may contribute to either of these. The Ethiopic version renders it, "in the fulness of your heart with joy". <p>(r) De Agricultura, p. 195. (s) T. Bab. Menachot, fol. 25. 1. Vid. T. Bab. Avoda Zara, fol. 54. 1. &amp; Maimon. Hilch.

By it the flock is designated as belonging, not to the elders who tend it, but to God as His peculiar property. Luther takes a too narrow view of the idea of tending,—he limits it to the preaching of the gospel. It applies rather to all and everything that is done by the elders, for the welfare of the individual as well as for that of the entire congregation. <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἐν ὑμῖν</span> must not be separated from <span class="greekheb">ποίμνιον</span>, as if it were equal to quantum in vobis est (cf. <a href="/romans/1-15.htm" title="So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.">Romans 1:15</a>), i. e. intendite omnes nervos (Calvin); it rather forms <span class="ital">one</span> idea with <span class="greekheb">ποίμνιον</span>. The greater number of commentators understand <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> in a local sense, either: in vestris regionibus (Pott), or: “<span class="ital">with</span> you, within your reach” (Luther, in the commentary, Hensler, de Wette, Besser, Schott,[266] etc.). Since <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>, as a more precise local definition, stands somewhat significantly, and “the churches only are the place where the elders are, and not <span class="ital">vice versa</span>” (Hofmann), <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> must, according to the analogy of <span class="greekheb">κεῖσθαι ἔν τινι</span>, be interpreted: “<span class="ital">that which is committed to you</span>” (Luther’s translation, Bengel, Steiger), or: “<span class="ital">that which is placed under your care</span> (hand).” <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> then serves to give point to the exhortation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπισκοποῦντες</span>, cf. the critical notes.

This participle, with the adverbs belonging to it, states what should be the character of the <span class="greekheb">ποιμαίνειν</span>.[267] The verb (which, except here, occurs only in <a href="/hebrews/12-15.htm" title="Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;">Hebrews 12:15</a>), equivalent to: “<span class="ital">to give heed</span>,” denotes the labours of the elders in caring for the congregation, but with the implied meaning of oversight. The still closer definition follows in three adjuncts, each of which consists of a negative and a positive member. The thought is aptly given by Calvin: Dum Pastores ad officium hortari vult, tria potissimum vitia notat, quae plurimum obesse solent, pigritiam scilicet, lucri captandi cupiditatem et licentiam dominandi; primo vitio opponit alacritatem aut voluntarium studium, secundo liberalem affectum, tertio moderationem ac modestiam.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀναγκαστῶς</span> (an expression foreign to Greek usage, and occurring only here, which Hofmann erroneously denies) and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἙΚΟΥΣΊΩς</span></span></span> (this adverb occurs in the N.

He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my sheep.">John 21:16</a>; <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-7.htm" title="Who goes a warfare any time at his own charges? who plants a vineyard, and eats not of the fruit thereof? or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>). The shepherd’s work had been from a very early period a parable of that of rulers and of teachers. Kings were to Homer the “shepherds of the people” (<span class="greekheb">ποίμενες λαῶν</span>). David was taken from the sheepfold to feed Israel as the flock of Jehovah (<a href="/context/psalms/78-70.htm" title="He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:...">Psalm 78:70-71</a>). The sin of the kings and rulers of Judah had been that they did not feed the flock, but scattered and destroyed it (<a href="/context/jeremiah/23-1.htm" title="Woe be to the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! said the LORD....">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/34-2.htm" title="Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD to the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?...">Ezekiel 34:2-31</a>). In St Peter’s use of the word we note a reproduction of the words that had fallen on his ears with a three-fold, yet varied, iteration, “Feed my sheep” (<a href="/john/21-16.htm" title="He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my sheep.">John 21:16</a>). The comprehensiveness of the word must not be lost sight of. It includes more than preaching or teaching, and takes in the varied duties of what we rightly call the pastoral office. In the words “the flock of God” men are tacitly reminded who is the Chief Shepherd whom they serve, and to whom they will have to render an account (comp. <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>). It may be noted as a characteristic difference that in the Old Testament the shepherds of the people are always the civil rulers of the nation (e.g. <a href="/psalms/78-71.htm" title="From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.">Psalm 78:71</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm" title="Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD to the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?">Ezekiel 34:2</a>), while in the New that thought falls into the background, and the shepherd of the flock is its spiritual guide and teacher.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">taking the oversight thereof</span>] The first three words are the English equivalent of the Greek participle of the verb formed from <span class="ital">Episcopos</span>, the “bishop,” or “overseer” of the Church. In its being thus used to describe the office of the elders of the Church we have a close parallel to St Paul’s addressing the “elders” of the Church as being also “overseers” (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>). The two terms were in fact interchangeable, and what is now the higher office of the Bishop in relation to the Presbyters was discharged by the Apostle or his personal representative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not by constraint, but willingly</span>] The words that follow indicate the three great conditions of true pastoral work. (1) It must not be entered on reluctantly and as under pressure. In one sense indeed the truest and best work may be done by one who feels, as St Paul felt, that a “necessity is laid” upon him (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm" title="For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid on me; yes, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>), but there the necessity was that of a motive essentially spiritual. What St Peter deprecates is the drawing back from the labour and responsibility of the care of souls. The <span class="ital">Nolo episcopari</span>, which has been so often the formula of the pride or the sloth that apes humility, would have been in his eyes the sign of cowardice and weakness. Here, as in other things, the true temper is that of cheerful and willing service. The history of the Church presents, it is true, not a few instances, among which Chrysostom and Ambrose are preeminent, of the pastoral and episcopal office being forced upon a reluctant acceptance, but in such cases the reluctance left no trace in the after life. The work once entered on was done “willingly,” not as a forced and constrained service. It may be noted that the memorable treatise of Chrysostom, <span class="ital">On the Priesthood</span>, is in its form an <span class="ital">apologia</span> for his unwillingness to enter on the priestly office on the ground of its infinite dangers and responsibilities. Some of the better MSS. add the words “according to God,” to “willingly,” the phrase having the same meaning (“according to the will of God,”) as in chap. <a href="/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1 Peter 4:6</a>, <a href="/context/2_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing....">2 Corinthians 7:9-10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not for filthy lucre</span>] The adverb is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. The corresponding adjective meets us in <a href="/1_timothy/3-3.htm" title="Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;">1 Timothy 3:3</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1 Timothy 3:8</a>, <a href="/titus/1-7.htm" title="For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;">Titus 1:7</a>. The words are interesting as shewing that even in the troubled times in which St Peter wrote there was enough wealth in the Church to make the position of a Bishop-presbyter a lucrative one. There was the double stipend for those who were both pastors and preachers (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1 Timothy 5:17</a>). There was, for baser natures, the temptation of using spiritual influence for secular ends, “devouring widows’ houses,” as the Pharisees did in Judæa (<a href="/matthew/23-14.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore you shall receive the greater damnation.">Matthew 23:14</a>), “leading captive silly women,” as did the false teachers at Ephesus (<a href="/2_timothy/3-6.htm" title="For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,">2 Timothy 3:6</a>) and Crete (<a href="/titus/1-11.htm" title="Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.">Titus 1:11</a>). It may be noted that the term which both the Apostles use of the man who enters on the work of the ministry of souls from such a motive, is one which Greek writers commonly use of one who seeks gain in base and sordid ways. In their eyes the calling of a presbyter might be made, so followed, as disreputable an occupation as that of the usurer, or the pander, or the slave-dealer. In contrast with this temper, eagerly catching at emoluments, the Apostle points to the cheerful readiness that seeks eagerly for work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1 Peter 5:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ποιμάνατε</span>, <span class="ital">feed</span>) by discipline and doctrine.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ἐν ὑμῖν</span>) <span class="ital">entrusted to you for your part</span>.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ ἀναγκαστῶς</span>, <span class="ital">not by constraint</span>) Necessity is laid upon them, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm" title="For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid on me; yes, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>, but willingness prevents it from being felt. This is efficacious both in undertaking and in discharging the office. Those pastors are not undeserving of censure, who, if it were in their power, would prefer to be anything else.—[<span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ</span>, <span class="ital">but</span>—<span class="ital">but</span>) The motive and scope ought to be free from fault.—V. g.]—<span class="greekheb">μηδὲ αἰσχροκερδῶς</span>, <span class="ital">nor for the sake of dishonourable gain</span>) The receiving of pay is not forbidden, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-14.htm" title="Even so has the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.">1 Corinthians 9:14</a>; but there ought to be the absence of all that is dishonourable, and the presence of a noble promptness.—<span class="greekheb">προθύμως</span>, <span class="ital">willingly</span>) So that the enjoyment consists in feeding the flock, and not in the pay.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Feed the flock of God which is among you</span>; rather, <span class="accented">tend</span>, as a shepherd tends his flock. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is aorist, as if St. Peter wished to concentrate into one point of view all the labors of the ministerial life. He is echoing the word so solemnly addressed to himself by the risen Lord, "Feed my sheep <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>." The word covers all the various duties of the pastoral office: "Pasce mente, pasce ore, pasce operc, pasce animi oratione, verbi exhortatione, exempli exhibitione" (St. Bernard, quoted by Alford). St. Peter lays stress upon the solemn fact that the flock belongs to God, not to the shepherds (comp. <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>). Some understand the words rendered "which is among you <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> " as meaning" quantum in vobis est," "<span class="accented">as</span> far as lies in your power." Others as "<span class="accented">that</span> which is committed to you," or "that which is placed under your care." But the simple local meaning seems the best. <span class="cmt_word">Taking the oversight thereof.</span> This word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is not found in the Sinaitic and Vatican Manuscripts. Alford thinks that "it has, perhaps, been removed for ecclesiastical reasons, for fear <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> should be supposed to be, as they really were, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> It is in the Alexandrine and most other ancient manuscripts and versions, and there seems to be no sufficient reason for omitting it. It shows that when this Epistle was written, the words <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, presbyter and bishop, were still synonymous (comp. <a href="/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a> and 28 in the Greek; also <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a> and 7). <span class="cmt_word">Not by constraint, but willingly</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, by constraint, occurs only here. St. Paul says (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>), "Necessity is laid upon me;" but that was an inward necessity, the constraining love of Christ. Bede, quoted by Alford, <span class="accented">says</span>, "Coacte pascit gregem, qui propter rerum temporalium penurium non habens unde vivat, idcirco praedicat evangelium ut de evangelio vivere possit." Some good manuscripts add, after "willingly," the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "according to God," i.e. according to his will (comp. <a href="/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not for filthy lucre.</span> The adverb <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> occurs only here (for the thought, comp. <a href="/1_timothy/3-8.htm">1 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>). It would seem that, even in the apostolic age, there were sometimes such opportunities of gain (see <a href="/titus/1-11.htm">Titus 1:11</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>) as to be a temptation to enter the ministry for the sake of money. St. Peter uses a strong word in condemnation of such a motive. <span class="cmt_word">But of a ready mind.</span> This adverb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; it has a stronger meaning than the preceding word <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, willingly; it implies zeal and enthusiasm. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_peter/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Feed (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Better, Rev., tend, since the verb denotes all that is included in the office of a shepherd - guiding, guarding, folding, no less than feeding, which latter is expressed by &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;. There is, doubtless, a reminiscence in the word of Christ's charge to Peter (<a href="//biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). Both words are used there: "Feed (&#x392;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;) my lambs" (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a>); "tend (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;) my sheep" (<a href="/john/21-16.htm">John 21:16</a>); "feed (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;) my sheep" (<a href="/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a>). The A. V. obliterates the distinction by rendering all three feed. Bengel rightly remarks, "Feeding is part of tending." See on <a href="/matthew/2-6.htm">Matthew 2:6</a>.<p>Taking the oversight<p>The best texts omit. Rev. retains.<p>By constraint (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here in New Testament.<p>Willingly (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here and <a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a>.<p>For filthy lucre (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>From &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, disgraceful, and &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, gain. Only here in New Testament. The word filthy is intended to convey the idea which lies in &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, base or dishonorable; becoming such if it is made the motive of the minister's service. Compare <a href="/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>.<p>Willingly (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Not strong enough.

Hence Rev., with a ready mind; a forward spirit; denoting not mere willingness, but zeal. Only here in New Testament.
