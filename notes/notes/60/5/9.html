not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1Peter 5:2</a>), or lying still and letting things take their course (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a>). And the words for “stedfast in the faith” seem to mean not only that each individual is to stand firm, but that they are to present all together a solid front to the lion.<p><span class= "bld">Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</span>—The phraseology of the original is very strange. The <span class= "ital">sameness</span> of the sufferings is brought out by an expression which literally runs “the same things in the way of sufferings;” the fraternal unity, by the use of the same abstract word which we had in <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm" title="Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.">1Peter 2:17</a>. The verb rendered “to accomplish” sometimes denotes execution or infliction. So the whole will run, <span class= "ital">knowing that the very same things in the way of sufferings are being inflicted upon your brotherhood which is in the world. “</span>There is one thing,” says Archbishop Leighton, “that much troubles the patience and weakens the faith of some Christians; they are ready to think there is none, yea, there was never any beloved of God in such a condition as theirs. Therefore the Apostle St. Paul breaks this conceit (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1Corinthians 10:13</a>), ‘no temptation hath taken you but such as is common to man:’ and here is the same truth, ‘the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren.’ This is the truth, and, taken altogether, is a most comfortable truth; the whole brotherhood go in this way, and our eldest Brother went first.” The addition, “that are in the world,” points the suffering Christians indirectly to solace themselves with the thought of that portion of the brotherhood which has got beyond the infliction. It would be possible to translate, though somewhat far-fetched in point of thought, “knowing that the same sufferings (or, <span class= "ital">the identity of the sufferings</span>) is completed by your brotherhood in the world”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>finds a consummation in making closer the bonds of brotherhood between you.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:5-9 Humility preserves peace and order in all Christian churches and societies; pride disturbs them. Where God gives grace to be humble, he will give wisdom, faith, and holiness. To be humble, and subject to our reconciled God, will bring greater comfort to the soul than the gratification of pride and ambition. But it is to be in due time; not in thy fancied time, but God's own wisely appointed time. Does he wait, and wilt not thou? What difficulties will not the firm belief of his wisdom, power, and goodness get over! Then be humble under his hand. Cast all you care; personal cares, family cares, cares for the present, and cares for the future, for yourselves, for others, for the church, on God. These are burdensome, and often very sinful, when they arise from unbelief and distrust, when they torture and distract the mind, unfit us for duties, and hinder our delight in the service of God. The remedy is, to cast our care upon God, and leave every event to his wise and gracious disposal. Firm belief that the Divine will and counsels are right, calms the spirit of a man. Truly the godly too often forget this, and fret themselves to no purpose. Refer all to God's disposal. The golden mines of all spiritual comfort and good are wholly his, and the Spirit itself. Then, will he not furnish what is fit for us, if we humbly attend on him, and lay the care of providing for us, upon his wisdom and love? The whole design of Satan is to devour and destroy souls. He always is contriving whom he may insnare to eternal ruin. Our duty plainly is, to be sober; to govern both the outward and the inward man by the rules of temperance. To be vigilant; suspicious of constant danger from this spiritual enemy, watchful and diligent to prevent his designs. Be stedfast, or solid, by faith. A man cannot fight upon a quagmire, there is no standing without firm ground to tread upon; this faith alone furnishes. It lifts the soul to the firm advanced ground of the promises, and fixes it there. The consideration of what others suffer, is proper to encourage us to bear our share in any affliction; and in whatever form Satan assaults us, or by whatever means, we may know that our brethren experience the same.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whom resist - See the notes at <a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>. You are in no instance to yield to him, but are in all forms to stand up and oppose him. Feeble in yourselves, you are to confide in the arm of God. No matter in what form of terror he approaches, you are to fight manfully the fight of faith. Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-17</a>.<p>Steadfast in the faith - Confiding in God. You are to rely on him alone, and the means of successful resistance are to be found in the resources of faith. See the notes at <a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm">Ephesians 6:16</a>.<p>Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world - Compare for a similar sentiment, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>. The meaning is, that you should be encouraged to endure your trials by the fact that your fellow-Christians suffer the same things. This consideration might furnish consolation to them in their trials in the following ways:<p>(1) They would feel that they were suffering only the common lot of Christians. There was no evidence that God was especially angry with them, or that he had in a special manner forsaken them.<p>(2) the fact that others were enabled to bear their trials should be an argument to prove to them that they would also be able. If they looked abroad, and saw that others were sustained, and were brought off triumphant, they might be assured that this would be the case with them.<p>(3) there would be the support derived from the fact that they were not alone in suffering. We can bear pain more easily if we feel that we are not alone - that it is the common lot - that we are in circumstances where we may have sympathy from others. This remark may be of great practical value to us in view of persecutions, trials, and death. The consideration suggested here by Peter to sustain those whom he addressed, in the trials of persecution, may be applied now to sustain and comfort us in every form of apprehended or real calamity. We are all liable to suffering. We are exposed to sickness, bereavement, death. We often feet as if we could not bear up under the sufferings that may be before us, and especially do we dread the great trial - death. It may furnish us some support and consolation to remember:<p>(1) that this is the common lot of people. There is nothing special in our case. It proves nothing as to the question whether we are accepted of God, and are beloved by him, that we suffer; for those whom he has loved most have been often among the greatest sufferers. We often think that our sufferings are unique; that there have been none like them. Yet, if we knew all, we should find that thousands - and among them the most wise, and pure, and good - have endured sufferings of the same kind as ours, and perhaps far more intense in degree.<p>(2) others have been conveyed triumphantly through their trials. We have reason to hope and to believe that we shall also, for:<p>(a) our trials have been no greater than theirs have been; and,<p>(b) their natural strength was no greater than ours. Many of them were timid, and shrinking, and trembling, and felt that they had no strength, and that they should fail under the trial.<p>(3) the grace which sustained them can sustain us. The hand of God is not shortened that it cannot save; his ear is not heavy that it cannot hear. His power is as great, and his grace is as fresh, as it was when the first sufferer was supported by him; and that divine strength which supported David and Job in their afflictions, and the apostles and martyrs in theirs, is just as powerful as it was when they applied to God to be upheld in their sorrows.<p>(4) we are especially fearful of death - fearful that our faith will fail, and that we shall be left to die without support or consolation. Yet let us remember that death is the common lot of man. Let us remember who have died - tender females; children; the timid and the fearful; those, in immense multitudes, who had no more strength by nature than we have. Let us think of our own kindred who have died. A wife has died, and shall a husband be afraid to die? A child, and shall a father? A sister, and shall a brother? It does much to take away the dread of death, to remember that a mother has gone through the dark valley; that that gloomy vale has been trod by delicate, and timid, and beloved sisters. Shall I be afraid to go where they have gone? Shall I apprehend that I shall find no grace that is able to sustain me where they have found it? Must the valley of the shadow of death be dark and gloomy to me, when they found it to be illuminated with the opening light of heaven? Above all, it takes away the fear of death when I remember that my Saviour has experienced all the horrors which can ever be in death; that he has slept in the tomb, and made it a hallowed resting-place. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

It is only a firm faith that can resist the devil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰδότες τὰ αὐτὰ τῶν παθημάτων</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐπιτελεῖσθαι</span>] Almost all interpreters assume that the construction here is that of the accus. c. inf. Hofmann nevertheless denies this, remarking that in the N. T. <span class="greekheb">εἰδότες</span> (in the sense of “knowing”) never takes the accus. c. inf., but always the particle <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, and that when <span class="greekheb">εἰδότες</span> is followed by the accus. c. inf., it signifies “to understand how to do a thing.”[278] If this be correct, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΤΕΛΕῖΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> must have an active meaning, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΑὐΤᾺ ΤῶΝ ΠΑΘ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> be the accusative after it, and the dative <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῇ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἈΔΕΛΦΌΤΗΤΙ</span></span></span> be dependent on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΑὐΤΆ</span></span></span>. Explaining <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΤΕΛΕῖΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> on the analogy of the phrase: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΤΟῦ ΓΉΡΩς ἘΠΙΤΕΛΕῖΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> (Xen. <span class="ital">Mem</span>. iv. 8. 8), and seeing in <span class="greekheb">τὰ αὐτά</span> the idea of measure expressed, Hofmann translates: “knowing how to pay for your Christianity the same tribute of affliction as your brethren in the world.” This explanation cannot be accepted without hesitation. For, on the one hand, from the fact that in other parts of the N. T. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸΔΌΤΕς</span></span></span> does not take the accus. c. inf., it cannot be concluded that here it does not do so either, the more especially that the construction of the accus. c. inf. occurs comparatively rarely in the N. T.; and, on the other hand, the phrase: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΤῶΝ ΠΑΘ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΠΟΤΕΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, is not analogous with the expression: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΤΟῦ ΓΉΡΩς ἘΠΙΤΕΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, since in the former there is no conception corresponding to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ΓΉΡΩς</span></span></span>. Hofmann inserts, indeed, as such, the idea of the Christian calling, but it is purely imported, and nowhere hinted at in the text. Accordingly, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΤΕΛΕῖΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>—grammatically considered—<span class="ital">can</span> have a passive signification, not, indeed, equivalent to: “are completed” (Thuc. 7:2; <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm" title="Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:">Php 1:6</a>, and other passages), for this idea would not be suitable here, but rather: “are being accomplished” (thus Herod. 1:51, in connection with <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐπιτασσόμενα</span>; 1:138: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΤΕΛΈΣΑΙ Ἃ ὙΠΈΣΧΕΤΟ</span></span></span>). This idea is, in truth, not very appropriate either; it seems to be more fitting to take the verb in a middle sense, as equivalent to: “are accomplishing themselves;” and to translate: “knowing (or better rather: considering) that the same sufferings are accomplishing themselves in the brethren.” This rendering is to be preferred to all others. The Vulg. translates <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΤΕΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> by fieri; Luther by “befall;” both are too inexact renderings of the sense.[279] In the explanation above given, <span class="greekheb">τὰ αὐτά</span> is used as a substantive, as frequently happens with the neuter of adjectives (Winer, p. 220[280] [E.T. 294]), and is put here to emphasize the sameness of the sufferings (thus de Wette, Wiesinger); <span class="greekheb">τῇ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφότητι</span> is to be taken as the more remote object; on no condition can the dative be understood as equivalent to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΌ</span></span></span> in passives.

Wiesinger justly remarks: “in the world, the dominion of the Evil One, the Christian can and dare expect nothing else.” Possibly it may contain at the same time a reference to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΔΕΛΦΌΤΗς</span></span></span>, which the Lord has already taken to Himself <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ ΤΟῦ ΚΌΣΜΟΥ</span></span></span>. The thought that the brethren have to bear the same afflictions, serves to give strength in resisting the devil, since the consciousness of bearing similar afflictions in common with all Christian brethren, encourages to patient endurance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[278] Cf. the passages quoted by Hofmann: <a href="/matthew/7-11.htm" title="If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?">Matthew 7:11</a>; <a href="/luke/11-13.htm" title="If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?">Luke 11:13</a>; <a href="/luke/12-36.htm" title="And you yourselves like to men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately.">Luke 12:36</a>; <a href="/james/4-17.htm" title="Therefore to him that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin.">Jam 4:17</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-12.htm" title="I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.">Php 4:12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-5.htm" title="(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)">1 Timothy 3:5</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-9.htm" title="The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished:">2 Peter 2:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[279] The translation of Wichelhaus: “<span class="ital">to be laid upon</span>,” is entirely unjustifiable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[280] Hofmann erroneously appeals to Hartung’s <span class="ital">Gr.</span> II. p. 238, in support of the interpretation: “the same measure of suffering.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_peter/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_peter/5-9.htm" title="Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brothers that are in the world.">1 Peter 5:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">ᾧ ἀντίστητε</span>. St. James adds the same exhortation to his quotation of Prov. The connexion is not obvious but is perhaps due to the traditional exposition of <span class="greekheb">לץ</span> = <span class="greekheb">ὑπερηφάνοις</span> as referring to the Devil and his children. As God ranges Himself against scoffers, so must Christians resist the Devil who is working with their slanderous tempers. Oecumenius and Cramer’s <span class="ital">Catena</span> both appeal to an extract from Justin’s book against Marcion (?) which is preserved in Irenæsus and quoted by Eusebius. The main point of the passage is that before Christ came the devil did not dare to blaspheme against God, for the prophecies of his punishment were enigmatic; but Christ proclaimed it plainly and so he lost all hope and goes about eager to drag down all to his own destruction.—<span class="greekheb">στερεοὶ τῇ πίστει</span>, <span class="ital">rock like in your faith</span>, abbreviation of <span class="greekheb">ἐπιμένετε τῇ πίστει τεθεμελιωμένοι καὶ ἑδραῖοι</span>, <a href="/colossians/1-23.htm" title=" If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;">Colossians 1:23</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">τὸ στερέωμα τῆς εἰς Χριστὸν πίστεως</span>, <a href="/colossians/2-5.htm" title=" For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.">Colossians 2:5</a> and <a href="/acts/16-5.htm" title="And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.">Acts 16:5</a>, <span class="greekheb">αἱ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησίαι ἐστερεοῦντο τῇ πιστει</span>.

The Apostle appeals to the thought of sympathy with other sufferers as a ground of steadfastness. Those to whom he wrote were not isolated in their afflictions.

Only faith can give that steadfastness - faith in Christ, the one Foundation, the Rock on which the Christian's house is built. Faith here is trustfulness rather than objective truth. Therefore the rendering of the Revised Version seems preferable, "in your faith," the article having, as often, a possessive meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the same</span> (<span class="accented">forms</span>) <span class="accented">of afflictions</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> unusual construction with the pronoun, though common with adjectives, intended to give emphasis; the sufferings were the very same. The infinitive is present; it should therefore be rendered, "are being accomplished." The persecutions were now beginning to break out. The word for "brethren" is the collective, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1fef;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, brotherhood, which we met with in <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>. The dative is that of reference -  "in" or "for"  the brotherhood. (For the words, "in the world," comp. <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.") There is another way of taking the clause. The unusual construction (in the Greek Testament) of the accusative and infinitive, which, indeed, occurs nowhere else with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, has led Herman and others to take the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> as middle, and to connect the dative, "<span class="accented">for</span> the brotherhood," with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, the same. Thus the translation will be, "<span class="accented">Knowing</span> how to pay the same tribute of affliction as your brethren in the world." This seems forced and unnecessary. Huther gives another possible translation, which he thinks preferable to all others: "<span class="accented">Knowing</span> [or better rather, 'considering'] that the same sufferings are accomplishing themselves in the brethren." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_peter/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Resist (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>The Rev., very judiciously, substitutes withstand; resist having been already used in <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a> for &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. Withstand is, moreover, the more accurate rendering; as the verb means rather to be firm against onset than to strive against it. With in withstand is the Saxon wid, against, which appears in the German wider.<p>Steadfast (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;)<p>Compare <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; and the kindred verb &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9;, to strengthen (<a href="//biblehub.com/acts/3-7.htm">Acts 3:7</a>, <a href="/acts/3-16.htm">Acts 3:16</a>; <a href="/acts/16-5.htm">Acts 16:5</a>). Paul, in <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a>, uses a cognate noun, &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, evidently as a military metaphor: "Beholding your order (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, compare &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>) and your solid front or close phalanx" (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;). It might be difficult to find, on the whole, a better rendering than steadfast, yet it falls a little short of the meaning. Steadfast is Anglo-Saxon, stede, a place, and faest, fast; and hence means firm in its place; but &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; conveys also the sense of compactness, compact solidity, and is appropriate, since a number of individuals are addressed and exhorted to withstand the onset of Satan as one compacted body. &#x3a3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; implies solidity in the very mass and body of the thing itself; steadfastness, mere holding of place. A rock is &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, firm, solid; but a flexible weed with its tough roots resisting all efforts to pull it up, may be steadfast.
