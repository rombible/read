If His be the dominion, and He have called us to His glory, then what can we fear?<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_peter/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:10-14 In conclusion, the apostle prays to God for them, as the God of all grace. Perfect implies their progress towards perfection. Stablish imports the curing of our natural lightness and inconstancy. Strengthen has respect to the growth of graces, especially where weakest and lowest. Settle signifies to fix upon a sure foundation, and may refer to Him who is the Foundation and Strength of believers. These expressions show that perseverance and progress in grace are first to be sought after by every Christian. The power of these doctrines on the hearts, and the fruits in the lives, showed who are partakers of the grace of God. The cherishing and increase of Christian love, and of affection one to another, is no matter of empty compliment, but the stamp and badge of Jesus Christ on his followers. Others may have a false peace for a time, and wicked men may wish for it to themselves and to one another; but theirs is a vain hope, and will come to nought. All solid peace is founded on Christ, and flows from him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To him be glory ... - See the notes at <a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

The verb <span class="ital">be</span> in the text is not in the Greek, and so it may be read with a supply of a verb either of the imperative mood, and then it is a doxology, as we render it; or of the indicative, he hath glory and dominion; or, to him belongs glory and dominion, or glorious dominion or power; and then it tends to encourage these saints, in that he, whom the apostle prays to stablish and strengthen them, is of power sufficient to do it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_peter/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>To him be glory, and dominion, for ever and ever, Amen. The Syriac version begins this doxology in the preceding verse, reading the words thus, "to the God of grace", and then putting what follows, "who hath called us", &amp;c. into a parenthesis, connects them with these, "be glory, and power, and honour", &amp;c. "glory" is due to God for all the grace he bestows on men; and to give it to him shows a sense of divine goodness, and a grateful heart; and to him very fitly is "dominion" ascribed, whose kingdom rules over all, and who dispenses his grace, as well as his providential favours, in a sovereign way; and whom the saints are in a peculiar manner under obligation to obey; to which is added, "Amen", signifying that so the apostle prayed it might be, and believed it would be. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.
