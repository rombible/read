There is a sense in which the heads of the Church are, and ought to be, lords and princes over the rest; but this is very different from “lording it,” acting tyrannically, forgetting the constitutional rights of their subjects.<p><span class= "bld">Over God’s heritage.</span>—Quite literally, <span class= "ital">Over the lots.</span> The word first of all means (as in <a href="/matthew/27-35.htm" title="And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and on my clothing did they cast lots.">Matthew 27:35</a> or <a href="/acts/1-26.htm" title="And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.">Acts 1:26</a>) the actual scrap of paper or wood that was tossed. Then it comes to mean (like the word “lot” in the language of auctions) the piece of property that falls by lot to any one’s share. Then all notion of <span class= "ital">chance</span> disappears, and it comes to mean the portion assigned to any one. So St. Peter says that Simon Magus has “no share nor lot in this thing” (<a href="/acts/8-21.htm" title="You have neither part nor lot in this matter: for your heart is not right in the sight of God.">Acts 8:21</a>). In <a href="/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-12.htm" title=" Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:">Colossians 1:12</a>, the same word is rendered “inheritance.” In <a href="/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>, our version endeavours, not very successfully, through the Latin word “consorted,” to keep up the underlying notion of the Greek, which literally is “were <span class= "ital">allotted</span> to Paul and Silas.” Here, therefore, we must understand “the lots,” over which the clergy are not to lord it, to be the different congregations, districts, parishes, dioceses, which had been allotted to them. At the same time it does not at all imply that any process like drawing of lots had been resorted to in their appointment, as is seen from <a href="/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>, just cited. It will be seen that our version is misleading in substituting singular for plural, and in inserting the word “God’s.” The whole flock is God’s (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1Peter 5:2</a>), purchased with His own blood; but the “allotments” are the portions assigned by Him to the different clergy. It is some consolation to see, when we groan under the lives and characters of some church officers now, that even in the Apostles’ days cowardice, greed, and self-assertion were not unknown.<p><span class= "bld">Ensamples to the flock.</span>—The best way of becoming a real prince and lord over men is to show them by example what they ought to do, like Chaucer’s Parson, who—<p>“Cristes lore and hys Apostlis twelve<p>He taught, but fyrst hee practys’d it himselve.”<p>Leighton well quotes from Nazianzen: “Either teach not, or teach by living.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_peter/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_peter/5-3.htm" title="Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock....">1 Peter 5:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Neither as being lords, </span>or <span class="ital">lording it, over God’s heritage </span>— Behaving in a haughty, domineering manner, as though you had dominion over their consciences. From this prohibition it would seem that, in the apostle’s days, the bishops or elders were beginning to assume that dominion over their flocks, which in after times they carried to the greatest height of tyranny. Or St. Peter, by inspiration, foreseeing what would happen, condemned in this prohibition the tyranny which in after times the clergy exercised. <span class="ital">But being ensamples to the flock </span>— Setting them an example worthy of their imitation; and therefore, being of a meek and lowly, kind and condescending mind, and be having toward them with such gentle, tender solicitude for their salvation, and such an entire freedom from the very appearance either of avarice or ambition, that you may gain their confidence, and win their affections. <span class="ital">And when the chief Shepherd shall appear </span>— To judge the world; <span class="ital">ye </span>— Who have discharged your duty to your flocks faithfully; <span class="ital">shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away </span>— A crown which shall bloom in immortal beauty and vigour, when all the transitory glories of this world are withered, like a fading flower.

It was the peculiar honour of Peter and a few more, to be witnesses of Christ's sufferings; but it is the privilege of all true Christians to partake of the glory that shall be revealed. These poor, dispersed, suffering Christians, were the flock of God, redeemed to God by the great Shepherd, living in holy love and communion, according to the will of God. They are also dignified with the title of God's heritage or clergy; his peculiar lot, chosen for his own people, to enjoy his special favour, and to do him special service. Christ is the chief Shepherd of the whole flock and heritage of God.

The word here used (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;  katakurieuo&#772;) is rendered "exercise dominion over," in <a href="/matthew/20-25.htm">Matthew 20:25</a>; exercise lordship over, in <a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42</a>; and overcame, in <a href="/acts/19-16.htm">Acts 19:16</a>. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It refers properly to that kind of jurisdiction which civil rulers or magistrates exercise. This is an exercise of authority, as contradistinguished from the influence of reason, persuasion, and example. The latter pertains to the ministers of religion; the former is forbidden to them. Their dominion is not to be that of temporal lordship; it is to be that of love and truth. This command would prohibit all assumption of temporal power by the ministers of religion, and all conferring of titles of nobility on those who are preachers of the gospel. It needs scarcely to be said that it has been very little regarded in the church.<p>Over God's heritage - &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  to&#772;n kle&#772;ro&#772;n. Vulgate: "in cleris" - over the clergy. The Greek word here (&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  kle&#772;ros) is that from which the word "clergy" has been derived; and some have interpreted it here as referring to the clergy, that is, to priests and deacons who are under the authority of a bishop. Such an interpretation, I however, would hardly be adopted now. The word means properly:<p>(a) a lot, die, anything used in determining chances;<p>(b) a part or portion, such as is assigned by lot; hence,<p>(c) an office to which one is designated or appointed, by lot or otherwise; and,<p>(d) in general any possession or heritage, <a href="/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12</a>.<p>The meaning here is, "not lording it over the possessions or the heritage of God." The reference is, undoubtedly, to the church, as that which is especially his property; his own in the world. Whitby and others suppose that it refers to the possessions or property of the church; Doddridge explains it - "not assuming dominion over those who fall to your lot," supposing it to mean that they were not to domineer over the particular congregations committed by Providence to their care. But the other interpretation is most in accordance with the usual meaning of the word.<p>But being ensamples to the flock - Examples. See the notes at <a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>. Peter has drawn here with great beauty, the appropriate character of the ministers of the gospel, and described the spirit with which they should be actuated in the discharge of the duties of their office. But how different it is from the character of many who have claimed to be ministers of religion; and especially how different from that corrupt communion which professes in a special manner to recognize Peter as the head, and the vicegerent of Christ. It is well remarked by Benson on this passage, that "the church of Rome could not well have acted more directly contrary to this injunction of Peter's if she had studied to disobey it, and to form herself upon a rule that should be the reverse of this." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. being lords&#8212;Greek, "lording it": implying pride and oppression.

It is explained by "the flock" in the next clause. However, in 1Pe 5:2, "flock of God which is among you," answering to "(God's) heritages" (plural to express the sheep who are God's portion and inheritance, De 32:9) committed to you, favors English Version. The flock, as one whole, is God's heritage, or flock in the singular. Regarded in relation to its component sheep, divided among several pastors, it is in the plural "heritages." Compare Ac 1:17, 25, "part" (the same Greek).

The elders, as the leaders of the church, necessarily possess a kind of <span class="greekheb">κυριότης</span> over it; but they are not to exercise this in a manner opposed to the character of Christian life in the church (which would be a <span class="greekheb">κατακυριεύειν</span>), but by being examples to the congregations, shining before them in every Christian virtue (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.">1 Timothy 4:12</a>; <a href="/titus/2-7.htm" title="In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing soundness, gravity, sincerity,">Titus 2:7</a>); cf. <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-9.htm" title="Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample to you to follow us.">2 Thessalonians 3:9</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-17.htm" title="Brothers, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as you have us for an ensample.">Php 3:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[269] Thus Hofmann interprets, correctly. He is mistaken, however, in maintaining that <span class="greekheb">κατα</span> here does not imply an hostile antithesis, since a violent rule is one by which he who is ruled over is injured in his rights.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[270] The opinion of Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">κλῆρον τὸ ἱερὸν σύστημα καλεῖ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ καὶ νῦν ἡμεῖς</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> the priesthood), which many Catholic commentators have followed, requires no refutation; and as little does that of Dodwell, who understands <span class="greekheb">κλῆροι</span> to mean church property.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">neither as being lords over God’s heritage</span>] Better, <span class="bld">not lording it over the heritages</span>. There is no word in the Greek answering to “God’s,” and it is not wanted to complete the sense. The word for “lording” implies an authority exercised both wrongfully and oppressively. Ambition, the love of power for the sake of power, is, from the Apostle’s standpoint, as great a hindrance to true pastoral work as avarice. The whole history of the Church, in particular the history of the papacy, as e.g. in the history of Gregory VII., shews how fatally it has worked on souls that had conquered, or had never known, the baser temptation. Warnings against such ambition we find again and again in our Lord’s teaching (<a href="/context/matthew/20-25.htm" title="But Jesus called them to him, and said, You know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority on them....">Matthew 20:25-28</a>; <a href="/context/luke/22-24.htm" title="And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest....">Luke 22:24-26</a>; <a href="/context/mark/9-34.htm" title="But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest....">Mark 9:34-35</a>). A memorable picture of the working of such a temper in St Paul’s rivals at Corinth meets us in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word for “heritages” (the Greek noun (<span class="greekheb">κλῆρος</span>) is in the plural) means primarily a “lot;” then, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-9.htm" title="Why Levi has no part nor inheritance with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD your God promised him.">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-12.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; for as much as he has no part nor inheritance with you.">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>, the “portion assigned by lot.” So Jehovah is said to be the “portion” or “heritage” of the Levites (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-9.htm" title="Why Levi has no part nor inheritance with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD your God promised him.">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>). Here the idea would seem to be that each separate <span class="ital">Ecclesia</span> was thought of as the “portion” of the presbyter who watched over it. The later history of the word presents a curious series of transitions. (1) From the congregations it was transferred to the presbyters, as being, it was supposed, in a special sense, the “portion” or “heritage” of God. They accordingly were described as the <span class="ital">clerus</span>, the <span class="ital">clerici</span>, of the Church, and hence we get the common words, “clergy,” and “clerical.” (2) From the educational superiority of the clerical order in the Middle Ages, the word came to be applied to any person of a higher than average culture. So Chaucer speaks of Homer as a “great clerke,” and the legal phrase “benefit of clergy” retains a trace of the same meaning. (3) From this elevation it has come to be applied, as by a <span class="ital">facilis descensus</span>, to the lower forms of culture, and the “parish clerk” and the copying “clerk” at his desk, present the fallen greatness of the word that was once so noble.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but being ensamples to the flock</span>] Comp. the word and the thought in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-9.htm" title="Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample to you to follow us.">2 Thessalonians 3:9</a> and <a href="/philippians/3-17.htm" title="Brothers, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as you have us for an ensample.">Php 3:17</a>. It is obvious that the teaching of the verse does not condemn the exercise of all spiritual authority as such, but only its excesses and abuses; but in doing this, it points out also that the influence of example is more powerful than any authority, and to seek after that influence is the best safeguard against the abuse of power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/5-3.htm" title="Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.">1 Peter 5:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὡς κατακυριεύοντες</span>, <span class="ital">as being lords over</span>) who only give orders with a proud mind, and not with humility, and who oppress.

But the style closely resembles a Mimesis:[39] for the congregation is not <span class="ital">the peculiar property</span> of the elder, but he who <span class="ital">lords it</span>, treats it as though it were his <span class="ital">lot</span> or <span class="ital">property</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κλῆρος</span> signifies <span class="ital">a lot</span>; then a portion of the Church which falls to an elder as his pastoral charge; then the pastor’s office; then the pastors; then the other <span class="ital">clergy</span>.

The literal rendering of the clause is, "lording it over the lots." The Authorized Version, following Beza, supplies <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "God's heritage." But if this were the apostle's meaning, he would surely have used the singular, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the lot or portion of God;" and it is very unlikely that he would have left the most important word to be supplied. Some commentators take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> in its modern sense, of the clergy, as if St. Peter was commanding the bishops not to tyrannize over the inferior clergy. But this view involves an anachronism; the word had not acquired this meaning in St. Peter's time. It is clearly best to understand it of the lots or portions assigned to individual presbyters. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> originally meant a "lot" (<a href="/matthew/27-35.htm">Matthew 27:35</a>; <a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>), then portions assigned by casting lots, as the possessions of the tribes of Israel (<a href="/joshua/18.htm">Joshua 18</a> and 19), then any portion or inheritance however obtained; thus in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a> the Lord is said to be the Inheritance <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Levites. In later times the word was applied to the clergy, who were regarded as, in a special sense, the Lord's portion or inheritance, perhaps because God was pleased to take the tribe of Levi instead of the firstborn, saying, the Levites shall be mine (<a href="/numbers/3-12.htm">Numbers 3:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But being ensamples to the flock</span>; literally, <span class="accented">becoming examples</span>. They must imitate the great Example, the Lord Jesus, and, by gradual imitation of his blessed character, become examples themselves.

Froth the kindred adjective &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; comes the English cleric, contracted into clerk, which in ecclesiastical writings originally signified a minister; either as being chosen by lot like Matthias, or as being the lot or inheritance of God. Hence Wycliffe translates the passage, "neither as having lordship in the clergie." As in the Middle Ages the clergy were almost the only persons who could write, the word clerk came to have one of its common modern meanings. The word here, though its interpretation is somewhat disputed, seems to refer to the several congregations - the lots or charges assigned to the elders.
