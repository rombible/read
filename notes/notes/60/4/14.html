It expresses that glory—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the triumphant manifestation of perfections—is His <span class= "ital">gift</span> and His distinguishing sign and the atmosphere in which He lives. “Glory” stands in contrast with “reproach.” And lest it should be doubted who was meant by the splendid phrase, the Apostle adds, “and of God.” All “glory” is His, and therefore the Spirit which is the “Spirit of glory” can be no other than the “Spirit of God;” but as God Himself is greater than His own glory, the words form a climax, and it means more to call Him the “Spirit of God” than to call Him the “Spirit of glory.” And this Spirit “resteth” upon the persecuted Christians. It means far more than “remaineth” or “abideth.” It expresses the complete repose and satisfaction with which the Spirit of glory abides on men who have the hearts of martyrs. “This shall be My rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.” It is the word which is used of the quiet retreat which our Lord took after John’s death (<a href="/mark/6-31.htm" title="And he said to them, Come you yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.">Mark 6:31</a>; of the calm relief which He offers to the weary souls who come to Him (<a href="/context/matthew/11-28.htm" title="Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.">Matthew 11:28-29</a>); of the repose of the blessed dead after the work of life is over (<a href="/revelation/6-11.htm" title="And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>). In the Old Testament it is used of the Spirit in <a href="/numbers/11-25.htm" title="And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was on him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested on them, they prophesied, and did not cease.">Numbers 11:25</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/2-15.htm" title="And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha.

And the argument is, that reproach for the name of the Christ is a proof of glory in reserve, or rather, already belonging to the man. Perhaps St. Peter intentionally hints (in speaking of the “Spirit”) that all who make themselves partakers of Christ’s reproach are made partakers of His chrism.<p><span class= "bld">On their part.</span>—These words, to the end of the verse, are an undoubted interpolation, though of very early date, appearing even in St. Cyprian’s works. The clause would bring out the different view taken by believers and unbelievers of the martyr-spirit. Pliny says in his letter that, whatever Christianity itself may be, there can be no doubt such <span class= "ital">obstinacy</span> ought to be punished. Marcus Aurelius speaks with contempt of the spirit in which Christians suffered themselves to be put to death as mere self-will, unlike the philosophical grace of the Stoics. Gibbon speaks of the “pious obstinacy” of St. Felix of Tibiura.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_peter/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_peter/4-14.htm" title="If you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you; for the spirit of glory and of God rests on you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified....">1 Peter 4:14-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">If ye be reproached for Christ — </span>Reproaches and cruel mockings were always one part of their sufferings, and to an ingenuous mind, reproach is often worse than the spoiling of goods, or even than bodily pain; <span class="ital">happy are you </span>— The apostle alludes to Christ’s words, <a href="/matthew/5-11.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.">Matthew 5:11</a>, <span class="ital">Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, </span>&c. <span class="ital">For the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you </span>— Conquering all reproach, and spreading a lustre around you, while he supports and comforts you in a glorious manner under all your trials.

For which reason, when they put the first Christians to death for refusing to worship idols, they were so struck with the constancy, patience, meekness, and benevolence wherewith they suffered, that it led many of them to think well, both of a religion which inspired its votaries with such admirable virtues, and of those votaries themselves. And as this constancy in suffering, from which the Christians derived so much glory, proceeded from the aid of the Spirit of God, the apostle justly termed it, both the <span class="ital">Spirit of glory, </span>and <span class="ital">the Spirit of God.” </span>— Macknight. <span class="ital">But let none of you</span> — Who have the honour to bear the Christian name; <span class="ital">suffer </span>— By your own fault; suppose <span class="ital">as a murderer, or as a thief </span>&c. — At the time St. Peter wrote this epistle, the unbelieving Jews in Judea were extremely addicted to murder and robbery, and every kind of wickedness, as we learn from Josephus; for they robbed and killed, not only the heathen, but their own brethren, who would not join them in their opposition to the Romans. Hence the apostle judged it proper to caution the Christians, especially the Jewish Christians, in this manner, lest, being corrupted by such bad examples, they should be led to the commission of any such crimes. As the apostle is here cautioning them against those sins which, if they committed them, would expose them to punishment from the civil magistrate, by <span class="greekheb">αλλοτριοεπισκοπος</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">a busy-body in other men’s matters, </span>he cannot well be supposed to mean merely <span class="ital">one who pries into the concerns of private families, </span>as such a one could not properly be ranked with such criminals as are here mentioned. But he might mean one that affected to inspect and direct the behaviour of persons in public offices, from a factious disposition to find fault with their conduct, and thereby to raise commotions in the state; which Lardner hath shown was the practice of the Jews in Alexandria, Cesarea, and other places. Or we may, with L’Enfant. understand the word in the more general sense of meddling with other people’s affairs, from avarice, anger, revenge, malice, or other bad passions. <span class="ital">Yet if any man suffer as a Christian — </span>That is, because he is a Christian; and if he suffer in a Christian spirit, <span class="ital">let him not be ashamed </span>— Of his sufferings; <span class="ital">but let him glorify, </span>or praise, <span class="ital">God on this behalf </span>— That is, for having judged him worthy to suffer in so good a cause; and for enabling him to do it with fortitude and patience. It may be proper to observe that this, with <a href="/acts/11-26.htm" title="And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people.

One would think such cautions as these were needless to Christians. But their enemies falsely charged them with foul crimes. And even the best of men need to be warned against the worst of sins. There is no comfort in sufferings, when we bring them upon ourselves by our own sin and folly. A time of universal calamity was at hand, as foretold by our Saviour, Mt 24:9,10. And if such things befall in this life, how awful will the day of judgment be! It is true that the righteous are scarcely saved; even those who endeavour to walk uprightly in the ways of God. This does not mean that the purpose and performance of God are uncertain, but only the great difficulties and hard encounters in the way; that they go through so many temptations and tribulations, so many fightings without and fears within. Yet all outward difficulties would be as nothing, were it not for lusts and corruptions within. These are the worst clogs and troubles. And if the way of the righteous be so hard, then how hard shall be the end of the ungodly sinner, who walks in sin with delight, and thinks the righteous is a fool for all his pains! The only way to keep the soul well, is, to commit it to God by prayer, and patient perseverance in well-doing. He will overrule all to the final advantage of the believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye - That is, in his cause, or on his account. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>. The sense of the word "happy" here is the same as "blessed" in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-5</a>, etc. It means that they were to regard their condition or lot as a blessed one; not that they would find personal and positive enjoyment on being reproached and vilified. It would be a blessed condition, because it would be like that of their Saviour; would show that they were his friends; would be accompanied with rich spiritual influences in the present world; and would be followed by the rewards of heaven.<p>For the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you - The glorious and Divine Spirit. There is no doubt that there is reference here to the Holy Spirit; and the meaning is, that they might expect that that Spirit would rest upon them, or abide with them, if they were persecuted for the cause of Christ. There may be some allusion here, in the language, to the fact that the Spirit of God descended and abode on the Saviour at his baptism <a href="/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>; and, in like manner, they might hope to have the same Spirit resting on them. The essential idea is, that, if they were called to suffer in the cause of the Redeemer, they would not be left or forsaken. They might hope that God would impart his Spirit to them in proportion to their sufferings in behalf of religion, and that they would have augmented joy and peace. This is doubtless the case with those who suffer persecution, and this is the secret reason why they are so sustained in their trials. Their persecutions are made the reason of a much more copious effusion of the Spirit on their souls. The same principle applies, doubtless, to all the forms of trial which the children of God pass through; and in sickness, bereavement, loss of property, disappointment in their worldly plans, and death itself, they may hope that larger measures of the Spirit's influences will rest upon them. Hence, it is often gain to the believer to suffer.<p>On their part - So far as they are concerned; or by them.<p>He is evil spoken of - That is, the Holy Spirit. They only blaspheme him, (Greek;) they reproach his sacred influences by their treatment of you and your religion.<p>But on your part he is glorified - By your manner of speaking of him, and by the honor done to him in the patience evinced in your trials, and in your purity of life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. for&#8212;Greek, "IN the name of Christ," namely, as Christians (1Pe 4:16; 3:14, above); "in My name, because ye belong to Christ."

The Jews have a saying (n), that the Holy Ghost does not dwell on any, but on him that has a cheerful heart: <p>on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified: on the part of the revilers, the person, office, work, and grace, the operations and influences of the Spirit are blasphemed and ridiculed; the power of the Spirit, with which the saints speak, the experiences of grace they express, the comforts of the Spirit they declare that they enjoy under suffering circumstances, as well as their courage, patience, and cheerfulness he gives them, are generally bantered by persecutors; and indeed all the reproaches they cast upon the people of God fall upon the Spirit of God, by whom they are animated and influenced: but on the part of the sufferers he is glorified; inasmuch as they continue to bear a testimony to his grace, depend upon his strength, and ascribe all their comfort and gracious experience unto him.

Accordingly, it is preferable to take <span class="greekheb">τό</span> with the subsequent <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, and to assume an additional <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> (as is done by the greater number of commentators, de Wette, also Brückner, Wiesinger, Schott); the Spirit of Glory is, then, the same as that which is also the Spirit of God (<span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ πν</span>. subjoined epexegetically). But in consideration of <span class="greekheb">ὀνειδίζεσθε</span>, He is styled the Spirit of <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> to whom <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> belongs (Calvin: qui gloriam secum perpetuo conjunctam habet; cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>), and who therefore also bestows it. <span class="greekheb">τὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> is added in order to show that this Spirit of <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> is none other than the Spirit of God Himself. It must be allowed that, on this interpretation, there is an inexactness of expression, <span class="greekheb">καί</span> being evidently out of place; cf.

But if Peter had had this thought in his mind, he would certainly have given definite expression to it; and it is self-evident, too, that on him who is reproached <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὀνόματι Χριστοῦ</span>, as a bearer of it, that name rests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ὑμᾶς ἀναπαύεται</span>] after <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a>, where the same expression is used of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> (in like manner <span class="greekheb">ἐπαναπαύεσθαι</span>, <a href="/numbers/11-25.htm" title="And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was on him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested on them, they prophesied, and did not cease.">Numbers 11:25</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-15.htm" title="And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha.

The accus. <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ὑμᾶς</span> is to be explained as with <span class="greekheb">ἔμεινεν</span>, <a href="/john/1-32.htm" title="And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed on him.">John 1:32</a>; Wahl: demissus in vos requiescit in vobis; it points to the living operation of the Spirit on those upon whom He rests. The thought contained in these words gives the reason (<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>) of what has been said: not, however, the logical reason (Aretius: crux, quam bonus fert pro Christo, <span class="ital">indicat</span>, quod Spir. Dei in illo quiescat; similarly, too, Hofmann: “they should consider themselves happy, that they are reproached for bearing the name of Christ; every such reproach <span class="ital">reminds them</span> of what, by bearing it, they are”); but the actual reason, that is, inasmuch as this resting of the Spirit of <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>, on those who are reproached <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὀνόμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span>, is a sealing of their eternal <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>. It is inappropriate to insert, with Calvin, a nihilominus, so that the sense would be: in spite of that reproach, the Spirit of God still dwells in you; the more so that the reproach of unbelievers was called forth by the very fact, that the life of the Christians was determined by the Spirit which rested upon them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the additional clause found in the <span class="ital">Rec.</span>, and connected with what goes before: <span class="greekheb">κατὰ μὲν αὐτοὺς βλασφημεῖται</span>, <span class="greekheb">κατὰ δὲ ὑμᾶς δοξάζεται</span>, the subject can hardly be <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα Θεοῦ</span> taken from the explanatory clause immediately preceding, but is more probably <span class="greekheb">ὄνομα Χριστοῦ</span> from the previous clause, and on which the principal stress is laid. Schott wrongly thinks that this addition interrupts the connection of thought; but Hofmann is equally in error in holding the opposite opinion, that it is of necessity demanded by the <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>, <a href="/1_peter/4-15.htm" title="But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.">1 Peter 4:15</a>; for <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> may be equally well applied to the idea that the Spirit of God rests on those who are reproached <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὀνόματι Χριστοῦ</span>, as to this, that the name of Christ is glorified <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ὑμᾶς</span>. Since the rendering of <span class="greekheb">κατά</span> by “with” (as formerly in this comment.), or by “on the part of” (Hofmann), cannot be supported,[256] the meaning “with regard to” (de Wette) must be maintained. The interpretation will then be: “<span class="ital">by their … your conduct</span>” or “<span class="ital">according to their … your opinion</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[255] Bengel erroneously understands <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> pro concrete, and that, ita ut sit appellatio Christi, adding: innuitur, Spiritum Christi eundem esse Spiritum Dei Patris.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[256] Although Hofmann appeals for this signification to chap. <a href="/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1 Peter 4:6</a>, still, in interpreting that passage, he himself takes <span class="greekheb">κατά</span> in a sense other than it is supposed to have here.—Pott uses the circumlocution <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν γνώμην αὐτῶν</span> for <span class="greekheb">κατὰ αὐτούς</span>; whilst he explains <span class="greekheb">κατὰ δὲ ὑμᾶς</span> by quod autem ad vos attinet, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> vestra autem agendi ratione, although <span class="greekheb">κατά</span> must have the same meaning in both clauses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_peter/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm" title="If you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you; for the spirit of glory and of God rests on you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.">1 Peter 4:14</a>. The Beautitude, <span class="greekheb">μακάριοι</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὅταν ὀνειδίσωσιν ὑμᾶς ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ</span> is supported by prophecy which referred originally to the root of Jesse.

As in chap. <a href="/1_peter/3-14.htm" title="But and if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;">1 Peter 3:14</a>, “If ye suffer for righteousness’ sake,” we found an echo of one beatitude (<a href="/matthew/5-10.htm" title="Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:10</a>), so in this we have the counterpart of the more personal “for my sake” of <a href="/matthew/5-11.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.">Matthew 5:11</a>. It would be better, as indicating the reference to the beatitudes, to render the adjective by <span class="bld">blessed</span> rather than <span class="bld">happy</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you</span>] The English version is tenable, but the construction of the sentence is peculiar and admits of a different rendering, “the <span class="bld">principle</span> or <span class="bld">element</span> of <span class="bld">glory</span>, and the spirit of God, resteth on you.” In either case what is emphasized is the fact that the outward reviling to which the disciples were exposed brought glory and not dishonour. The Spirit of Glory was there—who has glory as His essential attribute—and that Spirit was none other than the very Spirit of God. Looking to the connexion between the “glory” of the Shechinah-cloud which was the witness of the Divine Presence, and that which dwelt in Christ as the only-begotten of the Father (<a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>), it is possible that the words “the Spirit of Glory” may be equivalent to the “Spirit of Christ.” The use of the word for “rest” throws us back upon the occurrence of the same verb in the LXX. version of <a href="/numbers/11-25.htm" title="And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was on him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested on them, they prophesied, and did not cease.">Numbers 11:25</a>, <a href="/2_kings/2-15.htm" title="And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.">2 Kings 2:15</a>. The thought of the Apostle, in this respect true to his citation from Joel 2. in <a href="/context/acts/2-16.htm" title="But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;...">Acts 2:16-18</a>, is that the humblest sufferers for the name of Christ are as truly sharers in the gift of the Eternal Spirit as were the greatest prophets. It “rests” on them—not coming and going, in fitful movements, or extraordinary manifestations, but dwelling with them continually.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">on their part he is evil spoken of</span>] It is remarkable that the whole of this clause is omitted in many of the best MSS. and versions, including the Sinaitic. On the assumption to which this fact has led most recent Editors, that it was not part of the original text, we must think of it either as a marginal note that has found its way into the text, or, as an addition made in a second transcript of the Epistle by the writer himself. Here the word for “is evil spoken of” would rightly be rendered as <span class="bld">blasphemed</span>, and “Christ” or “the Spirit of God” must be taken as the subject of the sentence. In this case, that of suffering for the truth, the very blasphemies which men utter in their rage, are a witness to the effective work which has been done through the power of the Spirit, and in respect of those who suffer, are working for His glory. Appalling as is the contrast between the blasphemy of the persecutors and the doxologies of the sufferer, the one is almost the necessary complement of the other.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm" title="If you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you; for the spirit of glory and of God rests on you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.">1 Peter 4:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰ ὀνειὸίζεσθε ἐν ὁνόματι Χριστοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">if ye are reproached in the name of Christ</span>) The Gentiles thought it a reproach if they called any one <span class="ital">a Christian</span>: <a href="/1_peter/4-16.htm" title="Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.">1 Peter 4:16</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ τῆς δόξης καὶ τὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ Πνεῦμα</span>, <span class="ital">the Spirit of glory and of God</span>) The same Spirit which was on Christ: <a href="/luke/4-18.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,">Luke 4:18</a>.
