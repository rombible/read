It is difficult to decide about the right of the words “for us” to stand in the text. Tischendorf and Lachmann strike them out, and they are probably right in doing so. The authority for the reading “for you” is nearly as strong; but in fact neither is wanted here, as the point is not the atoning character of Christ’s death, but the death itself.<p><span class= "bld">Arm yourselves likewise with the same mind.</span>—Or rather, w<span class= "ital">ith the same conception.</span> It does not mean merely “put yourselves into the same disposition:” that is, “resolve to die with Him.” Though the word which is here rendered “mind” may possibly bear the meaning “intent” assigned to it in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a> (the only other place in the New Testament where it occurs), the more natural and common sense is that of <span class= "ital">conception, notion, view.</span> Christ is therefore said to have been “armed” with a particular “conception” or “view,” which He found to be sufficient shield in the day of suffering; and we are exhorted to try the same defensive armour. The “view” which Christ found so efficacious was the view He took of the “suffering” itself. What that view was is forthwith explained.<p><span class= "bld">For he that hath suffered in the flesh . . .</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">that he that hath suffered to the flesh is at rest from, sin.</span> This is the “view” which we are to take. The thought is probably derived from <a href="/romans/6-7.htm" title="For he that is dead is freed from sin.">Romans 6:7</a>. The death of the body puts a stop (at any rate, for the redeemed) to any further possibility of sin. Welcome, death! A slight difficulty is caused by the implied fact that Christ, too, in dying “ceased from sin.” But the Greek word for “hath ceased” literally means <span class= "ital">hath been caused to rest, </span>St. Peter using expressly (for the only time in the New Testament) that part of the verb which does not mean a voluntary cessation from what one was doing before, but a pause imposed from without. And that Christ looked upon His death as a boon of rest from sin (it does not say from <span class= "ital">sinning</span>) is not only a true and impressive thought, but is fully justified by <a href="/romans/6-10.htm" title="For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he lives, he lives to God.">Romans 6:10</a>, “He died unto sin,” and even by His cry, “It is finished.” Whatever harshness there is in the thought is much softened by the fact that St. Peter names it as the view <span class= "ital">we</span> are to take, not <span class= "ital">directly</span> as the view <span class= "ital">He</span> took; so that it admits of some adjustment when applied to <span class= "ital">Him.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/1_peter/4.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div><span class="bld">1 Peter<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>CHRISTIAN ASCETICISM</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/1_peter/4-1.htm" title="For as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;...">1 Peter 4:1-8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Christian morality brought two new things into the world--a new type of life in sharp contrast with the sensuality rife on every side, and a new set of motives powerfully aiding in its realisation. Both these novelties are presented in this passage, which insists on a life in which the spirit dominates the flesh, and is dominated by the will of God, and which puts forward purely Christian ideas as containing the motives for such a life. The facts of Christ’s life and the prospect of Christ’s return to judge the world are here urged as the reason for living a life of austere repression of ‘the flesh’ that we may do God’s will.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. We have, first, in verses 1 and 2, a general precept, based upon the broad view of Christ’s earthly history. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Christ hath suffered in the flesh.’ That is the great fact which should shape the course of all His followers. But what does suffering in the flesh mean here? It does not refer only to the death of Jesus, but to His whole life. The phrase ‘in the flesh’ is reiterated in the context, and evidently is equivalent to ‘during the earthly life.’ Our Lord’s life was, in one aspect, one continuous suffering, because He lived the higher life of the spirit. That higher life had to Him, and has to us, rich compensations; but it sets those who are true to it at necessary variance with the lower types of life common among men, and it brings many pains, all of which Jesus knew. The last draught from the cup was the bitterest, but the bitterness was diffused through all the life of the Man of Sorrows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That life is here contemplated as the pattern for all Christ’s servants. Peter says much in this letter of our Lord’s sufferings as the atonement for sin, but here he looks at them rather as the realised ideal of all worthy life. We are to be ‘partakers of Christ’s sufferings’ {5. 13}, and we shall become so in proportion as His own Spirit becomes the spirit which lives in us. If Jesus were only our pattern, Christianity would be a poor affair, and a gospel of despair; for how should we reach to the pure heights where He stood? But, since He can breathe into us a spirit which will hallow and energise our spirits, we can rise to walk beside Him on the high places of heroic endurance and of holy living. Very beautifully does Peter hint at our sore conflict, our personal defencelessness, and our all-sufficient armour, in the picturesque metaphor ‘arm yourselves.’ The ‘mind of Christ’ is given to us if we will. We can gird it on, and if we do, it will be as an impenetrable coat-of-mail, which will turn the sharpest arrows and resist the fiercest sword-cuts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The last clause of verse 1 is a parenthesis, and, if it is for the moment omitted, the sentence runs smoothly on, especially if the Revised Version’s reading is adopted. The purpose of arming us with the same mind is that, whilst we live on earth, we should live according to the will of God, and should renounce ‘the lusts of men,’ which are in us as in all men, and which men who are not clad in the armour which Christ gives to us yield to.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But what of the parenthetical statement? Clearly, the words which follow it forbid its being taken to mean that dead men do not sin. Rather the Apostle’s thought seems to be that such suffering in daily life after Christ’s pattern, and by His help, is at once a sign that the sufferer has shaken off the dominion of sin, and is a means of further emancipating him from it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the two great thoughts in this paragraph are, that the Christian life is one in which God’s will, and not man’s desires, is the regulating force, and that the pattern of that life and the power to copy the pattern are found in Christ, the sufferer for righteousness’ sake.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. More specific injunctions, entering into the details of the higher life, follow, interwoven, as in the preceding verses, with a statement of the motives which make obedience to them possible to our weakness. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sins in view are those most closely connected with ‘the flesh’ in its literal meaning, amongst which are included ‘abominable idolatries,’ because gross acts of sensual immorality were inseparably intertwined with much of heathen worship. These sins of flesh were especially rampant among the luxurious Asiatic lands, to which this letter was addressed, but they flooded the whole Roman empire, as the works of poets like Martial and of moralists like Epictetus equally show. But New York or London could match the worst scenes in Rome or Ephesus, and perhaps would not be far behind the foul animalism of Sodom and Gomorrah. Lust and drunkenness are eating out the manhood of our race on both sides of the Atlantic, and, if we have ‘the same mind’ as the suffering Christ, we shall put on the armour for war to the knife with these in society, and for the rigid self-control of our own animal nature.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe the strong motives which Peter just touches without expanding. A sad irony lies in his saying that the time past may suffice. The flesh had had enough of time given to it,--had not God a right to the rest? The flesh should have had none; it had had all too much. Surely the readers had had enough of the lower life, more than enough. Were they not sick of it, ‘satisfied’ even to disgust? Let us look back on our wasted years, and give no more precious moments to serve the corruptible flesh. Further, the life of submission to the animal nature is characteristic of ‘the Gentiles,’ and in sharp contrast, therefore, to that proper to Christ’s followers. That is as true to-day, in America and England, as ever it was. Indeed, as wealth has increased, and so-called ‘civilisation’ has diffused material comforts, senseless luxury, gluttony, drunkenness, and still baser fleshy sins, have become more flagrantly common in society which is not distinctively and earnestly Christian; and there was never more need than there is to-day for Christians to carry aloft the flag of self-control and temperance in all things belonging to ‘the flesh.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If we have the mind of Christ, we shall get the same treatment from the world which Peter says that the primitive Christians did from the idolaters round them. We shall be wondered at, just as a heathen stared with astonishment at this strange, new sect, which would have nothing to do with feasts and garlands and wine-cups and lust disguised as worship. The spectacle, when repeated to-day, of Christians steadfastly refusing to share in that lower life which is the only life of so many, is, perhaps, less wondered at now, because it is, thank God! more familiar; but it is not less disliked and ‘blasphemed.’ A total abstainer from intoxicants will not get the good word of the distiller or brewer or consumer of liquor. He will be called faddist, narrow, sour-visaged, and so on and so on. ‘You may know a genius because all the dunces make common cause against him,’ said Swift. You may know a Christian after Christ’s pattern because all the children of the flesh are in league to laugh at him and pelt him with nicknames.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Further, the thought of Christ as the judge should both silence the blasphemers and strengthen the blasphemed to endure. That judgment will vindicate the wisdom of those who sowed to the spirit and the folly of those who sowed to the flesh. The one will reap corruption; the other, life everlasting.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The difficult verse 6 cannot be adequately dealt with here, but we may note that introductory ‘for’ shows that it, too, contains a motive urging to life, ‘to the will of God,’ and that no such motive appears in it if it is taken to mean, as by some, that the gospel is preached after death to the dead. Surely to say that ‘the gospel was preached also {or, even} to them that are dead’ is not to say that it was preached to them when dead.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Peter’s letter is of late enough date to explain his looking back to a generation now passed away, who had heard it in their lifetime. Nor does one see how the meaning of ‘in the flesh,’ which belongs to the phrase in the frequent instances of its occurrence in this context, can be preserved in the clause ‘that they might be judged according to men in the flesh,’ unless that means a judgment which takes place during the earthly life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We note, too, that the antithesis between being judged ‘according to men in the flesh,’ and living ‘according to God in the spirit’ recalls that in verse 2 between living in the flesh to the lusts of men and to the will of God. It would appear, therefore, that the Apostle’s meaning is that the very aim of the preaching of the gospel to those who are gone to meet the Judge was that they might by it be judged while here in the flesh, in regard to the lower life ‘according to men’ {or, as verse 2 has it, ‘to the lusts of men’}, and, being so judged, and sin condemned in their flesh, might live according to God in their spirits. That is but to say in other words that the gospel is meant to search hearts, and bring to light and condemn the lusts of the flesh, and to impart the new life which is moulded after the will of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The reference to Christ as the judge suggests a final motive for a life of suppression of the lower nature,--the near approach of the end of all things. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The distinct statement by our Lord in <a href="/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a> excludes the knowledge of the time of the end from the revelation granted to the Apostles, so that there need be no hesitation in upholding their authority, and yet admitting their liability to mistake on that point. But the force of the motive is independent of the proximity of the judgment. Its certainty and the indefiniteness of the time when we each shall have to pass into the other state of being are sufficient to preserve for each of us the whole pressure of the solemn thought that for us the end is at hand, and to enforce thereby Peter’s exhortation, ‘Be ye therefore of sound mind.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The prospect of that end will sweep away many illusions as to the worth of the enjoyments of sense, and be a bridle on many vagrant desires. Self-control in all regions of our nature is implied in the word. Our various faculties are meant to be governed by a sovereign will, which is itself governed by the Divine will; and, if we see plain before us the dawning of the day of the Lord, the vision will help to tame the subordinate parts of ourselves, and to establish the supremacy of the spirit over the flesh. One special form of that general self-control is that already enjoined,--the suppression of the animal appetites, especially the abstinence from intoxicants. That form of self-control is especially meant by the second of these exhortations, ‘Be sober.’ How could a man lift the wine cup to his lips, and drown his higher nature in a flood of drunken riot, if the end, with its solemnities of judgment, blazed before his inner eye? But this self-command is inculcated that we may be fit to pray. These lower appetites will take all desire for prayer and all earnestness in it out of us, and only when we keep the wings of appetites close clipped will the pinions grow by which we can mount up with wings as eagles. A praying drunkard is an impossible monster.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But exhortations to self-control are not all. We have to think of others, as well as of our own growth in purity and spirituality. Therefore Peter casts one swift glance to the wider circle of the brethren, which encompasses each of us, and gives the all-embracing direction, which carries in itself everything. ‘Fervent love’ to our fellow-Christians is the counterpoise to earnest government of ourselves. There is a selfishness possible even in cultivating our religion, as many a monk and recluse has shown. Such love as Peter here enjoins will save us from the possible evils of self-regard, and it will ‘cover the multitude of sins,’--by which is not meant that, having it, we shall be excused if we in other respects sin, but that, having it, we shall be more desirous of veiling than of exposing our brother’s faults, and shall be ready to forgive even when our brother offends against us often. Perhaps Peter was remembering the lesson which he had once had when he was told that ‘seventy times seven’ was not too great a multitude of sins against brotherly love to be forgiven by it in one day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_peter/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_peter/4-1.htm" title="For as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;...">1 Peter 4:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered </span>— Even the ignominious and painful death of the cross, with all those previous and concomitant evils, which rendered his death peculiarly bitter; <span class="ital">for us </span>— And that from a pure and disinterested principle of love; <span class="ital">arm yourselves likewise with the same mind </span>— With a resolution such as animated him to suffer all the evils to which you may be exposed in the body; and particularly to suffer death, if called by God to do so for your religion.

He died to destroy sin; and though he cheerfully submitted to the worst sufferings, yet he never gave way to the least sin. Temptations could not prevail, were it not for man's own corruption; but true Christians make the will of God, not their own lust or desires, the rule of their lives and actions. And true conversion makes a marvellous change in the heart and life. It alters the mind, judgment, affections, and conversation. When a man is truly converted, it is very grievous to him to think how the time past of his life has been spent. One sin draws on another. Six sins are here mentioned which have dependence one upon another. It is a Christian's duty, not only to keep from gross wickedness, but also from things that lead to sin, or appear evil. The gospel had been preached to those since dead, who by the proud and carnal judgment of wicked men were condemned as evil-doers, some even suffering death. But being quickened to Divine life by the Holy Spirit, they lived to God as his devoted servants. Let not believers care, though the world scorns and reproaches them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh - Since he as a man has died for us.

The design was to set the suffering Redeemer before them as an example in their trials.<p>Arm yourselves likewise with the same mind - That is, evidently, the same mind that he evinced - a readiness to suffer in the cause of religion, a readiness to die as he had done. This readiness to suffer and die, the apostle speaks of as armour, and having this is represented as being armed. Armour is put on for offensive or defensive purposes in war; and the idea of the apostle here is, that that state of mind when we are ready to meet with persecution and trial, and when we are ready to die, will answer the purpose of armour in engaging in the conflicts and strifes which pertain to us as Christians, and especially in meeting with persecutions and trials. We are to put on the same fortitude which the Lord Jesus had, and this will be the best defense against our foes, and the best security of victory.<p>For he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin - Compare the notes at <a href="/romans/6-7.htm">Romans 6:7</a>. To "suffer in the flesh" is to die. The expression here has a proverbial aspect, and seems to have meant something like this: "when a man is dead, he will sin no more;" referring of course to the present life. So if a Christian becomes dead in a moral sense - dead to this world, dead by being crucified with Christ (see the notes at <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>) - he may be expected to cease from sin. The reasoning is based on the idea that there is such a union between Christ and the believer that his death on the cross secured the death of the believer to the world. Compare <a href="/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>1Pe 4:1-19.

The Christian is by faith one with Christ: as then Christ by death is judicially freed from sin; so the Christian who has in the person of Christ died, has no more to do with it judicially, and ought to have no more to do with it actually.

The apostle having finished his digression concerning Christ's preaching in the ministry of Noah, to men whose spirits were now in prison, and concerning the salvation of Noah's family in the ark, by water, and concerning its antitype, baptism, its nature and effect, returns to the sufferings of Christ he had before made mention of; and argues from thence to holiness of life, and patience in sufferings, after this manner; seeing then Christ, the eternal Son of God, the Lord of glory, the holy and Just One, suffered such indignities, reproaches, and persecutions from men, the wrath of God, the curses of the law, and death itself; and that not for himself, nor for angels, but for men, and those not all men, otherwise his death, with respect to some, must be in vain; but for a particular number of men, in distinction from others, described in the beginning of this epistle, as elect, according to the foreknowledge of God; and these sufferings he endured in the room and stead of those persons, in the days of his flesh, while here on earth, and in his human nature, both soul and body, and was crucified through the weakness of his flesh, and for the sins of our flesh, and which he bore in his own: <p>arm yourselves likewise with the same mind; that was in Christ; as he suffered for you, do ye likewise suffer for him, in his cause, for righteousness sake, for the sake of him and his Gospel; and bear all reproaches, afflictions, and persecutions on his account, willingly and cheerfully, with meekness and patience, as he did, and with the same view; not indeed to make satisfaction for sin, which was his principal design, but that being dead unto sin, you might live unto righteousness. The apostle speaks to the saints, in this exhortation, as to soldiers, and who had many enemies to engage with, and therefore should put on their armour, and be in a readiness to meet any attack upon them: <p>for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin: meaning either Christ, who having suffered in human nature for the sins of his people, whereby he has made satisfaction for them, is now clear of them; the sins that were imputed to him being took and bore away, finished and made an end of, and he justified from them, and freed from all the effects of them, and punishment for them, as from all the infirmities of human nature, from mortality and death: or the person that has suffered in and with Christ, his head and representative, which is all one as if he had suffered himself, in person; by virtue of which his sin ceases, and he ceases from being chargeable with it, as if he had never sinned; which is the case of every criminal, when he has suffered the penalty of the law for his crime: or else the person that is dead to sin, by virtue of the death of Christ, and, in imitation of it, who has been baptized into Christ's death, and planted in the likeness of it; whose old man is crucified with Christ, and he is dead with him; who has crucified the affections with the lusts, and through the Spirit has mortified the deeds of the body; which way the generality of interpreters go: such a man has ceased from sin; not from the being and indwelling of it in him; nor from the burden of it on him; nor from a continual war with it in him; nor from slips and falls by it, and into it; no, nor from it in the most solemn and religious services; but as from the guilt of it, and obligation to punishment by it, through the death of Christ; so from the servitude and dominion of it, through the power of divine grace, in consequence of Christ's death: or rather, the believer that suffers death in his body, for the sake of Christ, such an one immediately ceases from the very being of sin, and all commission of it; he becomes at once perfectly pure and holy, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; and a noble argument this is to meet death without fear, and to suffer it cheerfully and willingly, since the consequence of this will be an entire freedom from sin, than which nothing can be more desirable by a believer: to this agrees the Syriac version, which renders the words thus: "for whoever is dead in his body hath ceased from all sins"; but the Arabic version more fully confirms this sense, and is the best version of the text, and is this; "be ye armed with this (same) thought, that (not for) he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin"; that is, fortify your minds against all the fears of sufferings, and of death, for the sake of Christ, with this single thought; that he that has suffered martyrdom for Christ, in his body, or has suffered death for his sake, or dies in the Lord, is free from sin, and so from sorrow, and is the most happy person imaginable; so that this last clause is not a reason of the former, but points out, and is explanative of what that same mind or thought is Christians should arm themselves with, against the fears of death; and it is the best piece of armour for this service, a saint can make use of. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_peter/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Forasmuch <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</span><p>(1) Having ended his digression and sliding from his matter, now he returns to the exhortation which he broke off, taking occasion by that which he said concerning the death and resurrection of Christ, so defining our sanctification, that to be sanctified, is all one has to suffer in the flesh, that is to say, to leave off from our wickedness and viciousness: and to rise again to God, that is to say, to be renewed by the virtue of the holy Spirit, that we may lead the rest of our life which remains after the will of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_peter/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_peter/4-1.htm" title="For as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;">1 Peter 4:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ οὖν παθόντος</span> [<span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν</span>] <span class="greekheb">σαρκί</span>] In these words the apostle returns to chap. <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1 Peter 3:18</a>, in order to subjoin the following exhortation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σαρκί</span> is not: “<span class="ital">in</span> the flesh” (Luther), but: “<span class="ital">according to the flesh</span>;” comp. <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1 Peter 3:18</a>.

The reading <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΑΡΚΊ</span></span></span>, “according to the flesh,” conveys the same idea; cf. Winer, 384 (E. T. 513).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΈΠΑΥΤΑΙ ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑς</span></span></span>] The mid. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΎΟΜΑΙ</span></span></span> is in the classics frequently joined with the genitive, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <span class="ital">II</span>. vii. 290: <span class="greekheb">παυσώμεθα μάχης</span>; <span class="ital">Herod</span>, i. 47: <span class="greekheb">τῆς μάχης ἐπαύσαντο</span>; <span class="ital">Herodian</span>. vii. 10, 16: <span class="greekheb">τῆς τε ὀργῆς ὁ δῆμος ἐπαύσατο</span>. In this way <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΈΠΑΥΤΑΙ</span></span></span> here is explained by most interpreters as equivalent to: “he has ceased from sin, that is, he has given up sinning.” The word may also be taken as the perf. pass. according to the construction <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΎΕΙΝ ΤΙΝΆ ΤΙΝΟς</span></span></span>, equivalent to: “to cause one to give up, to desist from a thing.” <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΈΠΑΥΤΑΙ ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑς</span></span></span> would then mean: “he has been brought to cease from sin, to sin no more” (Schott: “brought away from sinful conduct”). Hofmann erroneously asserts that “<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΎΕΙΝ ΤΙΝᾺ ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑς</span></span></span> would in a quite general way mean: action such as brings it about that the individual is ended with sin;” that is to say, in the sense, that his <span class="ital">relation</span> to sin is at an end.[232] For the genitive with <span class="greekheb">παύειν</span> denotes always a condition or an activity of him who is the object of <span class="greekheb">παύειν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It makes no essential difference in the thought whether <span class="greekheb">παύειν</span> be taken here as a middle (Weiss) or as a passive (de Wette, Wiesinger). The idea: “<span class="ital">through Christ</span> immunitatem nactus sum,” is expressed here neither in the one case nor in the other (Wiesinger).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The clause here has the form of a general statement, the meaning of which is, that by suffering as to the flesh a ceasing of sin is effected.[233] This idea, in many respects a true one, may according to the connection be defined thus: he who suffered on account of sin, that is, on account of his opposition to sin, has in such wise broken with sin that it has no more power over him (Weiss). It is incorrect, with several of the earlier commentators, as also Schott, to understand <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΘΏΝ</span></span></span> in a spiritual sense, either of the being dead with Christ in baptism, according to <a href="/romans/6-7.htm" title="For he that is dead is freed from sin.">Romans 6:7</a> (Schott), or of the putting to death of the old man (Gerhard: qui carnem cum concupiscentiis suis in Christo et cum Christo crucifigit, ille peccare desinit; Calvin: passio in carne significat nostri abnegationem). Opposed to such an interpretation is the subjoined <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΑΡΚΊ</span></span></span>, by which <span class="ital">this</span> <span class="greekheb">παθών</span> here is expressly marked as identical with the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΘΏΝ</span></span></span>, used with reference to Christ; and the apostle in no way hints that that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΘΏΝ</span></span></span> is employed in a spiritual sense. It is evidently entirely a mistake to understand by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΠΑΘΏΝ</span></span></span> Christ, as Fronmüller does,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΈΠ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἉΜΑΡΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> being thus in no way appropriate (doubtless Jachmann explains: “because Christ hath removed sin for Himself, that is, hath shown that it is possible to be without sin”(!)); nor is it less so to assume, finally, with Steiger, that here “the apostle unites together the different persons, the head and the members in their unity,” so that the clause would contain the double idea: “Christ suffering as to the body made us free from sin,” and: “we, by participating through faith in the sufferings of Christ, die unto sin.” Hofmann, too, unjustifiably gives the clause the double reference—to Christ and to the Christians; to Christ, “in as far as He by His bodily death was finished with sin, which He took upon Himself for the purpose of atoning for it;” to the Christians, “in so far as he is spiritually dead whilst still alive in the body, and so is translated into a life in which he goes free from the guilt and slavery of sin.” In these interpretations thoughts are supplied to which the context makes no allusion.[234]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[231] Reiche erroneously appeals in support of this meaning: “disposition of mind,” to the passages in <a href="/proverbs/5-2.htm" title="That you may regard discretion, and that your lips may keep knowledge.">Proverbs 5:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-19.htm" title="Hear you, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart in the way.">Proverbs 23:19</a>, LXX., and <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-14.htm" title="He was made to reprove our thoughts.">Wis 2:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[232] Thus, too, Schott: “He who has experienced the <span class="greekheb">παθεῖν σαρκί</span> is delivered from his former <span class="ital">relation</span> to sin.” But Schott admits that “a release from sin must be thought of, in so far as sin determined the conduct and <span class="ital">made it sinful</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[233] Genuinely catholic is the remark of Lorinus on <span class="greekheb">πέπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίας</span>: Peccatorum nomine absolute posito gravia intelliguntur, quae vocamus mortalia; nam desinere atque quiescere a levibus et venialibus, eximium privilegium est, praeterque Deiparam definire non possumus, an alii ulli concessum.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[234] Reiche regards the entire sentence as spurious, because of the difficulty and indistinctness of the thought.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_peter/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_peter/4-1.htm" title="For as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;">1 Peter 4:1</a>. <span class="ital">Christ having died to flesh, arm yourselves with the same thought that</span> (or <span class="ital">because</span>) <span class="ital">he that died hath ceased to sins</span>.—<span class="greekheb">παθόντος σαρκί</span> Peter goes back to the starting point of <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1 Peter 3:18</a> in order to emphasise the import of the first step taken by Christ and His followers, apart now from the consequences.

In the Greek Bible the perfect passive occurs only once (<a href="/exodus/9-34.htm" title="And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.">Exodus 9:34</a>) outside Isa 1:-31., where it is used three times to render <span class="greekheb">שבת</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">σαββατισμός</span>, <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm" title="There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.">Hebrews 4:9</a>).

Christ had suffered in the flesh. If those who had been baptized in His name were called so to suffer, they, looking to the glory that had followed on His sufferings, were to follow His example. They were, it might be, engaged in a tremendous conflict, but they needed no other armour than “the mind of Christ,” the temper of patient submission and unwavering trust in the wisdom and love of the Father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin</span>] If this had been the close of the sentence we might have looked on the “suffering” of which the Apostle speaks, as including death, as it had included it in the case of Christ. So taken, the words might seem to express the familiar thought that “Death only can from sin release,” as in the Rabbinic maxim “He that is dead is freed from sin” (<a href="/romans/6-7.htm" title="For he that is dead is freed from sin.">Romans 6:7</a>), that men were to welcome the sufferings that brought death near to them, as working out their complete emancipation. The words that follow, however, make this interpretation impossible, and the “ceasing from sin” must therefore be understood of that “deadness to sin,” “sin no longer having dominion over us,” of which St Paul speaks in <a href="/context/romans/6-7.htm" title="For he that is dead is freed from sin....">Romans 6:7-11</a>. That Apostle, it may be noted, though he quotes the Rabbinic proverb, transfers its application from literal to spiritual death, and St Peter, following a like train of thought, affirms as a general law of the spiritual life that the very act of suffering in the mind of Christ and for Him so strengthens the powers of will and faith that the sufferer is <span class="ital">ipso facto</span> delivered from the life in which sin is dominant. It is hard to think of a martyr in the hour of death, or of a confessor patiently bearing his cross, as malignant or fraudulent or impure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/4-1.htm" title="For as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;">1 Peter 4:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">Christ</span>) who is the Lord of glory.—<span class="greekheb">σαρκὶ</span>, <span class="ital">with the flesh</span>) Shortly afterwards, <span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκὶ</span>, <span class="ital">in the flesh</span>.—[35]<span class="greekheb">ὁπλίσασθε</span>) <span class="ital">arm yourselves</span>, against enemies.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>) <span class="ital">because</span>.

The words "for us" are omitted in some ancient manuscripts; they express a great truth already dwelt upon in <a href="/1_peter/2.htm">1 Peter 2</a>. and 3. Here the apostle is insisting upon the example of Christ, not on the atoning efficacy of his death. Arm yourselves likewise with the same mind. The word rendered "mind" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is more exactly "thought" (comp. <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, the only other place where it occurs in the New Testament); but it certainly has sometimes the force of "intention, resolve." The Christian must be like his Mustier; he must arm himself with the great thought, the holy resolve, which was in the mind of Christ - the thought that suffering borne in faith frees us from the power of sin, the resolve to suffer patiently according to the will of God. That thought, which can be made our own only by faith, is the Christian's shield; we are to arm ourselves with it against the assaults of the evil one (comp. <a href="/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin.</span> The thought is that of <a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6-11</a>. Some translate the conjunction <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "that," and understand it as giving the content of the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: "Arm yourselves with the thought that," etc.; but this does not give so good a sense, and would seem to require <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x28;</span> " this thought," rather than "the same thought." Some, again, understand this clause of Christ; but this seems a mistake. The apostle spoke first of the Master; now he turns to the disciple. Take, he says, for your amour the thoughts which filled the sacred heart of Christ - the thought that suffering in the flesh is not, as the world counts it, an unmixed evil, but often a deep blessing; for, or because, he that suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin. If, when we are called to suffer, we offer up our sufferings to Christ who suffered for us, and unite our sufferings with his by faith in him, then those sufferings, thus sanctified, destroy the power of sin, and make us cease from sin (comp. <a href="/romans/6-10.htm">Romans 6:10</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_peter/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Arm yourselves (&#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)<p>Only here in New Testament.

Literally the word means thought, and so some render it here. Rev. puts it in margin. The rendering intent, resolution, is very doubtful. It seems rather to be the thought as determining the resolution. Since Christ has suffered in the flesh, be ye also willing to suffer in the flesh. </body></html>
