One would think such cautions as these were needless to Christians. But their enemies falsely charged them with foul crimes. And even the best of men need to be warned against the worst of sins. There is no comfort in sufferings, when we bring them upon ourselves by our own sin and folly. A time of universal calamity was at hand, as foretold by our Saviour, Mt 24:9,10. And if such things befall in this life, how awful will the day of judgment be! It is true that the righteous are scarcely saved; even those who endeavour to walk uprightly in the ways of God. This does not mean that the purpose and performance of God are uncertain, but only the great difficulties and hard encounters in the way; that they go through so many temptations and tribulations, so many fightings without and fears within. Yet all outward difficulties would be as nothing, were it not for lusts and corruptions within. These are the worst clogs and troubles. And if the way of the righteous be so hard, then how hard shall be the end of the ungodly sinner, who walks in sin with delight, and thinks the righteous is a fool for all his pains! The only way to keep the soul well, is, to commit it to God by prayer, and patient perseverance in well-doing.

Here “the sufferings of Christ” are those which He endured while on earth, those also which He endures now as the Head of His body, the Church, in His infinite sympathy with each individual member. Each faithful sufferer, accordingly, in proportion to the measure of his sufferings, becomes <span class="ital">ipso facto</span> a sharer in those of Christ. He fills up, in St Paul’s bold language, “what was lacking in the sufferings of Christ” (<a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that, when his glory shall be revealed</span>] The thought is again closely parallel to that of chap. <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1 Peter 1:11</a>.

As thought of by the Apostles, the “revelation of Christ” is identical with His coming to judge the quick and dead (<a href="/luke/17-30.htm" title="Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.">Luke 17:30</a>). The precise phrase “the revelation of His glory” is not found elsewhere, but it has an analogue in “the throne of His glory” in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm" title="But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.">1 Peter 4:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καθὸ</span>, <span class="ital">even</span> as) Glory answers to the measure of sufferings, but much more abundantly.—<span class="greekheb">κοινωνεῖτε</span>, <span class="ital">ye are partakers</span>) willingly.—<span class="greekheb">παθήμασι</span>, <span class="ital">in the sufferings</span>) <a href="/1_peter/4-1.htm" title="For as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;">1 Peter 4:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">χαίρετε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, <span class="ital">rejoice, that</span>) <span class="ital">That</span>, here, is more than if he had said <span class="greekheb">ὅνα</span>, <span class="ital">because</span>.

Christians should learn to rejoice in persecution; they must rejoice in so far as, in proportion as (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;</span>), they are partakers of Christ's sufferings (see <a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>). Suffering meekly borne draws the Christian nearer to Christ, lifts him, as on a cross, nearer to the crucified Lord; but this it does only when he looks to Jesus in his suffering, when the eye of faith is fixed upon the cross of Christ. Then faith unites the sufferings of the disciple with the sufferings of his Lord; he is made a partaker of Christ's sufferings; and so far as suffering has that blessed result, in such measure he must rejoice in his sufferings. That, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy; literally, <span class="accented">that in the revelation of Ms glory also ye may rejoice exulting.</span> The word for "exulting," <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, corresponds with that used in <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6</a> and in <a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>).
