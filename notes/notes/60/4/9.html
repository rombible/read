And the speedy approach of death and judgment concerns all, to which these words naturally lead our minds. Our approaching end, is a powerful argument to make us sober in all worldly matters, and earnest in religion. There are so many things amiss in all, that unless love covers, excuses, and forgives in others, the mistakes and faults for which every one needs the forbearance of others, Satan will prevail to stir up divisions and discords. But we are not to suppose that charity will cover or make amends for the sins of those who exercise it, so as to induce God to forgive them. The nature of a Christian's work, which is high work and hard work, the goodness of the Master, and the excellence of the reward, all require that our endeavours should be serious and earnest. And in all the duties and services of life, we should aim at the glory of God as our chief end. He is a miserable, unsettled wretch, who cleaves to himself, and forgets God; is only perplexed about his credit, and gain, and base ends, which are often broken, and which, when he attains, both he and they must shortly perish together. But he who has given up himself and his all to God, may say confidently that the Lord is his portion; and nothing but glory through Christ Jesus, is solid and lasting; that abideth for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Use hospitality one to another - On the duty of hospitality, see the <a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a> note; <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> note.<p>Without grudging - Greek, "without murmurs;" that is, without complaining of the hardship of doing it; of the time, and expense, and trouble required in doing it. The idea of grudging, in the common sense of that word - that is, of doing it unwillingly, or regretting the expense, and considering it as ill-bestowed, or as not producing an equivalent of any kind - is not exactly the idea here. It is that we are to do it without murmuring or complaining. It greatly enhances the value of hospitality, that it be done on our part with entire cheerfulness. One of the duties involved in it is to make a guest happy; and this can be done in no other way than by showing him that he is welcome. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Or, "be lovers of strangers", as the phrase may be rendered, and as it is in the Syriac version; that is, such as are of a distant country, or come from afar, and are unknown by face, especially good men, that are obliged to remove from their native country for the sake of religion, or by one providence or another; and these are to be loved: and love is to be shown them, both negatively, by not vexing them, and making them uneasy in body or mind; by not oppressing them by violence and injustice, and making any exorbitant demands upon them; or by not perverting judgment with respect to them; and positively, by directing, counselling, and advising them, and if need be, by giving them food, and raiment, and lodging: and it is what men have been led to by the very light of nature, as in the instances of Jethro the Midianite towards Moses, and the inhabitants of Melita with Publius, the chief man of the island, towards the Apostle Paul and his company; and is what God enjoined the Israelites by divers laws, since they had been strangers in the land of Egypt; and various are the exhortations to it in the New Testament; and some, by the practice of it, have entertained angels unawares, as Abraham, and Lot; and even Christ himself, as the two disciples travelling to Emmaus; and is what is highly regarded and commended by Christ, and the contrary is resented by him; and therefore it ought to be used and practised frequently; saints should inure themselves to it, be given to it, pursue and follow hard after it; See Gill on <a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>; see Gill on <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>. The apostle adds here, one to another; which clause is left out in the Syriac and Ethiopic versions; the reason of which may be, because the authors of these versions might think this not so consistent with the duty exhorted to, since the objects of it are strangers; but it should be observed, that so were these persons the apostle writes to; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>, they were scattered about, and lived in different countries, and were strangers to one another, and therefore the clause is pertinent enough; and the sense is, that as they were in foreign countries, and at a distance one from another, whenever by any providence they were brought where each other were, that they would be hospitable to one another: and that <p>without grudging: food, raiment, and lodging, or what they want, whether direction or advice, thinking it no trouble to give them either; or without murmurings, as it may be rendered, as if they were burdensome, and they were too chargeable to them, and their stay too long; and without complaints of them, finding fault, and picking quarrels with them, and laying charges against them, in order to get rid of them.

In this and the following verses two manifestations of love are brought prominently forward, in which its <span class="ital">ministering</span> nature is revealed. First: <span class="greekheb">φιλόξενοι εἰς ἀλλήλους</span>] cf. <a href="/romans/12-13.htm" title="Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm" title="Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.">Hebrews 13:2</a>; <a href="/3_john/1-5.htm" title="Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do to the brothers, and to strangers;">3 John 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, etc. The chief emphasis lies on the words which serve more closely to define the statement: <span class="greekheb">ἄνευ γογγυσμοῦ</span>, “<span class="ital">without murmuring</span>,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> murmuring at the trouble caused by the hospitality shown to brethren. The same thing is said in a more general way, <a href="/philippians/2-14.htm" title="Do all things without murmurings and disputings:">Php 2:14</a> : <span class="greekheb">πάντα ποιεῖτε χωρὶς γογγυσμῶν καὶ διαλογισμῶν</span>; cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm" title="Every man according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.">2 Corinthians 9:7</a> : <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἐκ λύπης</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἢ ἐξ ἀνάγκης</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_peter/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_peter/4-9.htm" title="Use hospitality one to another without grudging.">1 Peter 4:9</a>. Hospitality is the practical proof of this <span class="ital">love</span>; its practice was necessary to the cohesion of the scattered brotherhood as to the welfare of those whose duties called them to travel. The inns were little better than brothels and Christians were commonly poor. Chrysostom cites the examples of Abraham and Lot (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm" title="Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.">Hebrews 13:2</a>). The united advocacy of this virtue was successful—so much so that the Didache has to provide against abuses such as Lucian depicts in the biography of Peregrinus “a Christian traveller shall not remain more than two or three days … if he wishes to settle … is unskilled and will not work he is a <span class="greekheb">Χριστέμπορος</span>, makes his Christian profession his merchandise.”—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλήλους</span>, used despite <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτούς</span> above and below, perhaps because the recipients of hospitality belong necessarily to other Churches.—<span class="greekheb">ἄνευ γογγυσμοῦ</span>, St. Peter guards against the imperfection of even Christian human nature. <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/29-25.htm" title="Thou shalt entertain, and feast, and have no thanks: moreover thou shalt hear bitter words:...">Sir 29:25-28</a> describes how a stranger who outstays his welcome is first set to menial tasks and then driven out.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Use hospitality one to another without grudging</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">Be hospitable</span>. The stress laid on this virtue in the New Testament, as in <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="/romans/12-13.htm" title="Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm" title="Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.">Hebrews 13:2</a>, brings before us some of the more striking features of the social life of the Christians of the first three centuries. The Christian traveller coming to a strange city was in a position of no little difficulty. The houses of heathen friends, if he had any, were likely to bring trials of one kind or another. He might be taunted and persecuted for his faith or tempted to “run to the same excess of riot with them.” Inns presented too often scenes of drunkenness and impurity, foul words and fouler acts. It was therefore an unspeakable gain for such an one to know that he could find shelter in a Christian home. The fact that he was a Christian, that he brought with him some “letter of commendation” (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>) as a safeguard against imposture, was to be enough to secure a welcome. It lay in the nature of things that sometimes strangers might thus present themselves with inconvenient frequency or under inconvenient conditions, and therefore St Peter adds “be hospitable … without murmurings.” Men were not to look on it as a trouble or a nuisance, or think themselves hardly treated. They might be entertaining angels unawares (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm" title="Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.">Hebrews 13:2</a>). Here also God loved a cheerful giver (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm" title="Every man according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/4-9.htm" title="Use hospitality one to another without grudging.">1 Peter 4:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς ἀλλήλους</span>, <span class="ital">mutually</span>) This relates to those who dwelt in different cities or districts.—<span class="greekheb">γογγυσμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">murmurings</span>) These are avoided by preserving an equality of duties, or by not nicely weighing their inequality.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Use hospitality one to another</span>; literally, <span class="accented">being hospitable</span> (comp. <a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> 3John 5). Hospitality must have been a necessary, and often a costly, duty in the early ages of the Church. There was no public provision for the poor. Christians traveling from place to place would find no suitable shelter except in the houses of Christians. They would be obliged to avoid the public houses of entertainment, where they would be exposed often to danger, always to temptation; only the private houses of Christians would be safe for them. Hence the use of the "letters of commendation," mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>). Those who brought such letters were to be received in Christian homes. The well-known 'Teaching of the Twelve Apostles' speaks of this right of hospitality, and gives cautions against its abuse. Tim apostle is not speaking of ordinary social gatherings; they have their place and their utility in the Christian life, but they do not, as a rule, afford scope for the higher self-denials of Christian charity (comp. <a href="/luke/14-12.htm">Luke 14:12, 13</a>). Without grudging. Such hospitality would be always costly, often inconvenient, sometimes attended with danger, as in the case of the first British martyr; but it was to be without murmuring. Murmuring would take from the hospitality all its beauty; it should be offered as a gift of love, and Christian love can never murmur (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_peter/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Using hospitality<p>Compare <a href="/romans/13-13.htm">Romans 13:13</a>. </body></html>
