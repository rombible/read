that is to say, it does not directly point back to the list of sins just named, but the grammatical antecedent is to be supplied in the participial clause which follows, thus: “In a particular where they cannot imagine your <span class= "ital">not</span> being as bad as themselves, slanderously affirming that you <span class= "ital">are.</span>” The only difficulty involved in this view is one which does not show in the English, viz., that the participle is attracted into the nominative case by the influence of the finite verb, instead of being (as it strictly should) in the genitive, agreeing with “of the Gentiles.” But we have seen before that St. Peter deals very freely with participles in the nominative case. (See <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>, where “having” is nominative, though in strictness it should be accusative, agreeing with “you, as strangers and pilgrims;” comp. also <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1Peter 2:18</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm" title="Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;">1Peter 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1Peter 3:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-9.htm" title="Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that you are thereunto called, that you should inherit a blessing.">1Peter 3:9</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15-16</a>.)

He died to destroy sin; and though he cheerfully submitted to the worst sufferings, yet he never gave way to the least sin. Temptations could not prevail, were it not for man's own corruption; but true Christians make the will of God, not their own lust or desires, the rule of their lives and actions. And true conversion makes a marvellous change in the heart and life. It alters the mind, judgment, affections, and conversation. When a man is truly converted, it is very grievous to him to think how the time past of his life has been spent. One sin draws on another. Six sins are here mentioned which have dependence one upon another. It is a Christian's duty, not only to keep from gross wickedness, but also from things that lead to sin, or appear evil. The gospel had been preached to those since dead, who by the proud and carnal judgment of wicked men were condemned as evil-doers, some even suffering death. But being quickened to Divine life by the Holy Spirit, they lived to God as his devoted servants. Let not believers care, though the world scorns and reproaches them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_peter/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherein they think it strange - In respect to which vices, they who were once your partners and accomplices now think it strange that you no longer unite with them. They do not understand the reasons why you have left them. They regard you as abandoning a course of life which has much to attract and to make life merry, for a severe and gloomy superstition. This is a true account of the feelings which the people of the world have when their companions and friends leave them and become Christians. It is to them a strange and unaccountable thing, that they give up the pleasures of the world for a course of life which to them seems to promise anything but happiness. Even the kindred of the Saviour regarded him as" beside himself," <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm">Mark 3:21</a>, and Festus supposed that Paul was mad, <a href="/acts/26-24.htm">Acts 26:24</a>. There is almost nothing which the people of the world so little comprehend as the reasons which influence those with ample means of worldly enjoyment to leave the circles of gaiety and vanity, and to give themselves to the serious employments of religion. The epithets of fool, enthusiast, fanatic, are terms which frequently occur to the heart to denote this, if they are not always allowed to escape from the lips. The reasons why they esteem this so strange, are something like the following:<p>(1) They do not appreciate the motives which influence those who leave them. They feel that it is proper to enjoy the world, and to make life cheerful, and they do not understand what it is to act under a deep sense of responsibility to God, and with reference to eternity. They live for themselves. They seek happiness as the end and aim of life. They have never been accustomed to direct the mind onward to another world, and to the account which they must soon render at the bar of God. Unaccustomed to act from any higher motives than those which pertain to the present world, they cannot appreciate the conduct of those who begin to live and act for eternity.<p>(2) they do not yet see the guilt and folly of sinful pleasures. They are not convinced of the deep sinfulness of the human soul, and they think it strange that ethers should abandon a course of life which seems to them so innocent. They do not see why those who have been so long accustomed to these indulgences should have changed their opinions, and why they now regard those tilings as sinful which they once considered to be harmless.<p>(3) they do not see the force of the argument for religion. Not having the views of the unspeakable importance of religious truth and duty which Christians now have, they wonder that they should break off from the course of life which they formerly pursued, and separate from the mass of their fellow-men. Hence, they sometimes regard the conduct of Christians as amiable weakness; sometimes as superstition; sometimes as sheer folly; sometimes as madness; and sometimes as sourness and misanthropy. In all respects they esteem it strange:<p>"Lions and beasts of savage name.<p>Put on the nature of the lamb,<p>While the wide world esteems it strange,<p>Gaze, and admire, and hate the change."<p>That ye run not with them - There may be an allusion here to the well-known orgies of Bacchus, in which his votaries ran as if excited by the furies, and were urged on as if transported with madness. See Ovid, Metam. iii. 529, thus translated by Addison:<p>"For now, through prostrate Greece, young Bacchus rode,<p>Whilst howling matrons celebrate the god;<p>All ranks and sexes to his orgies ran,<p>To mingle in the pomp and fill the train,"<p>The language, however, will well describe revels of any sort, and at any period of the world.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_peter/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

It is more natural to take it thus<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> equivalent to: “on the ground of this” (that is, because ye have thus lived), and the absolute genitive following as equal to: “inasmuch as ye run not with them,” so that the sense is: “on account of this, that ye thus walked in time past, your countrymen think it strange when ye do so no longer” (Hofm.); with <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>, comp. <a href="/john/16-30.htm" title="Now are we sure that you know all things, and need not that any man should ask you: by this we believe that you came forth from God.">John 16:30</a> and Meyer <span class="ital">in loc</span>.

The word <span class="greekheb">ξενίζεσθαι</span> (in its common meaning is equivalent to: “to be a guest;” thus it is used frequently in the N.

This sense is to be kept hold of, and <span class="greekheb">τρέχειν εἰς ἀσωτίας</span> to be explained of the haste with which dissoluteness is allowed to break forth and to overflow. According to Hofm., it denotes the doings of those who are in haste to pour out from them their indwelling lasciviousness, so that it overflows and spreads in all directions. From the explanation of Strabo, iii. p. 206 A: <span class="greekheb">λέγονται ἀναχύσεις αἱ πληρούμεναι τῇ θαλάττῃ κοίλαδες ἐν πλημμυρίσι</span>, it is unjustifiable to derive the meaning “sentina, mire” (2d ed. of this commentary), or “flood” (3d ed.), or “stream” (Schott).[238]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">βλασφημοῦντες</span>] characterizes their amazement more nearly as one which prompts them to speak evil of those whose conduct causes them astonishment (not “Christianity,” as Hofmann thinks).

The <span class="ital">abuse</span> is directed against the apostate heathens and implies blasphemy in its technical sense as opposed to the <span class="ital">giving glory to God</span> (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1 Peter 2:12</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_peter/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">wherein they think it strange</span>] It may be worth noting that the same word is used to express (1) coming as a stranger (<a href="/acts/10-6.htm" title="He lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell you what you ought to do.">Acts 10:6</a>; <a href="/acts/10-18.htm" title="And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.">Acts 10:18</a>; <a href="/acts/21-16.htm" title="There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.">Acts 21:16</a>) and (2) as here, in <a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm" title="Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:">1 Peter 4:12</a> and <a href="/acts/17-20.htm" title="For you bring certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.">Acts 17:20</a>, counting a person or thing strange. The “wherein” points to the change of life implied in the previous verse. “In which matter, in regard to which.” The words imply a change like that of <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,...">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>. The heathen found that his old companions, even his Jewish companions, had acquired, when they became Christians, a new way of looking at things. Conscience was more sensitive. The standard of honesty, purity, and temperance was higher than before. It is not hard, even from our own experience, to picture to ourselves the surprise of the heathen when he found his friend refusing an invitation to a banquet, shrinking from contact with the prostitutes of Greek cities, or when there, passing the wine-cup untasted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to the same excess of riot</span>] The Greek words are singularly forcible. That for “excess,” not found elsewhere in the New Testament, means primarily the “confluence” of waters—then the cistern, sink, or cesspool into which waters have flowed. The underlying metaphor implied in the words reminds us of Juvenal’s (<span class="ital">Sat</span>. iii. 62)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Jam pridem Syrus in Tiberim defluxit Orontes”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(Syria’s Orontes into Tiber flows),<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>when he wishes to paint Rome as the meeting-point of the world’s vices. That for “riot” is used, in the adverbial form, of the life of the prodigal in <a href="/luke/15-13.htm" title="And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.">Luke 15:13</a>, and as a noun here and in <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm" title="And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;">Ephesians 5:18</a>; <a href="/titus/1-6.htm" title="If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.">Titus 1:6</a>. Compounded as it is of the negative particle and of the root of the verb “to save,” it may mean either (1) the state in which a man no longer thinks of saving anything, health, money, character, in the indulgence of his passions, or (2) one in which there is no longer any hope of his being saved himself from utter ruin. The former is probably the dominant meaning of the word. In either case it indicates the basest form of profligacy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">speaking evil of you</span>] More accurately, <span class="bld">reviling</span>. The word is that which is more commonly translated “blaspheming” in direct reference to God. Even here, and in <a href="/acts/13-45.htm" title="But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spoke against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.">Acts 13:45</a>; <a href="/acts/18-6.htm" title="And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said to them, Your blood be on your own heads; I am clean; from now on I will go to the Gentiles.">Acts 18:6</a>, where it is used in reference to men, the other or darker sense can scarcely be thought of as altogether absent. Men blasphemed God when they reviled His servants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_peter/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_peter/4-4.htm" title="Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:">1 Peter 4:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ᾧ</span>, <span class="ital">in which</span>) while you determine that it is sufficient to have lived badly [in past time].—<span class="greekheb">συντρεχόντων</span>, <span class="ital">running together with them</span>) in a troop, eagerly.—<span class="greekheb">τὴν αὐτὴν</span>) <span class="ital">the same</span> as they do up to this day, and as you did formerly with them.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνάχυσιν</span>, <span class="ital">confusion</span>) This is described in <a href="/1_peter/4-3.htm" title="For the time past of our life may suffice us to have worked the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, parties, and abominable idolatries:">1 Peter 4:3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">βλασφημοῦντες</span>, <span class="ital">speaking evil of you</span>) uttering against you reproaches, of pride, singularity, secret impiety, etc.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherein they think it strange.</span> <span class="accented">Wherein</span>, in which course of life, in the fact that the Christians once lived like the Gentiles, but now are so wholly changed. The word <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means commonly to be a guest, to live as a stranger in another's house (<a href="/acts/10-6.htm">Acts 10:6, 18</a>; <a href="/acts/21-16.htm">Acts 21:16</a>); here it means to be astonished, as at some strange sight, as such guests would no doubt sometimes be (comp. ver. 12 and <a href="/acts/17-20.htm">Acts 17:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye run not with them to the same excess of riot.</span> The Greek words are very strong, "while ye run not with them," as if the Gentiles were running greedily in troops to riot and ruin.

The word rendered "riot" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs also in <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a> and <a href="/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6</a>, and is used in the adverbial form in describing the recklessness of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-13.htm">Luke 15:13</a>).
