If sin be found in God's people he will not spare them; and their sins are most provoking to him, for they are most reproaching. When we feel the smart of sin, it behoves us to seek what is the sin we smart for. Persons and places most exalted, are most exposed to spiritual diseases.

Fire, the real agent at the end of the world, is, meanwhile, the symbol of God's anger, as being the most terrible of His instruments of destruction: whence God revealed Himself as a consuming fire <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, and at this same time said by Isaiah; "For behold, the Lord will come with fire ... to render His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire" <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>.<p>And the valleys shall be cleft as wax before the fire - It seems natural that the mountains should be cleft; but the valleys , so low already! This speaks of a yet deeper dissolution; of lower depths beyond our sight or knowledge, into the very heart of the earth. Sanch.: "This should they fear, who will to be so low; who, so far from lifting themselves to heavenly things, pour out their affections on things of earth, meditate on and love earthly things, and forgetful of the heavenly, choose to fix their eyes on earth. These the wide gaping of the earth which they loved, shall swallow: to them the cleft valleys shall open an everlasting sepulchre, and, having received them, shall never part with them."<p>Highest and lowest, first and last, shall perish before Him. The pride of the highest, kings and princes, priests and judges, shall sink and melt away beneath the weight and Majesty of His glory; the hardness of the lowest, which would not open itself to Him, shall be cleft in twain before Him.<p>As wax before the fire - (See <a href="/psalms/97-5.htm">Psalm 97:5</a>), melting away before Him by whom they were not softened, vanishing into nothingness. Metals melt, changing their form only; wax, so as to cease to be.<p>As the waters poured down - (As a stream or cataract, so the word means .)<p>A steep place - Down to the very edge, it is borne along, one strong, smooth, unbroken current; then, at once, it seems to gather its strength, for one great effort. But to what end? To fall, with the greater force, headlong, scattered in spray, foam and froth; dissipated, at times, into vapor, or reeling in giddy eddies, never to return. In Judea, where the autumn rains set in with great vehemence, the waters must have been often seen pouring in their little tumultuous brooklets down the mountain side , hastening to disappear, and disappearing the faster, the more vehemently they rolled along . Both images exhibit the inward emptiness of sinners, man's utter helplessness before God. They need no outward impulse to their destruction. Jerome: "Wax endureth not the nearness of the fire, and the waters are carried headlong. So all of the ungodly, when the Lord cometh, shall be dissolved and disappear." At the end of the world, they shall be gathered into bundles, and cast away. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

The third clause, "as wax," &c., answers to the first in the parallelism, "the mountains shall be molten"; the fourth, "as the waters," &c., to the second, "the valleys shall be cleft."

Therefore, because ye tread upon the poor, and take the distribution of corn from him, ye have built houses of square stones, and will not dwell therein; planted pleasant vineyards, and will not drink their wine. <a href="/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>. For I know how many are your transgressions, and how great your sins; oppressing the righteous, taking atonement money; and ye bow down the poor in the gate." However natural it may seem to take &#1502;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10</a> as referring to prophets, who charge the ungodly with their acts of unrighteousness, as Jerome does, this explanation is precluded not only by bassha&#8219;ar (in the gate), since the gate was not the meeting-place of the people where the prophets were accustomed to stand, but the place where courts of judgment were held, and all the public affairs of the community discussed (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>); but also by the first half of <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>, which presupposes judicial proceedings. Mo&#772;kh&#305;&#772;a&#774;ch is not merely the judge who puts down unjust accusers, but any one who lifts up his voice in a court of justice against acts of injustice (as in <a href="/isaiah/29-21.htm">Isaiah 29:21</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, he who says what is blameless, i.e., what is right and true: this is to be taken generally, and not to be restricted to the accused who seeks to defend his innocence. &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489; is a stronger expression than &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;. The punishment for this unjust oppression of the poor will be the withdrawal of their possessions. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. bo&#772;she&#772;s is a dialectically different form for &#1489;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505;, from &#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, to trample down (Rashi, Kimchi), analogous to the interchange of &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, a coat of mail, although as a rule &#1513;&#1473; passes into &#1505;, and not &#1505; into &#1513;&#1473;. For the derivation from &#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, according to which &#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1505; would stand for &#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; (Hitzig and Tuch on Genesis p. 85), is opposed both to the construction with &#1506;&#1500;, and also to the circumstance that &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; means to delay (<a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>; <a href="/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28</a>); and the derivation suggested by Hitzig from an Arabic verb, signifying to carry one's self haughtily towards others, is a mere loophole. Taking a gift of corn from the poor refers to unjust extortion on the part of the judge, who will only do justice to a poor man when he is paid for it. The main clause, which was introduced with la&#770;khe&#772;n, is continued with &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1490;&#1494;&#1497;&#1514;: "thus have ye built houses of square stones, and shall not dwell therein;" for "ye shall not dwell in the houses of square stones which ye have built." The threat is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-39.htm">Deuteronomy 28:39</a>, and sets before them the plundering of the land and the banishment of the people. Houses built of square stones are splendid buildings (see <a href="/isaiah/9-9.htm">Isaiah 9:9</a>). The reason for this threat is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>, where reference is made to the multitude and magnitude of the sins, of which injustice in the administration of justice is again held up as the chief sin. The participles &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497; and &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1497; are attached to the suffixes of &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; and &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;: your sins, who oppress the righteous, attack him, and take atonement money, contrary to the express command of the law in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>, to take no ko&#772;pher for the soul of a murderer. The judges allowed the rich murderer to purchase exemption from capital punishment by the payment of atonement money, whilst they bowed down the right of the poor. Observe the transition from the participle to the third person fem., by which the prophet turns away with disgust from these ungodly judges. Bowing down the poor is a concise expression for bowing down the right of the poor: compare <a href="/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a> and the warnings against this sin (<a href="/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>). </body></html>
