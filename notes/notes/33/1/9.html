Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust. When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath. All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven; and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh from God only.

The wounds were very sick, or incurable, not in themselves or on God's part, but on Israel's. The day of grace passes away at last, when man has so steeled himself against grace, as to be morally dead, having deadened himself to all capacity of repentance.<p>For it is come unto - (quite up to) Judah; he, (the enemy,) is come (literally, hath reached, touched,) to (quite up to) the gate of my people, even to (quite up to) Jerusalem Jerome: "The same sin, yea, the same punishment for sin, which overthrew Samaria, shall even come unto, quite up to Judah. Then the prophet suddenly changes the gender, and, as Scripture so often does, speaks of the one agent, the center and impersonation of the coming evil, as sweeping on over Judah, quite up to the gate of his people, quite up to Jerusalem. He does not say here, whether Jerusalem would be taken; and so, it seems likely that he speaks of a calamity short of excision. Of Israel's wounds only he here says, that they are incurable; he describes the wasting of even lesser places near or beyond Jerusalem, the flight of their inhabitants. Of the capital itself he is silent, except that the enemy reached, touched, struck against it, quite up to it. Probably, then, he is here describing the first visitation of God, when <a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a> Sennacherib came up against all the fenced cities of Judah and took them, but Jerusalem was spared. God's judgments come step by step, leaving time for repentance. The same enemy, although not the same king, came against Jerusalem who had wasted Samaria. Samaria was probably as strong as Jerusalem. Hezekiah prayed; God heard, the Assyrian army perished by miracle; Jerusalem was respited for 124 years. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. wound &#8230; incurable&#8212;Her case, politically and morally, is desperate (Jer 8:22).<p>it is come&#8212;the wound, or impending calamity (compare Isa 10:28).<p>he is come &#8230; even to Jerusalem&#8212;The evil is no longer limited to Israel. The prophet foresees Sennacherib coming even "to the gate" of the principal city. The use of "it" and "he" is appropriately distinct. "It," the calamity, "came unto" Judah, many of the inhabitants of which suffered, but did not reach the citizens of Jerusalem, "the gate" of which the foe ("he") "came unto," but did not enter (Isa 36:1;37:33-37).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/micah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Her wound is incurable; </span> the wounds of Samaria and the ten tribes; her own sins, God’s just displeasure, and the enemy’s rage have deeply wounded her, she is senseless, impenitent, and furious against her Physician, and she shall at last die by sword, famine, pestilence, and captivity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">It is come unto Judah; </span> the contagion of her sins, and the indignation of God against it, and the enemy’s successes, viz.

"Therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of hosts, the Lord: In all roads lamentation! and in all streets will men say, Alas! alas! and they call the husbandman to mourning, and lamentation to those skilled in lamenting. <a href="/amos/5-17.htm">Amos 5:17</a>. And in all vineyards lamentation, because I go through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah." La&#770;khe&#772;n (therefore) is not connected with the admonitions in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-14.htm">Amos 5:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-15.htm">Amos 5:15</a>, nor can it point back to the reproaches in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10-12</a>, since they are too far off: it rather links on to the substance of <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-13.htm">Amos 5:13</a>, which involves the thought that all admonition to return is fruitless, and the ungodly still persist in their unrighteousness, - a thought which also forms the background of <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-14.htm">Amos 5:14</a>, <a href="/amos/5-15.htm">Amos 5:15</a>. The meaning of <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-16.htm">Amos 5:16</a>, <a href="/amos/5-17.htm">Amos 5:17</a> is, that mourning and lamentation for the dead will fill both city and land. On every hand will there be dead to weep for, because Jehovah will go judging through the land. The roads and streets are not merely those of the capital, although these are primarily to be thought of, but those of all the towns in the kingdom. Mispe&#772;d is the death-wail. This is evident from the parallel 'a&#770;mar ho&#772; ho&#772;, saying, Alas, alas! i.e., striking up the death-wail (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>). And this death-wail will not be heard in all the streets of the towns only, but the husbandman will also be called from the field to mourn, i.e., to seep for one who has died in his house. The verb &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, they call, belongs to &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1491; &#1488;&#1500; &#1497;, they call lamentation to those skilled in mourning: for they call out the word mispe&#772;d to the professional mourners; in other words, they send for them to strike up their wailing for the dead. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; &#1504;&#1492;&#1497; (those skilled in mourning) are the public wailing women, who were hired when a death occurred to sing mourning songs (compare <a href="/jeremiah/9-16.htm">Jeremiah 9:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>, and my Bibl. Archologie, ii. p. 105). Even in all the vineyards, the places where rejoicing is generally looked for (<a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>), the death-wail will be heard. <a href="/amos/5-17.htm">Amos 5:17</a> mentions the event which occasions the lamentation everywhere. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, for (not "if") I go through the midst of thee. These words are easily explained from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>, from which Amos has taken them. Jehovah there says to Moses, "I pass through the land of Egypt, and smite all the first-born." And just as the Lord once passed through Egypt, so will He now pass judicially through Israel, and slay the ungodly. For Israel is no longer the nation of the covenant, which He passes over and spares (<a href="/amos/7-8.htm">Amos 7:8</a>; <a href="/amos/8-2.htm">Amos 8:2</a>), but has become an Egypt, which He will pass through as a judge to punish it.
