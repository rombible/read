Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with the sorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used to do; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, a house of dust. When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselves to the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share this mourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries coming upon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath. All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust in them; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven; and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour which cometh from God only.

"Its ruins only were still seen," in the time of Eusebius and Jerome, "in the second mile from Eleutheropolis" (Onomasticon). : "Foundations still remain on the south-eastern part of the remarkable Tell, south of Beth-Jibrin." Rehoboam fortified it also <a href="/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>. Zerah the Aethiopian had come to (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a> ff) it, probably to besiege it, when Asa met him, and God smote the AEthiopians before him, in the valley of Zephathah thereat. In the wars of the Maccabees, it was in the hands of the Edomites . Its capture and that of Adora are mentioned  as the last act of the war, before the Edomites submitted to John Hyrcanus, and were incorporated in Israel. It was a powerful city , when the Parthians took it. As Micah writes the name, it looked nearer to the word "inheritance." Mareshah (inheritance) shall yet have the heir of God's appointment, the enemy. It shall not inherit the land, as promised to the faithful, but shall itself be inherited, its people dispossessed. While it, (and so also the soul now) held fast to God, they were the heritage of the Lord, by His gifts and grace; when, of their own free-will, those, once God's heritage, become slaves of sin, they passed and still pass, against their will, into the possession of another master, the Assyrian or Satan.<p>He (that is, the heir, the enemy) shall come unto Adullam, the glory of Israel - .  that is, he who shall dispossess Mareshah, shall come quite unto Adullam, where, as in a place of safety, the glory of Israel, all in which she gloried, should be laid up. Adullum was a very ancient city, being mentioned in the history of the patriarch Judah <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/38-12.htm">Genesis 38:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/38-20.htm">Genesis 38:20</a>, a royal city <a href="/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>. It too lay in the Shephelah <a href="/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>; it was said to be 10 (Eusebius) or 12 (Jerome) miles East of Eleutheropolis; but for this, there seems to be scarcely place in the Shephelah. It was one of the 15 cities fortified by Rehoboam <a href="/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>; one of the 16 towns, in which (with their dependent villages) Judah settled after the captivity <a href="/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>. It contained the whole army of Judas Maccabaeus (1 Macc. 12:38).<p>Like Lachish, it had probably the double advantages of the neighborhood of the hills and of the plain, seated perhaps at the roots of the hills, since near it doubtless was the large cave of Adullam named from it. The line of caves, fit for human habitation, which extended from Eleutheropolis to Petra , began westward of it. : "The valley which runs up from Eleutheropolis Eastward, is full of large caves; some would hold thousands of men. They are very extensive, and some of them had evidently been inhabited." : "The outer chamber of one cavern was 270 feet long by 126 wide; and behind this were recesses and galleries, probably leading to other chambers which we could not explore. The massive roof was supported by misshaped pieces of the native limestone left for that purpose, and at some places was domed quite through to the surface, admitting both light and air by the roof." The name of Adullam suggested the memory of that cave, the refuge of the Patriarch David, the first of their line of kings, in extreme isolation and peril of his life. There, the refuge now of the remaining glory of Israel, its wealth, its trust, its boast - the foe should come. And so there only remained one common dirge for all.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. Yet will I bring an heir unto thee&#8212;rather, "the heir." As thou art now occupied by possessors who expelled the former inhabitants, so will I bring "yet" again the new possessor, namely, the Assyrian foe. Other heirs will supplant us in every inheritance but that of heaven. There is a play upon the meaning of Mareshah, "an inheritance": there shall come the new heir of the inheritance.<p>Adullam the glory of Israel&#8212;so called as being superior in situation; when it and the neighboring cities fell, Israel's glory was gone. Maurer, as the Margin, translates, "the glory of Israel" (her chief citizens: answering to "thy delicate children," Mic 1:16) "shall come in flight to Adullam."

Another city in the tribe of Judah, mentioned with Achzib in <a href="/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>; and by many thought to be the birth place of this prophet; and, if so, his faithfulness may be observed in declaring the whole counsel of God, though against his own fire place; and this must be an aggravation of the sin of the inhabitants of it, that they had such a prophet that arose from them, and they regarded him not. There is a beautiful allusion in the word "heir" to Mareshah (s), which signifies an "inheritance"; and here were an "heir" or heirs for it, as the Targum; not the Persians, as some in Aben Ezra, and in an Agadah mentioned by Jarchi, who descended from Elam the firstborn of Shem; and so had a right of inheritance, as those interpreters suppose; but the king of Assyria, who should invade the land, and seize upon this place among others, and possess it, as if it was his by right of inheritance, having obtained it by conquest: and this being by the permission and according to the will of God, he is said to be brought by him to it. Capellus thinks, on the contrary, that Hezekiah and his posterity are meant: <p>he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel; another city in the tribe of Judah, a royal one, <a href="/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>; said by Jerom to be in his time no small village, and to be about ten miles from Eleutheropolis; called the "glory of Israel", having been a royal city in Joshua's time, <a href="/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>; and a fenced city in the times of Rehoboam, <a href="/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>; and Eusebius says it was a large town; and Jerom says it was not a small one in his time; though some think Jerusalem is meant, the metropolis of the nation, Israel being put for Judah, as in <a href="/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>; and to be read, "he that is the enemy and heir shall come to Adullam, yea, to the glory of Israel" (t); even to Jerusalem, the most glorious city in all the tribes; though others are of opinion that this is the character of the enemy or heir that should come thither, called so by way of contradiction, as coming to the reproach and disgrace of Israel; or, ironically, whom Israel before gloried in, when they had recourse to him for help. The margin of our Bible reads, "the glory of Israel shall come to Adullam"; that is, the great men, the princes and heads of the people, shall flee to the cave of Adullam (u), to hide them from the enemy, where David was hid from Saul; see <a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>. Burkius (w), a very late commentator, takes Adullam for an appellative, and with Hillerus (x) renders it, "the perpetuity of the yoke"; and the whole thus, "at the perpetuity of the yoke, the glory of Israel shall come"; that is, when all things shall seem to tend to this, that the yoke once laid on Israel by the Gentiles shall become perpetual, without any hope of deliverance, then shall come the Deliverer, that is, Jesus, the Glory of Israel; and, adds he, God forbid we should think of any other subject here; and so he interprets the "heir" in the preceding clause of the Messiah; and which is a sense far from being despicable. <p>(s) &amp;  (t) So Piscator, Juuius, Drusius.

These limestone caverns are of great extent; some of them, says Dr Pusey, will hold thousands of men. A second meaning may be implied by a paronomasia, ‘The glory of Israel shall set for ever’ (as if Adullam meant ‘for ever,’ Hebr. <span class="ital">ad olam</span>). Adullam was a fortified town in the Shephélah, <a href="/joshua/15-35.htm" title="Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,">Joshua 15:35</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah.</span> "Mareshah" sounds like <span class="accented">Morashah</span>, the Hebrew word for "inheritance;" so the play is, "I will bring an inheritor who shall claim your Heritage town." The "heir" is the Assyrian king, Sargon, into whose possession the city shall pass. Mareshah (<a href="/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a>) was near Achzib, one mile southcast of Beit Jibrin, and is now  called <span class="accented">Mer'ash</span>. <span class="cmt_word">He shall come,</span> etc.; better, <span class="accented">the glory of Israel shall come to Adullam</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the nobility (comp. <a href="/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>) of Israel shall fly for refuge to such places as the cave of Adullam, David's asylum (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1, 2</a>).

But Rosenmuller, Henderson, Pusey, and others take the sentence as in the Authorized Version, making "the glory of Israel" in apposition with "Adullam," and understanding by "he" the heir or enemy. One knows no reason why Aduliam should be honoured with the above-named title; so the rendering given above is preferable. There is probably a paronomasia intended, "The glory of the Lord shall set (<span class="accented">ad olam</span>) forever." The city of Adullam, <span class="accented">hod</span>. <span class="accented">Aid-el-Mah</span>, lay in the valley of Elah, ten miles northwest of Hebron, halfway between Sochoh and Keilah. It was of great antiquity, being mentioned as the birthplace of Hirah, the friend of Judah (<a href="/genesis/38-12.htm">Genesis 38:12</a>), and one of the cities fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>). In its neighbourhood is the celebrated cave, Mugha et Khureitun, which is pointed out as the traditional hold of David, and which has been carefully explored by Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake, of the Palestine Exploration Fund (see Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' pp. 332, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This threatening judgment will not be averted by the Israelites, even by their feasts and sacrifices (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21</a>, <a href="/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>). The Lord has no pleasure in the feasts which they celebrate. Their outward, heartless worship, does not make them into the people of God, who can count upon His grace. <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21</a>. "I hate, I despise your feasts, and do not like to smell your holy days. <a href="/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>. For if ye offer me burnt-offerings, and your meat-offerings, I have no pleasure therein; and the thank-offering of your fatted calves I do not regard. <a href="/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>. Put away from me the noise of thy songs; and I do not like to hear the playing of thy harps. <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>. And let judgment roll like water, and righteousness like an inexhaustible stream." By the rejection of the opus operatum of the feasts and sacrifices, the roots are cut away from the false reliance of the Israelites upon their connection with the people of God. The combination of the words &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; expresses in the strongest terms the dislike of God to the feasts of those who were at enmity with Him. Chagg&#305;&#772;m are the great annual feasts; &#8219;a&#774;tsa&#770;ro&#772;th, the meetings for worship at those feasts, inasmuch as a holy meeting took place at the &#8219;a&#774;tsereth of the feast of Passover and feast of Tabernacles (see at <a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>). R&#305;&#772;a&#774;ch, to smell, is an expression of satisfaction, with an allusion to the &#1512;&#1497;&#1495; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1495;, which ascended to God from the burning sacrifice (see <a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a>). K&#305;&#772;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>, is explanatory: "for," not "yea." The observance of the feast culminated in the sacrificers. God did not like the feasts, because He had no pleasure in the sacrifices. In <a href="/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a> the two kinds of sacrifice, &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;h and mincha&#770;h, are divided between the protasis and apodosis, which gives rise to a certain incongruity. The sentences, if written fully, would read thus: When ye offer me burnt-offerings and meat-offerings, I have no pleasure in your burnt-offerings and meat-offerings. To these two kinds the shelem, the health-offering or peace-offering, is added as a third class in <a href="/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, fattened things, generally mentioned along with ba&#770;qa&#770;r as one particular species, for fattened calves (see <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>). In &#1492;&#1505;&#1512; (<a href="/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>) Israel is addressed as a whole. &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, the noise of thy songs, answers to the strong expression &#1492;&#1505;&#1512;. The singing of their psalms is nothing more to God than a wearisome noise, which is to be brought to an end. Singing and playing upon harps formed part of the temple worship (vid., <a href="/1_chronicles/16-40.htm">1 Chronicles 16:40</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>, and <a href="/1_chronicles/23-25.htm">1 Chronicles 23:25</a>). Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>.) also refuses the heartless sacrifice and worship of the people, who have fallen away from God in their hearts. It is very clear from the sentence which Amos pronounces here, that the worship at Bethel was an imitation of the temple service at Jerusalem. If, therefore, with <a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a> in view, where the careless upon Mount Zion and in Samaria are addressed, we are warranted in assuming that here also the prophet has the worship in Judah in his mind as well; the words apply primarily and chiefly to the worship of the kingdom of the ten tribes, and therefore even in that case they prove that, with regard to ritual, it was based upon the model of the temple service at Jerusalem. Because the Lord has no pleasure in this hypocritical worship, the judgment shall pour like a flood over the land. The meaning of <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a> is not, "Let justice and righteousness take the place of your sacrifices." Mishpa&#770;t is not the justice to be practised by men; for "although Jehovah might promise that He would create righteousness in the nation, so that it would fill the land as it were like a flood (<a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>), He only demands righteousness generally, and not actually in floods" (Hitzig). Still less can mishpa&#770;t u&#772;tseda&#770;qa&#770;h be understood as relating to the righteousness of the gospel which Christ has revealed. This thought is a very far-fetched one here, and is only founded upon the rendering given to &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, et revelabitur (Targ., Jerome,  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;), whereas &#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; comes from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, to roll, to roll along. The verse is to be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>, and threatens the flooding of the land with judgment and the punitive righteousness of God (Theod. Mops., Theodoret, Cyr., Kimchi, and others). </body></html>
