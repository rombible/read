Men had no comfort, no satisfaction in their own families or in their nearest relations. Contempt and violation of domestic duties are a sad symptom of universal corruption. Those are never likely to come to good who are undutiful to their parents. The prophet saw no safety or comfort but in looking to the Lord, and waiting on God his salvation. When under trials, we should look continually to our Divine Redeemer, that we may have strength and grace to trust in him, and to be examples to those around us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Woe - o is me! for I am, as when they have gathered the summer fruits , as the grape-gleanings of the vintage "The vineyard of the Lord of hosts," Isaiah said at the same time, "is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah His pleasant plants" <a href="/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>. Isaiah said, brought forth wild grapes; Micah, that there are but gleanings, few and poor.<p>It is as though Satan pressed the vineyard of the Lord, and made the most his prey, and few were left to those who glean for Christ; "the foxes have eaten the grapes" Sol 2:15. Some few remain too high out of their reach, or hidden behind the leaves, or, it may be , falling in the time of gathering, fouled, sullied, marred and stained, yet left." So in the gleaning there may be three sorts of souls; "two or three in the top of the uppermost bough" <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>, which were not touched; or those unripe, which are but imperfect and poor; or those who had fallen, yet were not wholly carried away. These too are all sought with difficulty; they had escaped the gatherer's eye, they are few and rare; it might seem at first sight, us though there were none. There is no cluster to eat; for the vintage is past, the best is but as a sour grape which sets the teeth on edge.<p>My soul desired the first-ripe fig. These are they which, having survived the sharpness of winter, ripen early, about the end of June; they are the sweetest ; but he longed for them in vain. He addressed a carnal people, who could understand only carnal things, on the side which they could understand. Our longings, though we pervert them, are God's gift. As they desired those things which refresh or recruit the thirsty body, as their whole self was gathered into the craving for that which was to restore them, so was it with him. Such is the longing of God for man's conversion and salvation; such is the thirst of His ministers; such their pains in seeking, their sorrow in not finding. Dionysius: "There were none, through whose goodness the soul of the prophet might spiritually be refreshed, in joy at his growth in grace, as Paul saith to Philemon, "refresh my bowels in the Lord" Plm 1:20.

"If thieves had come to thee, if robbers by night, alas, how art thou destroyed! would they not steal their sufficiency? If vine-dressers had come to thee, would they not leave gleanings? <a href="/obadiah/1-6.htm">Obadiah 1:6</a>. How have the things of Esau been explored, his hidden treasures desired! <a href="/obadiah/1-7.htm">Obadiah 1:7</a>. Even to the border have all the men of thy covenant sent thee: the men of thy peace have deceived thee, overpowered thee. They make thy bread a wound under thee. There is no understanding in him." In order to exhibit the more vividly the complete clearing out of Edom, Obadiah supposes two cases of plundering in which there is still something left (<a href="/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>), and then shows that the enemies in Edom will act much worse than this. &#1488;&#1501; with the perfect supposes a case to have already occurred, when, although it does not as yet exist in reality, it does so in imagination. &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; are common thieves, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491;&#1497; &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; robbers by night, who carry off another's property by force. With this second expression, the verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1498; must be repeated. "To thee," i.e., to do thee harm; it is actually equivalent to "upon thee." The following words &#1488;&#1497;&#1498;  &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; cannot form the apodosis to the two previous clauses, because nidme&#772;tha&#770;h is too strong a term for the injury inflicted by thieves or robbers, but chiefly because the following expression &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; &#1497;&#1490;&#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is irreconcilable with such an explanation, the thought that thieves steal &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; being quite opposed to nidma&#770;h, or being destroyed. The clause "how art thou destroyed" must rather be taken as pointing far beyond the contents of <a href="/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a> and <a href="/obadiah/1-6.htm">Obadiah 1:6</a>. It is more fully explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-9.htm">Obadiah 1:9</a>, and is thereby proved to be a thought thrown in parenthetically, with which the prophet anticipates the principal fact in his lively description, in the form of an exclamation of amazement. The apodosis to 'im ganna&#770;gh&#305;&#772;m (if robbers, etc.) follows in the words "do they not steal" ( equals  they surely steal) dayya&#770;m, i.e., their sufficiency (see Delitzsch on <a href="/isaiah/40-16.htm">Isaiah 40:16</a>); that is to say, as much as they need, or can use, or find lying open before them. The picture of the grape-gatherers says the same thing. They also do not take away all, even to the very last, but leave some gleanings behind, not only if they fear God, according to <a href="/leviticus/19-10.htm">Leviticus 19:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-21.htm">Deuteronomy 24:21</a>, as Hitzig supposes, but even if they do not trouble themselves about God's commandments at all, because many a bunch escapes their notice which is only discovered on careful gleaning. Edom, on the contrary, is completely cleared out. In <a href="/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a> the address to Edom passes over into words concerning him. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493; is construed as a collective with the plural. &#1488;&#1497;&#1498; is a question of amazement.

Matspo&#772;n, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. from tsa&#770;phan, does not mean a secret place, but a hidden thing or treasure (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, lxx). Obadiah mentions the plundering first, because Petra, the capital of Edom, was a great emporium of the Syrio-Arabian trade, where many valuables were stored (vid., Diod. Sic. xix. 95), and because with the loss of these riches the prosperity and power of Edom were destroyed.<p>(Note: Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>) has greatly altered the words of Obadiah, dropping the comparison of the enemy to thieves and grape-gatherers, and representing the enemy as being themselves grape-gatherers who leave no gleaning, and thieves who waste till they have enough; and thereby considerably weakening the poetical picture.) </body></html>
