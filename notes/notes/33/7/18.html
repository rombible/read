The gracious character here ascribed to Jehovah is unparalleled in the Bible in human utterances; it is the response of the prophet to the glorious words spoken by Jehovah of Himself (<a href="/context/exodus/34-6.htm" title="And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). The promise there made to Moses is here extended by the inspiration of the prophet to the Gentiles. The “remnant” refers to the returned from the captivity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/micah/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/micah/7-18.htm" title="Who is a God like to you, that pardons iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retains not his anger for ever, because he delights in mercy....">Micah 7:18-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who is a God like unto thee — </span>That is, there is no God like unto thee; <span class="ital">that passeth by the transgression of the remnant, </span>&c. — That pardons the offences of the remainder of his people, namely, of those that shall survive the various punishments and destructions brought upon their forefathers for their sins. <span class="ital">He retaineth not his anger for ever — </span>Though in his just displeasure he suffered their enemies to destroy their city, and lay their country desolate, and sent them into captivity; yet will he restore them again, and raise them to a state of great prosperity. He will chastise, but not consume his remnant. <span class="ital">Because he delighteth in mercy — </span>Because it is his nature to delight in pardoning the penitent, and communicating blessings; whereas to punish, or inflict evil, is contrary to it. <span class="ital">He will turn again, he will have compassion — </span>Or, he will again have compassion upon us. <span class="ital">He will subdue our iniquities </span>— He will deliver us not only from the guilt, but also from the power of them, so that they shall not have dominion over us.

And therefore <span class="ital">the remnant, </span>here spoken of, to which God will show such mercy, seems to be chiefly those Jews which should be reserved to be made partakers of the benefits which should be conferred on that nation, upon their conversion to Christianity. Then especially shall God make manifest his mercy toward them, in pardoning all their former stubbornness and disobedience, and receiving them into his favour as formerly; and that in a degree greater than was ever experienced in the preceding ages of their church.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/micah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:14-20 When God is about to deliver his people, he stirs up their friends to pray for them. Apply spiritually the prophet's prayer to Christ, to take care of his church, as the great Shepherd of the sheep, and to go before them, while they are here in this world as in a wood, in this world but not of it. God promises in answer to this prayer, he will do that for them which shall be repeating the miracles of former ages. As their sin brought them into bondage, so God's pardoning their sin brought them out. All who find pardoning mercy, cannot but wonder at that mercy; we have reason to stand amazed, if we know what it is. When the Lord takes away the guilt of sin, that it may not condemn us, he will break the power of sin, that it may not have dominion over us. If left to ourselves, our sins will be too hard for us; but God's grace shall be sufficient to subdue them, so that they shall not rule us, and then they shall not ruin us. When God forgives sin, he takes care that it never shall be remembered any more against the sinner. He casts their sins into the sea; not near the shore-side, where they may appear again, but into the depth of the sea, never to rise again. All their sins shall be cast there, for when God forgives sin, he forgives all. He will perfect that which concerns us, and with this good work will do all for us which our case requires, and which he has promised. These engagements relate to Christ, and the success of the gospel to the end of time, the future restoration of Israel, and the final prevailing of true religion in all lands. The Lord will perform his truth and mercy, not one jot or tittle of it shall fall to the ground: faithful is He that has promised, who also will do it. Let us remember that the Lord has given the security of his covenant, for strong consolation to all who flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before them in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is a God - (and, as the word means, A Mighty God,) like unto Thee? He saith not, "Who hast made heaven and earth, the sea and all that therein is" <a href="/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>; nor, "Who telleth the number of the stars; and calleth them all by their names" <a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>; nor, "Who by His strength setteth fast the mountains and is girded about with power" <a href="/psalms/65-6.htm">Psalm 65:6</a>; but who forgivest!

"That pardoneth", and beareth and taketh away also, "and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage", that is, His heritage, which is a remnant still when "the rest are blinded" <a href="/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7</a>; and this, not of its merits but of His mercy; since it is not His nature to "retain His anger forever"; not for anything in them, but "because He delighteth in mercy", as He saith, "I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not keep anger forever" <a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>. "I am He that blotteth out thy transgressions for Mine oum sake, and will not remember thy sins" <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>. : "For although God for a time is angry with His elect, chastening them mercifully in this life, yet in the end He hath compassion on them, giving them everlasting consolations."<p>Moses, after the completion of his people's deliverance at the Red Sea, used the like appeal to God, in unmingled joy. Then the thanksgiving ran, "glorious in holiness, awful in praises, doing wonders" <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>. Now, it ran in a more subdued, yet even deeper, tone, taken from God's revelation of Himself after that great transgression on Mount Sinai "forgiving iniquity and trasgression and sin". With this, Micah identified his own name . This was the one message which he loved above all to proclaim; of this, his own name was the herald to his people in his day. who is like the Lord, the Pardoner of sin, the Redeemer from its guilt, the Subduer of its power? For no false god was ever such a claim made. The pagan gods were symbols of God's workings in nature; they were, at best, representatives of His government and of His displeasure at sin. But, being the creatures of man's mind, they could hot freely pardon, for man dared not ascribe to them the attribute of a freely-pardoning mercy, for which be dared not hope. Who is a God like to Thee, mighty, not only to destroy but to pardon? is the wondering thanksgiving of time, the yet greater amazement of eternity, as eternity shall unveil the deep blackness of sin over-against the light of God, and we, seeing God, as He Is, shall see what that Holiness is, against Which we sinners sinned, The soul, which is truly penitent, never wearies of the wondering love, who is a God like unto Thee? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

The word of the Lord which came to Jonah was this: "Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and preach against it." &#1506;&#1500; does not stand for &#1488;&#1500; (<a href="/jonah/3-2.htm">Jonah 3:2</a>), but retains its proper meaning, against, indicating the threatening nature of the preaching, as the explanatory clause which follows clearly shows. The connection in <a href="/jonah/3-2.htm">Jonah 3:2</a> is a different one. Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian kingdom, and the residence of the great kings of Assyria, which was built by Nimrod according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a>, and by Ninos, the mythical founder of the Assyrian empire, according to the Greek and Roman authors, is repeatedly called "the great city" in this book (<a href="//biblehub.com/jonah/3-2.htm">Jonah 3:2-3</a>; <a href="/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>), and its size is given as three days' journey (<a href="/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3</a>). This agrees with the statements of classical writers, according to whom &#x39d;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, Ninus, as Greeks and Romans call it, was the largest city in the world at that time. According to Strabo (<a href="//biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>, <a href="/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a>), it was much larger than Babylon, and was situated in a plain, &#x391;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, of Assyria i.e., on the left bank of the Tigris. According to Ctesias (in Diod. ii. 3), its circumference was as much as 480 stadia, i.e., twelve geographical miles; whereas, according to Strabo, the circumference of the wall of Babylon was not more than 365 stadia. These statements have been confirmed by modern excavations upon the spot. The conclusion to which recent discoveries lead is, that the name Nineveh was used in two senses: first, for one particular city; and secondly, for a complex of four large primeval cities (including Nineveh proper), the circumvallation of which is still traceable, and a number of small dwelling-places, castles, etc., the mounds (Tell) of which cover the land. This Nineveh, in the broader sense, is bounded on three sides by rivers - viz. on the north-west by the Khosr, on the west by the Tigris, and on the south-west by the Gazr Su and the Upper or Great Zab - and on the fourth side by mountains, which ascend from the rocky plateau; and it was fortified artificially all round on the river-sides with dams, sluices for inundating the land, and canals, and on the land side with ramparts and castles, as we may still see from the heaps of ruins. It formed a trapezium, the sharp angles of which lay towards the north and south, the long sides being formed by the Tigris and the mountains. The average length is about twenty-five English miles; the average breadth fifteen. The four large cities were situated on the edge of the trapezium, Nineveh proper (including the ruins of Kouyunjik, Nebbi Yunas, and Ninua) being at the north-western corner, by the Tigris; the city, which was evidently the later capital (Nimrud), and which Rawlinson, Jones, and Oppert suppose to have been Calah, at the south-western corner, between Tigris and Zab; a third large city, which is now without a name, and has been explored last of all, but within the circumference of which the village of Selamiyeh now stands, on the Tigris itself, from three to six English miles to the north of Nimrud; and lastly, the citadel and temple-mass, which is now named Khorsabad, and is said to be called Dur-Sargina in the inscriptions, from the palace built there by Sargon, on the Khosr, pretty near to the north-eastern corner (compare M. v. Niebuhr, Geschichte Assurs, p. 274ff., with the ground-plan of the city of Nineveh, p. 284). But although we may see from this that Nineveh could very justly be called the great city, Jonah does not apply this epithet to it with the intention of pointing out to his countrymen its majestic size, but, as the expression gedo&#772;la&#770;h le&#772;'lo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m in <a href="/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3</a> clearly shows, and as we may see still more clearly from <a href="//biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>, with reference to the importance which Nineveh had, both in the eye of God, and with regard to the divine commission which he had received, as the capital of the Gentile world, quae propter tot animarum multitudinem Deo curae erat (Michaelis). Jonah was to preach against this great Gentile city, because its wickedness had come before Jehovah, i.e., because the report or the tidings of its great corruption had penetrated to God in heaven (cf. <a href="/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/5-12.htm">1 Samuel 5:12</a>). </body></html>
