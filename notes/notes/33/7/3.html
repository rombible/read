Men had no comfort, no satisfaction in their own families or in their nearest relations. Contempt and violation of domestic duties are a sad symptom of universal corruption. Those are never likely to come to good who are undutiful to their parents. The prophet saw no safety or comfort but in looking to the Lord, and waiting on God his salvation.

Bad men gain a dreadful skill and wisdom in evil, as Satan has; and cleverness in evil is their delight. Jerome: "They call the evil of their hands good." "The prince asketh, and the judge asketh (or, it may more readily be supplied, judgeth, doth that which is his office,) against right "for a reward", (which was strictly forbidden,) "and the great man he uttereth his mischievos desire" (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>. See above <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>), (or the "desire of his soul".) Even the shew of good is laid aside; whatever the heart conceives and covets, it utters; - mischief to others and in the end to itself.<p>The mischief comes forth from the soul, and returns upon it. "The elders and nobles in the city" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-8.htm">1 Kings 21:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-11.htm">1 Kings 21:11</a>, as well as Ahab, took part, (as one instance,) in the murder of Naboth. The great man, however, here, is rather the source of the evil, which he induces others to effect; so that as many as there were great, so many sources were there of oppression. All, prince, judges, the great, unite in the ill, and this not once only, but they are ever doing it  and "so they wrap it up", (literally, twist, intertwine it.) Things are twisted, either to strengthen, or to pervert or intricate them. It might mean, they "strengthen" it, that which their soul covets against; the poor, or they "pervert" it, the cause of the poor. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

The "threefold cord is not quickly broken" (Ec 4:12); here the "prince," the "judge," and the "great man" are the three in guilty complicity.

Or "well" (t), strenuously, diligently, to the utmost of their power, labouring at it with all their might and main; as wicked men generally are more industrious, and exert themselves more to do evil than good men do to do good; and even weary themselves to commit iniquity: or, "instead of doing good", as Marinus in Aben Ezra, take a great deal of pains to do evil; work with both hands at it, instead of doing good. The Septuagint and Arabic versions render it, "they prepare their hands for evil"; the Syriac version is, "their hands are read? to evil, and they do not do good"; with which agrees the Targum, <p>"they do evil with their hands, and do not do good.'' <p>Some make the sense to depend on what goes before and follows; "to do evil, both hands" are open and ready, and they hurt with them; "but to do, good the prince asketh, and the judge for a reward" (u); forward enough to do evil, but very backward to do any good office; <p>the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and, if they do it, must be bribed, and have a reward for it, even persons of such high character; but this sense is not favoured by, the accents; besides, by what follows, it seems as if the "prince", by whom may be meant the king upon the throne, and the "judge" he that sits upon the bench under him, sought for bribes to do an ill thing; to give a cause wrong against a poor man, and in favour of a rich man that will bribe high: <p>and the great man he uttereth his mischievous desire; the depravity, corruption, and perverseness of his soul; who is either some great man at court, that, being encouraged by the example of the prince and judge, openly and publicly requires a bribe also to do an ill thing; and without any shame or blushing promises to do it on that consideration; or a counsellor at the bar, who openly declares that he will speak in such a cause, though a bad one, and defend it, and not doubt of carrying it; or else this is some rich wicked man, that seeks to oppress his poor neighbour, and, being favoured by the prince and judge he has bribed, does without fear or shame speak out the wickedness of his heart, and what an ill design he has against his neighbour, whose mischief, hurt, and ruin, he seeks: <p>so they wrap it up together; or, "twist it together" (w); as cords are, which thereby become strong; slid so these three work up this mischievous business, and strengthen and establish it; and such a threefold cord of wickedness is not easily broken or unravelled: or, "they perplex it" (x); as thick branches of trees are implicated and wrapped together; so these agree to puzzle and perplex a cause, that they may have some show of carrying it with justice and truth. So the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "they trouble it"; confound the matter, and make it dark, dubious, and difficult. The Targum is, "they corrupt it"; or deprave it; put an ill sense on things, and make a wrong construction of them. <p>(t) "bene", Drusius. (u) So Grotius.

In any case, the A.V. rendering of the first clause cannot be maintained; a better one is, ‘(Their) hands are (only) for evil, to do (it) skilfully.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the prince asketh</span>] ‘Asketh’ the judge to shut his eyes to some act of violence, or to put some righteous man out of the way.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the judge asketh</span>] Rather, ‘the judge doeth it,’ or ‘agreeth to his demand;’ but the ellipsis is harsh, and the probability is that there is some corruption of the text, or that the letters are wrongly grouped in the Massoretic text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">so they wrap it up</span>] Rather, ‘and they weave it together.’ It requires ‘weaving’ to carry an evil desire into effect, for, bad as the times are, it is needful to keep up the forms of justice. Thus, when Ahab wished to get rid of Naboth, it was necessary to persuade the people that his victim had ‘renounced God and the king’ (<a href="/1_kings/21-13.htm" title="And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king.

This clause and the rest of the verse are very obscure Cheyne supposes the text to be corrupt. Henderson renders, "For evil their hands are well prepared;" so virtually Hitzig, Pusey, and the Septuagint. Caspari agrees rather with the Vulgate (<span class="accented">Malum manuum suarum dicunt bonum</span>)," Hands are (busy) upon evil to make (it seem) good," which looks to that extremity of iniquity  when men "call evil good, and good evil" (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>). The general meaning is that they are ready enough to do evil, and, as the next clause says, can be bribed to do anything. <span class="cmt_word">The prince asketh;</span> makes some nefarious demand of the judge, some perversion of justice at his hands, as in the case of Naboth (<a href="/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">The judge asketh</span> (<span class="accented">is ready</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for a reward.</span> The judge is willing to do what the prince wishes, if he is bribed for it.

The passage is altered in meaning by a different grouping of the Hebrew letters, thus: "The prince demandeth (a reward) to do good; and the judge, for the recompense of a great man, uttereth what he himself desireth. And they entangle the good more than briars, and the righteous more than a thorn hedge."

And thy heroes despair, O Teman, that every one may be cut off by murder from the mountains of Esau." In order to give up the Edomites to destruction at that time, the Lord will take away discernment from their wise men, so that even they will not be able to help them. The destruction of the wise men is not to be understood as signifying that the wise men will all be slain, or slain before any others, but simply that they will be destroyed as wise men by the withdrawal or destruction of their wisdom. This meaning is sustained, not only by the fact that in the second clause tebhu&#772;na&#770;h only is mentioned as that which is to be destroyed, but also by the parallel passages, <a href="/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a>. Jeremiah mentions here the wisdom of the Temanites in particular. That they were celebrated for their wisdom, is evident not only from this passage, but also from the fact that Eliphaz, the chief opponent of Job in argument, was a Temanite (<a href="//biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a>, etc.). With this withdrawal of wisdom and discernment, even the brave warriors lose their courage. The heroes are dismayed (chattu&#772;), or fall into despair. Te&#772;ma&#770;n, which the Chaldee has rendered incorrectly as an appellative, viz., inhabitants of the south (da&#770;ro&#772;ma&#770;'), is a proper name of the southern district of Idumaea (see at <a href="/amos/1-12.htm">Amos 1:12</a>), so called from Teman, a son of Eliphaz and grandson of Esau (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/36-11.htm">Genesis 36:11</a>, <a href="/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15</a>). Gibbo&#772;rekha&#770; (thy heroes), with the masculine suffix, the people inhabiting the district being addressed under the name of the district itself. God inflicts this upon Edom with the intention (lema&#8219;an, to this end) that all the Edomites should be cut off. Miqqa&#770;tel, from the murdering, by murder (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/9-11.htm">Genesis 9:11</a>, where min occurs after yikka&#770;re&#772;th in this sense); not "without conflict," as Ewald renders it, for qetel signifies slaying, and not conflict. The thought of connecting miqqa&#770;tel with what follows cannot for a moment be entertained (vid., lxx, Syr., Vulg.). It is opposed not only by the authority of the Masoretic punctuation, but still more decisively by the fact, that the stronger and more special word (qetel) cannot precede the weaker and more general one (cha&#770;ma&#770;s), and that the murder of certain fugitives is placed first in the list of crimes committed by Edom upon the Israelites (<a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>). </body></html>
