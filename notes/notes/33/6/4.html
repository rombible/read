Instead of doing them any wrong, he had done them much good; of which this is one instance, and he was able to produce more: this a notorious, plain, and full proof of his goodness to them, which could not be denied. It may be rendered, as it is by some, "surely I brought thee up" (s), &amp;c. this is a certain thing, well known, and cannot be disproved; it must be allowed to be a great favour and kindness to be brought up out of a superstitious, idolatrous, Heathenish people, enemies to God and true religion, and who had used them in a barbarous and cruel manner: <p>and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; or, "out of the house of bondage"; as the same words are rendered, <a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>; that is, out of hard service, in which their lives were made bitter; out of cruel bondage and slavery; which made them cry to the Lord for help and deliverance, and he heard them, and sent them a deliverer; by whose hand he redeemed them from this base and low estate in which they were, and for which they ought ever to have been thankful, and to have shown their gratitude by their cheerful and constant obedience. Some take "the house of servants" to be descriptive, not of the state of the children of Israel in Egypt, but of the character of the Egyptians themselves; who, being the posterity of Ham, were inheritors of his curse, that he should be a servant of servants; and so it is an aggravation of the blessing, that Israel were redeemed from being servants to the servants of servants. This sense is mentioned by Kimchi and Abarbinel: <p>and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam; not to bring them the news of their deliverance out of Egypt, before they came out of it, as Kimchi; but to be their guides to conduct and direct them in all matters, civil and religious. Moses was their lawgiver, leader, and commander; Aaron was their priest to offer sacrifice for them, and to intercede on their behalf; and Miriam was a prophetess; and they were all very useful and beneficial to them; and a very great blessing it is to a people to have a good constitution, civil and ecclesiastic, and to have good magistrates, and good ministers of the word.

Jehovah has indeed wonderfully assisted His people in their troubles. Nothing could extinguish the sense of the overwhelming grandeur of Israel’s first deliverance. A prophet, writing in the name of the Jewish Church of the Captivity, points back to the happy days of old, when he ‘brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock’ (<a href="/isaiah/63-11.htm" title="Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?">Isaiah 63:11</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam</span>] These were the shepherds, by whom ‘God led His people like sheep’ (<a href="/psalms/77-20.htm" title="You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.">Psalm 77:20</a>)—Eastern shepherds going before their sheep (<a href="/john/10-4.htm" title="And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.">John 10:4</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - God answers his own question by recounting some of his chief mercies to Israel.

After Amos has thus cut off all hope of deliverance from the ungodly, he repeats, in his own words in <a href="/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>., the threat already exhibited symbolically in <a href="/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1</a>. <a href="/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>. "Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are against the sinful kingdom, and I destroy it from off the face of the earth; except that I shall not utterly destroy the house of Jacob: is the saying of Jehovah. <a href="/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>. For, behold, I command, and shake the house of Israel among all nations, as (corn) is shaken in a sieve, and not even a little grain falls to the ground. <a href="/amos/9-10.htm">Amos 9:10</a>. All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, The evil will not overtake or come to us." The sinful kingdom is Israel; not merely the kingdom of the ten tribes however, but all Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes along with Judah, the house of Jacob or Israel, which is identical with the sons of Israel, who had become like the Cushites, although Amos had chiefly the people and kingdom of the ten tribes in his mind. Bammamla&#770;kha&#770;h, not upon the kingdom, but against the kingdom. The directing of the eye upon an object is expressed by  &#1506;&#1500;  (<a href="/amos/9-4.htm">Amos 9:4</a>) or  &#1488;&#1500;  (cf. <a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a>); whereas  &#1489;  is used in relation to the object upon which anger rests (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>). Because the Lord had turned His eye towards the sinful kingdom, He must exterminate it, - a fate with which Moses had already threatened the nation in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-15.htm">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>. Nevertheless (&#1488;&#1508;&#1505; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, "only that," introducing the limitation, as in <a href="/numbers/13-28.htm">Numbers 13:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-4.htm">Deuteronomy 15:4</a>) the house of Jacob, the covenant nation, shall not be utterly destroyed. The "house of Jacob" is opposed to the "sinful nation;" not, however, so that the antithesis simply lies in the kingdom and people (regnum delebo, non populum), or that the "house of Jacob" signifies the kingdom of Judah as distinguished from the kingdom of the ten tribes, for the "house of Jacob" is perfectly equivalent to the "house of Israel" (<a href="/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>). The house of Jacob is not to be utterly destroyed, but simply to be shaken, as it were, in a sieve. The antithesis lies in the predicate &#1492;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;, the sinful kingdom. So far as Israel, as a kingdom and people, is sinful, it is to be destroyed from off the face of the earth. But there is always a divine kernel in the nation, by virtue of its divine election, a holy seed out of which the Lord will form a new and holy people and kingdom of God. Consequently the destruction will not be a total one, a &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;. The reason for this is introduced by k&#305;&#772; (for) in <a href="/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>. The Lord will shake Israel among the nations, as corn is shaken in a sieve; so that the chaff flies away, and the dust and dirt fall to the ground, and only the good grains are left in the sieve. Such a sieve are the nations of the world, through which Israel is purified from its chaff, i.e., from its ungodly members. Tsero&#772;r, generally a bundle; here, according to its etymology, that which is compact or firm, i.e., solid grain as distinguished from loose chaff. In <a href="/2_samuel/17-13.htm">2 Samuel 17:13</a> it is used in a similar sense to denote a hard piece of clay or a stone in a building. Not a single grain fill fall to the ground, that is to say, not a good man will be lost (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/26-20.htm">1 Samuel 26:20</a>). The self-secure sinners, however, who rely upon their outward connection with the nation of God (compare <a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a> and <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>), or upon their zeal in the outward forms of worship (<a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21</a>.), and fancy that the judgment cannot touch them (&#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;, to come to meet a person round about him, i.e., to come upon him from every side), will all perish by the sword. This threat is repeated at the close, without any formal link of connection with <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>, not only to prevent any abuse of the foregoing modification of the judgment, but also to remove this apparent discrepancy, that whereas in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1-4</a> it is stated that not one will escape the judgment, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>, the nation of Israel is not to be utterly destroyed. In order to anticipate the frivolity of the ungodly, who always flatter themselves with the hope of escaping when there is a threatening of any general calamity, the prophet first of all cuts off all possibilities whatever in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1-4</a>, without mentioning the exceptions; and it is not till afterwards that the promise is introduced that the house of Israel shall not be utterly annihilated, whereby the general threat is limited to sinners, and the prospect of deliverance and preservation through the mercy of God is opened to the righteous. The historical realization or fulfilment of this threat took place, so far as Israel of the ten tribes was concerned, when their kingdom was destroyed by the Assyrians, and in the case of Judah, at the overthrow of the kingdom and temple by the Chaldeans; and the shaking of Israel in the sieve is still being fulfilled upon the Jews who are dispersed among all nations. </body></html>
