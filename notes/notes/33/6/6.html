They intimate that they are ready to offer any expiatory sacrifices, though never so costly, for that purpose. <span class="ital">Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, </span>&c. — Will God accept of the ordinary sacrifices, such as we have offered on other occasions, as an atonement for sin? <span class="ital">Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, </span>&c. — With a prodigious number; <span class="ital">or ten thousands of rivers of oil — </span>Were it possible to give them? Doth he expect more costly sacrifices than ordinary?

And some of the idolatrous Jews and Israelites imitated this horrid practice: see note on <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm" title="And you shall not let any of your seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:21</a>, where God in a solemn manner prohibits it, as he frequently does elsewhere. These two verses give us an exact description of the character of hypocrites and habitual sinners, who hope to obtain God’s favour by performing certain external ceremonies; and are willing to purchase their own pardon upon any terms, except that of reforming their lives.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/micah/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:6-8 These verses seem to contain the substance of Balak's consultation with Balaam how to obtain the favour of Israel's God. Deep conviction of guilt and wrath will put men upon careful inquiries after peace and pardon, and then there begins to be some ground for hope of them. In order to God's being pleased with us, our care must be for an interest in the atonement of Christ, and that the sin by which we displease him may be taken away. What will be a satisfaction to God's justice? In whose name must we come, as we have nothing to plead as our own? In what righteousness shall we appear before him? The proposals betray ignorance, though they show zeal. They offer that which is very rich and costly. Those who are fully convinced of sin, and of their misery and danger by reason of it, would give all the world, if they had it, for peace and pardon. Yet they do not offer aright. The sacrifices had value from their reference to Christ; it was impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin. And all proposals of peace, except those according to the gospel, are absurd. They could not answer the demands of Divine justice, nor satisfy the wrong done to the honour of God by sin, nor would they serve at all in place of holiness of the heart and reformation of the life. Men will part with any thing rather than their sins; but they part with nothing so as to be accepted of God, unless they do part with their sins. Moral duties are commanded because they are good for man. In keeping God's commandments there is a great reward, as well as after keeping them. God has not only made it known, but made it plain. The good which God requires of us is, not the paying a price for the pardon of sin and acceptance with God, but love to himself; and what is there unreasonable, or hard, in this? Every thought within us must be brought down, to be brought into obedience to God, if we would walk comfortably with him. We must do this as penitent sinners, in dependence on the Redeemer and his atonement. Blessed be the Lord that he is ever ready to give his grace to the humble, waiting penitent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord? - The people, thus arraigned, bursts in, as men do, with professions that they would be no more ungrateful; that they will do anything, everything - but what they ought. With them it shall be but "Ask and have." They wish only to know, with what they shall come? They would be beforehand with Him, anticipating His wishes; they would, with all the submission of a creature, bow, prostrate themselves before God; they acknowledge His High Majesty, who dwelleth on high, the most High God, and would abase themselves  before His lofty greatness, if they but knew, "how" or "wherewith."<p>They would give of their best; sacrifices the choicest of their kind, which should be wholly His, whole-burnt-offerings, offered exactly according to the law, "bullocks of a year old" <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-2.htm">Leviticus 9:2-3</a>; then too, the next choice offering, the rams; and these, as they were offered for the whole people on very solemn occasions, in vast multitudes, thousands or ten thousands ; the oil which accompanied the burnt sacrifice, should flow in rivers ; nay, more still; they would not withhold their sons, their first born sons, from God, part, as they were, of themselves, or any fruit of their own body.<p>They enhance the offering by naming the tender relation to themselves <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>. They would offer everything, (even what God forbade) excepting only what alone He asked for, their heart, its love and its obedience . The form of their offer contains this; they ask zealously, "with what shall I come." It is an outward offering only, a thing which they would bring. Hypocritical eagerness! a sin against light. For to enquire further, when God has already revealed anything, is to deny that He has revealed it. It comes from the wish that He had not revealed what lie has revealed. : "whose, after he hath found the truth, discusseth anything further, seeketh a lie." God had told them, long before, from the time that He made them His people, what he desired of them; So Micah answers, <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

The people, feeling its need of atonement, anxiously (note the repeated questions) inquires of the prophet how it is to propitiate Jehovah. Bishop Butler, in his Sermon on the Character of Balaam, adopts the view that <span class="ital"><a href="/context/micah/6-6.htm" title="With which shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?...">Micah 6:6-7</a></span> represent the question of Balak, and <span class="ital"><a href="/micah/6-8.htm" title="He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?">Micah 6:8</a></span> the answer of Balaam. This was probably suggested by <a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm" title="Then he took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.">2 Kings 3:27</a>, where it is recorded that the king of Moab offered up his eldest son as a burnt-offering. But the inference is hasty; human sacrifices were one of the abominations of Israel (see below), which most excited the reprobation of the prophets. Bishop Butler, too, had probably not realized the amount of personification which exists in the prophetic writings. It is the people personified which speaks in these two verses (6 and 7).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">The people, awakened to its ingratitude and need of atonement, asks how to please God, and is referred for answer to the moral requirements of the Law.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - It is greatly doubted who is the speaker here. Bishop Butler, in his sermon "Upon the Character of Balaam," adopts the view that Balak is the speaker of vers. 6 and 7, and Balaam answers in ver. 8. Knabenbauer considers Micah himself as the interlocutor, speaking in the character of the people; which makes the apparent change of persons in ver. 8 very awkward. Most commentators, ancient and modern, take the questions in vers. 6 and 7 to be asked by the people personified, though they are not agreed as to the spirit from which they proceed, some thinking that they are uttered in self-righteousness, as if the speakers had done all that and more than could be required of them; others regarding the inquiries as representing a certain acknowledgment of sin and a desire for means of propitiation, though there is exhibited a want of appreciation of the nature of God and of the service which alone is acceptable to him. The latter view is most reasonable, and in accordance with Micah's manner. <span class="cmt_word">Wherewith</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with what offering?

After Amos has thus cut off all hope of deliverance from the ungodly, he repeats, in his own words in <a href="/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>., the threat already exhibited symbolically in <a href="/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1</a>. <a href="/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>. "Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are against the sinful kingdom, and I destroy it from off the face of the earth; except that I shall not utterly destroy the house of Jacob: is the saying of Jehovah. <a href="/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>. For, behold, I command, and shake the house of Israel among all nations, as (corn) is shaken in a sieve, and not even a little grain falls to the ground. <a href="/amos/9-10.htm">Amos 9:10</a>. All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, The evil will not overtake or come to us." The sinful kingdom is Israel; not merely the kingdom of the ten tribes however, but all Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes along with Judah, the house of Jacob or Israel, which is identical with the sons of Israel, who had become like the Cushites, although Amos had chiefly the people and kingdom of the ten tribes in his mind. Bammamla&#770;kha&#770;h, not upon the kingdom, but against the kingdom. The directing of the eye upon an object is expressed by  &#1506;&#1500;  (<a href="/amos/9-4.htm">Amos 9:4</a>) or  &#1488;&#1500;  (cf. <a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a>); whereas  &#1489;  is used in relation to the object upon which anger rests (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>). Because the Lord had turned His eye towards the sinful kingdom, He must exterminate it, - a fate with which Moses had already threatened the nation in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-15.htm">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>. Nevertheless (&#1488;&#1508;&#1505; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, "only that," introducing the limitation, as in <a href="/numbers/13-28.htm">Numbers 13:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-4.htm">Deuteronomy 15:4</a>) the house of Jacob, the covenant nation, shall not be utterly destroyed. The "house of Jacob" is opposed to the "sinful nation;" not, however, so that the antithesis simply lies in the kingdom and people (regnum delebo, non populum), or that the "house of Jacob" signifies the kingdom of Judah as distinguished from the kingdom of the ten tribes, for the "house of Jacob" is perfectly equivalent to the "house of Israel" (<a href="/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>). The house of Jacob is not to be utterly destroyed, but simply to be shaken, as it were, in a sieve. The antithesis lies in the predicate &#1492;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;, the sinful kingdom. So far as Israel, as a kingdom and people, is sinful, it is to be destroyed from off the face of the earth. But there is always a divine kernel in the nation, by virtue of its divine election, a holy seed out of which the Lord will form a new and holy people and kingdom of God. Consequently the destruction will not be a total one, a &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;. The reason for this is introduced by k&#305;&#772; (for) in <a href="/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>. The Lord will shake Israel among the nations, as corn is shaken in a sieve; so that the chaff flies away, and the dust and dirt fall to the ground, and only the good grains are left in the sieve. Such a sieve are the nations of the world, through which Israel is purified from its chaff, i.e., from its ungodly members. Tsero&#772;r, generally a bundle; here, according to its etymology, that which is compact or firm, i.e., solid grain as distinguished from loose chaff. In <a href="/2_samuel/17-13.htm">2 Samuel 17:13</a> it is used in a similar sense to denote a hard piece of clay or a stone in a building. Not a single grain fill fall to the ground, that is to say, not a good man will be lost (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/26-20.htm">1 Samuel 26:20</a>). The self-secure sinners, however, who rely upon their outward connection with the nation of God (compare <a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a> and <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>), or upon their zeal in the outward forms of worship (<a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21</a>.), and fancy that the judgment cannot touch them (&#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;, to come to meet a person round about him, i.e., to come upon him from every side), will all perish by the sword. This threat is repeated at the close, without any formal link of connection with <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>, not only to prevent any abuse of the foregoing modification of the judgment, but also to remove this apparent discrepancy, that whereas in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1-4</a> it is stated that not one will escape the judgment, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>, the nation of Israel is not to be utterly destroyed. In order to anticipate the frivolity of the ungodly, who always flatter themselves with the hope of escaping when there is a threatening of any general calamity, the prophet first of all cuts off all possibilities whatever in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1-4</a>, without mentioning the exceptions; and it is not till afterwards that the promise is introduced that the house of Israel shall not be utterly annihilated, whereby the general threat is limited to sinners, and the prospect of deliverance and preservation through the mercy of God is opened to the righteous. The historical realization or fulfilment of this threat took place, so far as Israel of the ten tribes was concerned, when their kingdom was destroyed by the Assyrians, and in the case of Judah, at the overthrow of the kingdom and temple by the Chaldeans; and the shaking of Israel in the sieve is still being fulfilled upon the Jews who are dispersed among all nations. </body></html>
