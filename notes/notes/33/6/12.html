This voice of the Lord says to all, Hear the rod when it is coming, before you see it, and feel it. Hear the rod when it is come, and you are sensible of the smart; hear what counsels, what cautions it speaks. The voice of God is to be heard in the rod of God. Those who are dishonest in their dealings shall never be reckoned pure, whatever shows of devotion they may make. What is got by fraud and oppression, cannot be kept or enjoyed with satisfaction. What we hold closest we commonly lose soonest. Sin is a root of bitterness, soon planted, but not soon plucked up again. Their being the people of God in name and profession, while they kept themselves in his love, was an honour to them; but now, being backsliders, their having been once the people of God turns to their reproach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the rich men thereof - that is, "of the city, <a href="/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a> are full of violence." It bad been little, had thieves and robbers lived by violence, but now, (as Isaiah at the same time upbraids them,) "her princes were become companions of thieves" <a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>. Not the poor out of distress, but the rich, out of wantonness and exceeding covetousness and love of luxury, not only did wrong but were filled, not so much with riches, as with violence. Violence is the very meat and drink wherewith they are filled, yea, and wherewith they shall be filled, when it is returned upon their heads.<p>And the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies - Fraud is itself lying, and lying is its inseparable companion. Jerome: "Lying followeth the gathering together of riches, and the hard custom to lay up riches hath a deceitful tongue." The sin, he saith, is spread throughout all her inhabitants; that is, all of them, as their custom, have spoken lies, and, even when they speak not, the lie is ready; "their tongue is deceitful (literally, deceit) in their mouth." It is deceit, nothing but deceit, and that, deceit which should "overthrow" and ruin others. One intent on gain has the lie ever ready to be uttered, even when he speaks not. It lurks concealed, until it is needed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The first clause, &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; ... &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, does not harmonize with what follows, inasmuch as we should expect it to be followed with a declaration made by Jehovah Himself, instead of which there follow simply tidings heard from Jehovah. The difficulty cannot be removed by assuming that these introductory words are spurious, or were added by a later prophet (Eichhorn, Ewald, and others); for the interpolator could not fail to observe the incongruity of these words just as well as Obadiah. Moreover, &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; could not be omitted from the opening, because it is required not only by the suffix in &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; (against her), but also by the direct addresses in <a href="/obadiah/1-2.htm">Obadiah 1:2</a>. Nor is the assumption that the prophet suddenly altered the construction any more satisfactory, or that the declaration of Jehovah announced in &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; ("thus saith the Lord") commences in <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-2.htm">Obadiah 1:2</a>, and that the words from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; to the end of the verse form an explanatory parenthesis to &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; ot sisehtnera. For such an alteration of the construction at the very beginning of the address is hardly conceivable; and the parenthetical explanation of the last three clauses of <a href="/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a> is at variance with their contents, which do not form by any means a subordinate thought, but rather the main thought of the following address. No other course remains, therefore, than to take these introductory words by themselves, as Michaelis, Maurer, and Caspari have done, in which case &#1499;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; does not announce the actual words of Jehovah in the stricter sense, but is simply meant to affirm that the prophet uttered what follows jussu Jehovae, or divinitus monitus, so that &#1499;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is really equivalent to diber &#1494;&#1492; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-13.htm">Isaiah 16:13</a>, as Theodoret has explained it. &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;, not "to Edom," but with reference to, or of, Edom. On the occurrence of Yeho&#772;va&#770;h after 'Ado&#772;na&#770;i, see the comm. on <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>. What Obadiah saw as a word of the Lord was the tidings heard from the Lord, and the divine message sent to the nations to rise up for war against Edom. The plural &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (we have heard) is communicative. The prophet includes himself in the nation (Israel), which has heard the tidings in him and through him. This implies that the tidings were of the greatest interest to Israel, and would afford it consolation. Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/49-14.htm">Jeremiah 49:14</a>) has removed the pregnant character of the expression, by introducing the singular &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (I have heard). The next clause, "and an ambassador," etc., might be taken, as it has been by Luther, as a statement of the import of the news, namely, that a messenger had been sent; inasmuch as in Hebrew a sentence is frequently co-ordinated with the preceding one by Vav cop., when it ought really to be subordinated to it so far as the sense is concerned, from a simple preference for the parallelism of the clauses. But the address gains in force, if we take the clause as a co-ordinate one, just as it reads, viz., as a declaration of the steps already taken by the Lord for carrying out the resolution which had been heard of by report. In this case the substance of the report is not given till the last clause of the verse; the summons of the ambassador sent among the nations, "to rise up for war against Edom," indicating at the same time the substance of the report which Israel has heard. The perfect shulla&#770;ch with qa&#770;mets in the pause, which is changed by Jeremiah into the less appropriate passive participle kal, corresponds to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, and expresses in prophetic form the certainty of the accomplishment of the purpose of God. The sending of the messenger (ts&#305;&#772;r as in <a href="/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a>) among the nations (&#1489; as in <a href="/judges/6-35.htm">Judges 6:35</a>) is an assurance that the nations will rise up at the instigation of Jehovah to war against Edom (compare <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>). The plural na&#770;qu&#772;ma&#770;h (let us rise up), in the words of the messenger, may be explained on the simple ground that the messenger speaks in the name of the sender. The sender is Jehovah, who will also rise up along with the nations for war against Edom, placing Himself at their head as leader and commander (compare <a href="/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4-5</a>). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;, against Edom, construed as a land or kingdom, gener. faem. The fact that it is the nations generally that are here summoned to make war upon Edom, and not only one nation in particular, points at once to the fact that Edom is regarded as a type of the power of the world, and its hostility to God, the destruction of which is here foretold. </body></html>
