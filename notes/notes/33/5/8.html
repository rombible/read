But to those who neglected or opposed this salvation, they would, as lions, cause terror, their doctrine condemning them. The Lord also declares that he would cause not only the reformation of the Jews, but the purification of the Christian church. In like manner shall we be assured of victory in our personal conflicts, as we simply depend upon the Lord our salvation, worship him, and serve him with diligence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the remnant of Jacob shall be as a young lion - o: "What more unlike than the sweetness of the dew and the fierceness of the lion? What so different as the gentle shower distilling on the herb, and the savageness or vehemence of a lion roaring among "the flocks of sheeps?" Yet both are ascribed to "the remnant of Jacob." Why? Because the Apostles of Christ are both tender and severe, tender in teaching and exhorting, severe in rebuking and avenging. How does Paul teach, "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation; now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God!" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19-6:11</a>. What sweeter than the dew of love, the shower of true affection? And so, on to that, "our heart is enlarged." They are such drops of dew as no one could doubt came from "the Lord, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort" <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>.<p>Yet the same Apostle after a little writes, "This is the third time I am coming to you. I told you before and foretell you, and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all others, that if I come again, I will not spare, since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1-3</a>. See the severity of a master, like the roaring of "a lion among the beasts of the forest." For such surely are they whom he rebukes for the <a href="/2_corinthians/12-21.htm">2 Corinthians 12:21</a> uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they had committed. Was he not to such as a lion? <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2-5</a>? Was not Peter such, when he rebuked Ananias first and then Sapphira his wife, and they fell down and gave up the ghost? They tread down or "cast down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God" <a href="/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>; as Christ Himself, who spake in them, is both a lamb and the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>, and nothing is so terrible as "the wrath of the Lamb" <a href="/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a>.<p>And none can deliver - Dionysius: "For as the Apostles past from nation to nation, and trod down paganism, subduing it to Christ, and taking within their net the many converted nations, none could withdraw from the Apostles' doctrine those whom they had converted." The pagan world  "cried out that the state is beset, that the Christians are in their fields, their forts, their islands." : "We are a people of yesterday, and yet we have filled every place belonging to you, cities, islands, castles, towns, assemblies, your very camp, your tribes, companies, palace, senate, forum!

Judah will be "as as lion," not in respect to its cruelty, but in its power of striking terror into all opponents.

The same persons are meant here as before; who are compared to dew and showers of rain, because numerous; and full of blessings in themselves, and useful and beneficial to others: and here are said to be <p>as a lion among the beasts of the forest; strong, mighty, powerful, and courageous, and superior to their enemies, as the lion is strongest among beasts, and keeps all others in awe of him. Some refer this to the times of the Maccabees; when Judas and his brethren behaved with great fortitude and courage, and were victorious, and prevailed over the armies of Antiochus, and others; but it seems rather to belong to the latter day, when the Jews shall be superior to their enemies the Turks, who would disturb them in the possession of their land: and shall be a terror to them, <p>as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; signifying that their enemies shall be no more to them, and no more able to oppose them, than a flock of sheep are to a young lion, or they to resist him The design of the metaphor is; not to signify the harmlessness and innocence of their enemies, but their weakness, and the strength and courage of them; <p>who, if he go through; the flock: on whatsoever he seizes, <p>both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver; brings it to the ground at once, tramples upon it, and tears it in pieces as its prey; and none in the flock, or to whom it belongs, can deliver out of his hand. This will be the case when the Jews shall turn to the Lord, and the Lion of the tribe of Judah shall be at the head of them; though some interpret this of the first times of the Gospel, and take it to be fulfilled in the apostles and first ministers of the word, who were Jews; and who were valiant defenders of truth, and conquerors over the devil and the world, and were the instruments of bringing many into subjection to Christ; but it seems best to apply it to the last times, and not to the converted Jews only, though in the first place; but to all the, spiritual Israel of God, the whole Christian church, which will then be in such happy circumstances. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/micah/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Secondly, Israel shall be a terrible power among the nations, and invincible in strength.

And they will reel from sea to sea; and from the north, and even to the east, they sweep round to seek the word of Jehovah, and will not find it." The bitterness of the time of punishment is increased by the fact that the Lord will then withdrawn His word from them, i.e., the light of His revelation. They who will not now hear His word, as proclaimed by the prophets, will then cherish the greatest longing for it. Such hunger and thirst will be awakened by the distress and affliction that will come upon them. The intensity of this desire is depicted in <a href="/amos/8-12.htm">Amos 8:12</a>. They reel (&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; as in <a href="/amos/4-8.htm">Amos 4:8</a>) from the sea to the sea; that is to say, not "from the Dead Sea in the east to the Mediterranean in the west," for <a href="/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a> are not cases in point, as the two seas are defined there by distinct epithets; but as in <a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>, according to which the meaning is, from the sea to where the sea occurs again, at the other end of the world, "the sea being taken as the boundary of the earth" (Hupfeld).
