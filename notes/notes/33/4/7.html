But very precious promises these are, relating to the gospel church, which will be more and more fulfilled, for He is faithful that has promised. There shall be a glorious church for God set up in the world, in the last days, in the days of the Messiah. Christ himself will build it upon a rock. The Gentiles worshipped their idol gods; but in the period spoken of, the people will cleave to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and delight in doing his will. The word halteth, describes those who walk not according to the Divine word. The collecting the captives from Babylon was an earnest of healing, purifying, and prospering the church; and the reign of Christ shall continue till succeeded by the everlasting kingdom of heaven. Let us stir up each other to attend the ordinances of God, that we may learn his holy ways, and walk in them, receiving the law from his hands, which, being written in our hearts by his Spirit, may show our interest in the Redeemer's righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And her that was cast off a strong nation - The prophecy, that there should be a remnant, was depressing. Yet what a remnant should it be! A remnant, which should multiply like the stars of heaven or the sand on the sea-shore. Israel had never been "a strong nation," as a kingdom of this world. At its best estate, under David, it had subdued the petty nations around it, who were confederated to destroy it. It had never competed with the powers of this world, East or West, Egypt or Nineveh, although God had at times marvelously saved it from being swallowed up by them. Now, the remnant of Judah, which itself was but a remnant of the undivided people, was to become "a strong nation." So Isaiah prophesied, "A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation" <a href="/isaiah/60-22.htm">Isaiah 60:22</a>. Plainly not in temporal greatness, both because human strength was not, and could not be, its characteristic, and because the prophet had been speaking of spiritual restoration.<p>: "'Strong' are they, whom neither torture nor allurements can separate from the love of Christ." "Strong are they, who are strong against themselves." Strong were they who said,<p>"We ought to obey God rather than men <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>, and, "who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us" <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-35.htm">Romans 8:35</a>, <a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>. God does not only restore in the Gospel; He multiplies exceedingly. Rup.: "I will so clothe her with the spirit of might, that, as she shall be fruitful in number, so shall she be glorious in victories, so that of her it shall be said, "who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, terrible as an army with banners?" Sol 6:10. For, not to name those, whose whole life is one warfare against invisible enemies and the evil desires of the flesh, who shall count the martyrs of Christ? We know that that "remnant" and "strong nation" owe wholly to grace all which they are, as they themselves in the Revelations give thanks; "Thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by Thy Blood, out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation, and hast made us unto our God kings and priests, and we shall reign on the earth" <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9-10</a>; that same Lord, of whom it is here said,<p>The Lord shall reign over them in Zion from henceforth even forever - The visible kingdom of God in Judah was often obscured, kings, princes, priests, and false prophets combining to encourage one another in rebellion against God. In the captivity it even underwent an almost total eclipse by the over-shadowing of earthly power, save when the divine light flashed forth for an instant in the deeds or words of power and wisdom, related by Daniel. "Henceforth," that is, from the time, when the law should go forth out of Zion, God should indeed reign, and that kingdom should have no end. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

As commonly, the restoration from captivity and the privileges of Messiah's kingdom are combined in one foreshortened view.

"I am no prophet," sc. by profession, "and no prophet's son," i.e., not a pupil or member of the prophets' schools, one who has been trained to prophesy (on these schools, see the comm. on <a href="/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>); but (according to my proper calling) a bo&#772;qe&#772;r, lit., a herdsman of oxen (from ba&#770;qa&#770;r); then in a broader sense, a herdsman who tends the sheep (&#1510;&#1488;&#1503;), a shepherd; and a bo&#772;le&#772;s shiqm&#305;&#772;m, i.e., one who plucks sycamores or mulberry-figs, and lives upon them. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. bo&#772;le&#772;s is a denom. from the Arabic name for the mulberry-fig, and signifies to gather mulberry-figs and live upon them; like &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; and &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, i.e., according to Hesych. &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, to eat figs. The rendering of the lxx &#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, Vulg. vellicans, points to the fact that it was a common custom to nip or scratch the mulberry-figs, in order to make them ripen (see Theophr. Hist. plant. iv. 2; Plin. Hist. nat. 13, 14; and Bochart, Hieroz. i. 384, or p. 406 ed. Ros.); but this cannot be shown to be the true meaning of bo&#772;le&#772;s. And even if the idea of nipping were implied in the word bo&#772;le&#772;s, it would by no means follow that the possession of a mulberry plantation was what was intended, as many commentators have inferred; for "the words contain an allusion to the 'eating of bread' referred to in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-12.htm">Amos 7:12</a>, and the fruit is mentioned here as the ordinary food of the shepherds, who lived at the pasture grounds, and to whom bread may have been a rarity" (Hitzig). From this calling, which afforded him a livelihood, the Lord had called him away to prophesy to His people Israel; so that whoever forbade him to do so, set himself in opposition to the Lord God. </body></html>
