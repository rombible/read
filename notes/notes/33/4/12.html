Then the Lord declared that the Assyrian king was but His instrument in all he had done; so that when he presumed to arrogate to himself the glory of his victories, the Lord revoked his commission: “I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou carnest.” And so it came to pass.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/micah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:9-13 Many nations would assemble against Zion to rejoice in her calamities. They would not understand that the Lord had collected them as sheaves are gathered to be threshed; and that Zion would be strengthened to beat them to pieces. Nothing has yet taken place in the history of the Jewish church agreeing with this prediction. When God has conquering work for his people to do, he will furnish them with strength and ability for it.

They think that they strengthen themselves, as they gather together; God sees them but as ripened and fitted for destruction, gathered into one bundle together, to perish together. God gathers them, not by constraint or force, but by giving free scope to their own wayward wills, and overruling these to His ends. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. thoughts of the Lord&#8212;Their unsearchable wisdom, overruling seeming disaster to the final good of His people, is the very ground on which the restoration of Israel hereafter (of which the restoration from Babylon is a type) is based in Isa 55:8; compare with Mic 4:3, 12, 13, which prove that Israel, not merely the Christian Church, is the ultimate subject of the prophecy; also in Ro 11:13.

The Hebrew is singular, "sheaf." However great the numbers of the foe, they are all but as one sheaf ready to be threshed [Calvin]. Threshing was done by treading with the feet: hence the propriety of the image for treading under foot and breaking asunder the foe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/micah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But they, </span> the gathered confederate nations, Zion’s enemies, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">know not, </span> neither discern nor consider, the thoughts of the Lord; the design of the holy, just, gracious, and faithful God, who is the God of his people, of Israel; who will humble, but not extirpate; who will purify by, but not consume in, the furnace; God’s thoughts to Israel are, to give him an expected end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither understand they his counsel; </span> the same thing in somewhat different phrase: this elegancy is ever added to confirm the thing foretold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He shall gather them; </span> by his secret, just, and effectual providence disposing all things to facilitate their gathering together, that they shall do, and yet God also shall do it; he as the first cause, they as the second; he moves according to his own pleasure, they move as they are second and dependent agents; they shall as a fire purge out the dross, or as a wind blow away the chaff and lightest corn, which is that God intendeth; but they consult only to extinguish the people, to cut them off that they be no moro a nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As the sheaves into the floor; </span> a plain and very intelligible simile.

Which are very different from theirs: the thoughts and designs of the enemies of Zion, in the times of the Maccabees, were, to destroy utterly the people of God, and root them out of the earth, and abolish their religion and worship; but the intentions of God were to defeat them, and bring them to ruin: the views of the kings of the earth, being stirred up by unclean spirits to the battle of Almighty God, will be to extirpate the interest and kingdom of Christ; but the end of the Lord, in suffering them to be gathered together, will be utterly and totally to destroy them; and the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand, and the thoughts of his heart, to all generations.

The metaphor is carried on in the next verse. Various are the explanations of the prophet's reference in this prophecy. Many commentators see in it a reference to the destruction of the army of Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>); others discern a defeat of the Scythians after the return from captivity; others, again, place it in the times of the Maccabees; and others interpret it of the defeat of the mystical adversaries of God's Church adumbrated in <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12.htm">Zechariah 12</a>; and <a href="/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20</a>. But the prophet has not one definite event in view, but looks forward to the general conflict between the powers of the world and the Church, of which the historical events and material enemies were the types. Certain historical circumstances may exactly suit the prediction, but they do not exhaust it. And indeed we do wrong to seek for minute and definite fulfilment of particular predictions. Such utterances are often conditional and are modified by subsequent circumstances. The prophets are concerned with great moral truths and the righteous government of the world, and are not always to be interpreted with literal exactness. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Vision of a Basket of Ripe Fruit. - <a href="/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1</a>. "Thus did the Lord Jehovah show me: and behold a basket with ripe fruit. <a href="/amos/8-2.htm">Amos 8:2</a>. And He said, What seest thou, Amos? And I said, A basket of ripe fruit. Then Jehovah said to me, The end is come to my people Israel; I will not pass by them any more. <a href="/amos/8-3.htm">Amos 8:3</a>. And the songs of the palace will yell in that day, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah: corpses in multitude; in every place hath He cast them forth: Hush!" &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; from &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, to lay hold of, to grasp, lit., a receiver, here a basket (of basket-work), in <a href="/jeremiah/5-27.htm">Jeremiah 5:27</a> a bird-cage. &#1511;&#1497;&#1509;: summer-fruit (see at <a href="/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1</a>); in <a href="/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-4.htm">Isaiah 28:4</a>, the gathering of fruit, hence ripe fruit. The basket of ripe fruit (qayits) is thus explained by the Lord: the end (qe&#772;ts) is come to my people (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/7-6.htm">Ezekiel 7:6</a>). Consequently the basket of ripe fruit is a figurative representation of the nation that is now ripe for judgment, although qe&#772;ts, the end, does not denote its ripeness for judgment, but its destruction, and the word qe&#772;ts is simply chosen to form a paronomasia with qayits. &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; as in <a href="/amos/7-8.htm">Amos 7:8</a>. All the joy shall be turned into mourning. the thought is not that the temple-singing to the praise of God (<a href="/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>) would be turned into yelling, but that the songs of joy (<a href="/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>) would be turned into yells, i.e., into sounds of lamentation (cf. <a href="/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a> and 1 Maccabees 9:41), namely, because of the multitude of the dead which lay upon the ground on every side. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; is not impersonal, in the sense of "which men are no longer able to bury on account of their great number, and therefore cast away in quiet places on every side;" but Jehovah is to be regarded as the subject, viz., which God has laid prostrate, or cast to the ground on every side. For the adverbial use of &#1492;&#1505; cannot be established. The word is an interjection here, as in <a href="/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>; and the exclamation, Hush! is not a sign of gloomy despair, but an admonition to bow beneath the overwhelming severity of the judgment of God, as in <a href="/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a> (cf. <a href="/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a> and <a href="/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>). </body></html>
