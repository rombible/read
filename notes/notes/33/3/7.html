How seldom do wholesome truths reach the ears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceive others are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet had ardent love to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his glory and their salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met with did not drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and of himself, but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those who act honestly, may act boldly.

The Locusts. - <a href="/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>. "Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me; and, behold, He formed locusts in the beginning of the springing up of the second crop; and, behold, it was a second crop after the king's mowing. <a href="/amos/7-2.htm">Amos 7:2</a>. And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the vegetable of the land, I said, Lord Jehovah, forgive, I:pray: how can Jacob stand? for he is small. <a href="/amos/7-3.htm">Amos 7:3</a>. Jehovah repented of this: It shall not take place, saith Jehovah." The formula, "Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me," is common to this and the three following visions (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-4.htm">Amos 7:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a>, and <a href="/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1</a>), with this trifling difference, that in the third (<a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a>) the subject (the Lord Jehovah) is omitted, and 'Ado&#772;na&#770;i (the Lord) is inserted instead, after vehinne&#772;h (and behold). &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; denotes seeing with the eyes of the mind - a visionary seeing. These visions are not merely pictures of a judgment which was ever threatening, and drawing nearer and nearer (Baur); still less are they merely poetical fictions, or forms of drapery selected arbitrarily, for the purpose of clothing the prophet's thoughts; but they are inward intuitions, produced by the Spirit of God, which set forth the punitive judgments of God. Ko&#772;h (ita, thus) points to what follows, and vehinne&#772;h (and behold) introduces the thing seen. Amos sees the Lord form locusts. Baur proposes to alter &#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512; (forming) into &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; (forms), but without any reason, and without observing that in all three visions of this chapter hinne&#772;h is followed by a participle (&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-4.htm">Amos 7:4</a>, and &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; in <a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a>), and that the 'Ado&#772;na&#770;i which stands before &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; in <a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a> shows very clearly that this noun is simply omitted in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>, because 'Ado&#772;na&#770;I Yeho&#772;va&#770;h has immediately preceded it. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497; (a poetical form for &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;, analogous to &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; for &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, and contracted into &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; in <a href="/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>) signifies locusts, the only question being, whether this meaning is derived from &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;  equals  Arab. ja&#770;b, to cut, or from &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;  equals  Arab. jb&#8219;a, to creep forth (out of the earth). The fixing of the time has an important bearing upon the meaning of the vision: viz., "at the beginning of the springing up of the second crop (of grass);" especially when taken in connection with the explanation, "after the mowings of the king." These definitions cannot be merely intended as outward chronological data. For, in the first place, nothing is known of the existence of any right or prerogative on the part of the kings of Israel, to have the early crop in the meadow land throughout the country mown for the support of their horses and mules (<a href="/1_kings/18-5.htm">1 Kings 18:5</a>), so that their subjects could only get the second crop for their own cattle. Moreover, if the second crop, "after the king's mowings," were to be interpreted literally in this manner, it would decidedly weaken the significance of the vision. For if the locusts did not appear till after the king had got in the hay for the supply of his own mews, and so only devoured the second crop of grass as it grew, this plague would fall upon the people alone, and not at all upon the king. But such an exemption of the king from the judgment is evidently at variance with the meaning of this and the following visions. Consequently the definition of the time must be interpreted spiritually, in accordance with the idea of the vision. The king, who has had the early grass mown, is Jehovah; and the mowing of the grass denotes the judgments which Jehovah has already executed upon Israel. The growing of the second crop is a figurative representation of the prosperity which flourished again after those judgments; in actual fact, therefore, it denotes the time when the dawn had risen again for Israel (<a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). Then the locusts came and devoured all the vegetables of the earth. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is not the second crop; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489; does not mean grass, but vegetables, the plants of the field (see at <a href="/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11</a>). <a href="/amos/7-2.htm">Amos 7:2</a> and <a href="/amos/7-3.htm">Amos 7:3</a> require that this meaning should be retained. When the locusts had already eaten the vegetables of the earth, the prophet interceded, and the Lord interposed with deliverance. This intercession would have been too late after the consumption of the second crop. On the other hand, when the vegetables had been consumed, there was still reason to fear that the consumption of the second crop of grass would follow; and this is averted at the prophet's intercession. &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; for &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, as in <a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-11.htm">Jeremiah 37:11</a>, etc. &#1505;&#1500;&#1495;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488;, pray forgive, sc. the guilt of the people (cf. <a href="/numbers/14-19.htm">Numbers 14:19</a>). &#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, how (&#1502;&#1497; qualis) can Jacob (the nation of Israel) stand (not arise), since it is small? &#1511;&#1496;&#1503;, small, i.e., so poor in sources and means of help, that it cannot endure this stroke; not "so crushed already, that a very light calamity would destroy it" (Rosenmller). for &#1504;&#1495;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;, see <a href="/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>. &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; (this) refers to the destruction of the people indicated in &#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;; and &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; is also to be supplied as the subject to &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;. </body></html>
