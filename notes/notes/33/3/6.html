How seldom do wholesome truths reach the ears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceive others are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet had ardent love to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his glory and their salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met with did not drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and of himself, but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those who act honestly, may act boldly.

The false prophets had promised peace, light, brightness, prosperity; the night of trouble, anguish, darkness, fear, shall Come upon them. So shall they no more dare to speak in the Name of God, while He was by His judgments speaking the contrary in a way which all must hear. They abused God's gifts and long-suffering against Himself: they could misinterpret His long-suffering into favor, and they did it: their visions of the future were but the reflections of the present and its continuance; they thought that because God was enduring, He was indifferent, and they took His government out of His Hands, and said, that what He appeared to be now, He would ever be. They had no other light, no other foresight. When then the darkness of temporal calamity enveloped them, it shrouded in one common darkness of night all present brightness and all sight of the future.<p>Rup.: "After Caiaphas had in heart spoken falsehood and a prophecy of blood, although God overruled it to truth which he meant not, all grace of prophecy departed <a href="/matthew/11-13.htm">Matthew 11:13</a>. The law and the prophets prophesied until John. "The Sun of Righteousness went down over them," inwardly and outwardly, withdrawing the brightness of His Providence and the inward light of grace." So Christ Himself forewarned; "Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you" <a href="/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a>. And so it has remained ever since <a href="/2_corinthians/3-15.htm">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>. The veil has been on their hearts. The light is in all the world, but they see it not; it arose to lighten the Gentiles, but they walk on still in darkness. As opposed to holiness, truth, knowledge, divine enlightening of the mind, bright gladness, contrariwise darkness is falsehood, sin, error, blindness of soul, ignorance of divine things, and sorrow. In all these ways, did the Sun go down "over them," so that the darkness weighed heavily upon them. So too the inventors of heresies pretend to see and to enter into the mysteries of Christ, yet find darkness instead of light, lose even what they think they see, fail even of what truth they seem most to hold; and they shall be in night and darkness, being cast into outer darkness <a href="/1_corinthians/8-12.htm">1 Corinthians 8:12</a>; sinning against the brethren, and wounding the weak conscience of those for whom Christ died. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. night &#8230; dark&#8212;Calamities shall press on you so overwhelming as to compel you to cease pretending to divine (Zec 13:4).

Not that those outward gifts and illuminations, and that prophetic light they had, or seemed to have should be taken away from them, and it should be quite a night with them; because these men were never sent of God, or received any message from him, or had any prophetic talents at all, and therefore could not be taken away from them, and they be benighted in this sense; though, it is true, such might be the circumstances they would be brought into, that it should appear to the people that they are the dark persons they were, that they have no vision, nor never had any; but rather the sense is, that such dark providences and dreadful calamities should come upon the people in general, and upon those prophets in particular, often signified by "night" in Scripture, that they would not have the face to pretend any more that they had any vision from God of good times and things. It may be rendered, "therefore night shall be unto you because of vision" (c); calamity should come upon them because of their false and pretended visions of peace and prosperity they deluded the people with: <p>and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; such darkness of affliction should be upon them, that they would not offer to deliver out any divination or prediction of good things coming upon them; or such darkness and distress would be their portion "because of divination" (d), on account of their lying divinations they had imposed upon the people: <p>and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them; their time of prosperity will be over, and they shall be no more in favour with the people, or courted and feasted by them; but shall be had in the utmost contempt and abhorrence.

The Locusts. - <a href="/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>. "Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me; and, behold, He formed locusts in the beginning of the springing up of the second crop; and, behold, it was a second crop after the king's mowing. <a href="/amos/7-2.htm">Amos 7:2</a>. And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the vegetable of the land, I said, Lord Jehovah, forgive, I:pray: how can Jacob stand? for he is small. <a href="/amos/7-3.htm">Amos 7:3</a>. Jehovah repented of this: It shall not take place, saith Jehovah." The formula, "Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me," is common to this and the three following visions (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-4.htm">Amos 7:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a>, and <a href="/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1</a>), with this trifling difference, that in the third (<a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a>) the subject (the Lord Jehovah) is omitted, and 'Ado&#772;na&#770;i (the Lord) is inserted instead, after vehinne&#772;h (and behold). &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; denotes seeing with the eyes of the mind - a visionary seeing. These visions are not merely pictures of a judgment which was ever threatening, and drawing nearer and nearer (Baur); still less are they merely poetical fictions, or forms of drapery selected arbitrarily, for the purpose of clothing the prophet's thoughts; but they are inward intuitions, produced by the Spirit of God, which set forth the punitive judgments of God. Ko&#772;h (ita, thus) points to what follows, and vehinne&#772;h (and behold) introduces the thing seen. Amos sees the Lord form locusts. Baur proposes to alter &#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512; (forming) into &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; (forms), but without any reason, and without observing that in all three visions of this chapter hinne&#772;h is followed by a participle (&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-4.htm">Amos 7:4</a>, and &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; in <a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a>), and that the 'Ado&#772;na&#770;i which stands before &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; in <a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a> shows very clearly that this noun is simply omitted in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>, because 'Ado&#772;na&#770;I Yeho&#772;va&#770;h has immediately preceded it. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497; (a poetical form for &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;, analogous to &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; for &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, and contracted into &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; in <a href="/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>) signifies locusts, the only question being, whether this meaning is derived from &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;  equals  Arab. ja&#770;b, to cut, or from &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;  equals  Arab. jb&#8219;a, to creep forth (out of the earth). The fixing of the time has an important bearing upon the meaning of the vision: viz., "at the beginning of the springing up of the second crop (of grass);" especially when taken in connection with the explanation, "after the mowings of the king." These definitions cannot be merely intended as outward chronological data. For, in the first place, nothing is known of the existence of any right or prerogative on the part of the kings of Israel, to have the early crop in the meadow land throughout the country mown for the support of their horses and mules (<a href="/1_kings/18-5.htm">1 Kings 18:5</a>), so that their subjects could only get the second crop for their own cattle. Moreover, if the second crop, "after the king's mowings," were to be interpreted literally in this manner, it would decidedly weaken the significance of the vision. For if the locusts did not appear till after the king had got in the hay for the supply of his own mews, and so only devoured the second crop of grass as it grew, this plague would fall upon the people alone, and not at all upon the king. But such an exemption of the king from the judgment is evidently at variance with the meaning of this and the following visions. Consequently the definition of the time must be interpreted spiritually, in accordance with the idea of the vision. The king, who has had the early grass mown, is Jehovah; and the mowing of the grass denotes the judgments which Jehovah has already executed upon Israel. The growing of the second crop is a figurative representation of the prosperity which flourished again after those judgments; in actual fact, therefore, it denotes the time when the dawn had risen again for Israel (<a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). Then the locusts came and devoured all the vegetables of the earth. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is not the second crop; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489; does not mean grass, but vegetables, the plants of the field (see at <a href="/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11</a>). <a href="/amos/7-2.htm">Amos 7:2</a> and <a href="/amos/7-3.htm">Amos 7:3</a> require that this meaning should be retained. When the locusts had already eaten the vegetables of the earth, the prophet interceded, and the Lord interposed with deliverance. This intercession would have been too late after the consumption of the second crop. On the other hand, when the vegetables had been consumed, there was still reason to fear that the consumption of the second crop of grass would follow; and this is averted at the prophet's intercession. &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; for &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, as in <a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-11.htm">Jeremiah 37:11</a>, etc. &#1505;&#1500;&#1495;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488;, pray forgive, sc. the guilt of the people (cf. <a href="/numbers/14-19.htm">Numbers 14:19</a>). &#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, how (&#1502;&#1497; qualis) can Jacob (the nation of Israel) stand (not arise), since it is small? &#1511;&#1496;&#1503;, small, i.e., so poor in sources and means of help, that it cannot endure this stroke; not "so crushed already, that a very light calamity would destroy it" (Rosenmller). for &#1504;&#1495;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;, see <a href="/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>. &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; (this) refers to the destruction of the people indicated in &#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;; and &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; is also to be supplied as the subject to &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;. </body></html>
