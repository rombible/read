How seldom do wholesome truths reach the ears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceive others are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet had ardent love to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his glory and their salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met with did not drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and of himself, but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those who act honestly, may act boldly. And those who come to hear the word of God, must be willing to be told of their faults, must take it kindly, and be thankful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who hate the good and love the evil - that is, they hate, for its own sake, that which is good, and love that which is evil. The prophet is not here speaking of their "hating good" men, or "loving evil" men, but of their hating goodness and loving wickedness . : "It is sin not to love good; what guilt to hate it! it is faulty, not to flee from evil, what ungodliness to love it!" Man, at first, loves and admires the good, even while he cloth it not; he hates the evil, even while he does it, or as soon as he has done it. But man cannot bear to he at strife with his conscience, and so he ends it, by excusing himself and telling lies to himself. And then, he hates the truth or good with a bitter hatred, because it disturbs the darkness of the false peace with which he would envelop himself. At first, men love only the pleasure connected with the evil; then they make whom they can, evil, because goodness is a reproach to them: in the end, they love evil for its own sake <a href="/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>. pagan morality too distinguished between the incontinent and the unprincipled , the man who sinned under force of temptation, and the man who had lost the sense of right and wrong <a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>. "Everyone that doeth evil, hateth the light. Whoso longeth for things unlawful, hateth the righteousness which rebuketh and punisheth" .<p>Who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones - He had described the Good Shepherd; now, in contrast, he describes those who ought to be "shepherds of the people," to feed, guard, direct them, but who were their butchers; who did not shear them, but flayed them; who fed on them, not fed them. He heaps up their guilt, act by act. First they flay, that is, take away their outer goods; then they break their bones in pieces, the most solid parts, on which the whole frame of their body depends, to get at the very marrow of their life, and so feed themselves upon them. And not unlike, though still more fearfully, do they sin, who first remove the skin, as it were, or outward tender fences of God's graces; (such as is modesty, in regard to inward purity; outward demeanor, of inward virtue; outward forms, of inward devotion;) and so break the strong bones of the sterner virtues, which hold the whole soul together; and with them the whole flesh, or softer graces, becomes one shapeless mass, shred to pieces and consumed. So Ezekiel says; "Woe to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves; should not the shepherds feed the flock? Ye eat the fat and ye clothe you, with the wool, ye kill them that are fed, ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened ..."

So the Targum, <p>"who spoil the substance of my people, and their precious mammon they take from them;'' <p>and what aggravated their guilt was, that they were the Lord's people by profession and religion they so used; whom he had committed to their care to rule over, protect, and defend: <p>and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron: did with them as cooks do, who not only cut flesh off the bones, and into slices, but break the bones themselves, to get out the marrow, and chop them small, that they may have all the virtue that is in them, to make their soup and broth the richer; by which is signified, that these wicked and avaricious rulers took every method to squeeze the people, and get all their wealth and riches into their hands, that they might have in a more riotous and luxurious manner. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/micah/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The idea of the last verse is repeated here with more emphasis.

"Do horses indeed run upon the rock, or do men plough (there) with oxen, that ye turn justice into poison, and the fruit of the righteousness into wormwood? <a href="/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>. They who rejoice over what is worthless, who say: with our strength we make ourselves horns! <a href="/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>. For, behold, I raise over you, O house of Israel, is the saying of Jehovah, the God of hosts, a nation; and they will oppress you from the territory of Hamath to the brook of the desert." To explain the threat in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>, Amos now calls attention in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>, under two different similes, to the perversity with which the haughty magnates of Israel, who turn right into bitter wrong, imagine that they can offer a successful resistance, or bid defiance with their own strength to the enemy, whom the Lord will raise up as the executor of His judgment. The perversion of right into its opposite can no more bring salvation than horses can run upon rocks, or any one plough upon such a soil with oxen. In the second question &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506; (on the rock) is to be repeated from the first, as the majority of commentators suppose. But the two questions are not to be taken in connection with the previous verse in the sense of "Ye will no more be able to avert this destruction than horses can run upon rocks," etc. (Chr. B. Mich.). They belong to what follows, and are meant to expose the moral perversity of the unrighteous conduct of the wicked. For &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, see <a href="/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a>; and for &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a>. The impartial administration of justice is called the "fruit of righteousness," on account of the figurative use of the terms darnel and wormwood. These great men, however, rejoice thereby in &#1500;&#1488; &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, "a nothing," or a thing which has no existence. What the prophet refers to may be seen from the parallel clause, viz., their imaginary strength (cho&#772;zeq). They rested this hope upon the might with which Jeroboam had smitten the Syrians, and restored the ancient boundaries of the kingdom. From this might they would take to themselves (la&#770;qach, to take, not now for the first time to create, or ask of God) the horns, to thrust down all their foes. Horns are signs and symbols of power (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>); here they stand for the military resources, with which they fancied that they could conquer every foe. These delusions of God-forgetting pride the prophet casts down, by saying that Jehovah the God of hosts will raise up a nation against them, which will crush them down in the whole length and breadth of the kingdom. This nation was Assyria. K&#305;&#772; hinne&#772;h (for behold) is repeated from <a href="/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>; and the threat in <a href="/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a> is thereby described as the resumption and confirmation of the threat expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>, although the k&#305;&#772; is connected with the perversity condemned in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>, of trusting in their own power. La&#770;chats, to oppress, to crush down. On the expression &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;, as a standing epithet for the northern boundary of the kingdom of Israel, see <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>.
