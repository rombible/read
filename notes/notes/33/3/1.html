How seldom do wholesome truths reach the ears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceive others are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet had ardent love to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his glory and their salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met with did not drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and of himself, but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those who act honestly, may act boldly. And those who come to hear the word of God, must be willing to be told of their faults, must take it kindly, and be thankful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I said - God's love for us is the great incitement, constrainer, vivifier of His creature's love. Micah had just spoken of God's love of Israel; how He would gather them into one fold under One Shepherd, guard them, lead them, remove all difficulties before them, be Himself their Head and enable them to follow Him. He turns then to them. These are God's doings; this, God has in store for you hereafter. Even when mercy itself shall require chastisement, He doth not cast off forever. The desolation is but the forerunner of future mercy. What then do ye? The prophet appeals to them, class by class. There was one general corruption of every order of men, through whom Judah could be preserved, princes <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1-4</a>, prophets <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5-7</a>, priests <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>. The salt had lost its savor; wherewith could it be seasoned? whereby could the decaying mass of the people be kept from entire corruption?<p>Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel - He arraigns them by the same name, under which He had first promised mercy. He had first promised mercy to all Jacob and the remnant of Israel. So now he upraids the "heads of Jacob, and the princes of the house of Israel," lest they should deceive themselves. At the same time he recalls them to the deeds of their father. Judah had succeeded to the birthright, forfeited by Reuben, Simeon and Levi; and in Judah all the promises of the Messiah were laid up. But he was not like the three great patriarchs, the father of the faithful (Abraham), or the meek Isaac, or the much-tried Jacob. The name then had not the reminiscences, or force of appeal, contained in the titles, seed of Abraham, or Isaac, or Israel.<p>Is it not for you to know judgment? - It is a great increase of guilt, when persons neglect or pervert what it is their special duty and office to guard; as when teachers corrupt doctrine, or preachers give in to a low standard of morals, or judges pervert judgment. The "princes" here spoken or are so named from judging, "deciding"  causes. They are the same its the "rulers," whom Isaiah at the same time upbraids, as being, from their sins, rulers of Sodom , whose hands were full of blood <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>. They who do not right, in time cease, in great measure, to know it. As God withdraws His grace, the mind is darkened and can no longer see it. So it is said of Eli's sons, they were sons of Belial, they knew not the Lord <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a>; and, Into a malicious soul Wisdom shall not enter, nor dwell in a body that is subject unto sin (Wisd. 1:4). Such , "attain not to know the judgments of God which are a great deep: and the depth of His justice the evil mind findeth not." But if men will not "know judgment" by doing it, they shall by suffering it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>Mic 3:1-12.

"The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by Himself, is the saying of Jehovah, the God of hosts: I abhor the pride of Jacob, and his palaces I hate; and give up the city, and the fulness thereof. <a href="/amos/6-9.htm">Amos 6:9</a>. And it will come to pass, if then men are left in a house, they shall die. <a href="/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>. And when his cousin lifts him up, and he that burieth him, to carry out the bones out of the house, and saith to the one in the hindermost corner of the house, Is there still any one with thee? and he says, Not one; then will he say, Hush; for the name of Jehovah is not to be invoked. <a href="/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>. For, behold, Jehovah commandeth, and men smite the great house to ruins, and the small house into shivers." In order to show the secure debauchees the terrible severity of the judgments of God, the Lord announces to His people with a solemn oath the rejection of the nation which is so confident in its own power (cf. <a href="/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). The oath runs here as in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>, with this exception, that instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; we have &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; in the same sense; for the nephesh of Jehovah, His inmost being or self, is His holiness. &#1502;&#1514;&#1488;&#1489;, with the guttural softened, for &#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489;. The participle describes the abhorrence as a continued lasting feeling, and not a merely passing emotion. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, the loftiness or pride of Jacob, i.e., everything of which Jacob is proud, the true and imaginary greatness and pride of Israel, which included the palaces of the voluptuous great men, for which reason they are placed in parallelism with &#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1506;. This glory of Israel Jehovah abhors, and He will destroy it by giving up the city (Samaria), and all that fills it (houses and men), to the enemies to be destroyed. &#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1506;, to give up to the enemy, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a> and <a href="/obadiah/1-14.htm">Obadiah 1:14</a>; not to surround, to which &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;&#1468; is unsuitable. The words not only threaten surrounding, or siege, but also conquest, and (<a href="/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>) the destruction of the city. And then, even if there are ten in one house, they will all perish. &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;: people, men. Ten in one house is a large number, which the prophet assumes as the number, to give the stronger emphasis to the thought that not one will escape from death. This thought is still further explained in <a href="/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>. A relative comes into the house to bury his deceased blood-relation. The suffix to &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493; refers to the idea involved in &#1502;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;, a dead man. Do&#772;d, literally the father's brother, here any near relation whose duty it was to see to the burial of the dead. &#1502;&#1505;&#1512;&#1507; for &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1507;, the burner, i.e., the burier of the dead. The Israelites were indeed accustomed to bury their dead, and not to burn the corpses. The description of the burier as mesa&#770;re&#772;ph (a burner) therefore supposes the occurrence of such a multitude of deaths that it is impossible to bury the dead, whose corpses are obliged to be burned, for the purpose of preventing the air from being polluted by the decomposition of the corpses. Of course the burning did not take place at the house, as Hitzig erroneously infers from &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;; for &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; denotes the corpse here, as in <a href="/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>, and not the different bones of the dead which remained without decomposition or burning. The burier now asks the last living person in the house, who has gone to the very back of the house in order to save his life, whether there is any one still with him, any one still living in the house beside himself, and receives the answer, &#1488;&#1508;&#1505; (Adv.), "Nothing more;" whereupon he says to him, has, "Be still," answering to our Hush! because he is afraid that, if he goes on speaking, he may invoke the name of God, or pray for the mercy of God; and he explains his words by adding, "The name of Jehovah must not be mentioned." It is not Amos who adds this explanation, but the relation. Nor does it contain "the words of one who despairs of any better future, and whose mind is oppressed by the weight of the existing evils, as if he said, Prayers would be of no use, for we too must die" (Lievl., Ros.). &#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, "it is not to (may not) be mentioned," would be unsuitable as an utterance of despair. It rather indicates the fear lest, by the invocation of the name of God, the eye of God should be drawn towards this last remaining one, and he also should fall a victim to the judgment of death. This judgment the Lord accomplishes not merely by a pestilence which breaks out during the siege, and rages all around (there is no ground for any such limitation of the words), but also by sword and plague during the siege and conquest of the town. For the reason assigned for the threat in <a href="/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a> points to the latter. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; links the words to the main thought in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>, or even <a href="/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>: "When the Lord delivers up the city and all that fills it, they will all perish; for, behold, He commands, orders the enemy (the nation in <a href="/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>), and it will smite in pieces the houses, great and small." The singular &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is used with indefinite generality: every house, great and small (cf. <a href="/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>). </body></html>
