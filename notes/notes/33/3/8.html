How seldom do wholesome truths reach the ears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceive others are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet had ardent love to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his glory and their salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met with did not drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and of himself, but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those who act honestly, may act boldly. And those who come to hear the word of God, must be willing to be told of their faults, must take it kindly, and be thankful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And truly I-- (Literally, contrariwise I,) that is, whereas they shall be void and no word in them, "I am full of (or filled with) power by the Spirit of the Lord and of judgment and might." The false prophets, walked after their own spirit, <a href="/ezekiel/13-3.htm">Ezekiel 13:3</a>. Their only power or influence was from without, from favoring circumstances, from adapting themselves to the great or to the people, going along with the tide, and impelling persons whither they wished to go. The power of the true prophet was inherent, and that by gift of "the Spirit of the Lord". And so, while adverse circumstances silenced the false prophets, they called forth the more the energy of the true, whose power was from Him in whose Hands the world is. The adverse circumstances to the false prophets were God's judgments; to the true, they were man's refractoriness, rebellion, oppressiveness. Now was the time of the false prophets; now, at a distance, they could foretell hardily, because they could not yet be convicted of untruth. When trouble came, they went into the inner chamber to hide <a href="/1_kings/22-25.htm">1 Kings 22:25</a> themselves. Micah, amid the wild tumult of the people <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>, was fearless, upborne by Him who controls, stills, or looses it, to do His Sovereign Will.<p>I am filled with power - So our Lord bade His Apostles, "Tarry ye, until ye be endued with power from on high" <a href="/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a> : "ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you" <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; and "they were all filled with the Holy Ghost" <a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>. The three gifts, "power, judgment, might," are the fruits of the One Spirit of God, through whom the prophet was filled with them. Of these, "power" is always strength residing in the person, whether it be the "power" (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-17.htm">Numbers 14:17</a>, etc.) or "might of wisdom" <a href="/job/36-5.htm">Job 36:5</a> of Almighty God Himself, or "power" which He imparts <a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-9.htm">Judges 16:9</a>, <a href="/judges/16-19.htm">Judges 16:19</a> or implants . But it is always power lodged in the person, to be put forth by him. Here, as in John the Immerser <a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a> or the Apostles Luk 24:49, it is divine power, given through God the Holy Spirit, to accomplish that for which he was sent, as Paul was endued with might <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. It is just that, which is so wanting to human words, which is so characteristic of the word of God, "power."<p>"Judgment" is, from its form, not so much discernment in the human being, as "the thing judged," pronounced by God, the righteous judgment of God, and righteous judgment in man conformably therewith (as in <a href="/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>). It was what, he goes on to say, the great men of his people abhorred <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-9.htm">Micah 3:9</a>, equity. With this he was filled. This was the substance of his message, right judgment to be enacted by them, to which he was to exhort them, or which, on their refusal, was to be pronounced upon them in the Name of God the Judge of all, and to be executed upon them. "Might" is courage or boldness to deliver the message of God, not awed or hindered by any adversaries. It is that holy courage, of which Paul speaks, "that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in bonds, that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak" <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19-20</a>. So too, after the Apostles had been "straitly threatened that they should speak no more in the Name of Jesus, all, having prayed, were filled with the Holy Spirit, and spake the word of God with boldness" <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/4-18.htm">Acts 4:18</a>, <a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>. Dionysius: "Whoso is so strengthened and arrayed, uttereth fiery words, Whereby hearers' hearts are moved and changed. But whoso speaketh of his own mind, doth good neither to himself nor others."<p>So then, of the three gifts, "power" expresses the divine might lodged in him; "judgment," the substance of what he had to deliver; "might or courage," the strength to deliver it in face of human power, persecution, ridicule, death.<p>Lap.: "These gifts the prophets know are not their own, but are from the Spirit of God, and are by Him inspired into them. Such was the spirit of Elijah, unconquered, energetic, fiery, of whom it is said, 'Then stood up Elias as fire, and his word burned like a lamp' (Ecclus. 48:1). Such was Isaiah, 'Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew My people their transgression and the house of Jacob their sins' <a href="/isaiah/58-1.htm">Isaiah 58:1</a>. Such was Jeremiah; 'Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord; I am weary of holding in. I have set thee for a trier among My people, a strong fort; and thou shalt know and try their ways' <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27</a>. Such was John Baptist, who said, 'O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?' <a href="/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>. Such was Paul, who, when he <a href="/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a> reasoned of temperance, righteousness and judgment to come, made Felix tremble, though unbelieving and ungodly. Such were the Apostles, who, when they had received the Holy Spirit <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>, broke, with a mighty breath, ships and kings of Tarshish. Such will be Elias and Enoch at the end of the world, striving against antichrist, of whom it is said <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/11-5.htm">Revelation 11:5</a>, if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies."<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The Locusts. - <a href="/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>. "Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me; and, behold, He formed locusts in the beginning of the springing up of the second crop; and, behold, it was a second crop after the king's mowing. <a href="/amos/7-2.htm">Amos 7:2</a>. And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the vegetable of the land, I said, Lord Jehovah, forgive, I:pray: how can Jacob stand? for he is small. <a href="/amos/7-3.htm">Amos 7:3</a>. Jehovah repented of this: It shall not take place, saith Jehovah." The formula, "Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me," is common to this and the three following visions (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-4.htm">Amos 7:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a>, and <a href="/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1</a>), with this trifling difference, that in the third (<a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a>) the subject (the Lord Jehovah) is omitted, and 'Ado&#772;na&#770;i (the Lord) is inserted instead, after vehinne&#772;h (and behold). &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; denotes seeing with the eyes of the mind - a visionary seeing. These visions are not merely pictures of a judgment which was ever threatening, and drawing nearer and nearer (Baur); still less are they merely poetical fictions, or forms of drapery selected arbitrarily, for the purpose of clothing the prophet's thoughts; but they are inward intuitions, produced by the Spirit of God, which set forth the punitive judgments of God. Ko&#772;h (ita, thus) points to what follows, and vehinne&#772;h (and behold) introduces the thing seen. Amos sees the Lord form locusts. Baur proposes to alter &#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512; (forming) into &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; (forms), but without any reason, and without observing that in all three visions of this chapter hinne&#772;h is followed by a participle (&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-4.htm">Amos 7:4</a>, and &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; in <a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a>), and that the 'Ado&#772;na&#770;i which stands before &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; in <a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a> shows very clearly that this noun is simply omitted in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>, because 'Ado&#772;na&#770;I Yeho&#772;va&#770;h has immediately preceded it. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497; (a poetical form for &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;, analogous to &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; for &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, and contracted into &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; in <a href="/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>) signifies locusts, the only question being, whether this meaning is derived from &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;  equals  Arab. ja&#770;b, to cut, or from &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;  equals  Arab. jb&#8219;a, to creep forth (out of the earth). The fixing of the time has an important bearing upon the meaning of the vision: viz., "at the beginning of the springing up of the second crop (of grass);" especially when taken in connection with the explanation, "after the mowings of the king." These definitions cannot be merely intended as outward chronological data. For, in the first place, nothing is known of the existence of any right or prerogative on the part of the kings of Israel, to have the early crop in the meadow land throughout the country mown for the support of their horses and mules (<a href="/1_kings/18-5.htm">1 Kings 18:5</a>), so that their subjects could only get the second crop for their own cattle. Moreover, if the second crop, "after the king's mowings," were to be interpreted literally in this manner, it would decidedly weaken the significance of the vision. For if the locusts did not appear till after the king had got in the hay for the supply of his own mews, and so only devoured the second crop of grass as it grew, this plague would fall upon the people alone, and not at all upon the king. But such an exemption of the king from the judgment is evidently at variance with the meaning of this and the following visions. Consequently the definition of the time must be interpreted spiritually, in accordance with the idea of the vision. The king, who has had the early grass mown, is Jehovah; and the mowing of the grass denotes the judgments which Jehovah has already executed upon Israel. The growing of the second crop is a figurative representation of the prosperity which flourished again after those judgments; in actual fact, therefore, it denotes the time when the dawn had risen again for Israel (<a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). Then the locusts came and devoured all the vegetables of the earth. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is not the second crop; for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489; does not mean grass, but vegetables, the plants of the field (see at <a href="/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11</a>). <a href="/amos/7-2.htm">Amos 7:2</a> and <a href="/amos/7-3.htm">Amos 7:3</a> require that this meaning should be retained. When the locusts had already eaten the vegetables of the earth, the prophet interceded, and the Lord interposed with deliverance. This intercession would have been too late after the consumption of the second crop. On the other hand, when the vegetables had been consumed, there was still reason to fear that the consumption of the second crop of grass would follow; and this is averted at the prophet's intercession. &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; for &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, as in <a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-11.htm">Jeremiah 37:11</a>, etc. &#1505;&#1500;&#1495;&#1470;&#1504;&#1488;, pray forgive, sc. the guilt of the people (cf. <a href="/numbers/14-19.htm">Numbers 14:19</a>). &#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, how (&#1502;&#1497; qualis) can Jacob (the nation of Israel) stand (not arise), since it is small? &#1511;&#1496;&#1503;, small, i.e., so poor in sources and means of help, that it cannot endure this stroke; not "so crushed already, that a very light calamity would destroy it" (Rosenmller). for &#1504;&#1495;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;, see <a href="/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>. &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; (this) refers to the destruction of the people indicated in &#1502;&#1497; &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;; and &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; is also to be supplied as the subject to &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;. </body></html>
