The desire to accumulate property in land, in contravention of the Mosaic Law, was denounced by Micah’s contemporary, Isaiah: “Woe unto them that join house to house. that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth” (<a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm" title="Woe to them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the middle of the earth!">Isaiah 5:8</a>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/micah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 Woe to the people that devise evil during the night, and rise early to carry it into execution! It is bad to do mischief on a sudden thought, much worse to do it with design and forethought. It is of great moment to improve and employ hours of retirement and solitude in a proper manner. If covetousness reigns in the heart, compassion is banished; and when the heart is thus engaged, violence and fraud commonly occupy the hands. The most haughty and secure in prosperity, are commonly most ready to despair in adversity. Woe to those from whom God turns away! Those are the sorest calamities which cut us off from the congregation of the Lord, or cut us short in the enjoyment of its privileges.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they covet fields and take them by violence - (rend them away) and houses, and take them away Still, first they sin in heart, then in act. And yet, with them, to covet and to rob, to desire and to take, are the same. They were prompt, instantaneous, without a scruple, in violence. So soon as they coveted, they took. Desired, acquired! Coveted, robbed! "They saw, they coveted, they took," had been their past history. They did violence, not to one only, but, touched with no mercy, to whole families, their little ones also; they oppressed a man and his house. They spoiled pot goods only, but life, a man and his inheritance; destroying him by false accusations or violence and seizing upon his inheritance . Thus, Ahab first coveted Naboth's vineyard, then, through Jezebel, slew him; and , "they who devoured widow's houses, did at the last plot by night against Him of whom they said, Come, let us kill Him, and the inheritance shall be our's; and in the morning, they practiced it, leading Him away to Pilate." : "Who of us desires not the villas of this world, forgetful of the possessions of Paradise? You see men join field to field, and fence to fence. Whole places suffice not to the tiny frame of one man." : "Such is the fire of concupiscence, raging within, that, as those seized by burning fevers cannot rest, no bed suffices them, so no houses or fields content these.

These rich men would have had a perfect right to purchase the lease of another man’s property, subject indeed to the law of redistribution in the 49th year (the year of Jubilee)—a relic of the old Village Community system, which seems to have prevailed anciently among Semitic as well as Aryan races (comp. Sir R. Maine’s <span class="ital">Village Communities</span>, and Mr Fenton’s article on the Law of Jubilee, in the <span class="ital">Theological Review</span>, 1878). But, as the account of Naboth the Jezreelite (1 Kings 21.) shews, the small Israelitish proprietors were too sturdy and too law-abiding to accede to proposals of purchasers when they could possibly avoid it. Hence, on the immoral principle that ‘might is right’ (or, as the prophet says, ‘because it is in the power of their hands’), they followed the example of Ahab, and used fraudulent or openly violent means—fraud is suggested by the language of <span class="ital"><a href="/micah/2-1.htm" title="Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil on their beds! when the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand.">Micah 2:1</a></span>, open violence by that of <span class="ital"><a href="/micah/2-2.htm" title="And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.">Micah 2:2</a></span>.

"Have ye offered me sacrifices and gifts in the desert forty years, O house of Israel? <a href="/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>. But have ye borne the booth of your king and the pedestal of your images, the star of your gods, which ye made for yourselves? <a href="/amos/5-27.htm">Amos 5:27</a>. Then I will carry you beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah; God of hosts is His name." The connection between these verses and what precedes is explained by Hengstenberg thus: "All this (the acts of worship enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-23</a>) can no more be called a true worship, than the open idolatry in the wilderness. Therefore (<a href="/amos/5-17.htm">Amos 5:17</a>) as in that instance the outwardly idolatrous people did not tread the holy land, so now will the inwardly idolatrous people be driven out of the holy land" (Dissertations on the Pentateuch, vol. i. p. 157 transl.). But if this were the train of thought, the prophet would not have omitted all reference to the punishment of the idolatrous people in the wilderness. And as there is no such allusion here, it is more natural to take <a href="/amos/5-25.htm">Amos 5:25</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>, as Calvin does, and regard the reference to the idolatry of the people, which was practised even in the wilderness, as assigning a further reason for their exposure to punishment.<p>(Note: "In this place," says Calvin, "the prophet proves more clearly, that he is not merely reproving hypocrisy among the Israelites, or the fact that they only obtruded their external pomps upon the notice of God, without any true piety of heart, but he also condemns their departure from the precepts of the law. And he shows that this was not a new disease among the Israelitish people, since their fathers had mixed up such leaven as this with the worship of God from the very beginning, and had thereby corrupted that worship. He therefore shows that the Israelites had always been addicted to superstitions, and could not be kept in any way whatever to the true and innate worship of God.")<p>The question, "Have ye offered me sacrifices?" is equivalent to a denial, and the words apply to the nation as a whole, or the great mass of the people, individual exceptions being passed by. The forty years are used as a round number, to denote the time during which the people were sentenced to die in the wilderness after the rebellion at Kadesh, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/5-6.htm">Joshua 5:6</a>, where this time, which actually amounted to only thirty-eight years, is given, as it is here, as forty years. And "the prophet could speak all the more naturally of forty years, since the germ of apostasy already existed in the great mass of the people, even when they still continued outwardly to maintain their fidelity to the God of Israel" (Hengstenberg). During that time even the circumcision of the children born in the thirty-eight years was suspended (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/5-5.htm">Joshua 5:5-7</a>), and the sacrificial worship prescribed by the law fell more and more into disuse, so that the generation that was sentenced to die out offered no more sacrifices. Zebha&#770;ch&#305;&#772;m (slain-offerings) and mincha&#770;h (meat-offerings), i.e., bleeding and bloodless sacrifices, are mentioned here as the two principal kinds, to denote sacrifices of all kinds. We cannot infer from this that the daily sacrificial worship was entirely suspended: in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11</a>, indeed, the altar-fire is actually mentioned, and the daily sacrifice assumed to be still in existence; at the same time, the event there referred to belonged to the time immediately succeeding the passing of the sentence upon the people. Amos mentions the omission of the sacrifices, however, not as an evidence that the blessings which the Lord had conferred upon the people were not to be attributed to the sacrifices they had offered to Him, As Ephraem Syrus supposes, nor to support the assertion that God does not need or wish for their worship, for which Hitzig appeals to <a href="/jeremiah/7-22.htm">Jeremiah 7:22</a>; but as a proof that from time immemorial Israel has acted faithlessly towards its God, in adducing which he comprehends all the different generations of the people in the unity of the house of Israel, because the existing generation resembled the contemporaries of Moses in character and conduct.</body></html>
