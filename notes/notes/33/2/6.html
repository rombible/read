The oppressors desire the prophets to cease prophesying; nevertheless, the prophecies shall be continued, but without benefit to those who will not put away their shame.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/micah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:6-11 Since they say, Prophesy not, God will take them at their word, and their sin shall be their punishment. Let the physician no longer attend the patient that will not be healed. Those are enemies, not only to God, but to their country, who silence good ministers, and stop the means of grace. What bonds will hold those who have no reverence for God's word? Sinners cannot expect to rest in a land they have polluted. You shall not only be obliged to depart out of this land, but it shall destroy you. Apply this to our state in this present world. There is corruption in the world through lust, and we should keep at a distance from it. It is not our rest: it was designed for our passage, but not for our portion; our inn, but not our home; here we have no continuing city; let us therefore arise and depart, let us seek a continuing city above. Since they will be deceived, let them be deceived. Teachers who recommend self-indulgence by their doctrine and example, best suit such sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy; they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame - The words are very emphatic in Hebrew, from their briefness, "Prophesy not; they shall indeed prophesy; they shall not prophesy to these; shame shall not depart." The people, the false prophets, the politicians, forbade God and Micah to prophesy; "Prophesy not." God, by Micah recites their prohibition to themselves, and forewarns them of the consequences.<p>Prophesy ye not - , literally drop not. Amaziah and the God-opposing party had already given an ungodly meaning to the word . "Drop not," "distill not," thus unceasingly, these same words, ever warning, ever telling of "lamentation and mourning and woe <a href="/ezekiel/2-10.htm">Ezekiel 2:10</a>; prophesying not good concerning us, but evil" <a href="/1_kings/22-18.htm">1 Kings 22:18</a>. So their descendants commanded the Apostles Act 4:18; <a href="/acts/5-40.htm">Acts 5:40</a> not to speak at all or to teach in the Name of Jesus <a href="/acts/5-28.htm">Acts 5:28</a>. Did we not straitly command you, that ye should not teach in this Name? <a href="/acts/6-13.htm">Acts 6:13</a>. This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law. God answers; They shall certainly prophesy. The Hebrew word is emphatic. The prophets had their commission from God, and Him they must obey, whether Israel <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/2-7.htm">Ezekiel 2:7</a> would hear or whether they would forbear. So must Micah and Isaiah Isa 28:9-14, <a href="/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a> now, or Jeremiah Jer 1:7, <a href="/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10-15</a>, Ezekiel, and the rest afterward. "They shall not prophesy to these."<p>He does not say only, "They shall not prophesy to them," but, to these; that is, they shall prophesy to others who would receive their words: God's word would not be stayed; they who would hearken shall never be deprived of their portion; but to these who despise, "they shall not prophesy." It shall be all one, as though they did not prophesy; the soft rain shall not bedew them. The barn-floor shall be dry, while the fleece is moist <a href="/judges/6-37.htm">Judges 6:37</a>. So God says by Isaiah; "I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it" <a href="/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>. The dew of God's word shall be transferred to others. But so shame (literally shames manifold shame,) shall not depart, but shall rest upon them forever. God would have turned away the shame from them; but they, despising His warnings, drew it to themselves. It was the natural fruit of their doings; it was in its natural home with them. God spoke to them, that they might be freed from it. They silenced His prophets; deafened themselves to His words; so it departed not. So our Lord says <a href="//biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>, Now ye say, we see; therefore your sin remaineth; and John the Immerser <a href="//biblehub.com/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>, The wrath of God abideth on him. It hath not now first to come. It is not some new thing to be avoided, turned aside. The sinner has but to remain as he is; the shame encompasseth him already; and only departeth not. The wrath of God is already upon him, and abideth on him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Prophesy ye not, say they&#8212;namely, the Israelites say to the true prophets, when announcing unwelcome truths. Therefore God judicially abandons them to their own ways: "The prophets, by whose ministry they might have been saved from shame (ignominious captivity), shall not (that is, no longer) prophesy to them" (Isa 30:10; Am 2:12; 7:16). Maurer translates the latter clause, "they shall not prophesy of such things" (as in Mic 2:3-5, these being rebellious Israel's words); "let them not prophesy"; "they never cease from insult" (from prophesying insults to us). English Version is supported by the parallelism: wherein the similarity of sound and word implies how exactly God makes their punishment answer to their sin, and takes them at their own word. "Prophesy," literally, "drop" (De 32:2; Eze 21:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/micah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Prophesy ye not; </span> it is manifest that our version here intends this as an interdict, or prohibition, laid upon the true prophets, whose hearers were so far from amending and turning unto God in compliance with his counsel, and obedience to his commands given out by his prophets, that rulers and people agree to silence the prophets, and expressly forbid them to distil or drop their severe predictions against the kingdom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That prophesy</span> faithfully, as Isaiah, Hoses, Joel, and Micah now did. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They, </span> or my true prophets, saith God, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall not prophesy to them; </span> shall cease from further troubling and terrifying these people, who fear not my judgments, and will not by repentance prevent their miserable captivity and shame.

This seems the meaning of the words in our version, and I will not add any other, though there are several versions which somewhat vary from ours. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/micah/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy,....

Hostility of the two classes of Prophets<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Prophesy ye not</span>] Micah and the prophets like-minded with him (e. g. Isaiah) are angrily bidden by the flattering, popular prophets to hold their peace. Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/30-9.htm" title="That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:...">Isaiah 30:9-10</a>, ‘For it is a rebellious people … Who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things; speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits (or, illusions); also <a href="/amos/2-12.htm" title="But you gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.">Amos 2:12</a>; <a href="/amos/5-10.htm" title="They hate him that rebukes in the gate, and they abhor him that speaks uprightly.">Amos 5:10</a>. Thus, in the times of Isaiah, Amos, and Micah, we can already detect the germs of the persecution which broke out with such severity under Manasseh. The faithful prophets of Jehovah were sometimes obliged to hide themselves (<a href="/isaiah/30-20.htm" title="And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not your teachers be removed into a corner any more, but your eyes shall see your teachers:">Isaiah 30:20</a>), and it seemed as if ‘the godly man had perished out of the land’ (<a href="/micah/7-2.htm" title="The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.">Micah 7:2</a>). From the context in which these words ‘Prophesy ye not,’ occur, we should suppose that the speakers were the ‘rebellious people’ (see <a href="/isaiah/30-9.htm" title="That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:">Isaiah 30:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-20.htm" title="And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not your teachers be removed into a corner any more, but your eyes shall see your teachers:">Isaiah 30:20</a>), represented by the grandees, though most commentators think that they are rather the unfaithful, smooth-speaking prophets, sometimes called ‘false prophets.’ Obs., the word used, here and in <span class="ital"><a href="/micah/2-11.htm" title="If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.">Micah 2:11</a></span> (also in <a href="/amos/7-16.htm" title="Now therefore hear you the word of the LORD: You say, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not your word against the house of Isaac.">Amos 7:16</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/21-2.htm" title="Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and drop your word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,">Ezekiel 21:2</a>) for ‘prophesy’ is literally ‘drop;’ it was perhaps originally a figurative expression for the constant flow and persuasive eloquence of prophecy. It is however probably used by Micah’s hostile critics in an unfavourable sense (‘dropping’ = constantly finding fault, comp. ‘here a little, there a little,’ <a href="/isaiah/28-10.htm" title="For precept must be on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little:">Isaiah 28:10</a>), so that we may venture to render here, <span class="bld">Prattle ye not</span>. Speech in general is said to ‘drop as the dew,’ <a href="/deuteronomy/32-2.htm" title="My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain on the tender herb, and as the showers on the grass:">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>; comp. <a href="/job/29-22.htm" title="After my words they spoke not again; and my speech dropped on them.">Job 29:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">say they to them that prophesy</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">(thus) they prattle</span>. The prophet takes up their word, and flings it back to them sarcastically. This view makes the grandees the speakers, in accordance with the context. Most recent commentators, however, suppose a sudden introduction of the false prophets (see last note).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they shall not prophesy to them</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">they should not prattle of these things</span>. Micah and his companions are exceeding the limits of their commission.

By ‘reproaches’ the hostile speakers mean denunciations such as that in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/micah/2-1.htm" title="Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil on their beds! when the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand....">Micah 2:1-2</a></span>, Isaiah 5. Comp. again <a href="/isaiah/28-10.htm" title="For precept must be on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little:">Isaiah 28:10</a> (where however A.

The speakers are generally supposed to be the false prophets who wish to stop the mouths of Micah and those who are like minded with him. This is probably correct; but these are not the only speakers; the people themselves, the oppressing grandees, who side with the popularity hunting seers, are also included (see note on ver. 12). Say they to them that <span class="cmt_word">prophesy</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thus they prophesy</span> (<span class="accented">drop</span>). Micah uses their own word sarcastically, "Do not be always rebuking; Thus they rebuke." The rest of the verse belongs to the same speakers, and should be rendered, "They shall not prophesy of these things; reproaches never cease." The great men and the false prophets complain of the true prophets that they are always proclaiming misfortune and rebuking the people, and they bid them leave such denunciations alone for the future. The passage is very difficult, and its interpretation has greatly exercised commentators; the above is virtually the explanation of Ewald, Hitzig, Caspari, and Cheyne. Orelli makes the two last clauses Micah's answer to the interdict of the adversaries, "Should one not prophesy of these things? Should reproaches (against the true prophets) never cease?" We prefer the interpretations given above, and consider the prophet's reply to be given in the next verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a> states what the princes of Israel are to see in the cities mentioned, - namely, that they are not better off (&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; denoting outward success or earthly prosperity) than these two kingdoms, i.e., the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and that their territories are not larger than theirs. It is very evident that this does not apply to cities that have been destroyed. The double question &#1492; ... &#1488;&#1501; requires a negative answer. <a href="/amos/6-3.htm">Amos 6:3</a>. assigns the reason for the woe pronounced upon the sinful security of the princes of Israel, by depicting the godless conduct of these princes; and this is appended in the manner peculiar to Amos, viz., in participles. These princes fancy that the evil day, i.e., the day of misfortune or of judgment and punishment, is far away (&#1502;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, piel of &#1504;&#1491;&#1492;  equals  &#1504;&#1491;&#1491;, to be far off, signifies in this instance not to put far away, but to regard as far off); and they go so far as to prepare a seat or throne close by for wickedness and violence, which must be followed by judgment. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;, to move the sitting (shebheth from ya&#770;shabh) of violence near, or better still, taking shebheth in the sense of enthroning, as Ewald does, to move the throne of violence nearer, i.e., to cause violence to erect its throne nearer and nearer among them. </body></html>
