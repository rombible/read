It is bad to do mischief on a sudden thought, much worse to do it with design and forethought. It is of great moment to improve and employ hours of retirement and solitude in a proper manner. If covetousness reigns in the heart, compassion is banished; and when the heart is thus engaged, violence and fraud commonly occupy the hands. The most haughty and secure in prosperity, are commonly most ready to despair in adversity. Woe to those from whom God turns away! Those are the sorest calamities which cut us off from the congregation of the Lord, or cut us short in the enjoyment of its privileges.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prophet had declared that evil should come down on Samaria and Jerusalem for their sins. He had pronounced them sinners against God; he now speaks of their hard unlovingness toward man, as our Blessed Lord in the Gospel speaks of sins against Himself in His members, as the ground of the condemnation of the wicked. The time of warning is past. He speaks as in the person of the Judge, declaring the righteous judgments of God, pronouncing sentence on the hardened, but blessing on those who follow Christ. The sins thus visited were done with a high hand; first, with forethought:<p>Woe - All woe, woe from God ; "the woe of temporal captivity; and, unless ye repent, the woe of eternal damnation, hangeth over you." Woe to them that devise iniquity. They devise it , "they are not led into it by others, but invent it out of their own hearts." They plot and forecast and fulfill it even in thought, before it comes to act. And work evil upon their beds. Thoughts and imaginations of evil are works of the soul <a href="/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>. "Upon their beds" (see <a href="/psalms/36-4.htm">Psalm 36:4</a>), which ought to be the place of holy thought, and of communing with their own hearts and with God <a href="/psalms/4-4.htm">Psalm 4:4</a>. Stillness must be filled with thought, good or bad; if not with good, then with bad. The chamber, if not the sanctuary of holy thoughts, is filled with unholy purposes and imaginations. Man's last and first thoughts, if not of good, are especially of vanity and evil. The Psalmist says, "Lord, have I not remembered Thee in my bed, and thought upon Thee when I was waking?" <a href="/psalms/63-6.htm">Psalm 63:6</a>. These men thought of sin on their bed, and did it on waking. When the morning is light, literally in the light of the morning, that is, instantly, shamelessly, not shrinking from the light of day, not ignorantly, but knowingly, deliberately, in full light. Nor again through infirmity, but in the wantonness of might, because it is in the power of their hand , as, of old, God said, "This they begin to do, and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do" <a href="/genesis/11-6.htm">Genesis 11:6</a>. Rup.: "Impiously mighty, and mighty in impiety."<p>Lap.: See the need of the daily prayer, "Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this day without sin;" and "Almighty God, who hast brought us to the beginning of this day, defend us in the same by Thy mighty power, that we may fall into no sin, etc." The illusions of the night, if such be permitted, have no power against the prayer of the morning. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>Mic 2:1-13.

Any kind of iniquity; idolatry, or worshipping of idols, for the word is used sometimes for an idol; or the sin of uncleanness, on which the thoughts too often dwell in the night season; or coveting of neighbours' goods, and oppressing the poor; sins which are instanced in <a href="/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>; and every thing that is vain, foolish, and wicked, and in the issue brings trouble and distress: now a woe is denounced against such that think on such things, and please themselves with them in their imaginations, and contrive ways and means to commit them: <p>and work evil upon their beds; when, the senses being less engaged, the thoughts are more free; but should not be employed about evil; but either in meditating on the divine goodness, and praising the Lord for his mercies; or in examining a man's heart, state, and case, and mourning over his sins, and applying to God for the remission of them; but, instead of this, the persons here threatened are said to "work evil on their beds", when they should be asleep and at rest, or engaged in the above things; that is, they plot and contrive how to accomplish the evil they meditate; they determine upon doing it, and are as sure of effecting it as if it was actually done; and do act it over in their own minds, as if it was real; see <a href="/psalms/36-4.htm">Psalm 36:4</a>; <p>when the morning is light, they practise it; they wish and wait for the morning light, and as soon as it appears they rise; and, instead of blessing God for the mercies of the night, and going about their lawful business, they endeavour to put in practice with all rigour and diligence, and as expeditiously as they can, what they have projected and schemed in the night season; <p>because it is in the power of their hand; to commit it; and they have no principle of goodness in them, nor fear of God before them, to restrain them from it: or, "because their hand is unto power" (b); it is stretched out, and made use of in the commission of sin to the utmost of their power, without any regard to God or man. The Vulgate Latin version is, "because their hand is against God"; their hearts are enmity to God, and therefore they oppose him with both their hands, and care not what iniquity they commit; they are rebels against him, and will not be subject to him. The Septuagint and Arabic versions are, "because they lift not up their hands to God"; they do not pray to him, and therefore are bold and daring to perpetrate the grossest iniquity, which a praying man dared not do; but the Syriac version is the reverse, "they do lift up their hands to God"; make a show of religion and devotion, when their hearts and their hands are deeply engaged in, sinning; which shows their impudence and hypocrisy; but the passages in <a href="/genesis/31-29.htm">Genesis 31:29</a> favour and confirm our version, and the sense of it; so the Targum. <p>(b)    "quia est ad potentiam manus ipsorum", Calvin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/micah/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</span><p>(a) As soon as they rise, they execute their wicked devices of the night, and according to their ability hurt others.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/micah/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1–5</span>.

As the word <span class="accented">el</span> may be taken to mean "God" as well as "power," some render here, "For their hand is their god," comparing the boast of Mezentius in Virgil, 'AEneid,' 10:773 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Dextra mihi Deus et telum quod missile libro."</span> The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Quoniam contra Deum est manus eorum</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, Because they lifted not up their hands unto God." So the Syriac, with the omission of the negative. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This threatening judgment will not be averted by the Israelites, even by their feasts and sacrifices (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21</a>, <a href="/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>). The Lord has no pleasure in the feasts which they celebrate. Their outward, heartless worship, does not make them into the people of God, who can count upon His grace. <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21</a>. "I hate, I despise your feasts, and do not like to smell your holy days. <a href="/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>. For if ye offer me burnt-offerings, and your meat-offerings, I have no pleasure therein; and the thank-offering of your fatted calves I do not regard. <a href="/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>. Put away from me the noise of thy songs; and I do not like to hear the playing of thy harps. <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>. And let judgment roll like water, and righteousness like an inexhaustible stream." By the rejection of the opus operatum of the feasts and sacrifices, the roots are cut away from the false reliance of the Israelites upon their connection with the people of God. The combination of the words &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1502;&#1488;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; expresses in the strongest terms the dislike of God to the feasts of those who were at enmity with Him. Chagg&#305;&#772;m are the great annual feasts; &#8219;a&#774;tsa&#770;ro&#772;th, the meetings for worship at those feasts, inasmuch as a holy meeting took place at the &#8219;a&#774;tsereth of the feast of Passover and feast of Tabernacles (see at <a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>). R&#305;&#772;a&#774;ch, to smell, is an expression of satisfaction, with an allusion to the &#1512;&#1497;&#1495; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1495;, which ascended to God from the burning sacrifice (see <a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a>). K&#305;&#772;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>, is explanatory: "for," not "yea." The observance of the feast culminated in the sacrificers. God did not like the feasts, because He had no pleasure in the sacrifices. In <a href="/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a> the two kinds of sacrifice, &#8219;o&#772;la&#770;h and mincha&#770;h, are divided between the protasis and apodosis, which gives rise to a certain incongruity. The sentences, if written fully, would read thus: When ye offer me burnt-offerings and meat-offerings, I have no pleasure in your burnt-offerings and meat-offerings. To these two kinds the shelem, the health-offering or peace-offering, is added as a third class in <a href="/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, fattened things, generally mentioned along with ba&#770;qa&#770;r as one particular species, for fattened calves (see <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>). In &#1492;&#1505;&#1512; (<a href="/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>) Israel is addressed as a whole. &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, the noise of thy songs, answers to the strong expression &#1492;&#1505;&#1512;. The singing of their psalms is nothing more to God than a wearisome noise, which is to be brought to an end. Singing and playing upon harps formed part of the temple worship (vid., <a href="/1_chronicles/16-40.htm">1 Chronicles 16:40</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>, and <a href="/1_chronicles/23-25.htm">1 Chronicles 23:25</a>). Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>.) also refuses the heartless sacrifice and worship of the people, who have fallen away from God in their hearts. It is very clear from the sentence which Amos pronounces here, that the worship at Bethel was an imitation of the temple service at Jerusalem. If, therefore, with <a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a> in view, where the careless upon Mount Zion and in Samaria are addressed, we are warranted in assuming that here also the prophet has the worship in Judah in his mind as well; the words apply primarily and chiefly to the worship of the kingdom of the ten tribes, and therefore even in that case they prove that, with regard to ritual, it was based upon the model of the temple service at Jerusalem. Because the Lord has no pleasure in this hypocritical worship, the judgment shall pour like a flood over the land. The meaning of <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a> is not, "Let justice and righteousness take the place of your sacrifices." Mishpa&#770;t is not the justice to be practised by men; for "although Jehovah might promise that He would create righteousness in the nation, so that it would fill the land as it were like a flood (<a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>), He only demands righteousness generally, and not actually in floods" (Hitzig). Still less can mishpa&#770;t u&#772;tseda&#770;qa&#770;h be understood as relating to the righteousness of the gospel which Christ has revealed. This thought is a very far-fetched one here, and is only founded upon the rendering given to &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, et revelabitur (Targ., Jerome,  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;), whereas &#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; comes from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, to roll, to roll along. The verse is to be explained according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>, and threatens the flooding of the land with judgment and the punitive righteousness of God (Theod. Mops., Theodoret, Cyr., Kimchi, and others). </body></html>
