What bonds will hold those who have no reverence for God's word? Sinners cannot expect to rest in a land they have polluted. You shall not only be obliged to depart out of this land, but it shall destroy you. Apply this to our state in this present world. There is corruption in the world through lust, and we should keep at a distance from it. It is not our rest: it was designed for our passage, but not for our portion; our inn, but not our home; here we have no continuing city; let us therefore arise and depart, let us seek a continuing city above.

Jerome: "He imputeth not past sins, but those recent and, as it were, of yesterday." "My people is risen up vehemently". God upbraideth them tenderly by the title, "Mine own people," as John complaineth, "He came unto His own, and His own received Him not" <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>. God became not their enemy, but they arose as one man, - "is risen up," the whole of it, as His. In Him they might have had peace and joy and assured gladness, but they arose in rebellion against Him, requiting Him evil for good, (as bad Christians do to Christ,) and brought war upon their own heads. This they did by their sins against their brethren. Casting off the love of man, they alienated themselves from the love of God.<p>Ye pull off (strip off violently) the robe with the garment - Literally, "over against the cloak." The &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;  s'alma&#770;h is the large enveloping cloak, which was worn loosely over the other dress, and served by night for a covering <a href="/deuteronomy/22-17.htm">Deuteronomy 22:17</a>. Eder, translated "robe," is probably not any one garment, but the remaining dress, the comely, becoming , array of the person. These they stripped violently off from persons, peaceable, unoffending, off their guard, "passing by securely, men averse from war" and strife. These they stripped of their raiment by day, leaving them half-naked, and of their covering for the night. So making war against God's peaceful people, they, as it were, made war against God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Towards whom? Not immediately against Jehovah, whom indeed they cannot cease to recognize as their national deity, but against those who are under His most immediate care—the poor and needy. (The rendering and even the reading of this verse is very doubtful, but the above explanation probably gives the general sense. One difficulty is that in this verse, according to the received text, the phrase ‘my people’ means the oppressive grandees, whereas in <span class="ital"><a href="/micah/2-9.htm" title="The women of my people have you cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have you taken away my glory for ever.">Micah 2:9</a></span> it is applied to the oppressed poor; comp. <a href="/isaiah/3-15.htm" title="What mean you that you beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? said the Lord GOD of hosts.">Isaiah 3:15</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye pull off the robe with the garment</span>, &c.] Rather, <span class="bld">clean away from the garment</span>. The ‘robe’ is the spreading mantle; the ‘garment’ is the so-called ‘upper garment.’ The former would of course be the most valuable article of apparel; the richest mantles were imported from Babylon (<a href="/joshua/7-21.htm" title="When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.">Joshua 7:21</a>).—It is probably not vulgar robbery which is here denounced, but a remorseless use of the rights of a creditor (contrary to the spirit of <a href="/context/exodus/22-26.htm" title="If you at all take your neighbor's raiment to pledge, you shall deliver it to him by that the sun goes down:...">Exodus 22:26-27</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even of late;</span> <span class="accented">but of late</span>; literally, <span class="accented">yesterday</span>, implying an action recent and repeated.

This translation obviates the difficulty of referring the words, "my people," in this verse to the oppressor, and in ver. 7 to the oppressed. According to the usual view, and retaining the authorized rendering, the meaning is that the princes exhibit themselves as enemies of the Lord by their acts of violence and oppression, which the prophet proceeds to particularize.

The "garment" (<span class="accented">salmah</span>) is the principal inner garment, or tunic. There may be an allusion to the enactment which forbade a creditor retaining the pledged garment during the night (<a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26</a>, etc.).

The grandees rob those who are peaceably disposed, perhaps strip their debtors of their cloaks as they pass quietly along the road. The versions vary considerably from the received Hebrew text.

Hitzig considers that the reference is to fugitives from the northern kingdom who passed through Judaea in their endeavour to escape the evils of the war, leaving wives and children in the hands of the Judaeans. But these treated the refugees harshly. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This forgetfulness of God shows itself more especially in the reckless licentiousness and debauchery of these men. <a href="/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>. "They who lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat lambs from the flock, and calves out of the fattening stall. <a href="/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>. Who prattle to the tune of the harp; like David, they invent string instruments. <a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>. Who drink wine out of sacrificial bowls, and anoint themselves with the best oils, and do not afflict themselves for the hurt of Joseph." They lie stretched, as it were poured out (&#1505;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;), upon beds inlaid with ivory, to feast and fill their belly with the flesh of the best lambs and fattened calves, to the playing of harps and singing, in which they take such pleasure, that they invent new kinds of playing and singing. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. pa&#770;rat, to strew around (cf. peret in <a href="/leviticus/19-10.htm">Leviticus 19:10</a>), in Arabic to throw many useless words about, to gossip, describes the singing at the banquets as frivolous nonsense. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;, articles or instruments of singing, are not musical instruments generally, but, as we may see from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-12.htm">2 Chronicles 34:12</a>, compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-26.htm">2 Chronicles 29:26-27</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>, the stringed instruments that were either invented by David (e.g., the nebel), or arranged by him for the sacred song of the temple, together with the peculiar mode of playing them; in other words, "the playing upon stringed instruments introduced by David." Consequently the meaning of <a href="/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a> is the following: As David invented stringed instruments in honour of his God in heaven, so do these princes invent playing and singing for their god, the belly. The meaning to invent or devise, which Baur will not allow to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, is established beyond all doubt by <a href="/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4</a>. They drink thereby out of sacrificial bowls of wine, i.e., drink wine out of sacrificial bowls. &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492; with &#1489;, as in <a href="/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5</a>. Mizra&#770;q, in the plural mizra&#770;q&#305;&#772;m and mizra&#770;qo&#772;th, from za&#770;raq, to sprinkle, was the name given both to the vessels used for the sprinkling of the blood, and also to the bowls made use of for pouring the libation of wine upon the table of shew-bread (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-8.htm">2 Chronicles 4:8</a>). This word is applied by Amos to the bowls out of which the gluttons drank their wine; with special reference to the offering of silver sacrificial bowls made by the tribe-princes at the consecration of the altar (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/7.htm">Numbers 7</a>), to show that whereas the tribe-princes of Israel in the time of Moses manifested their zeal for the service of Jehovah by presenting sacrificial bowls of silver, the princes of his own time showed just as much zeal in their care for their god, the belly. Mizra&#770;q&#305;&#772;m does not mean "rummers, or pitchers used for mixing wine." Lastly, Amos refers to their anointing themselves with the firstling of the oils, i.e., the best oils, as a sign of unbridled rejoicing, inasmuch as the custom of anointing was suspended in time of mourning (<a href="/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a>), for the purpose of appending the antithesis &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1490;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, they do not afflict or grieve themselves for the ruin of Israel. She&#772;bher, breach, injury, destruction. Joseph signifies the people and kingdom of the ten tribes. </body></html>
