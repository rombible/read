By <span class="ital">assembling all of Jacob, and gathering the remnant of Israel, as a flock in the midst of their fold, </span>they understand bringing them together into Samaria and Jerusalem, to be besieged in those cities, and thence taken out for slaughter or captivity. By <span class="ital">the breaker being come up before them, breaking up and passing through the gate, </span>they understand the enemies assaulting their cities, (namely, the Assyrians and Chaldeans,) breaking down their walls, and entering in and going out the gates of them, just as the citizens used to do; and by <span class="ital">their king passing before them, </span>his being carried into captivity along with them. By <span class="ital">the Lord on </span>(or, <span class="ital">at</span>) <span class="ital">the head of them, </span>they understand, God being on the side of, or prospering the Assyrians and Chaldeans in their attempts against the Israelites and Jews. Others, however, interpret these verses of the restoration of the Jewish people from captivity, and therefore understand by <span class="ital">the breaker coming up before them, </span>him who was to break the bonds of their captivity, or break through all obstacles that hindered their restoration, and open to them the way home. The following expressions, <span class="ital">They have broken up, and have passed</span> <span class="ital">through the gate, and are gone out by it, </span>they consider as metaphorical, describing their return, in allusion to a flock of sheep, which, as soon as a passage is opened for one to get out, do all of them follow; and that these expressions are made use of because it is said, in the foregoing verse, that they should be put or gathered together as a flock of sheep in the midst of their folds. The last clause they render, <span class="ital">Their king shall pass before them, even the Lord on the head of them — </span>That is, the Messiah, who is both the Lord and their King, shall lead and conduct them as their captain-general. Thus the Jewish commentators generally understand the <span class="ital">breaker </span>and <span class="ital">their king </span>of the same person, namely, the Messiah, as may be seen in Dr. Pocock on the place. Bishop Pearson cites the words of Moses Hadarson to the same purpose, in his exposition of the Sixth Article of the Creed. It may be observed further, that most of those who understand the Messiah as being meant by <span class="ital">the breaker </span>and <span class="ital">their king, </span>though they consider the promise as receiving its first accomplishment in the restoration of the Jews from Babylon, yet suppose it will receive a much more complete fulfilment in the latter days, when the general conversion of the Jews and Israelites, and their restoration to their own land, shall take place; it being very usual with the prophets, after they have denounced the destruction of the Jewish republic, to foretel their grand and spiritual deliverance; that the people might not think themselves entirely forsaken of God, before the promises made to their fathers were completed. As this passage is so extremely obscure, it has been thought best to lay both these interpretations before the reader, that he may judge which is most consistent with the words of the text. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/micah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:12,13 These verses may refer to the captivity of Israel and Judah. But the passage is also a prophecy of the conversion of the Jews to Christ. The Lord would not only bring them from captivity, and multiply them, but the Lord Jesus would open their way to God, by taking upon him the nature of man, and by the work of his Spirit in their hearts, breaking the fetters of Satan. Thus he has gone before, and the people follow, breaking, in his strength, through the enemies that would stop their way to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/micah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel - God's mercy on the penitent and believing being the end of all His threatenings, the mention of it often bursts in abruptly. Christ is ever the Hope as the End of prophecy, ever before the prophets' mind. The earthquake and fire precede the still small voice of peace in Him. What seems then sudden to us, is connected in truth. The prophet had said <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-10.htm">Micah 2:10</a>, where was not their rest and how they should be cast forth; he saith at once how they should be gathered to their everlasting rest. He had said, what promises of the false prophets would not be fulfille <a href="/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>. But, despair being the most deadly enemy of the soul, he does not take away their false hopes, without shewing them the true mercies in store for them. Jerome: "Think not," he would say, "that I am only a prophet of ill. The captivity foretold will indeed now come, and God's mercies will also come, although not in the way, which these speak of."<p>The false prophets spoke of worldly abundance ministering to sensuality, and of unbroken security. He tells of God's mercies, but after chastisement, to "the remnant of Israel." But the restoration is complete, far beyond their then condition. He had foretold the desolation of Samaria <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-6.htm">Micah 1:6</a>, the captivity of Judah <a href="/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>; <a href="/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>; he foretells the restoration of all Jacob, as one. The images are partly taken (as is the prophet's custom) from that first deliverance from Egypt . Then, as the image of the future growth under persecution, God multiplied His people exceedingly <a href="/exodus/1-12.htm">Exodus 1:12</a>; then "the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way" <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>; then God "brought them up"  "out of the house of bondage" (see below, <a href="/micah/6-4.htm">Micah 6:4</a>).<p>But their future prison-house was to be no land of Goshen. It was to be a captivity and a dispersion at once, as Hosea had already foretold . So he speaks of them emphatically, as a great throng, "assembling I will assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; gathering I will gather the remnant of Israel." The word, which is used of the gathering of a flock or its lambs <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>, became, from Moses' prophecy (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-4</a>, see <a href="/nehemiah/1-9.htm">Nehemiah 1:9</a>), a received word of the gathering of Israel from the dispersion of the captivity (see below, <a href="/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47</a>; <a href="/psalms/107-3.htm">Psalm 107:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-8.htm">Isaiah 56:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-19.htm">Zephaniah 3:19-20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-34.htm">Ezekiel 20:34</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-13.htm">Ezekiel 34:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-8.htm">Ezekiel 38:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/39-27.htm">Ezekiel 39:27</a>; <a href="/zechariah/10-10.htm">Zechariah 10:10</a>). The return of the Jews from Babylon was but a faint shadow of the fulfillment. For, ample as were the terms of the decrees of Cyrus <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2-4</a> and Artaxerxes <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/7-13.htm">Ezra 7:13</a>, and widely as that of Cyrus was diffused <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>, the restoration was essentially that of Judah, that is, Judah, Benjamin and Levi : the towns, whose inhabitants returned, were those of Judah and Benjamin <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7.htm">Nehemiah 7</a>; the towns, to which they returned, were of the two tribes.<p>It was not a gathering of "all Jacob;" and of the three tribes who returned, there were but few gathered, and they had not even an earthly king, nor any visible Presence of God. The words began to he fulfilled in the "many <a href="/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20</a> tens of thousands" who believed at our Lord's first Coming; and "all Jacob," that is, all who were Israelites indeed, "the remnant" according to the election of grace <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>, were gathered within the one fold of the Church, under One Shepherd. It shall be fully fulfilled, when, in the end, "the fullness of the Gentiles shall come in and all Israel shall be saved" <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25-26</a>. "All Jacob" is the same as "the remnant of Israel," the true Israel which remains when the false severed itself off; all the seed-corn, when the chaff was winnowed away. So then, whereas they were now scattered, then, God saith, "I will put them together (in one fold) as the sheep of Bozrah," which abounded in sheep <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>, and was also a strong city of Edom ; denoting how believers should be fenced within the Church, as by a strong wall, against which the powers of darkness should not prevail, and the wolf should howl around the fold, yet be unable to enter it, and Edom and the pagan should become part of the inheritance of Christ . "As a flock in the midst of their fold," at rest , "like sheep, still and subject to their shepherd's voice. So shall these, having one faith and One Spirit, in meekness and simplicity, obey the one rule of truth. Nor shall it be a small number;" for the place where they shall be gathered shall be too narrow to contain them, as is said in Isaiah; "Give place to me, that I may dwell" <a href="/isaiah/49-20.htm">Isaiah 49:20</a>.<p>They shall make great noise - (it is the same word as our hum, "the hum of men,") by reason of the multitude of men He explains his image, as does Ezekiel E<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/34-31.htm">Zechariah 34:31</a>, "And ye are My flock, the flock of My pasture; men are ye; I, your God, saith the Lord God: and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-38.htm">Ezekiel 36:38</a>, As a flock of holy things, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be full of a flock of men and they shall know that I am the Lord." So many shall they be, that throughout the whole world they shall make a great and public sound in praising God, filling Heaven and the green pastures of Paradise with a mighty hum of praise;" as John saw "a great multitude which no man could number" <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, "with one united voice praising the Good Shepherd, who smoothed for them all rugged places, and evened them by His Own Steps, Himself the Guide of their way and the Gate of Paradise, as He saith, 'I am the Door;' through whom bursting through and going before, being also the Door of the way, the flock of believers shall break through It. But this Shepherd is their Lord and King" . Not their King only, but the Lord God; so that this, too, bears witness that Christ is God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/micah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. A sudden transition from threats to the promise of a glorious restoration. Compare a similar transition in Ho 1:9, 10. Jehovah, too, prophesies of good things to come, but not like the false prophets, "of wine and strong drink" (Mic 2:11). After I have sent you into captivity as I have just threatened, I will thence assemble you again (compare Mic 4:6, 7).<p>all of thee&#8212;The restoration from Babylon was partial. Therefore that here meant must be still future, when "all Israel shall be saved" (Ro 11:26). The restoration from "Babylon" (specified (Mic 4:10) is the type of the future one.<p>Jacob &#8230; Israel&#8212;the ten tribes' kingdom (Ho 12:2) and Judah (2Ch 19:8; 21:2, 4).<p>remnant&#8212;the elect remnant, which shall survive the previous calamities of Judah, and from which the nation is to spring into new life (Isa 6:13; 10:20-22).<p>as the sheep of Bozrah&#8212;a region famed for its rich pastures (compare 2Ki 3:4). Gesenius for Bozrah translates, "sheepfold." But thus there will be tautology unless the next clause be translated, "in the midst of their pasture." English Version is more favored by the Hebrew.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/micah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There are three different interpretations of this verse, of which it is hard to say which is most agreeable to the intent of this scripture; I will propose all three, and leave each reader to choose for himself. First, Some will that these words be a continuation of the false prophet’s preaching prosperity and good days. So the words are a promise made to them contradictory to the menaces of the Lord by Micah; he foretold all would end in destruction; the false prophet foretells the assembling of all the seed of Jacob into their land and cities, and bringing back the remnant of the captive Israelites carried away by Tiglath-pileser, and their safety in their own fold as the flock of Bozrah, and should make great noise of joy and rejoicing in their multitudes. All which, spoken by the false prophet, Micah refutes in the 13th verse. Secondly, Others make it an evangelical promise of the restitution of Israel by the Messiah, and many Jews agree with Christian expositors herein, though, the Jews refer it to a temporal restitution, not yet fulfilled: the Christians refer it to a spiritual, partly fulfilled, yet more fully to be accomplished hereafter; and suitably to this hypothesis they interpret all the passages of this text and the 13th verse; both which will very fairly bear the sense by these put upon them, and may be the mystical sense of the words, but we, who inquire into the literal meaning, think it advisable not to swell the volume by long digressions. A third opinion ought to be considered ere we can choose which we shall adhere to. Now the third opinion, in expounding the text, makes it a commination or dreadful threat against this people, and thus suits it: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I, </span> i.e. God, offended with them.

But the style is entirely Micah's (comp. <a href="/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6, 7</a>), the promise is a true one, and such like sudden transitions are common in the prophetical books (comp. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2-6</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a>; <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>); so that we need not resort to the hypothesis that some connecting link has dropped out of the text, or that the clause is misplaced; and we are fully justified in considering the paragraph as inserted here in its right position, and as predictive of the restoration of the Jews after captivity. Micah would seem to imply - I am not, indeed, as one of the false prophets who promise you earthly good without regard to your moral fitness for receiving God's bounty; neither am I one who has no message but of woe and calamity; I, too, predict salvation and happiness for a remnant of you after you have been tried by defeat and exile. <span class="cmt_word">I will surely assemble.</span> This presupposes dispersion among the heathen, such as is foretold in <a href="/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>, etc.; Micah 2:4, etc. <span class="cmt_word">O Jacob, all of thee.</span> The promise extends to the whole nation, whether called Jacob or Israel, as <a href="/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>; <span class="cmt_word">but still only a remnant,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that portion of the nation which should make a good use of adversity, and turn to the Lord with sincere repentance (comp. <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>, etc.; <a href="/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11</a>, etc.; <a href="/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12</a>,. etc.). Some see in the term "remnant" an allusion to the people that were left in the northern kingdom after the fall of Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">As the sheep of Bozrah.</span> There were two or more towns so named - one in Sidon, for which see note on Amos 1:12; and another, <span class="accented">hod. Buzrah</span>, on the south border of the Hauran. This is mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>, as one of the cities of Moab, a district celebrated for its flocks (<a href="/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>); hence "sheep of Bozrah" may have become a proverbial saying. Many commentators take <span class="accented">Botsrah as</span> an appellative, meaning "fold," in agreement with the Vulgate, <span class="accented">quasi gregem in ovili</span>, and Chaldee, as well as Aquila and Symmachus. The parallelism in the following words seems to favour this view. The LXX. reads differently, rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "in trouble." Thus, too, the Syriac. <span class="cmt_word">As the flock in the midst of their fold;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as a flock in the midst of its pasture</span>. <span class="cmt_word">They shall make great noise,</span> etc. Like a numerous flock bleating in its fold, so shall the returned Israelites be, prosperous and happy, celebrating their salvation with praise and exultation (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/34-31.htm">Ezekiel 34:31</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "They shall leap forth from among men," which St. Jerome explains as meaning that the repentant Israelites shall rise above worldly things and aspire to heaven. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This threat is carried out still further in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8-11</a>. <a href="/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>. "The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by Himself, is the saying of Jehovah, the God of hosts: I abhor the pride of Jacob, and his palaces I hate; and give up the city, and the fulness thereof. <a href="/amos/6-9.htm">Amos 6:9</a>. And it will come to pass, if then men are left in a house, they shall die. <a href="/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>. And when his cousin lifts him up, and he that burieth him, to carry out the bones out of the house, and saith to the one in the hindermost corner of the house, Is there still any one with thee? and he says, Not one; then will he say, Hush; for the name of Jehovah is not to be invoked. <a href="/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>. For, behold, Jehovah commandeth, and men smite the great house to ruins, and the small house into shivers." In order to show the secure debauchees the terrible severity of the judgments of God, the Lord announces to His people with a solemn oath the rejection of the nation which is so confident in its own power (cf. <a href="/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). The oath runs here as in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>, with this exception, that instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; we have &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; in the same sense; for the nephesh of Jehovah, His inmost being or self, is His holiness. &#1502;&#1514;&#1488;&#1489;, with the guttural softened, for &#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489;. The participle describes the abhorrence as a continued lasting feeling, and not a merely passing emotion. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, the loftiness or pride of Jacob, i.e., everything of which Jacob is proud, the true and imaginary greatness and pride of Israel, which included the palaces of the voluptuous great men, for which reason they are placed in parallelism with &#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1506;. This glory of Israel Jehovah abhors, and He will destroy it by giving up the city (Samaria), and all that fills it (houses and men), to the enemies to be destroyed. &#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1506;, to give up to the enemy, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a> and <a href="/obadiah/1-14.htm">Obadiah 1:14</a>; not to surround, to which &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;&#1468; is unsuitable. The words not only threaten surrounding, or siege, but also conquest, and (<a href="/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>) the destruction of the city. And then, even if there are ten in one house, they will all perish. &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;: people, men. Ten in one house is a large number, which the prophet assumes as the number, to give the stronger emphasis to the thought that not one will escape from death. This thought is still further explained in <a href="/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>. A relative comes into the house to bury his deceased blood-relation. The suffix to &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493; refers to the idea involved in &#1502;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;, a dead man. Do&#772;d, literally the father's brother, here any near relation whose duty it was to see to the burial of the dead. &#1502;&#1505;&#1512;&#1507; for &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1507;, the burner, i.e., the burier of the dead. The Israelites were indeed accustomed to bury their dead, and not to burn the corpses. The description of the burier as mesa&#770;re&#772;ph (a burner) therefore supposes the occurrence of such a multitude of deaths that it is impossible to bury the dead, whose corpses are obliged to be burned, for the purpose of preventing the air from being polluted by the decomposition of the corpses. Of course the burning did not take place at the house, as Hitzig erroneously infers from &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;; for &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; denotes the corpse here, as in <a href="/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>, and not the different bones of the dead which remained without decomposition or burning. The burier now asks the last living person in the house, who has gone to the very back of the house in order to save his life, whether there is any one still with him, any one still living in the house beside himself, and receives the answer, &#1488;&#1508;&#1505; (Adv.), "Nothing more;" whereupon he says to him, has, "Be still," answering to our Hush! because he is afraid that, if he goes on speaking, he may invoke the name of God, or pray for the mercy of God; and he explains his words by adding, "The name of Jehovah must not be mentioned." It is not Amos who adds this explanation, but the relation. Nor does it contain "the words of one who despairs of any better future, and whose mind is oppressed by the weight of the existing evils, as if he said, Prayers would be of no use, for we too must die" (Lievl., Ros.). &#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, "it is not to (may not) be mentioned," would be unsuitable as an utterance of despair. It rather indicates the fear lest, by the invocation of the name of God, the eye of God should be drawn towards this last remaining one, and he also should fall a victim to the judgment of death. This judgment the Lord accomplishes not merely by a pestilence which breaks out during the siege, and rages all around (there is no ground for any such limitation of the words), but also by sword and plague during the siege and conquest of the town. For the reason assigned for the threat in <a href="/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a> points to the latter. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; links the words to the main thought in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>, or even <a href="/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>: "When the Lord delivers up the city and all that fills it, they will all perish; for, behold, He commands, orders the enemy (the nation in <a href="/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>), and it will smite in pieces the houses, great and small." The singular &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is used with indefinite generality: every house, great and small (cf. <a href="/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>). </body></html>
