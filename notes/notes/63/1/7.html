Such a one is a deceiver and an antichrist; he deludes souls, and undermines the glory and kingdom of the Lord Christ. Let us not think it strange, that there are deceivers and opposers of the Lord Christ's name and dignity now, for there were such, even in the apostles' times. The more deceivers and deceits abound, the more watchful the disciples must be. Sad it is, that splendid attainments in the school of Christ, should ever be lost. The way to gain the full reward is, to abide true to Christ, and constant in religion to the end. Firm cleaving to Christian truth unites us to Christ, and thereby to the Father also; for they are one. Let us equally disregard such as abide not in the doctrine of Christ, and those who transgress his commands. Any who did not profess and preach the doctrine of Christ, respecting him as the Son of God, and salvation by him from guilt and sin, were not to be noticed and countenanced. Yet in obeying this command, we must show kindness and a good spirit to those who differ from us in lesser matters, but hold firmly the all-important doctrines of Christ's person, atonement, and holy salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For - &#x39f;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;  Hoti. This word "for" is not here to be regarded as connected with the previous verse, and as giving a reason why there should be the exercise of mutual love, but is rather to be understood as connected with the following verse, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_john/1-8.htm">2 John 1:8</a>, and as giving a reason for the caution there expressed: "Because it is a truth that many deceivers have appeared, or since it has occurred that many such are abroad, look to yourselves lest you be betrayed and ruined." The fact that there were many such deceivers was a good reason for being constantly on their guard, lest they should be so far drawn away as not to receive a full reward.<p>Many deceivers are entered into the world - Are abroad in the world, or have appeared among men. Several manuscripts read here, "have gone out into the world," (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  exe&#772;lthon,) instead of "have entered into," &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  eise&#772;lthon. The common reading is the correct one, and the other was originated, probably, from the unusual form of the expression, "have come into the world," as if they had come from another abode. That, however, is not necessarily implied, the language being such as would he properly used to denote the idea that there were such deceivers in the world.<p>Who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh - Who maintain that he assumed only the appearance of a man, and was not really incarnate. See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2-3</a>.<p>This is a deceiver - Everyone who maintains this is to be regarded as a deceiver.<p>And an antichrist - See the notes at <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

He who denies Christ's coming in the flesh, denies the possibility of the incarnation; he who denies that he has come, denies its actuality. They denied the possibility of a Messiah's appearing, or coming, in the flesh [Neander]. I think the Greek present participle implies both the first and the second advent of Christ. He is often elsewhere called the Coming One (Greek), Mt 11:3; Heb 10:37. The denial of the reality of His manifestation in the flesh, at His first coming, and of His personal advent again, constitutes Antichrist. "The world turns away from God and Christ, busily intent upon its own husks; but to OPPOSE God and Christ is of the leaven of Satan" [Bengel].<p>This is a, &c.&#8212;Greek, "This (such a one as has been just described) is the deceiver and the Antichrist." The many who in a degree fulfil the character, are forerunners of the final personal Antichrist, who shall concentrate in himself all the features of previous Antichristian systems.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_john/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See <span class="bld"><a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1Jo 2:18</a>,22 4:3</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_john/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For many deceivers are entered into the world,....

It is rare in N. T. Comp. <a href="/matthew/27-63.htm" title="Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.">Matthew 27:63</a>. S.

John’s special sense of what is external to the Church and antichristian; see on <a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1 John 2:2</a>. The meaning may be that, like the many antichrists in <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>, they went out from the Church into the unchristian world. Possibly the same persons are meant in both Epistles. Irenaeus (a.d. 180) by a slip of memory quotes this passage as from the First Epistle (<span class="ital">Haer.</span> III. xvi. 8).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who confess not</span>] More accurately, as R. V., <span class="ital">even they that confess not</span>: the many deceivers and those who confess not are the same group, and this is their character,—unbelief and denial of the truth. ‘Confess not’ = deny.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh</span>] This is not quite accurate; nor does R. V., ‘that Jesus Christ <span class="ital">cometh</span> in the flesh’, seem to be more than a partial correction. Rather, <span class="ital">that confess not Jesus Christ</span> <span class="bld">as coming</span> <span class="ital">in the flesh</span>, or possibly, <span class="ital">that confess not Jesus</span> <span class="bld">as Christ coming</span> <span class="ital">in the flesh</span>. See on <a href="/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:">1 John 4:2</a>, where the Greek is similar, but with perfect instead of present participle. These deceivers denied not merely the fact of the Incarnation, but its possibility. In both passages A. V. and R. V. translate as if we had the infinitive mood instead of the participle. The difference is, that with the participle the denial is directed against the <span class="ital">Person</span>, ‘they deny <span class="ital">Jesus</span>’; with the infinitive it is directed against the <span class="ital">fact</span>, ‘they deny that He <span class="ital">cometh</span>’ or ‘<span class="ital">has come</span>.’ Note that Christ is never said to come <span class="ital">into</span> the flesh; but either, as here and <a href="/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:">1 John 4:2</a>, to come <span class="ital">in</span> the flesh; or, to <span class="ital">become</span> flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>). To say that Christ came <span class="ital">into</span> the flesh would leave room for saying that the Divine Son was united with Jesus after He was born of Mary; which would be no true Incarnation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">This is a deceiver and an Antichrist</span>] Rather, <span class="ital">This is</span> <span class="bld">the</span> <span class="ital">deceiver and</span> <span class="bld">the</span> <span class="ital">Antichrist</span>: a good example of inadequate treatment of the Greek article in A.

(see on <a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a>). Luther is more accurate; ‘Dieser ist <span class="ital">der</span> Verführer und <span class="ital">der</span> Widerchrist’. The transition from plural to singular (see on <span class="ital"><a href="/2_john/1-6.htm" title="And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.">2 John 1:6</a></span>) may be explained in two ways; 1. The man who acts thus is the deceiver and the Antichrist; 2. These men collectively are the deceiver and the Antichrist.

The third element in the triplet of leading thoughts once more comes to the front, but without being named. Love and obedience require, as the condition of their existence, truth. It is in truth that ‘the Elder’ and all who love the truth love the elect lady and her children; and they love them for the truth’s sake. Truth no less than love is the condition of receiving the threefold blessing of grace, mercy, and peace. And it was the fact that some of her children were walking in truth, while others seemed to be deserting it, which led the Apostle in the fulness of his heart to write to her. All this tends to shew the preciousness of the truth. Love of the brethren and loyal obedience to God’s commands will alike suggest that we should jealously guard against those who by tampering with the truth harm the brethren and dishonour God and His Son.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_john/1-7.htm" title="For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.

The dangers which they suggest are not imaginary. Mischief has already been done by neglecting them. "Deceiver" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> here means "seducer," one who causes others to go astray. The cognate verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span> is frequent in St. John, especially in the Revelation (<a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3, 8, 10</a>), and commonly indicates seduction into grave error (comp. <a href="/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-26.htm">1 John 2:26</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>). The true reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> gives "are gone forth," not "are entered" <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. We cannot be sure that "are gone forth" refers to their leaving the true Church; although <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a> inclines us to think so: it may mean no more than that they have gone abroad spreading their erroneous tenets. Just as "love not" in <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10, 14, 15</a> and 1 John 4:20 is equivalent to "hate," so "confess not" here is equivalent to "deny." These seducers deny "Jesus Christ <span class="accented">as coming</span> in the flesh," or (as the Greek may possibly mean) they deny "Jesus <span class="accented">as Christ coming</span> in the flesh." The present participle <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> seems to indicate exactly the position of some of the Gnostic teachers. The Jew denied that the Incarnation <span class="accented">had</span> taken place - the Messiah had not yet come. The Gnostic denied that the Incarnation <span class="accented">could</span> take place: no such Person as the Christ coming in the flesh was possible; that the Infinite should become finite, that the Divine Word should become flesh, was inconceivable. The teacher who brings such doctrine as this "is <span class="accented">the</span> deceiver and <span class="accented">the</span> antichrist" about whom the elder's children had been so frequently warned. In the strong language which St. John here and elsewhere (<a href="/1_john/2-22.htm">1 John 2:22, 26</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>) uses respecting those who deny or pervert the truth, we hear the voice of the "son of thunder," ever jealous about whatever touched the honour of his Lord. Such hatred of error was the outcome of a firm grasp, and profound love, of the truth. It is easy to imitate and to exceed such strength of language; but let us beware of doing so without having first attained to an  equal comprehension of the truth, and an equal affection for it. The strong words of the apostle are the expression of a glowing conviction. Our strong words are too often the expression of a heated temper; and a man who loses his temper in argument cares more about himself than about the truth. Let us remember the noble words of St. Augustine to the heretics of his own day: "Let those rage against you who know not with what toil truth is found, and how difficult it is to avoid errors; who know not with how much difficulty the eye of the inner man is made whole; who know not with what sighs and groans it is made possible, in however small a degree, to comprehend God." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Deceivers (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>See on we deceive ourselves, <a href="/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>.<p>Are entered into (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., are gone forth into.
