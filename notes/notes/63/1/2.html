And old disciple is honourable; an old apostle and leader of disciples is more so. The letter is to a noble Christian matron, and her children; it is well that the gospel should get among such: some noble persons are called. Families are to be encouraged and directed in their love and duties at home. Those who love truth and piety in themselves, should love it in others; and the Christians loved this lady, not for her rank, but for her holiness. And where religion truly dwells, it will abide for ever. From the Divine Persons of the Godhead, the apostle craves grace, Divine favour, and good-will, the spring of all good things. It is grace indeed that any spiritual blessing should be given to sinful mortals. Mercy, free pardon, and forgiveness; for those already rich in grace, need continual forgiveness. Peace, quietness of spirit, and a clear conscience, in assured reconciliation with God, together with all outward prosperity that is really for good: these are desired in truth and love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the truth's sake - They love this family because they love the truth, and see it so cordially embraced and so happily exemplified. Those who love the gospel itself will rejoice in all the effects which it produces in society, on individuals, families, neighborhoods, and their hearts will be drawn with warm affection to the places where its influence is most fully seen.<p>Which dwelleth in us - In us who are Christians; that is, the truths of the gospel which we have embraced. Truth may be said to have taken up a permanent abode in the hearts of all who love religion.<p>And shall be with us for ever - Its abode with us is not for a night or a day; not for a month or a year; not for the few years that make up mortal life; it is not a passing stranger that finds a lodging like the weary traveler for a night, and in the morning is gone to be seen no more; it has come to us to make our hearts its permanent home, and it is to be with us in all worlds, and while ceaseless ages shall roll away. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

By <span class="greekheb">μετά</span> (as distinguished from <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>) the objectivity of the truth is indicated (Braune). The irregularity of the construction, inasmuch as the finite verb is used instead of a participle (comp. A.

An echo of Christ’s farewell discourses: ‘He shall give you another Advocate, that He may <span class="ital">be with you for ever</span>, even the Spirit of <span class="ital">truth</span>’ (<a href="/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>).

The Apostle and all believers love the elect lady and her children on account of the ever-abiding presence of Christ in the gift of the Spirit. ‘For ever’ is literally ‘unto the age’: see on <a href="/1_john/2-17.htm" title="And the world passes away, and the lust thereof: but he that does the will of God stays for ever.">1 John 2:17</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_john/1-2.htm" title="For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us for ever.">2 John 1:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀγαπητὲ</span>, <span class="ital">beloved</span>) This expression occurs three times, in <a href="/2_john/1-2.htm" title="For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us for ever.">2 John 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-5.htm" title="And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.">2 John 1:5</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-11.htm" title="For he that bids him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.">2 John 1:11</a>.—<span class="greekheb">περὶ πάντων</span>, <span class="ital">respecting all things</span>) that which relates to all parts [in all respects].—<span class="greekheb">εὐοδοῦσθαι</span>, <span class="ital">to prosper</span>) in property, etc.—<span class="greekheb">ὑγιαίνειν</span>, <span class="ital">to be in health</span>) in body.—<span class="greekheb">καθὼς</span>, <span class="ital">even as</span>) Where the <span class="ital">soul</span> is in health, it is possible for all things to be in health.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>even in addressing illustrious persons, in preference to appellatives.
