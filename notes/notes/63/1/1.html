The absence of the article would not be more surprising in that case than it would be if we translate “lady,” for “elect” would evidently be in such familiar use that the article would be easily omitted.<p>If the name of the matron is not given, it is not absurd to suppose that the dangers of the times, or family persecution, may have made it advisable that both her name and that of the writer should be withheld. The messenger would supply both deficiencies.<p>The term “lady” would not imply anything about her social station.

And old disciple is honourable; an old apostle and leader of disciples is more so. The letter is to a noble Christian matron, and her children; it is well that the gospel should get among such: some noble persons are called. Families are to be encouraged and directed in their love and duties at home. Those who love truth and piety in themselves, should love it in others; and the Christians loved this lady, not for her rank, but for her holiness. And where religion truly dwells, it will abide for ever. From the Divine Persons of the Godhead, the apostle craves grace, Divine favour, and good-will, the spring of all good things. It is grace indeed that any spiritual blessing should be given to sinful mortals. Mercy, free pardon, and forgiveness; for those already rich in grace, need continual forgiveness. Peace, quietness of spirit, and a clear conscience, in assured reconciliation with God, together with all outward prosperity that is really for good: these are desired in truth and love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The elder - See the introduction, Section 1, (2,d).<p>Unto the elect lady - The elect or chosen Kyria.

At all events, the use of such a pronoun proves that some at least of her children were sons.

The meaning however is, that he was sincerely attached to them. The word "whom" here, (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#768;&#x3c2;  hous,) embraces both the mother and her children, though the pronoun is in the masculine gender, in accordance with the usage of the Greek language. No mention is made of her husband, and it may thence be inferred that she was a widow. Had he been living, though he might not have been a Christian, it is to be presumed that some allusion would have been made to him as well as to the children, especially since there is reason to believe that only some of her children were pious.

The commendation of the apostle here shows that it is possible that a family shall be extensively known as one of order, peace, and religion, so that all who know it or hear of it shall regard it with interest, respect, and love. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>THE SECOND AND THIRD EPISTLES GENERAL OF JOHN Commentary by A. R. Faussett   <p>INTRODUCTION<p>Authenticity.&#8212;That these two Epistles were written by the same author appears from their similarity of tone, style, and sentiments. That John, the beloved disciple, was the author of the Second and Third Epistles, as of the First Epistle, appears from Iren&aelig;us [Against Heresies, 1.16.3], who quotes 2Jo 10, 11; and in [3.16.8], he quotes 2Jo 7, mistaking it, however, as if occurring in First John. Clement of Alexandria (A.D. 192) [Miscellanies, 2.66], implies his knowledge of other Epistles of John besides the First Epistle; and in fragments of his Adumbrations [p. 1011], he says, "John's Second Epistle which was written to the virgins (Greek, "parthenous"; perhaps Parthos is what was meant) is the simplest; but it was written to a certain Babylonian named the Elect lady." Dionysius of Alexandria (in Eusebius [Ecclesiastical History, 7.25]) observes that John never names himself in his Epistles, "not even in the Second and Third Epistles, although they are short Epistles, but simply calls himself the presbyter, a confutation of those who think John the apostle distinct from John the presbyter. Alexander of Alexandria cites 2Jo 10, 11, as John's [Socrates, Ecclesiastical History, 1.6]. Cyprian [Concerning the Baptism of Heretics], in referring to the bishops at the Council of Carthage, says, "John the apostle, in His Epistle, has said, if any come to you" (2Jo 10); so that this Epistle, and therefore its twin sister, Third John, was recognized as apostolic in the North African Church. The Muratori fragment is ambiguous. The Second and Third Epistles were not in the Peschito or old Syriac version; and Cosmas Indicopleustes in the sixth century says that in his time the Syriac Church only acknowledged three of the Catholic Epistles, First Peter, First John, and James. But Ephrem the Syrian quotes the Second Epistle of John. Eusebius [Ecclesiastical History,] reckons both Epistles among the Antilegomena or controverted Scriptures, as distinguished from the Homologoumena or universally acknowledged from the first. Still his own opinion was that the two minor Epistles were genuine, remarking, as he does in Demonstration of the Gospel [3.5], that in John's "Epistles" he does not mention his own name, nor call himself an apostle or evangelist, but an "elder" (2Jo 1; 3Jo 1). Origen (in Eusebius [Ecclesiastical History, 6.25]) mentions the Second and Third Epistles, but adds, "not all admit (implying that most authorities do) their genuineness." Jerome [On Illustrious Men, 9] mentions the two latter Epistles as attributed to John the presbyter, whose sepulcher was shown among the Ephesians in his day. But the designation "elder" was used of the apostles by others (for example, Papias, in Eusebius [Ecclesiastical History, 3.39]), and is used by Peter, an apostle, of himself (1Pe 5:1). Why, then, should not John also use this designation of himself, in consonance with the humility which leads him not to name himself or his apostleship even in the First Epistle? The Antilegomena were generally recognized as canonical soon after the Council of Nicea (A.D. 325). Thus Cyril of Jerusalem, A.D. 349, enumerates fourteen Epistles of Paul, and seven Catholic Epistles. So Gregory Nazianzen, in A.D. 389. The Councils of Hippo, 393, and Carthage, 397, adopted a catalogue of New Testament books exactly agreeing with our canon. So our oldest extant Greek manuscripts. The Second and Third Epistles of John, from their brevity (which Origen notices), and the private nature of their contents, were less generally read in the earliest Christian assemblies and were also less quoted by the Fathers; hence arose their non-universal recognition at the first. Their private nature makes them the less likely to be spurious, for there seems no purpose in their forgery. The style and coloring too accord with the style of the First Epistle.<p>To whom addressed.&#8212;The Third Epistle is directed to Gaius or Caius; whether Gaius of Macedonia (Ac 19:20), or Gaius of Corinth (Ro 16:23; 1Co 1:14), or Gaius of Derbe (Ac 20:4), it is hard to decide. Mill believes Gaius, bishop of Pergamos [Apostolic Constitutions, 7.40], to be the person addressed in 3Jo 1.<p>The address of the Second Epistle is more disputed. It opens, "The elder unto the Elect lady" (2Jo 1). And it closes, "The children of thy elect sister greet thee" (2Jo 13). Now, 1Pe 1:1, 2, addresses the elect in Asia, &c., and closes (1Pe 5:13), "The Church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you." Putting together these facts, with the quotations (above) from Clement of Alexandria, and the fact that the word "Church" comes from a Greek word (kyriake) cognate to the Greek for "lady" (kyria; "belonging to the Lord," kyrios); Wordsworth's view is probable. As Peter in Babylon had sent the salutations of the elect Church in the then Parthian (see above on Clement of Alexandria) Babylon to her elect sister in Asia, so John, the metropolitan president of the elect Church in Asia, writes to the elect lady, that is, Church, in Babylon. Neander, Alford, and others, think the Greek "kyria" not to mean "lady," but to be her proper name; and that she had a "sister, a Christian matron," then with John.<p>Date and place of writing.&#8212;Eusebius [Ecclesiastical History, 3.25] relates that John, after the death of Domitian, returned from his exile in Patmos to Ephesus, and went on missionary tours into the heathen regions around, and also made visitations of the churches around, and ordained bishops and clergy. Such journeys are mentioned, 2Jo 12; 3Jo 10, 14. If Eusebius be right, both Epistles must have been written after the Apocalypse, in his old age, which harmonizes with the tone of the Epistles, and in or near Ephesus. It was on one of his visitation tours that he designed to rebuke Diotrephes (3Jo 9, 10).<p>2Jo 1-13. Address: Greeting: Thanksgiving for the Elect Lady's Faithfulness in the Truth: Enjoins Love: Warns against Deceivers, Lest We Lose Our Reward: Conclusion.<p>1. The elder&#8212;In a familiar letter John gives himself a less authoritative designation than "apostle"; so 1Pe 5:1.<p>lady&#8212;Bengel takes the Greek as a proper name Kyria, answering to the Hebrew "Martha." Being a person of influence, "deceivers" (2Jo 7) were insinuating themselves into her family to seduce her and her children from the faith [Tirinus], whence John felt it necessary to write a warning to her. (But see my Introduction and 1Pe 5:13). A particular Church, probably that at Babylon, was intended.

By the "elder" is meant the writer of this epistle, the Apostle John, who so calls himself either on account of his age, he being now near an hundred years of age, having outlived all the apostles: or on account of his office, being a bishop or overseer, not only of the church at Ephesus, but of all the Asiatic churches, which is the same with an elder; nor is this incompatible with his being an apostle; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/5-1.htm">1 Peter 5:1</a>, the elect lady is the person he writes unto; by whom is designed not the church of Christ, since such a way of speaking is unusual; and besides, he speaks of coming to see her face to face, and of the children of her elect sister: but some particular person, some rich, as well as gracious woman of John's acquaintance; and these words, "elect lady", are neither of them proper names of the person: some think that the word "Kyria", rendered "lady", was the name of the person, as "Domina" with the Romans, and answers to the Hebrew word "Martha"; for as  "Mar", signifies lord, so  "Martha, lady"; and then the inscription runs, "to the choice" or "excellent Martha"; and the Syriac and Arabic versions read, "to the elect Kyria": and others think that the word rendered elect is a proper name, and that this person's name was "Electa", as "Electus" (d) is a man's name; and then it must read thus, "to the lady Electa"; but her sister also is so called, and it can hardly be thought that two sisters should be both of a name; neither of them are proper names, but characters and titles of respect and honour: she is called a "lady", because she was a person of distinction and substance, which shows that God sometimes calls by his grace some that are rich and noble; and also that titles of respect and honour, where flattery is avoided, may be lawfully given to persons of dignity and wealth; so Nazianzen (e) calls his own mother by the same title; and it was usual to call women by this name from fourteen years of age (f): and this person also is said to be "elect"; either because she was a choice, famous, and excellent person, not only for her birth, nobility, and riches, but for her virtue, grace, and good works; or because she was chosen unto eternal life and salvation; and which the apostle might know without a special and divine revelation, by the Gospel coming with power to her; by the grace that was wrought in her; by the faith of God's elect, which she appeared to have, seeing it worked by love; and which may be, and ought to be concluded in a judgment of charity, of everyone that professes faith in Christ, and walks according to it; and this also makes it appear that election is of particular persons, and not of nations, communities, and churches, as such; nor is it unusual to salute single persons under this character; see <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/16-13.htm">Romans 16:13</a>, this epistle is inscribed not only to this lady, but also to "her children"; who were not infants, but grown up, and had made a profession of the truth, and walked in it, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_john/1-4.htm">2 John 1:4</a>, and both the mother and the children the apostle represents as the objects of his love: <p>whom I love in the truth; either as being in the truth and faith of the Gospel; for though all men are to be loved as men, and to be done well to, yet they that are of the household of faith, or are in the faith, are in and especial manner to be loved and respected; see <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>; or the sense is, that the apostle loved this lady and her children sincerely and heartily, without dissimulation; not in word and in tongue, but in deed and in truth, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>, <p>and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; either the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the truth; not with a notional knowledge, but with the knowledge of approbation and affection; with a fiducial and appropriating one: or the Gospel, the word of truth; not with a speculative, but with a spiritual and experimental knowledge of it: and this is not to be understood of every individual person then living, which had such a knowledge of the truth; for it cannot be reasonably thought that every individual person should know this lady and her children; but of all such persons who had any knowledge of them; for such who are born again by the word of truth, love not only him that begot them, but all those who are begotten of him: this shows in what sense the word "all" is sometimes taken. <p>(d) Herodian.

That this is most probably the <span class="ital">Apostle</span> John, see Introduction, sec. 1. The reflection on his age may have led the apostle to write, not <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐπίσκοπος</span>, but <span class="greekheb">ὁ πρεσβύτερος</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτῇ κυρίᾳ καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτῆς</span>] The interpretation of these words has from the earliest times been very diverse, according as either <span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτή</span> or <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> has been regarded as a proper noun, or both words have been considered as appellatives. The first opinion (Lyranus, a Lapide, Lorinus, Cappellus, Grotius, Wetstein, etc.) has been with justice given up by modern commentators; it is clearly enough opposed not only by the mode of its conjunction with <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span>, but also by <a href="/2_john/1-13.htm" title="The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.">2 John 1:13</a>. The second view, according to which <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> is the proper noun, is found as early as in Athanasius, and afterwards in Bengel, Carpzovius, Heumann, Krigel (<span class="ital">Commentatio de</span> <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> <span class="ital">Johannis</span>, Lips. 1758), Paulus, Lücke, de Wette, Brückner, Guericke, Düsterdieck, Ebrard, Braune, etc. That <span class="greekheb">Κυρία</span> appeared as a feminine proper name is not to be doubted, see Grutteri, <span class="ital">Inscriptt.</span> p. 1127, num. xi.; comp. Heumann: <span class="ital">Poecile de Cyria Johannis;</span> but if this view be taken, not only is the adjective <span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτή</span> strange, as it never is assigned to any individual in the N. T. as a single predicate except in <a href="/romans/16-13.htm" title="Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.">Romans 16:13</a> (where, however, <span class="greekheb">ἐν κυρίῳ</span> is put along with it), but also its connection with the proper noun, instead of <span class="greekheb">Κυρίᾳ τῇ ἐκλεκτῇ</span>, comp. <a href="/3_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.">3 John 1:1</a>; <a href="/context/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:...">Php 1:1-2</a>; Romans 16. Lücke, it is true, refers to <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1 Peter 1:1</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις</span>; but here the case is different, as <span class="greekheb">παρεπιδήμοις</span> is not a proper noun, as even Brückner admits, though he nevertheless falls back on a “familiar carelessness” in this case.[1] The third interpretation is found in Luther (“the elect woman”), Hornejus, Wolf, Rittmeier (<span class="ital">Diatriba, de electa domina</span>, Helmst. 1706), Baumgarten-Crusius, Sander, etc. According to Epictetus, chap. 62: <span class="greekheb">αἱ γυναῖκες εὐθὺς ἀπὸ τεσσαρεσκαίδεκα ἐτῶν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνδρῶν κυρίαι καλοῦνται</span>, women might certainly be called <span class="greekheb">κυρίαι</span>; but this was plainly only a <span class="ital">polite</span> address, corresponding not to the German “Frau” (woman), but to the German “Herrin” (lady). It hardly corresponds with the apostolic dignity of the author, however, to describe the receiver of the Epistle in the superscription by this name of a conventional politeness.[2] But the opinion of Knauer (<span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1833, Part 2, p. 452 ff.), that by <span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτὴ κυρία</span> is to be understood Mary, the mother of Jesus, lacks any tenable foundation (see Lücke on this passage).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Already at an early date <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> was taken as a symbolic description of the Christian Church; so Jerome (<span class="ital">ep.</span> xi. <span class="ital">ad Ageruchiam</span>) and the Scholiast I. (<span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτὴν κυρίαν λέγει τὴν ἐν τινὶ τόπῳ ἐκκλησίαν</span>), and later Calovius, Whiston, Michaelis, Augusti, Hofmann (in his <span class="ital">Weissagung u. Erfüllung</span>, II. p. 321, and in his <span class="ital">Schriftbew.</span> I. p. 226 ff.), Hilgenfeld (1855), Ewald, etc. It is true the word does not elsewhere appear in this signification, but according to its connection with Him who is <span class="greekheb">ὁ κύριος</span>, the Church <span class="ital">may</span> certainly be called <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> in its relationship to the individual members.[3] Both the contents of the Epistle, which is lacking in the slightest individual reference to a single person, and the way in which John speaks to the receivers of the Epistle and passes judgment on them (comp. what follows in this verse; further, <a href="/context/2_john/1-4.htm" title="I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father....">2 John 1:4-5</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-8.htm" title="Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have worked, but that we receive a full reward.">2 John 1:8</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-10.htm" title="If there come any to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:">2 John 1:10</a>); and, finally, the way in which the sister and her children are mentioned,[4]—are no less <span class="ital">opposed to</span> the opinion that the Epistle was written to one particular woman, than they are <span class="ital">in favour of</span> the opinion that it was directed to a Christian Church; only <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> must not be regarded as the name of honour of any one particular Church, according to Serrarius of the Corinthian Church, or according to Augusti of that of Jerusalem; it is rather a name suitable for every Church, by which, therefore, <span class="ital">that</span> Church could also be described to which the Epistle is directly addressed.[5]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτῆς</span>] If <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> is a description of the Church, the <span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span> are her individual members. The representation of the Church as a mother, and of her members as her children, occurs elsewhere also; comp. <a href="/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὓς ἐγὼ ἀγαπῶ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ</span>] If we take <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> as a proper noun, then <span class="greekheb">οὕς</span> indicates that by <span class="greekheb">τέκνοις</span> only sons are to be understood; but why then does not the apostle write: <span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτῆς</span>? If the <span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span> are the members of the Church, however, then <span class="greekheb">οὕς</span> is used here exactly as <span class="greekheb">τεκνία μου</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὕς</span> in <a href="/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>; comp. also <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a> : <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔθνη</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτούς</span>. Suitable though the masculine is to denote <span class="ital">all</span> Church-members, it would be just as unsuitable to denote members of one <span class="ital">family</span>, if this consisted not merely of sons, but—as Braune here supposes—of daughters also. <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span> is used emphatically, inasmuch as the apostle wants to bring out <span class="ital">his</span> intimate relationship to the members of the Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀληθείᾳ</span> in its connection with <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπῶ</span> is not = <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ</span>, as if the (Christian) truth were thereby indicated as the element in which love has its existence (Bengel, Düsterdieck), but it is used adverbially, not, however, to emphasize the sincerity of the love, but, as the word itself states, the <span class="ital">truth</span> of the love (Ebrard: “I love thee with that love which is a <span class="ital">love</span> in truth;” similarly Lücke: “it is the real <span class="ital">Christian</span> love that is meant,” and Braune).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἐγὼ μόνος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ πάντες</span>] All who have known the truth share with the apostle love to the <span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span> of the <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span>. This addition also goes to show that <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> is not a proper noun; for how could the children of an individual woman be regarded as an object of the love of all believers? Bengel, with whom Düsterdieck agrees, remarks indeed on this: communio sanctorum, but the apostle’s mode of expression presupposes an actual knowledge about one another. Several commentators accordingly have recourse to a weakening of the idea <span class="greekheb">πάντες</span>,[6] which, however, is arbitrary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> is the divine truth, of which the believer becomes a partaker in Christ. The emphasis of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΉΘΕΙΑ</span></span></span> both here and in <a href="/2_john/1-2.htm" title="For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us for ever.">2 John 1:2</a> is caused by the antithesis to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΆΝΟΙ</span></span></span> (<a href="/2_john/1-7.htm" title="For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.">2 John 1:7</a>). The bracketing of the words: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΟὐΚ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΤῊΝ ἈΛΉΘΕΙΑΝ</span></span></span>, “spoils the clearness of the connection, and is also logically not quite correct, because <a href="/2_john/1-2.htm" title="For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us for ever.">2 John 1:2</a> refers not only to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓΏ</span></span></span>, but also to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΝΤΕς</span></span></span>” (Lücke).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1] According to Ewald, it is “foolish to think” that “the apostle is here writing to an individual woman.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2] Against the distinction between the expressions “Frau” and “Herrin,” Braune adduces the etymology of the former word (Frau, feminine of <span class="ital">fro</span> = Herr); this is quite irrelevant here, however, as it is not the <span class="ital">German</span>, but the <span class="ital">Greek</span>, expressions, that are in question; it is the distinction between <span class="greekheb">γυνή</span> and <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span>. That “Frau” originally corresponded to the expression <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> is certain,—the word is even yet frequently used in this sense,—but it docs not therefore follow that the Greek <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> became so much weakened in usage as the German word “Frau.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3] Hofmann recalls the description of the Church in the Apocalypse as the <span class="greekheb">νύμφη</span> and the <span class="greekheb">γυνή</span>. When Ebrard objects to this, that the Church in contrast with the “Lord” is not “the lady,” but the obedient handmaid, it must be remembered that she is here spoken of not in regard to her subordinate relationship to Christ, but in regard to her superior relationship to her individual members.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4] De Wette also says: “The way in which her sister and her sister’s children are mentioned is favourable to the idea that a single Christian Church is meant.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[5] That the Epistle is directly addressed to a particular Church is evident from ver. 12; the want of references to individual circumstances may perhaps be explained by the fact that it also had an encyclical design; that the author, however, “had in view <span class="ital">the whole of orthodox Christendom</span>” (Hilgenfeld), is just as little appropriate to this Epistle as to the First.—Braune’s considerations are of little importance; the name of the Church might be omitted, because the bearer of the Epistle knew to what Church he had to take it; <span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτή</span> is by no means unsuitable with <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> = <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία</span>, according to <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι συνεκλεκτή</span> (by which the Church is certainly to be understood); it has not been asserted that the relationship of the mother in <a href="/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a> has been given to a single Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[6] Hornejus: omnes fideles, non quidem qui in toto orbe tum temporis erant, sed qui in illis partibus et simul Dominam illam et liberos ejus norant.—Lücke: “<span class="greekheb">πάντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">i.e.</span> all Christians (perhaps of this place?) who know the Kyria and her children;” Braune agrees with this explanation, but would regard “as included, even those who would later become acquainted with her”—which is clearly unsuitable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;...">2 John 1:1-3</a>.

John would scarcely have chosen, as being too indistinct. On the other hand an Elder, who did <span class="ital">not</span> wish to personate the Apostle, would hardly call himself ‘<span class="ital">The</span> Elder.’ It is in addressing Elders that S. Peter calls himself a ‘fellow-elder’ (<a href="/1_peter/5-1.htm" title="The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:">1 Peter 5:1</a>). “The use of the word in this Epistle shews that he cannot have understood this title in the usual ecclesiastical sense, as though he were only one among many presbyters of a community. Clearly the writer meant thereby to express the singular and lofty position he held in the circle around him, as the teacher venerable for his old age, and the last of the Apostles” (Döllinger). “In this connexion there can be little doubt that it describes not age simply but official position” (Westcott). See Appendix E.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto the elect Lady</span>] Or possibly, <span class="ital">unto the elect</span> <span class="bld">Kyria</span>: but the other is better, as leaving open the question, which cannot be determined with any approach to certainty, whether the letter is addressed to an individual or to a community. There is no article in the Greek, so that ‘to <span class="ital">an</span> elect lady’ is a possible translation. If we make <span class="greekheb">κυρία</span> a proper name (and no doubt there was such a name in use), we are committed to the former alternative. The rendering ‘to the <span class="ital">lady Electa</span>’ may be safely dismissed, if only on account of <span class="ital"><a href="/2_john/1-13.htm" title="The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.">2 John 1:13</a></span>. If Electa is a proper name here, it is a proper name there; which involves two sisters each bearing the same extraordinary name. Comp. ‘to <span class="ital">the elect</span> who are sojourners of the Dispersion’ (<a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1 Peter 1:1</a>), and ‘for the <span class="ital">elect’s</span> sake’ (<a href="/2_timothy/2-10.htm" title="Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.">2 Timothy 2:10</a>).

In the Greek ‘the lady’ is feminine, ‘the children’ are neuter, ‘whom’ is masculine. No argument can be drawn from this as to whether a Christian family or a Church is to be understood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but also all they that have known</span>] Better, as R. V., <span class="ital">but also all they that</span> <span class="bld">know</span>: literally, <span class="ital">that have come to know</span> (see on <a href="/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1 John 2:3</a>). At first sight this looks like a strong argument in favour of the view that ‘the elect Lady’ is a Church. “How could the children of an individual woman be regarded as an object of the love of all believers”? The First Epistle is the answer to the question. Every one who ‘has come to know the truth’ enters that ‘Communion of Saints’ of which the love of each for every other is the very condition of existence. The Apostle speaks first in his own name, and then in the name of every Christian. “For all Catholics throughout the world follow one rule of truth: but all heretics and infidels do not agree in unanimous error; they impugn one another not less than the way of truth itself” (Bede).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1–3.

In its fulness the salutation reminds us of the elaborate openings of the Epistles to the Romans, Galatians, and to Titus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;">2 John 1:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ πρεσβύτερος</span>, <span class="ital">The Elder</span>) This Epistle also has three parts:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I.&emsp;&emsp;THE INSCRIPTION, <a href="/context/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;...">2 John 1:1-2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>II.

Other apostles had been called elders; their successors also were called elders; but St. John was "the elder." That there was a second John at Ephesus, who was known as "the elder," to distinguish him from the apostle and evangelist, is a theory of Eusebius, based upon a doubtful interpretation of an awkwardly worded passage in Papias. But it is by no means certain that any such person ever existed. Irenaeus, who had read Papias, and been intimate with Polycarp, the disciple of St. John, seems to know nothing of any such person. Even if he existed, there is little reason for attributing this Epistle to him; it is too like the First Epistle to be by a different author. Unto the elect lady. This rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> should be retained: <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span> <span class="accented">cannot be a</span> proper name, on account of verse 13; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> need not be one. We commit ourselves to nothing that is disputable if we render <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> "lady;" whereas if we render it "Kyria" it is open to any one to object that perhaps the lady's name was not Kyria, and that perhaps she is not an individual at all, but a Church. She is elect, as being chosen out of the dominion of the evil one (<a href="/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>) into the Christian family. She is thus reminded at the outset of the relationship between them; she is a member of that elect company of believers of which he is the elder. It is futile to ask who this lady is. There have been various conjectures, some of them absurd; but we know no more than the letter itself tells us. Evidently the lady and her children were not among the great ones of the earth; they have made no name in the world. And herein lies one of the chief lessons of the Epistle. Those mentioned in it were ordinary people, such as any Church in any generation might produce. But because they were faithful, and endeavoured to live up to their calling, the apostle loved them, and all true Christians loved them, and he dared to assure them that "grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father" should be their portion. Any Christian minister may give the same assurance to faithful Christians, however humble and inconspicuous, still. They may win no place in the history of the world that is passing away; but they have a place in the heart of him who abideth for ever. Note the characteristic repetition of the characteristic word "truth," which occurs five times in the first four verses. All words respecting truth and bearing witness to it are characteristic of St. John. In two of the five cases "truth" has the article; "all they that know <span class="accented">the</span> truth; for <span class="accented">the</span> truth's sake which abideth in us." It is not impossible that "the truth" here means him who is the Way, the Truth and the Life. Christ is the Revelation of Divine truth to man. All who know him love all faithful Christians for his sake. To the apostle truth was not a mere notion, "or a set of notions, however large and accurate; it was no theory about God, but God himself, and God manifest in the flesh in order that we might know him and partake his life." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The elder (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>The word is used originally of seniority in age.

It is supposed by some that the title describes a person, by others, a society. The views of the former class as to the person designated, are (1.) That the letter was addressed to a certain Babylonian named Electa. (2.) To a person named Kyria. (3.) To Electa Kyria, a compound proper name. Those who regard the phrase as describing a society, divide on the question whether a particular Christian society or the whole Church is intended. It is impossible to settle the question satisfactorily.<p>Children (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>May be taken either in a literal or in a spiritual sense.
