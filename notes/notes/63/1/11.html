Such a one is a deceiver and an antichrist; he deludes souls, and undermines the glory and kingdom of the Lord Christ. Let us not think it strange, that there are deceivers and opposers of the Lord Christ's name and dignity now, for there were such, even in the apostles' times. The more deceivers and deceits abound, the more watchful the disciples must be. Sad it is, that splendid attainments in the school of Christ, should ever be lost. The way to gain the full reward is, to abide true to Christ, and constant in religion to the end. Firm cleaving to Christian truth unites us to Christ, and thereby to the Father also; for they are one. Let us equally disregard such as abide not in the doctrine of Christ, and those who transgress his commands. Any who did not profess and preach the doctrine of Christ, respecting him as the Son of God, and salvation by him from guilt and sin, were not to be noticed and countenanced. Yet in obeying this command, we must show kindness and a good spirit to those who differ from us in lesser matters, but hold firmly the all-important doctrines of Christ's person, atonement, and holy salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he that biddeth him God speed, is partaker of his evil deeds - Shows that he countenances and approves of the doctrine which is taught.

By wishing a false brother or teacher "God (or 'good') speed," you imply that he is capable as such of good speed and joy (the literal meaning of the Greek), and that you wish him it while opposing Christ; so you identify yourself with "his evil deeds." The Greek of "partaker" is "having communion with." We cannot have communion with saints and with Antichrist at the same time. Here we see John's naturally fiery zeal directed to a right end. Polycarp, the disciple of John, told contemporaries of Iren&aelig;us, who narrates the story on their authority, that on one occasion when John was about to bathe, and heard that Cerinthus, the heretic, was within, he retired with abhorrence, exclaiming, Surely the house will fall in ruins since the enemy of the truth is there.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_john/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/2_john/1-10.htm" title="If there come any to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:">2Jo 1:10</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_john/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he that biddeth him God speed,....

Confirmation of the preceding prohibition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ λέγων γὰρ αὐτῷ χαίρειν</span>] The apostle mentions only this one thing, because what he says about it is self-evident in regard to the rest also.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κοινωνεῖ τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ τοῖς πονηροῖς</span>] <span class="ital">i.e.</span> inasmuch as the <span class="greekheb">χαίρειν λέγειν</span> is not merely an outward display of politeness, but an expression of an intimate relation of fellowship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔργα τὰ πονηρά</span> we are to understand, of course, the false doctrine, but, at the same time, along with this the whole evil character of the false teachers, which was very closely connected with their doctrine.[14]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[14] De Wette’s remark, justly rejected by Brückner, is utterly erroneous: “This prohibition finds its justification in polemic zeal, and the necessity for defence against what seemed fatal to the maintenance of the Church. We, with the sure foundation of the Christian Church, and <span class="ital">in accordance with the higher view, then perhaps impossible, that man even in his errors still remains man, and an object of esteem and love, see in it impatience.</span>”—Difficult though it may be under present circumstances, considering the development which doctrine has taken, in many particular cases rightly to apply what is here said by John, yet it must still be regarded as a valid maxim, not only that the Christian should remain conscious of the antithesis between anti-Christianity and Christianity, but also that he should not deny this consciousness in his conduct towards his neighbour.—Besser unjustifiably seeks to make use of the expression of the apostle as a weapon against union.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_john/1-11.htm" title="For he that bids him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.">2 John 1:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">κοινωνεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1 John 1:3</a>.

The adjective is an emphatic afterthought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This counsel recalls the story of St. John’s behaviour to Cerinthus (see Introd. p. 157), and it was cited by Irenæus (i. ix. 3) as inculcating intolerance of heretics. If so, it is certainly an unChristian counsel, contrary to the spirit and teaching of our Lord (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/mark/9-38.htm" title="And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and he follows not us: and we forbade him, because he follows not us....">Mark 9:38-39</a>; <a href="/context/luke/9-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,...">Luke 9:51-56</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/13-28.htm" title="He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Will you then that we go and gather them up?...">Matthew 13:28-29</a>). Heretics are our fellow-creatures; Jesus died for them also, and our office is to win them. If we close our doors and our hearts against them, we lose our opportunity of winning them and harden them in their opposition. There are two thoughts which may well teach us forbearance and humility: (1) The patience of the Lord. A Jewish fable tells how Abraham thrust an aged wayfarer from his tent because he asked no blessing on his food and avowed himself a fire-worshipper. And the Lord said: “I have suffered him these hundred years, although he dishonoured Me; and couldst not thou endure him for one night?” (2) The mystery of the things of God and the blindness of our intellects. “Illi,” says St. Augustine (<span class="ital">Contra Epistolam Manichcæi</span>, 2), “in vos sæviant, qui neseiunt cum quo labore verum inveniatur, et quam difficile caveantur errores”. This counsel of the Apostle must be read in the light of local circumstances. There was need of caution and discrimination in receiving the itinerant “apostles and prophets” who went from church to church, lest they should prove “false apostles” (<span class="greekheb">ψευδαπόστολοι</span>) and “false prophets” (<span class="greekheb">ψευδοπροφῆται</span>). See <span class="ital">Didache</span>, xi.–xii., where the test is given: <span class="greekheb">οὐ πᾶς ὁ λαλῶν ἐν πνεύματι προφήτης ἐστίν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἐὰν ἔχῃ τοὺς τπρόπους Κυρίου</span>. It is not until the second century that there is any appearance of buildings set apart for worship. The primitive <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησίαι</span> met in private houses (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/16-5.htm" title="Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.">Romans 16:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you.

She must neither let him pervert “the church in her house” nor send him on his way to a neighbouring church with the recommendation of her confidence and goodwill. This is expressed, though somewhat vaguely, by Clem. Alex.: “Hoc in hujusmodi non est inhumanum, sed nec conquirere vel condisputare cum talibus admonet qui non valent intelligibiliter divina tractare, ne per eos traducantur a doctrina veritatis, verisimilibus inducti rationibus. Arbitror autem, quia et orare cum talibus non oportet, quoniam in oratione quæ fit in domo, postquam ab orando surgitur, salutatio gaudii est et pacis indicium.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">For he that biddeth him God speed</span>] Much more, therefore, he that by receiving him into his house affords a home and head-quarters for false teaching.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is partaker of his evil deeds</span>] More accurately, as R. V., <span class="bld">partaketh in</span> <span class="ital">his evil</span> <span class="bld">works</span>: literally, with much emphasis on ‘evil’, <span class="ital">partaketh in his works, his evil</span> (<span class="ital">works</span>). The word for ‘partake’ (<span class="greekheb">κοινωνεῖν</span>) occurs nowhere else in S. John, but is cognate with the word for ‘fellowship’ (<span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span>), <a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1 John 1:3</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:...">1 John 1:6-7</a>. The word for ‘evil’ (<span class="greekheb">πονηρός</span>) is the same as that used of ‘the evil one’, <a href="/context/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning.

I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father....">1 John 2:13-14</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm" title="Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.

What is involved, therefore, in having fellowship with such men is obvious. At a Council of Carthage (a.d. 256), when Cyprian uttered his famous invective against Stephen, Bishop of Rome,—Aurelius, Bishop of Chullabi, quoted this passage with the introductory remark, “John the Apostle laid it down in his Epistle”: and Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria (c. a.d. 315), quotes the passage as an injunction of “the blessed John” (Socrates <span class="ital">H.E.</span> I. vi.). The change from ‘deeds’ to ‘works’ may seem frivolous and vexatious, but it is not unimportant. ‘Works’ is a wider word and better represents <span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span>: words no less than deeds are included, and here it is specially the words of these deceivers that is meant. Moreover in <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm" title="Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.">1 John 3:12</a> the same word is rendered ‘works’ of the ‘evil works’ of Cain. See on <a href="/john/5-20.htm" title="For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.">John 5:20</a>; <a href="/john/6-27.htm" title="Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.">John 6:27</a>; <a href="/john/6-29.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent.">John 6:29</a>.
