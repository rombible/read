This shows the propriety of the apostle’s advice to this pious matron and her children. 2d, That as the Christians in those days exercised hospitality to their stranger brethren, who were employed in spreading the gospel; so the Christian sister to whom the apostle wrote this letter, being probably rich, and of a benevolent disposition, thought herself under an obligation to supply the wants of those strangers who went about preaching. Wherefore, to prevent her from being deceived by impostors, the apostle here directs her to require such teachers to give an account of the doctrines which they taught; and if she found that they did not hold the true Christian doctrine, he advised her not to receive them into her house, nor to give them any countenance. And this advice of the apostle was certainly perfectly proper, because they who entertained, or otherwise showed respect to, false teachers, enabled them the more effectually to spread their erroneous doctrine, to the seduction and ruin of those whom they deceived.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:7-11 The deceiver and his deceit are described: he brings some error concerning the person or office of the Lord Jesus. Such a one is a deceiver and an antichrist; he deludes souls, and undermines the glory and kingdom of the Lord Christ. Let us not think it strange, that there are deceivers and opposers of the Lord Christ's name and dignity now, for there were such, even in the apostles' times. The more deceivers and deceits abound, the more watchful the disciples must be. Sad it is, that splendid attainments in the school of Christ, should ever be lost. The way to gain the full reward is, to abide true to Christ, and constant in religion to the end. Firm cleaving to Christian truth unites us to Christ, and thereby to the Father also; for they are one. Let us equally disregard such as abide not in the doctrine of Christ, and those who transgress his commands. Any who did not profess and preach the doctrine of Christ, respecting him as the Son of God, and salvation by him from guilt and sin, were not to be noticed and countenanced. Yet in obeying this command, we must show kindness and a good spirit to those who differ from us in lesser matters, but hold firmly the all-important doctrines of Christ's person, atonement, and holy salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If there come any unto you - Any professed teacher of religion. There can be no doubt that she to whom this Epistle was written was accustomed to entertain such teachers.<p>And bring not this doctrine - This doctrine which Christ taught, or the true doctrine respecting him and his religion.<p>Receive him not into your house - This cannot mean that no acts of kindness, in any circumstances, were to be shown to such persons; but that there was to be nothing done which could be fairly construed as encouraging or countenancing them as "religious teachers." The true rule would seem to be, in regard to such persons, that, so far as we have contact with them as neighbors, or strangers, we are to be honest, true, kind, and just, but we are to do nothing that will countenance them as religious teachers, We are not to aid their instruction, <a href="/proverbs/19-27.htm">Proverbs 19:27</a>; we are not to receive them into our houses, or to entertain them as religious teachers; we are not to commend them to others, or to give them any reason to use our names or influence in propagating error. It would not be difficult to practice this rule, and yet to show to others all the kindness, and all the attention in circumstances of need, which religion demands. A person who is truly consistent is never suspected of countenancing error, even when he is distinguished for liberality, and is ready, like the good Samaritan, to pour in oil and wine in the wounds of any waylaid traveler. The command not to "receive such an one into the house," in such circumstances as those referred to by John, would be probably understood literally, as he doubtless designed that it should be. To do that, to meet such persons with a friendly greeting, would be construed as countenancing their doctrine, and as commending them to others; and hence it was forbidden that they should be entertained as such. This treatment would not be demanded where no such interpretation could be put on receiving a friend or relative who held different and even erroneous views, or in showing kindness to a stranger who differed from us, but it would apply to the receiving and entertaining "a professed teacher of religion, as such;" and the rule is as applicable now as it was then.<p>Neither bid him God speed - &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  Kai chairein auto&#772; me&#772; legete - "and do not say to him, hail, or joy."

The particle <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span> is used here because “the case is put as if actual” (Winer).

It is only with this interpretation that the prohibition of the apostle can be correctly understood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μὴ λαμβάνετε αὐτὸν εἰς οἰκίαν</span>] is to be understood of the hospitable reception into our house, which is to be accorded to the brethren as such; the apostle therefore forbids the brotherly reception of such as <span class="ital">bring</span> not the doctrine of Christ, but another doctrine opposed to it, and are, accordingly, assiduous in asserting the latter. The limitation of the prohibition to the relationship of <span class="greekheb">φιλοξενία</span> (<a href="/romans/12-13.htm" title="Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm" title="Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.">Hebrews 13:2</a>) finds no support in the words of the apostle. Now such a <span class="greekheb">κρίσις</span> was so much the more necessary the more the false teachers sought to abuse the Christian hospitality, in order to gain for themselves access to the Churches; comp. <a href="/2_timothy/3-6.htm" title="For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,">2 Timothy 3:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ χαίρειν αὐτῷ μὴ λέγετε</span>] It is arbitrary to limit this prohibition, with Clemens Alex., to the salutatio, quae fiebat, postquam surgebatur ab oratione solemni velut gaudii et pacis indicium; as well as to interpret it in <span class="ital">that</span> degree of generality which a Lapide gives it when he says: vetat hic Joh. omne colloquium, omne consortium, omne commercium cum haereticis; just as little is it to be interpreted, with Vitringa (<span class="ital">de Synag. vet.</span> p. 759), of the excommunication proper. This prohibition is in closest connection with the preceding, and similarly refers to <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις ἔρχεται πρὸς ὑμᾶς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; it is meant to strengthen the former; not merely the hospitable reception into the house, but also the friendly greeting of the false teacher, if he comes as a Christian brother, is not to take place[13] (comp. Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew.</span> II. 2, p. 339). The word <span class="greekheb">χαίρειν</span>, as a formula of salutation, appears frequently both in the classics and also in the N.

The phrase ‘to bring doctrine’ occurs nowhere else in N. T., but it is on the analogy of ‘to bring a message, to bring word’ (Hom. <span class="ital">Il.</span> XV. 15, 175 &c.): comp. ‘What accusation <span class="ital">bring</span> ye’? (<a href="/john/18-29.htm" title="Pilate then went out to them, and said, What accusation bring you against this man?">John 18:29</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">receive him not into your house</span>] ‘Refuse him the hospitality which as a matter of course you would shew to a faithful Christian’. Charity has its limits: it must not be shewn to one man in such a way as to do grievous harm to others; still less must it be shewn in such a way as to do more harm than good to the recipient of it. If these deceivers were treated as if they were true Christians, (1) their opportunities of doing harm would be greatly increased, (2) they might never be brought to see their own errors. “S. John is at once earnestly dogmatic and earnestly philanthropic; for the Incarnation has taught him both the preciousness of man and the preciousness of truth” (Liddon). The famous story respecting S. John and Cerinthus in the public baths is confirmed in its main outlines by this injunction to the elect lady, which it explains and illustrates. See the Introduction, p. 24.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The greatest care will be necessary before we can venture to act upon the injunction here given to the elect lady. We must ask, <span class="ital">Are the cases really parallel</span>? Am I quite sure that the man in question is an unbeliever and a <span class="ital">teacher</span> of infidelity? Will my shewing him hospitality aid him in teaching infidelity? Am I and mine in any danger of being infected by his errors? Is he more likely to be impressed by severity or gentleness? Is severity likely to create sympathy in others, first for him, and then for his teaching? In not a few cases the differences between Christianity in the first century and Christianity in the nineteenth would at once destroy the analogy between these antichristian Gnostics visiting Kyria and an Agnostic visiting one of ourselves. Let us never forget the way in which the Lord treated Pharisees, publicans and sinners.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither bid him God speed</span>] ‘Give him no greeting’ is perhaps too narrow, whether as translation or interpretation. <span class="bld">And do not bid him, God speed</span> will perhaps be a better rendering; and the injunction will cover any act which might seem to give sanction to the false doctrine or shew sympathy with it. The word for ‘God speed’ (<span class="greekheb">χαίρειν</span>) is used in a similar sense <a href="/acts/15-23.htm" title="And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.">Acts 15:23</a>; <a href="/acts/23-26.htm" title="Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix sends greeting.">Acts 23:26</a>; <a href="/james/1-1.htm" title="James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.">James 1:1</a> : comp. <a href="/john/19-3.htm" title="And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.">John 19:3</a>, &c.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_john/1-10.htm" title="If there come any to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:">2 John 1:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔρχεται</span>, <span class="ital">comes</span>) as a teacher or brother.—<span class="greekheb">ταύτην</span>) <span class="ital">this</span>, of Christ.—<span class="greekheb">οὐ φέρει</span>, <span class="ital">does not bring</span>) by a true profession.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>) <span class="ital">and</span> moreover.—<span class="greekheb">χαίρειν</span>, <span class="ital">salutation</span>) Let him be to you as a heathen, to whom however <span class="ital">a salutation</span> is more safely addressed: <a href="/1_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortionists, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world.">1 Corinthians 5:10</a>.

"If people of this kind come - and it is well known that they do - do not receive them or give them a welcome." It is of the utmost importance to remember that St. John is here giving a rule for a special case, not laying down a general principle. His words give no sanction to the view that no hospitality is to be shown to heretics, still less to the monstrous mediaeval doctrine that no faith need be kept with them. The apostle is giving directions to a particular Christian household during a particular crisis in the history of the Christian faith. It by no means follows that he would have given the same directions to every household during that crisis, or to any household under totally different circumstances. We may well believe that he would not have followed them himself, but would have endeavoured "to convince the gainsayers." His charity towards them would not have been misunderstood, and his faith would not have been in danger of being subverted. It was otherwise with her and her children, as experience had proved. And before we take this verse as a rule for our own guidance, we must consider the difference, which may well constitute an essential difference, between a time in which those who confessed Jesus Christ coming in the flesh were a despised and persecuted handful, and one in which some courage is required to avow that one denies him. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>If there come any (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Better, Rev., if anyone cometh.
