There is a special fitness in the emphasis thus laid upon the seeing Him, in the case of one whose very power to see was witness to the presence of the Messiah. The words do not refer to any earlier meeting, but the perfect tense refers to the completion of the act of vision and the abiding impression.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:35-38 Christ owns those who own him and his truth and ways. There is particular notice taken of such a suffer in the cause of Christ, and for the testimony of a good conscience. Our Lord Jesus graciously reveals himself to the man. Now he was made sensible what an unspeakable mercy it was, to be cured of his blindness, that he might see the Son of God. None but God is to be worshipped; so that in worshipping Jesus, he owned him to be God. All who believe in him, will worship him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is he? - It is probable that the man did not know that he who now addressed him was the same who had healed him. He had not yet seen him <a href="//biblehub.com/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>, but he was prepared to acknowledge him when he did see him. He inquired, therefore, who the person was, or wished that he might be pointed out to him, that he might see him. This passage shows that he was disposed to believe, and had a strong desire to see and hear the Son of God.<p>Lord - This word here, as in many other instances in the New Testament, means "Sir." It is clear that the man did not know that it was the Lord Jesus that addressed him, and he therefore replied to him in the common language of respect, and asked him to point out to him the Son of God. The word translated "Lord" here is rendered "Sir" in <a href="/john/4-11.htm">John 4:11</a>; <a href="/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a>; <a href="/john/12-21.htm">John 12:21</a>; <a href="/acts/16-30.htm">Acts 16:30</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>.

It is very observable here, that miracles do not work faith, but confirm it. The blind man had experienced here a miracle wrought upon himself, but yet he is an unbeliever, until the Lord cometh to give him the revelation of his word: <span class="ital">faith cometh by hearing:</span> but together with this word we must also conceive a mighty power to have flowed from Christ, inwardly enlightening him, and enabling him to discern the truth of what he told him, and making him yet further willing to receive him, and close with him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jesus said unto him,....

Nowhere does our Lord more openly admit that he as the Christ, the Son of God. The disciples scarcely rise beyond the climax of this revelation even on the night of the Passion. The man's faith was waiting for its Object, and the vision comes to his unscaled spiritual vision. </body></html>
