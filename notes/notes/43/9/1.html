The day was the Sabbath of the preceding discourse, now drawing to its close. (Comp. <a href="/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>; <a href="/john/9-14.htm" title="And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.">John 9:14</a>, and <a href="/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>.)

Of the six miracles connected with blindness which are recorded in the Gospels, this is the only case described as blindness from birth. In this lies its special characteristic, for “since the world began, was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind” (<a href="/john/9-32.htm" title="Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.">John 9:32</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/9-1.htm" title="And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth....">John 9:1-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">And as Jesus passed by </span>— The word Jesus is not in the Greek, which is <span class="greekheb">παραγων ειδεν ανθρωπον τυφλον</span>, <span class="ital">and passing on; he found a man blind from his birth </span>— This chapter, therefore, seems to be a continuation of the preceding. As Jesus and his disciples (having left the temple, where the Jews were going to stone him) were passing through one of the streets of the city, they found a blind beggar, who, to move the people’s compassion, told them he was born in that miserable condition. The disciples, on hearing this, asked their Master whether it was the man’s own sin, or the sin of his parents, which had occasioned his blindness from the womb. It seems the Jews, having derived from the Egyptians the doctrines of the pre-existence and transmigration of souls, supposed that men were punished in this world for the sins they had committed in their pre-existent state. The purport of that doctrine was, that, if a man behaved himself amiss, his soul was afterward sent into another body, where he met with great calamities, and lived in a more miserable condition than before; whereas a more advantageous situation, and happier condition than the former, were supposed to be the rewards of distinguished virtue; a notion which they borrowed from the Pythagoreans, and which seems to be hinted at by Josephus, (<span class="ital">Bell., </span>lib. 2. cap. 12,) and is plainly referred to, <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/8-19.htm" title="For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit....">Wis 8:19-20</a>; compare <a href="/matthew/14-2.htm" title="And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Matthew 14:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-14.htm" title="And they said, Some say that you are John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.">Matthew 16:14</a>. “From the account which Josephus gives, however, of this matter, it appears, the Pharisees believed that the souls of good men only went into other bodies; whereas the souls of the wicked, they thought, went immediately into eternal punishment: an opinion somewhat different from that which the disciples expressed on this occasion. For, if they spake accurately, they must have thought that, in his pre-existent state, this person had been a sinner, and was now punished for his sins then committed, by having his soul thrust into a blind body. Nevertheless, from what they say, we cannot certainly determine whether they thought that, in his pre-existent state, this person had lived on earth as a man, which is the notion Josephus describes, or whether they fancied he had pre-existed in some higher order of being, which was the Platonic notion.” Now the disciples might possibly have been acquainted with these opinions, and might put the question in the text, on purpose to know their Master’s decision on so curious a subject. It seems more probable, however, as Theophylact has observed, after Chrysostom, that, as they were plain, illiterate fishermen, they had not heard of any such notions. Another opinion imbibed by the Jews during their captivity was, that all their sufferings descended upon them from the crimes of their forefathers, and were wholly unmerited on their part. It was this opinion which drew from the pen of Ezekiel that severe remonstrance and animated vindication of the ways of Providence, in his eighteenth chapter. Some remains of this opinion might have possessed the minds of the apostles: and they might have supposed they saw in the man born blind a case which could not be accounted for, but by supposing him to suffer for his parents’ guilt. But our Lord showed them that the case admitted of a very different solution; <span class="ital">Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned nor his parents </span>— So as to bring this suffering upon him; nor was the punishment of either the chief design of this dispensation of Providence; <span class="ital">but that the works of God </span>— Namely, his miraculous works; <span class="ital">should be made manifest in him </span>— Particularly his sovereignty, in bringing him into the world blind; his power, in conferring the faculty of sight upon him; and his goodness, in bearing witness to the doctrine by which men are to be saved.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-7 Christ cured many who were blind by disease or accident; here he cured one born blind. Thus he showed his power to help in the most desperate cases, and the work of his grace upon the souls of sinners, which gives sight to those blind by nature. This poor man could not see Christ, but Christ saw him. And if we know or apprehend anything of Christ, it is because we were first known of him. Christ says of uncommon calamities, that they are not always to be looked on as special punishments of sin; sometimes they are for the glory of God, and to manifest his works. Our life is our day, in which it concerns us to do the work of the day. We must be busy, and not waste day-time; it will be time to rest when our day is done, for it is but a day. The approach of death should quicken us to improve all our opportunities of doing and getting good. What good we have an opportunity to do, we should do quickly. And he that will never do a good work till there is nothing to be objected against, will leave many a good work for ever undone, Ec 11:4. Christ magnified his power, in making a blind man to see, doing that which one would think more likely to make a seeing man blind. Human reason cannot judge of the Lord's methods; he uses means and instruments that men despise. Those that would be healed by Christ must be ruled by him. He came back from the pool wondering and wondered at; he came seeing. This represents the benefits in attending on ordinances of Christ's appointment; souls go weak, and come away strengthened; go doubting, and come away satisfied; go mourning, and come away rejoicing; go blind, and come away seeing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As Jesus passed by - As he was leaving the temple, <a href="/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>.

This healing of the blind is not <span class="ital">intended</span> to have a figurative import, though it is afterwards <span class="ital">used</span> (<a href="/john/9-39.htm" title="And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.">John 9:39</a> ff.) as a figurative representation of a great idea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τίς ἥμαρτεν</span>, etc.] The notion of the disciples is not, that <span class="ital">neither</span> the one <span class="ital">nor</span> the other could be the case (Euth. Zigabenus, Ebrard, comp. also Hengstenberg); but, as the positive mode of putting the dilemma shows, that <span class="ital">either the one or the other</span> must be the case. See Baeumlein, <span class="ital">Partic</span>. p. 132. They were still possessed by the popular idea (comp. on <a href="/matthew/9-2.htm" title="And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; your sins be forgiven you.">Matthew 9:2</a>, also the book of Job, and <a href="/acts/28-4.htm" title="And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffers not to live.">Acts 28:4</a>) that special misfortunes are the punishment of special sins; against which view Jesus, here and in <a href="/luke/13-9.htm" title="And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that you shall cut it down.">Luke 13:9</a> ff., decidedly declares Himself. Now, as the man was <span class="ital">born</span> blind, <span class="ital">either</span> it must have been the guilt of his <span class="ital">parents</span>, which he was expiating,—a belief which, in accordance with <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;">Exodus 20:5</a>, was very prevalent (Lightfoot, p. 1048), and existed even among the Greeks (Maetzner in <span class="ital">Lycurg. in Leocr</span>. p. 217),—<span class="ital">or he himself</span> must have sinned even whilst in the womb of his mother. The latter alternative was grounded in the popular notion that even an embryo experiences emotions (comp. <a href="/luke/1-41.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:">Luke 1:41</a>; <a href="/luke/1-43.htm" title="And what is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?">Luke 1:43</a>), especially evil emotions, and that the latter predominate (see Sanhedr. f. 91. 2; Beresh. Rabba, f. 38. 1, b.; Lightfoot), comp. Wetstein. The explanation of the question from the belief (which there is also no right to assume as presupposed in <a href="/matthew/14-2.htm" title="And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Matthew 14:2</a>) in the <span class="ital">transmigration of souls</span> (Calvin, Beza, Drusius, Aretius, Grotius, Hammond, Clericus, and several others) is as inadmissible as the assumption of a belief in the <span class="ital">pre-existence of souls</span> (Cyril, De Wette, Brückner). For apart from the uncertainty of the fact whether the doctrine of the transmigration of souls was entertained by the Jews in the days of Christ (see Tholuck on the passage, and Delitzsch <span class="ital">Psychol</span>. p. 463 f. [E. T. p. 545 f.]), those two doctrines could not have been popularly known among the people, and therefore must not be assumed to have been held by the disciples, although it is true that the pre-existence of souls, both of good and bad, is an unquestionable article of doctrine in <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/8-19.htm" title="For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit.">Wis 8:19</a> f., as also with Philo and the Essenes, with the Rabbins, and in the Cabbala (see Grimm on <span class="ital">Wisdom</span> of Solomon in the <span class="ital">Exeget. Handb</span>. p. 177 f.; Bruch, <span class="ital">Lehre v. d. Prae-existenz d. Seel</span>. p. 22). It is quite out of place, however, to refer to the <span class="ital">heathen</span> view of the pre-existence of souls (Isidorus and Severus in <span class="ital">Corder. Cat</span>). Tholuck’s suggestion, finally, that the thought, though obscurely conceived, is, that the blind man, through being born blind, is marked out as a sinner in virtue of an <span class="ital">anticipation</span> of punishment, both contradicts the words, and is altogether destitute of biblical support. In Luthardt’s view, the disciples, in accordance with <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;">Exodus 20:5</a>, regarded the second of the two supposed cases as alone possible, but mentioned the first as a possibility, in order that <span class="ital">Christ</span> might solve the riddle which <span class="ital">they</span> were unable to solve. Similarly Baeumlein and Delitzsch, who looks upon the question as the mere expression of perplexity resulting from a false premiss. It is an arbitrary procedure, however, to ascribe such a difference to two cases regarding which a question is asked in <span class="ital">precisely the same form</span>, or to treat the possibility in the one case as posited merely in appearance. The disciples considered <span class="ital">both</span> cases <span class="ital">possible</span>, and wished to know which of them was <span class="ital">real</span>. At the same time, however, they deemed a <span class="ital">third</span> case out of the question, and this was the error in the dilemma which they put forth,—an error which Jesus (<a href="/john/9-3.htm" title="Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.">John 9:3</a>) lays bare and corrects by setting before them the <span class="ital">Tertium datur</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα τυφλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γενν</span>.] The retributive result, in accordance with the teleological connection of the divine destiny. That the man was <span class="ital">born</span> blind might have been previously known to those who asked the question; or the man himself might just have informed them of the fact, for the purpose of adding force to his request for alms (<a href="/john/9-8.htm" title="The neighbors therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?">John 9:8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/john/9-1.htm" title="And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth....">John 9:1-7</a>. <span class="ital">The cure narrated</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1–5</span>. The Prelude to the Sign<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">And as Jesus passed by</span>] Or, <span class="ital">And as He was passing by</span>. This was possibly on His way from the Temple (<a href="/john/8-59.htm" title="Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the middle of them, and so passed by.">John 8:59</a>), or it may refer to a later occasion near the Feast of the Dedication (<a href="/john/10-22.htm" title="And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.">John 10:22</a>). We know that this man begged for his living (<span class="ital"><a href="/john/9-8.htm" title="The neighbors therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?">John 9:8</a></span>), and that beggars frequented the gates of the Temple (<a href="/acts/3-2.htm" title="And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;">Acts 3:2</a>), as they frequent the entrances of foreign churches now.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">blind from his birth</span>] The man would be repeatedly stating this fact to passers by. The Greek for ‘from his birth’ occurs nowhere else in N.T. Justin Martyr uses the phrase twice of those whom Christ healed; <span class="ital">Trypho</span> lxix.; <span class="ital">Apol.</span> i. xxii. No source is so probable as this verse, for nowhere else is there an account of Christ’s healing a congenital disease. See on <a href="/john/1-23.htm" title="He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.">John 1:23</a> and <a href="/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/9-1.htm" title="And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.">John 9:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ παράγων</span>, <span class="ital">and passing by</span>) Immediately after the attack of His enemies.—<span class="greekheb">τυφλόν</span>, <span class="ital">blind</span>) Who was begging at the temple. Comp. <a href="/acts/3-2.htm" title="And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;">Acts 3:2</a>, “The lame man, laid at the Beautiful gate of the temple, to ask alms.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> <span class="accented">The Lord confirms by a sign the declaration that he is the Light of the world</span>, <span class="accented">by giving eyesight as well as light</span>. That which had been proclaimed as a great truth of his Being and mission, viz. that he was the Light of the world, was now to be established and confirmed to the disciples by a signal miracle. The "higher criticism" finds explanation of this and other similar miracles at Bethsaida and Jericho, in the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/42-19.htm">Isaiah 42:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>. Volkmar holds that the story of Zacchaeus is thus rewritten! Thoma thinks that we have a spiritualization of the "miracle" on Saul of Tarsus. It would be waste time to point out the differences which are patent to the simplest criticism. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> - the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> suggests relation both in subject-matter, in time, place, occasion, and theme, with that which had preceded - <span class="cmt_word">as Jesus was passing by, going along his way, he saw a man blind from birth</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <a href="/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2</a>; <a href="/acts/14-8.htm">Acts 14:8</a>). He was obviously a well-known beggar, who had often proclaimed the fact that he was blind from birth (see ver. 8). Such a condition and history rendered the cure more difficult and hopeless in the view of ordinary <span class="accented">professors</span> of the healing art, and the juxtaposition of such a symbolic fact with the near activity of those who were boasting of their Abrahamic privilege and their national and mere hereditary advantages, is one of the instances of the unconscious poesy of the gospel history. There he sits, the very type of the race which says, "We <span class="accented">see</span>," but which to Christ's eye was proclaiming its utter helplessness and blindness, not asking even to be illumined, and revealing the fundamental injury done to the very race and nature of man, and calling for all the healing power that he had been sent into the world to dispense. The man who had been struck blind, or whose eyesight had been slowly dosed by disease, became the type of the effect of special sins upon the character and life; thus <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">vanity</span> conceals radical defects and weaknesses; <span class="accented">pride</span> hides from the sinner's own view his own trans<span class="accented">gressions</span>; temporary blindness to great faults is one of the symptoms of <span class="accented">gross sin</span> like David's, and prejudice is proverbially blind and deaf; but here is a man who is nothing less than the type of a congenital bias to evil, of hereditary damage done to human nature. Unless Christ can pour light upon those who are <span class="accented">born</span> blind, he is not the Savior the world needs. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>From his birth (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>The word only here in the New Testament. </body></html>
