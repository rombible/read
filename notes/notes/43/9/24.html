It is not “Give God the praise for your cure, instead of this Man, who is a sinner. Trace the gift to its true source, and give glory to the true Giver.” This is wholly opposed to the context, for they are assuming that no cure has really taken place. The phrase is rather an adjuration calling upon the man to speak, as in God’s presence, and confess the whole truth. (Comp. the words of Joshua to Achan, “My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto Him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me,” <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm" title="And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.">Joshua 7:19</a>.

They said, <span class="ital">Give God the praise </span>— If the cure was really wrought in the manner thou affirmest, acknowledge the power, sovereignty, and goodness of God, in working by so unworthy an instrument; for we certainly know this man, of whom thou speakest, is a profligate sinner, and deserves public punishment rather than esteem. Thus some explain the clause; and doubtless this would be the meaning of it, if the original words did properly signify, <span class="ital">Give God the praise. </span>But the expression, <span class="greekheb">Δος δοξαν τω θεω</span>, is literally, <span class="ital">Give glory to God, </span>that is, as they seem to have meant, by a free confession of the fraud, collusion, or artifice which they supposed was in this affair, and in which they believed the man to be an accomplice of Jesus. See <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm" title="And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.">Joshua 7:19</a>, where the Jewish general adjures Achan in similar terms to confess his sin. Their speech was to this effect: Thou canst not impose upon us by this incredible story. We know that the man thou speakest of, who openly profanes the sabbath, is a transgressor, and therefore can have no authority or commission from God: it will, consequently, be the wisest thing thou canst do, to profess the truth honestly, as thereby thou wilt give glory to God. “As it is greatly for the honour of the divine omniscience and providence, that persons who are guilty of crimes not fully proved against them, should freely confess them, and not presume, against the dictates of conscience, to maintain their own innocence; there is a propriety in the phrase, taken in this sense.” — Doddridge. <span class="ital">He answered, Whether he be a sinner, I know not </span>— Having no personal acquaintance with him; <span class="ital">one thing I know </span>— And will stand to the truth of it; <span class="ital">that, whereas I was blind </span>— Even from my birth; <span class="ital">now I see</span> — Perfectly well, and owe my sight to the very person whom you condemn. “In this answer of the beggar there is a strong and beautiful irony, founded on good sense; and therefore it must have been felt by the doctors, though they dissembled their resentment for a little, hoping that by gentle means they might prevail with him to confess the supposed fraud of this miracle. They desired him, therefore, to tell them again how it had been performed: saying, <span class="ital">What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</span> — They asked him this question before, (<a href="/john/9-15.htm" title="Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and do see.">John 9:15</a>,) but they now proposed it a second time, in order that the man, repeating his account of the servile work performed at his cure, might become sensible that Jesus had violated the sabbath thereby, and was an impostor. For gladly would they have prevailed with him to join them in the judgment which they passed upon Jesus. But their resistance of the truth appeared so criminal to him, that, laying aside fear, <span class="ital">he answered, I have told you already, and you did not hear </span>— That is, believe; <span class="ital">wherefore would ye hear it again? </span>— Are ye so affected with the miracle, and do ye entertain so high an opinion of the author of it, that ye take pleasure in hearing the account of it repeated, desiring to be more and more confirmed in your veneration for him? <span class="ital">Will ye also </span>— As well as I; <span class="ital">be his disciples? </span>— Being at length convinced of his divine mission. In this answer the irony was more plain, pointed, and severe, than in the former. By this, therefore, the rulers were provoked to the highest pitch; <span class="ital">and reviled him, saying, Thou art his disciple </span>— As is plain from the partiality thou discoverest toward him; <span class="ital">but we are Moses’s disciples </span>— And with great reason; for <span class="ital">we know God spake to Moses </span>— He clearly demonstrated his mission from God. <span class="ital">As for this fellow, </span>&c. — Whereas this fellow, who contradicts Moses, and breaks his laws, by his pretended cures performed on the sabbath; <span class="ital">we know not whence he is </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor by what power or authority he does these things. “Their partiality here was inexcusable; for if they believed the mission of Moses, on the evidence of miracles, credibly attested indeed, but performed two thousand years before they were born, it was much more reasonable, on their own principles, to believe the mission of Jesus, on at least equal miracles, wrought daily among them, when they might, in many instances, have been eye-witnesses to the facts; and one of which, notwithstanding all their malice, they were here compelled to own, or, at least, found themselves utterly unable to disprove.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:24-34 As Christ's mercies are most valued by those who have felt the want of them, that have been blind, and now see; so the most powerful and lasting affections to Christ, arise from actual knowledge of him. In the work of grace in the soul, though we cannot tell when, and how, and by what steps the blessed change was wrought, yet we may take the comfort, if we can say, through grace, Whereas I was blind, now I see. I did live a worldly, sensual life, but, thanks be to God, it is now otherwise with me, Eph 5:8. The unbelief of those who enjoy the means of knowledge and conviction, is indeed marvellous. All who have felt the power and grace of the Lord Jesus, wonder at the wilfulness of others who reject him. He argues strongly against them, not only that Jesus was not a sinner, but that he was of God. We may each of us know by this, whether we are of God or not. What do we? What do we for God? What do we for our souls? What do we more than others?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give God the praise - This expression seems to be a form of administering an oath. It is used in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>, when Achan was put on his oath and entreated to confess his guilt. Joshua said, "My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel (in the Greek of the Septuagint, the very expression used in John, 'Give God the praise'), and make confession unto him." It is equivalent to an adjuration in the presence of God to acknowledge the truth; as the truth would be giving God praise, confessing the case before him, and trusting to his mercy. Compare <a href="/1_samuel/6-5.htm">1 Samuel 6:5</a> The meaning here is not "give God praise for healing you," for they were not willing to admit that he had been cured <a href="//biblehub.com/john/9-18.htm">John 9:18</a>, but confess that there is imposture in the case; that you have declared to us a falsehood, that you have endeavored to impose on us; and by thus confessing your sin, give praise and honor to God, who condemns all imposture and falsehood, and whom you will thus acknowledge to be right in your condemnation. To induce him to do this, they added that they knew, or were satisfied that Jesus was a sinner. As they considered that point settled, they urged him to confess that he had attempted to impose on them.<p>We know - We have settled that.

That had been blind. After they had examined his parents, and could get nothing from them for their purpose, they try a second time what they could do with the son: <p>and said unto him, give God the praise; a phrase used when confession of sin was required; see <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; and this may be the meaning of it here; confess this fraud and imposture before the omniscient God, the searcher of hearts, and in so doing glorify that perfection of his. One and the same word,  signifies both to confess the truth of anything, as a sinful action, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>, and to give thanks and praise to God for any mercy and blessing, <a href="/psalms/45-17.htm">Psalm 45:17</a>.

Or the sense may be, if this really is matter of fact, that thou wast born blind, and hast received thy sight by the means of this man, give all the glory of it to God, to whom alone it is due, and not to him. God sometimes works by wicked instruments, when the glory of what is done ought not to be ascribed to them, but to him. <p>We know that this man is a sinner; this they concluded from his breaking the sabbath, as they supposed; though they also aspersed his character, and accused him of other things, yet falsely; see <a href="/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>; nor could they prove one single instance of sin in him, though they express themselves here with so much assurance. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> Give God the praise: we know that this man is a <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> sinner.</span><p>(d) A solemn order, by which men were put under oath in ancient time to acknowledge their fault before God, as if it was said to them, Consider that you are before God, who knows the entire matter, and therefore be sure that you revere his majesty, and do him this honour and confess the whole matter openly rather than to lie before him; Jos 7:19; 1Sa 6:5.<p>(e) He is called a sinner in the Hebrew language, who is a wicked man, and someone who makes an art of sinning.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/9-24.htm" title="Then again called they the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner....">John 9:24-25</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δὸς δόξαν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεῷ</span>] “Speciosa praefatio,” Bengel; for they expect a declaration prejudicial to Jesus, such as the man had hitherto refused to make, and therefore employ this sacred and binding requirement to declare the truth, by which God would be honoured, inasmuch as to speak the truth was to show reverence to Him.

Many have urged (see Calvin, De Wette, Lange, Lucke, and Meyer) that this is only a solemn form of adjuration, which corresponds with <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-11.htm">Ezra 10:11</a>; 3Esdras 9:8, and was a hypocritical appeal to the man to eat his own words on oath; and Godet urges, "They demanded that this guilty assertion, 'He is a Prophet,' should be blotted out by the contrary one,' He is a sinner.'" Moulton says, "A formula used when a criminal who was thought to be concealing the truth was being urged to make a full confession." Luthardt, Lampe, and others rightly observe that this adjuration theory, though it suits <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>, does not fit <a href="/1_samuel/6-5.htm">1 Samuel 6:5</a> or <a href="/jeremiah/12-16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a>, and that the Pharisees rather wished the man to give glory direct to God, and not to Jesus. They implied that their action was dictated by zeal for the honor of God, and tempted the man to disclaim the mediation of Divine grace through the lips and at the will of Jesus.

This phrase addressed to an offender implies that by some previous act or word he has done dishonor to God, and appeals to him to repair the dishonor by speaking the truth. In this case it is also an appeal to the restored man to ascribe his cure directly to God, and not to Jesus. Palgrave, "Central and Eastern Arabia," says that the Arabic phrase commonly addressed to one who has said something extremely out of place, is Istaghfir Allah, Ask pardon of God.<p>We know<p>The we is emphatic.
