So had God opened the eyes of his understanding, as well as his bodily eyes! <span class="ital">Why, herein is a marvellous thing, that ye </span>— The teachers and guides of the people; <span class="ital">know not whence he is — </span>From whence he comes, and who hath sent him; <span class="ital">and yet he hath opened mine eyes </span>— Hath wrought a miracle, the like of which was never heard of before. Surely a man who could do such a thing must be from heaven, must be sent of God. It was esteemed by the Jews a peculiar sign of the Messiah, that he should open the eyes of the blind, that is, of those born blind; a miracle never known to be wrought by Moses or any of the prophets. <span class="ital">Now we know — </span>Even we of the populace know; <span class="ital">God heareth not sinners </span>— Impenitent sinners who continue in sin, so as to answer their prayers in this manner, and assist them to perform such astonishing miracles; which, without his assistance, and that communicated in a very extraordinary degree, could not possibly have been performed. <span class="ital">But if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will </span>— If any man truly worship and serve him; <span class="ital">him he heareth </span>— Answereth his prayers, and that sometimes, probably, in a singular sense. <span class="ital">Since the world began, </span>&c. — That is, from the beginning of the world; <span class="ital">it was never heard, that any man</span> — Who was not a worshipper of God, and a doer of his will, that is, any sinner, any impostor; <span class="ital">opened the eyes of one that was born blind. If this man were not of God </span>— Were not sent of God; if he were not a prophet and messenger of God; <span class="ital">he could do nothing </span>— Thus the beggar, though illiterate, answered that great body of learned men with such strength of reason, that they had not a word to reply. However, the evidence of his arguments had no other effect but to put them into a passion; insomuch that they railed at him, saying, <span class="ital">Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us </span>— Thou wicked, illiterate, impudent fellow, whose understanding continues still as blind as thy body was, and who wast born under the heaviest punishment of sin, dost thou pretend to instruct us in a matter of this kind? Us, who are the guides of the people, and eminent for our skill in the law? The reproach, <span class="ital">Thou wast altogether born in sins, </span>proceeded from the same general principle from which the question of the disciples arose, (<a href="/john/9-2.htm" title="And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?">John 9:2</a>,) <span class="ital">Who did sin, this man or his parents? </span>They inferred from his being born blind, that he was in some peculiar way born in sins. <span class="ital">And they cast him out — </span>That is, passed the sentence of excommunication upon him, which was the highest punishment in their power to inflict. From this account we learn, that a plain man, void of the advantages of learning and education, but who has an upright disposition, is in a fairer way to understand the truth, than a whole council of learned doctors, who are under the power of prejudice, and of an earthly mind, lovers of wealth, honour, and pleasure, rather than lovers of God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:24-34 As Christ's mercies are most valued by those who have felt the want of them, that have been blind, and now see; so the most powerful and lasting affections to Christ, arise from actual knowledge of him. In the work of grace in the soul, though we cannot tell when, and how, and by what steps the blessed change was wrought, yet we may take the comfort, if we can say, through grace, Whereas I was blind, now I see. I did live a worldly, sensual life, but, thanks be to God, it is now otherwise with me, Eph 5:8. The unbelief of those who enjoy the means of knowledge and conviction, is indeed marvellous. All who have felt the power and grace of the Lord Jesus, wonder at the wilfulness of others who reject him. He argues strongly against them, not only that Jesus was not a sinner, but that he was of God. We may each of us know by this, whether we are of God or not. What do we? What do we for God? What do we for our souls? What do we more than others?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A marvelous thing - This is wonderful and amazing.<p>Know not from whence he is - That you cannot perceive that he who has performed such a miracle must be from God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30.
