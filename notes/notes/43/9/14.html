Their zeal for mere rites consumed the substantial matters of religion; therefore Christ would not give place to them. Also, works of necessity and mercy are allowed, and the sabbath rest is to be kept, in order to the sabbath work. How many blind eyes have been opened by the preaching of the gospel on the Lord's day! how many impotent souls cured on that day! Much unrighteous and uncharitable judging comes from men's adding their own fancies to God's appointments. How perfect in wisdom and holiness was our Redeemer, when his enemies could find nothing against him, but the oft-refuted charge of breaking the sabbath!

The introduction here shows that the difficulty of the neighbors and other friends had already been raised, and something more than a desire on their part for religious guidance actuated their appeal to the Pharisees. Why should the healed man be taken to the Pharisees, or the synagogue-court at all, unless some question of casuistry had been raised? The movement was one unquestionably adverse to Jesus. It could have had no other motive. Nor can any doubt arise that Jesus had violated the rabbinical rules of the sabbath, though his act had been in perfect harmony with the spirit and even letter of the Mosaic Law. The making of clay with the spittle and the sand was an infringement of the rule ('Shabbath,' 24:3). It was curiously laid down in one of the vexatious interpretations (preserved in Jerusalem Gemara on 'Shabbath,' 14) that while "<span class="accented">wine</span> could by way of remedy be applied to the eyelid, on the ground that this might be treated as washing, it was sinful to apply it to the inside of the eye" (Edersheim). And it was positively forbidden (in the same Gemara) to apply saliva to the eyelid, because this would be the application of a remedy. All medicinal appliances, unless in cases of danger to life or limb, were likewise forbidden. Consequently, the Lord had broken with the traditional glosses on the Law in more ways than one (see Winer, 'Bibl. Realw.,' 2:346; Lightfoot, ' Ad Joan. 9; 'Wetstein on <a href="/matthew/12-9.htm">Matthew 12:9</a>; Wunsche, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>It was the Sabbath day when (&#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>The best texts read, instead of &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; when, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#837; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#837; on which day.
