Sleep is given by the Rabbis as one of six favourable symptoms, and that it is so is a common-place in authors of all periods. From the apparent suddenness of the attack, and rapidity of the progress of the disease, it would seem to have been the “great fever” which was common in Palestine (comp. <a href="/john/4-52.htm" title="Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend.

A true Christian, when he dies, does but sleep; he rests from the labours of the past day. Nay, herein death is better than sleep, that sleep is only a short rest, but death is the end of earthly cares and toils. The disciples thought that it was now needless for Christ to go to Lazarus, and expose himself and them. Thus we often hope that the good work we are called to do, will be done by some other hand, if there be peril in the doing of it. But when Christ raised Lazarus from the dead, many were brought to believe on him; and there was much done to make perfect the faith of those that believed. Let us go to him; death cannot separate from the love of Christ, nor put us out of the reach of his call. Like Thomas, in difficult times Christians should encourage one another. The dying of the Lord Jesus should make us willing to die whenever God calls us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If the sleep, he shall do well - Sleep was regarded by the Jews, in sickness, as a favorable symptom; hence it was said among them, "Sleep in sickness is a sign of recovery, because it shows that the violence of the disease has abated" (Lightfoot). This seems to have been the meaning of the disciples. They intimated that if he had this symptom, there was no need of his going into Judea to restore him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. if he sleep, he shall do well&#8212;literally, "be preserved"; that is, recover.

Sound sleep is a sign of health. This they said to, put off their master from going into Judea, fearing the danger he would be exposed unto. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">Then said his disciples</span>] Better, <span class="bld">Therefore</span> <span class="ital">said the disciples</span> <span class="bld">to Him</span>.

Probably they thought that Christ meant to go and cure Lazarus (<span class="ital"><a href="/john/11-37.htm" title="And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?">John 11:37</a></span>, comp. <a href="/john/9-3.htm" title="Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.">John 9:3</a>); and here they infer from his sleeping that he will recover without Christ’s aid: consequently Christ need not go. They are too full of anxiety to notice Christ’s significant words ‘I go, that I may awake him,’ whereas the rendering in our Bible reads like an expostulation against waking him, as if it meant ‘a sick man should not be disturbed.’ For other instances in which the disciples grossly misunderstand Christ, see <a href="/john/4-33.htm" title="Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has any man brought him ought to eat?">John 4:33</a>, <a href="/john/14-5.htm" title="Thomas said to him, Lord, we know not where you go; and how can we know the way?">John 14:5</a>; <a href="/john/14-8.htm" title="Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.">John 14:8</a>; <a href="/john/14-22.htm" title="Judas said to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?">John 14:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-7.htm" title="And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.">Matthew 16:7</a>; and comp. <a href="/john/3-4.htm" title="Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?">John 3:4</a>; <a href="/john/3-9.htm" title="Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?">John 3:9</a>, <a href="/john/4-11.htm" title="The woman said to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where then have you that living water?">John 4:11</a>; <a href="/john/4-15.htm" title="The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come here to draw.">John 4:15</a>, <a href="/john/6-34.htm" title="Then said they to him, Lord, ever more give us this bread.">John 6:34</a>; <a href="/john/6-52.htm" title="The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?">John 6:52</a>, <a href="/john/7-35.htm" title="Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?">John 7:35</a>, <a href="/john/8-22.htm" title="Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he said, Where I go, you cannot come.">John 8:22</a>; <a href="/john/8-33.htm" title="They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?">John 8:33</a>; <a href="/john/8-52.htm" title="Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that you have a devil.

This candour in declaring their own failings adds to our confidence in the veracity of the Evangelists. It is urged that the misunderstanding here is too gross to be probable: but they had not unnaturally understood Christ Himself to nave declared that Lazarus would not die (<span class="ital"><a href="/john/11-4.htm" title="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.">John 11:4</a></span>); this being so, they could not easily suppose that by sleep He meant death. Moreover, when men’s minds are on the stretch the strangest misapprehensions become possible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/11-12.htm" title="Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.">John 11:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰ κεκοίμηται</span>, <span class="ital">if he sleep</span>) Often a long sleep is a means of restoration to health.

Wunsche quotes 'Berach,' fol. 57, b, "Sleep is a good sign for the sick." The language of the disciples is somewhat remarkable; at least their misunderstanding is puzzling (Reuss and Strauss think it is a sign of the unhistorical); but it probably arose out of the statement, made two days before, that "the sickness was not unto death," and from their eager and affectionate desire to prevent their Lord's retraining to Judaea. <span class="accented">If he have fallen asleep</span>, <span class="accented">he well recover</span> (<span class="accented">be saved</span>). The whole narrative is throbbing with deeper meanings than lie on the surface of it. The theory of the sanitary effects of sleep in fever are well known, and the rousing from such sleep might seem hazardous; but the disciples were catching at straws to save their Master. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Shall do well (&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Literally, shall be saved.
