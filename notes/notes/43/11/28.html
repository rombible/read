Perhaps the name was that by which they usually spoke of Him who had been their Teacher. We are not told that our Lord sent for Mary, but we must assume that Martha conveyed the message which she herself had heard.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/11-28.htm" title="And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calls for you....">John 11:28-35</a></span>. <span class="ital">When she had so said </span>— When she had testified her faith, as in the preceding verse; <span class="ital">she went and called Mary </span>— Jesus having inquired for her, as is implied in the next words, designing that she and her companions should likewise have the honour and comfort of being present at the stupendous miracle which he was about to perform. <span class="ital">As soon as she </span>(Mary) <span class="ital">heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him </span>— Without speaking a word to the company of friends, who, because she was of a softer disposition than her sister, paid a special attention to her grief; remaining with her in the house after Martha was gone out, and when she went out following her: lest she should be going to the grave to weep there. In consequence of this, they were naturally led to be eye-witnesses of all that followed. When Mary came to Jesus, being greatly affected at the sight of him in the present circumstances of their distress, <span class="ital">she fell down at his feet </span>— As one overwhelmed with sorrow, and with many tears, (as appears, <a href="/john/11-33.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.">John 11:33</a>,) expressed herself as Martha had done before; <span class="ital">Lord, if thou hadst been here, </span>&c. — For they had often said this to one another. She was so overcome with grief that she could utter no more. She had sat at Christ’s feet to hear his word: but now she is at his feet on a different errand. Such are the changes in human life! Observe, reader, those that in a day of peace place themselves at Christ’s feet, to receive instruction from him, may with confidence and comfort cast themselves at his feet in a day of trouble, with hope of finding favour with him. <span class="ital">When Jesus saw her weeping, </span>&c. — When he beheld Martha and Mary, and their companions around him, all in tears, the tender feelings of love, and pity, and friendship moved him in a high degree; for his compassionate heart could not contemplate the distress of the two affectionate sisters, and that of their friends, without having a deep share in it. <span class="ital">He </span>therefore <span class="ital">groaned in spirit, and was troubled </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">εταραξεν εαυτον</span>, <span class="ital">he troubled himself: </span>an expression, both elegant and full of the highest propriety. For (as Bengelius observes) the affections of Jesus were not properly passions, but voluntary emotions, which were wholly in his own power. And this tender trouble which he now voluntarily sustained, was full of the highest order and reason. <span class="ital">And </span>— That he might keep them in suspense no longer, but, going to the grave, might give them immediate relief, by bringing him to life again; he asks, <span class="ital">Where have ye laid him? </span>— He knew where he was laid, and yet asks, because, 1st, He would thus express himself as a man, even then, when he was going to exert the power of God; non nescit sed quasi nescit, saith Austin here, <span class="ital">he was not ignorant </span>where he was laid, but he speaks <span class="ital">as if he were ignorant. </span>2d, He would thus divert the grief of his mourning friends, by raising their expectation of his doing something great. <span class="ital">They say, Lord, come and see </span>— Perhaps indulging some uncertain hope of what was afterward done. <span class="ital">Jesus wept — </span>In remembrance of the dead, and out of sympathy with the living, as well as from a deep sense of the misery which sin had brought upon human nature. “In this grief of the Son of God,” says Macknight, “there was a greatness and generosity, not to say an amiableness of disposition, infinitely nobler than that which the Stoic philosophers aimed at, in their so much boasted apathy.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:17-32 Here was a house where the fear of God was, and on which his blessing rested; yet it was made a house of mourning. Grace will keep sorrow from the heart, but not from the house. When God, by his grace and providence, is coming towards us in ways of mercy and comfort, we should, like Martha, go forth by faith, hope, and prayer, to meet him. When Martha went to meet Jesus, Mary sat still in the house; this temper formerly had been an advantage to her, when it put her at Christ's feet to hear his word; but in the day of affliction, the same temper disposed her to melancholy. It is our wisdom to watch against the temptations, and to make use of the advantages of our natural tempers. When we know not what in particular to ask or expect, let us refer ourselves to God; let him do as seemeth him good. To enlarge Martha's expectations, our Lord declared himself to be the Resurrection and the Life. In every sense he is the Resurrection; the source, the substance, the first-fruits, the cause of it. The redeemed soul lives after death in happiness; and after the resurrection, both body and soul are kept from all evil for ever. When we have read or heard the word of Christ, about the great things of the other world, we should put it to ourselves, Do we believe this truth? The crosses and comforts of this present time would not make such a deep impression upon us as they do, if we believed the things of eternity as we ought. When Christ our Master comes, he calls for us. He comes in his word and ordinances, and calls us to them, calls us by them, calls us to himself. Those who, in a day of peace, set themselves at Christ's feet to be taught by him, may with comfort, in a day of trouble, cast themselves at his feet, to find favour with him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She went her way - Jesus probably directed her to go, though the evangelist has not recorded it, for she said to Mary, The Master calleth for thee.<p>Secretly - Privately.
