Martha, therefore, immediately went out; <span class="ital">and, </span>being told what way he was coming, soon <span class="ital">met him: but Mary sat still in the house — </span>Probably not hearing of his coming: for Martha, overjoyed at the news of his approach, did not take time to tell her sister of it, but went out in all haste. Her intention, no doubt, was to welcome him; but being in an excess of grief, the first thing she uttered was a complaint that he had not come sooner, saying, <span class="ital">Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died </span>— In which words she shows both the strength and weakness of her faith. 1st, The strength of it, in that she believed Christ’s power was such, that though her brother’s sickness was very grievous, yet he could have cured it, and so have prevented his death; and that his goodness was such, that if he had been present, and seen Lazarus in his extreme illness, and his dear relations all in tears about him, he would have had compassion, and have prevented so sad a breach upon the peace and comfort of the family. 2d, Her words show also the weakness of her faith; for she limits the power of Christ in saying, <span class="ital">If thou hadst been here; </span>whereas she ought to have known that Christ could cure at a distance, and that his gracious operations were not confined to his bodily presence. She reflects likewise on the wisdom and kindness of Christ, because he had not hastened to them when they sent for him, intimating that by delaying to come, she thought he had neglected to save her brother’s life. She, however, corrects and comforts herself with the consideration of the prevailing interest which Christ had in heaven, adding, <span class="ital">But I know that even now </span>— Though he be dead; <span class="ital">whatsoever thou wilt ask of God </span>— Whatsoever thou shalt think proper to ask; <span class="ital">God will give it thee</span> — Will assuredly grant thy request, how great soever the favour may be which thou askest: thus intimating, that she believed his prayer might yet restore her brother to life. She has not courage, however, to ask Jesus that he would pray to his Father for such an extraordinary exertion of divine power to be displayed on their behalf, there having yet been no precedent of any one being raised who had been so long dead: but, like a modest petitioner, she humbly recommends their case to the wise and compassionate consideration of Jesus. Thus when we know not what in particular to ask, or expect, let us, in general, refer ourselves to God; let him do as seemeth him good. And let it comfort us to be assured, when we are in doubt what to pray for, that our great Intercessor knows what to ask for us, and is always heard. But we have in this latter sentence, uttered by Martha on this occasion, a further proof, as of the strength, so also of the weakness of her faith: she believed Jesus could obtain of God by prayer whatever he should think fit to ask, even the restoration of her brother to life, though he had been so many days dead, but she did not believe that he himself could raise him; forgetting, or not considering, that he had life in himself, yea, was the Prince of life and Conqueror of death. She founded her hopes of her brother’s resurrection, so far as she entertained any hopes of so wonderful an event, not on Christ’s own power, but on the power of God, to be exerted at his intercession.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:17-32 Here was a house where the fear of God was, and on which his blessing rested; yet it was made a house of mourning. Grace will keep sorrow from the heart, but not from the house. When God, by his grace and providence, is coming towards us in ways of mercy and comfort, we should, like Martha, go forth by faith, hope, and prayer, to meet him. When Martha went to meet Jesus, Mary sat still in the house; this temper formerly had been an advantage to her, when it put her at Christ's feet to hear his word; but in the day of affliction, the same temper disposed her to melancholy. It is our wisdom to watch against the temptations, and to make use of the advantages of our natural tempers. When we know not what in particular to ask or expect, let us refer ourselves to God; let him do as seemeth him good. To enlarge Martha's expectations, our Lord declared himself to be the Resurrection and the Life. In every sense he is the Resurrection; the source, the substance, the first-fruits, the cause of it. The redeemed soul lives after death in happiness; and after the resurrection, both body and soul are kept from all evil for ever. When we have read or heard the word of Christ, about the great things of the other world, we should put it to ourselves, Do we believe this truth? The crosses and comforts of this present time would not make such a deep impression upon us as they do, if we believed the things of eternity as we ought. When Christ our Master comes, he calls for us. He comes in his word and ordinances, and calls us to them, calls us by them, calls us to himself. Those who, in a day of peace, set themselves at Christ's feet to be taught by him, may with comfort, in a day of trouble, cast themselves at his feet, to find favour with him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then Martha ... - To Martha was intrusted the management of the affairs of the family, <a href="/luke/10-40.htm">Luke 10:40</a>.

Often this grief was so excessive as to fix the person in astonishment, and render him immovable, or prevent his being affected by any external objects. It is possible that the evangelist meant to intimate this of Mary's grief.

She as usual takes the lead in entertaining, and Mary shrinks from it. “One most remarkable feature in the history is the coincidence between the characters of Mary and Martha as depicted here and in S.

Thoma says that this picture is "simply painted with synoptic color." Martha is the mistress of the house. <span class="cmt_word">Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</span> Martha was a woman of impulse, energy, practical duty; like Peter, she was ready even to give advice to her Lord, and eager to put everybody in his rightful place. On the first opportunity she hastened at once to "meet" Jesus, even without at first warning her sister of his approach. Mary, contemplative, pensive, undemonstrative under ordinary circumstances, but with a great fund of love, was sitting in the house receiving the condolences of the Jews (cf. ver. 19). Weiss suggests that Jesus was well aware, from the station of the family, and from the fact that hitherto his own friendship for the sisters had not submitted <span class="accented">them</span> to the ban, that "many Jews" would have congregated in the house of mourning.
