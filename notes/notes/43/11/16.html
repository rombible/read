The name belonged probably to his childhood, and we are wholly without the knowledge which can explain it. The various theories which attempt to do so, from the statement of the Apostolical Constitutions that he had a twin sister Lydia, to the view that the name was given by our Lord to signify his double or halting spiritual nature, are never more than, and are sometimes much less than, elaborate guesses. We may well believe that the name is due to the fact that he was a twin, but of whom it is of no importance that we should know, and it is quite certain that we cannot know.<p>And yet Peter, John, and Judas, are the only Apostles whose characters we know as well.

A true Christian, when he dies, does but sleep; he rests from the labours of the past day. Nay, herein death is better than sleep, that sleep is only a short rest, but death is the end of earthly cares and toils. The disciples thought that it was now needless for Christ to go to Lazarus, and expose himself and them. Thus we often hope that the good work we are called to do, will be done by some other hand, if there be peril in the doing of it. But when Christ raised Lazarus from the dead, many were brought to believe on him; and there was much done to make perfect the faith of those that believed. Let us go to him; death cannot separate from the love of Christ, nor put us out of the reach of his call. Like Thomas, in difficult times Christians should encourage one another. The dying of the Lord Jesus should make us willing to die whenever God calls us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thomas, which is called Didymus - These names express the same thing. One is Hebrew and the other Greek. The name means a twin.<p>Die with him - It has been much doubted by critics whether the word him refers to Lazarus or to Jesus. They who refer it to Lazarus suppose this to be the meaning: "Let us go and die, for what have we to hope for if Jesus returns into Judea? Lately they attempted to stone him, and now they will put him to death, and we also, like Lazarus, shall be dead." This expression, is supposed to be added by John to show the slowness with which Thomas believed, and his readiness to doubt without the fullest evidence. See <a href="/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25</a>. Others suppose, probably more correctly, that it refers to Jesus: "He is about to throw himself into danger. The Jews lately sought his life, and will again. They will put him to death. But let us not forsake him. Let us attend him and die with him." It may be remarked that this, not less than the other mode of interpretation, expresses the doubts of Thomas about the miracle which Jesus was about to work. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

On a memorable occasion this tendency opened the door to downright, though but momentary, unbelief (Joh 20:25). Here, however, though alleged by many interpreters there is nothing of the sort. He perceives clearly how this journey to Judea will end, as respects his Master, and not only sees in it peril to themselves, as they all did, but feels as if he could not and cared not to survive his Master's sacrifice to the fury of His enemies. It was that kind of affection which, living only in the light of its Object, cannot contemplate, or has no heart for life, without it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thomas</span> and <span class="bld">Didymus</span> were names of the same signification, only Thomas was the Hebrew, and Didymus the Greek name.

Seeing that our Lord will not be persuaded from going into Judea, where his life will be in apparent danger, for they will put him to death, let us also go and die with him. But it is more probable that Thomas meant with Lazarus, who, as our Saviour told them but now, was dead; and in that sense it was not only an expression of great passion, but great unbelief also. We ought not to be so affected with the death of our friends, as to wish or desire ourselves out of the world, where God hath set us in stations which we ought to keep, until God be pleased to remove us. Besides, Thomas ought to have believed our Saviour, who had told them, that though Lazarus slept the sleep of death, yet he went to awake him; which could have no other sense, than to raise him out of that sleep of death, of which he had spoken.

He is the pessimist among the disciples, and now takes the gloomy, and, as it proved, the correct view of the result of this return to Judaea, but his affectionate loyalty forbids the thought of their allowing Jesus to go alone. “To his mind there is nothing left for Jesus but to die. But now comes the remarkable thing. He is willing to take Jesus at the lowest, uncrowned, unseated, disrobed, he loves Him still.” Matheson.

Thomas is Hebrew, Didymus is Greek, for a twin. In all probability he was a twin, <span class="ital">possibly</span> of S. Matthew, with whom he is coupled in all three lists of the Apostles in the Gospels: in the Acts he is coupled with S. Philip. That S. Thomas received his name from Christ (as Simon was called Peter, and the sons of Zebedee Boanerges) in consequence of his character, is pure conjecture. But the coincidence between the name and his twin-mindedness (<a href="/james/1-8.htm" title="A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.">James 1:8</a>; <a href="/james/4-8.htm" title="Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double minded.">James 4:8</a>) is remarkable. “In him the twins, unbelief and faith, were contending with one another for mastery, as Esau and Jacob in Rebecca’s womb” (Trench). It is from S. John that we know his character: in the Synoptists and the Acts he is a mere name (see on <a href="/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>). He seems to have combined devotion to Christ with a tendency to see the dark side of everything. S. John’s care in distinguishing him by his Gentile name adds point to the argument derived from his never distinguishing John as the Baptist (see on <a href="/john/1-6.htm" title="There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.">John 1:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fellow-disciples</span>] The word occurs here only. It has been remarked that S. Thomas would scarcely have taken the lead in this way had S. Peter been present, and that had S. Peter been there he would probably have appeared in the previous dialogue. If he was absent, we have an additional reason for the absence of this miracle from S. Mark’s Gospel, the Gospel of S. Peter, and undoubtedly the representative of the oldest form of the Synoptic narrative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">die with him</span>] Of course with Christ (<span class="ital"><a href="/john/11-8.htm" title="His disciples say to him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone you; and go you thither again?">John 11:8</a></span>). It is strange that any should understand it of Lazarus. They could not die with him, for he was dead already, and S. Thomas knew this (<span class="ital"><a href="/john/11-14.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.">John 11:14</a></span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/11-16.htm" title="Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.">John 11:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ λεγόμενος Δίδυμος</span>, <span class="ital">who is called Didymus</span>) John wrote in Greek.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡμεῖς</span>, <span class="ital">let us also</span>) Thomas perhaps had had some peculiar tie of connection with Lazarus.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἀποθάνωμεν</span>, <span class="ital">that we may die</span>) Thomas seems to have taken the words of Jesus immediately preceding in this sense, as though Jesus would have been about to die with Lazarus, had He been present, and as though, now that the faith of His disciples had been still further established, He was about to depart this life at Bethany, and that by the plots of the Jews against Him, <a href="/john/11-8.htm" title="His disciples say to him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone you; and go you thither again?">John 11:8</a>, “The Jews of late sought to stone Thee.” He [Thomas] was, as it were, standing mid-way [indifferent] between this life and death, without sorrow or joy, ready to die; not however without faith. Comp. ch. <a href="/john/14-5.htm" title="Thomas said to him, Lord, we know not where you go; and how can we know the way?">John 14:5</a>, “Thomas saith unto Him, Lord, we know not whither Thou goest.” In this view he seems to have understood the <span class="greekheb">πρός</span>, <span class="ital">unto</span>, in the discourse of Jesus, in the same sense as it occurs <a href="/2_samuel/12-23.htm" title="But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again?

Not unlike is the meaning of Peter’s words, <a href="/luke/22-33.htm" title="And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with you, both into prison, and to death.">Luke 22:33</a>, “Lord, I am ready to go with Thee into prison and to death.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thomas</span>, in Aramaic, is equivalent in meaning to the Greek name <span class="accented">Didymus</span>, or "twin." This apostle is mentioned in the synoptic Gospels with Matthew, and in Acts (<a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>) with Philip. He is classed with the fishermen (<a href="/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>), and may therefore have been a Galilaean. Ecclesiastical tradition has associated him with Judas (not Iscariot) (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 1:13), and with Judas the brother of Jesus. He is reputed to have preached ultimately in Parthia and India, there to have suffered martyrdom. The various references to him in this Gospel give, by a few vivid touches, a biography and characterization of singular congruity. <span class="cmt_word">He said to his fellow-disciples</span> (the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is only used in this place, and shows that the body of the disciples were being more and more blended into a unity), <span class="cmt_word">Let us go, that we may die with him.</span> Here he manifests a fervent love to his Master, tinged with a sorrowful, melancholy temperament. He saw the danger to his Lord, but at once, with the spirit of self-surrender, was ready to share his fate. Moulton says these words reveal love, but they are "the language of despair and vanished hope. This is the end of all - death, not Messianic kingdom." Surely Thomas may have pondered much the Lord's words about his approaching death, and may have felt ready, along the same line, willingly to yield up his own life for his Master's or with his Master. Too much has been made of Thomas's skepticism and criticism. He was one who wanted visible, tangible evidence; but he was prepared to act impulsively, and to give powerful expression to his faith, whenever the evidence was granted. In <a href="/john/14-5.htm">John 14:5</a> he was still in the dark, but it was not an evil darkness. How could he know, with the clearness which his mind naturally desiderated, whither our Lord was going? No brainless or heartless unbelief led him to ask, "How can we know the way?" At last (<a href="/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24</a>, etc.), when he wanted ocular, personal, tangible evidence of the resurrection of Jesus, and absented himself in deep melancholy from the company of the eleven, it is clear that his soul was ready for the full manifestation. Before he could have put his finger into the print of the nails, he exclaimed, with adoring gratitude, "MY LORD AND MY GOD!"
