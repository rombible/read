Thus by a voluntary purification, and by religious exercises, many, more devout than their neighbours, spent some time before the passover at Jerusalem. When we expect to meet God, we must solemnly prepare. No devices of man can alter the purposes of God: and while hypocrites amuse themselves with forms and disputes, and worldly men pursue their own plans, Jesus still orders all things for his own glory and the salvation of his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Will not come to the feast? - They doubted whether he would come. On the one hand, it was required by law that all males should come. On the other, his coming was attended with great danger. This was the cause of their doubting. It was in this situation that our Saviour, like many of his followers, was called to act. Danger was on the one hand, and duty on the other. He chose, as all should, to do his duty, and leave the event with God. He preferred to do it, though he knew that death was to be the consequence; and we should not shrink, when we have reason to apprehend danger, persecution, or death, from an honest attempt to observe all the commandments of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>56. sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple&#8212;giving forth the various conjectures and speculations about the probability of His coming to the feast.<p>that he will not come&#8212;The form of this question implies the opinion that He would come.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I find good interpreters expounding this verse of the friends of Christ, who having used to meet Christ at these feasts, and see some miracles wrought by him, did out of a good design seek for him, and inquire of each other whether they knew if he intended to be at the feast: yet it may also be understood of his enemies, though it seemeth something too early, being six or seven days before. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then sought they for Jesus,.... That is, the country people; some on one account, and some on another; some out of curiosity to see his person, others to see his miracles, and others to hear his doctrine; and some, it may be, to take him, and deliver him up to the sanhedrim, who had issued out a proclamation to that purpose, and doubtless offered a reward: <p>and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple; whither they came to purify themselves, according to the law of the sanctuary: <p>what think ye, that he will not come to the feast? it was a matter of dispute with them, whether Christ would come or not, to the feast; some might be of opinion that he would not, at least they very much questioned it, since the sanhedrim had published such an order for the discovery of him; and since upon it he was gone from Bethany, farther into the country; though others might be differently minded, and believe he would come, since all the males of Israel were obliged to appear at that feast, and it was his duty; and they could not persuade themselves that he would neglect his duty, for fear of the Jews. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/11-56.htm" title="Then sought they for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think you, that he will not come to the feast?">John 11:56</a>.

Their excitement augmented from day to day; they dreaded and hoped for the final conflict. Not being aware of his retreat, not caring, perhaps, to dispatch him by hired assassins, they determined in the most public way, on a great platform, to complete the deep damnation of his taking off, little forecasting their eternal infamy. They were in continual search for Jesus, and spake in excited groups when they met, asking one another eager questions when they stood in the temple.
