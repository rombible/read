Dr. Campbell renders the clause, <span class="ital">will not prove fatal, </span>observing that this reading gives the full import of the Greek expression, <span class="greekheb">ουκ εστι προς θανατον</span>, and at the same time preserves the ambiguity intended. <span class="ital">Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister, </span>&c. — That is, he loved them with a peculiar affection, on account of their unfeigned piety toward God, their friendship and affection toward one another, and their faith in him as the Messiah, and had often visited them, and lodged at their house. And, in consequence of his peculiar love to them, he was determined to conduct himself toward them, in their present trying circumstances, in such a manner as he knew would be most for their final advantage, though it might, for a while, be an occasion of greater affliction to them. <span class="ital">When he heard therefore that he was sick </span>— Instead of making all possible haste to go to him, and without declaring he had any thoughts of going; <span class="ital">he abode two days still </span>— On the other side of Jordan; and <span class="ital">in the same place where he was before </span>— This he did not only though he loved them, but <span class="ital">because </span>he loved them. He loved them, and therefore he designed to do something great and extraordinary for them; to work such a miracle for their relief, as he had not wrought for any of his friends. If he had gone immediately, and had arrived at Bethany while Lazarus was still alive, and had cured his sickness, he would have done no more for him than he had done for many; if he had come to him, and raised him when he was but just dead, he would have done no more than he had done for some; but deferring his relief so long, he had an opportunity of doing more for him than he had done, or ever should do, for any other. Observe, reader, God hath gracious intentions even in his apparent delays. See <a href="/context/isaiah/54-7.htm" title="For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies will I gather you....">Isaiah 54:7-8</a>. Christ’s friends at Bethany were not out of his thoughts, nor was his affection to them lessened, though when he heard of their distress he made no haste to give them relief. “His lingering so long after their message came, did not proceed from want of concern for his friends, but happened according to the counsels of his own wisdom. For the length of time that Lazarus lay in the grave put his death beyond all possibility of doubt, and removed every suspicion of a fraud, and so afforded Jesus a fit opportunity of displaying the love he bare to Lazarus, as well as his own almighty power, in his unquestionable resurrection from the dead. It is true, the sisters were thus kept a while in painful anxiety, on account of their brother’s life, and in the conclusion were pierced with the sorrow of seeing him die. Yet they would think themselves abundantly recompensed by the evidence accruing to the gospel from this astonishing miracle, as well as by the inexpressible surprise of joy which they felt, when they received their brother again from the dead.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-6 It is no new thing for those whom Christ loves, to be sick; bodily distempers correct the corruption, and try the graces of God's people. He came not to preserve his people from these afflictions, but to save them from their sins, and from the wrath to come; however, it behoves us to apply to Him in behalf of our friends and relatives when sick and afflicted. Let this reconcile us to the darkest dealings of Providence, that they are all for the glory of God: sickness, loss, disappointment, are so; and if God be glorified, we ought to be satisfied. Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. The families are greatly favoured in which love and peace abound; but those are most happy whom Jesus loves, and by whom he is beloved. Alas, that this should seldom be the case with every person, even in small families. God has gracious intentions, even when he seems to delay. When the work of deliverance, temporal or spiritual, public or personal, is delayed, it does but stay for the right time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whom thou lovest - <a href="/john/11-5.htm">John 11:5</a>. The members of this family were among the few special and intimate friends of our Lord. He was much with them, and showed them marks of special friendship <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38-42</a>, and they bestowed upon him special proofs of affection in return. This shows that special attachments are lawful for Christians, and that those friendships are especially lovely which are tempered and sweetened with the spirit of Christ. Friendships should always be cemented by religion, and one main end of those attachments should be to aid one another in the great business of preparing to die.<p>Sent unto him - They believed that he had power to heal him <a href="//biblehub.com/john/11-21.htm">John 11:21</a>, though they did not then seem to suppose that he could raise him if he died. Perhaps there were two reasons why they sent for him; one, because they supposed he would be desirous of seeing his friend; the other, because they supposed he could restore him. In sickness we should implore the aid and presence of Jesus. He only can restore us and our friends; he only can perform for us the office of a friend when all other friends fail; and he only can cheer us with the hope of a blessed resurrection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-5. his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, he whom thou lovest is sick&#8212;a most womanly appeal, yet how reverential, to the known affection of her Lord for the patient.

Both the sisters of Lazarus, Mary and Martha, sent to Jesus; they did not go themselves, being women, and the place where Jesus was, was at some distance; and besides, it was necessary they should abide at home, to attend their brother in his sickness, and therefore they sent a messenger, or messengers to Christ, <p>saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick; for it seems that Lazarus was in a very singular manner loved by Christ, as man, as John the beloved disciple was; and this is the rather put into the message by the sisters, to engage Jesus to come to his assistance; and they were very right in applying to Christ in this time of need, who is the physician, both of the bodies and souls of men; and are greatly to be commended both for their modesty and piety, in not prescribing to Christ what should be done in this case: and it may be further observed, that such who are the peculiar objects of Christ's love, are attended in this life with bodily sickness, disorders, and diseases, which are sent unto them, not in a way of vindictive wrath, but in love, and as fatherly chastisements; which, as they are designed, so they are overruled for their good; and are to be considered, not as instances of wrath, but as tokens of love. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/11-3.htm" title="Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick....">John 11:3-4</a>.
