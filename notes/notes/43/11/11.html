A true Christian, when he dies, does but sleep; he rests from the labours of the past day. Nay, herein death is better than sleep, that sleep is only a short rest, but death is the end of earthly cares and toils. The disciples thought that it was now needless for Christ to go to Lazarus, and expose himself and them. Thus we often hope that the good work we are called to do, will be done by some other hand, if there be peril in the doing of it. But when Christ raised Lazarus from the dead, many were brought to believe on him; and there was much done to make perfect the faith of those that believed. Let us go to him; death cannot separate from the love of Christ, nor put us out of the reach of his call. Like Thomas, in difficult times Christians should encourage one another. The dying of the Lord Jesus should make us willing to die whenever God calls us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lazarus sleepeth - Is dead. The word "sleep" is applied to death,<p>1. Because of the resemblance between them, as sleep is the "kinsman of death." In this sense it is often used by pagan writers.<p>2. However, in the Scriptures it is used to intimate that death will not be final: that there will be an awaking out of this sleep, or a resurrection. It is a beautiful and tender expression, removing all that is dreadful in death, and filling the mind with the idea of calm repose after a life of toil, with a reference to a future resurrection in increased vigor and renovated powers. In this sense it is applied in the Scriptures usually to the saints, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-24.htm">Matthew 9:24</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-16. Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go that I may wake him out of sleep&#8212;Illustrious title! "Our friend Lazarus." To Abraham only is it accorded in the Old Testament, and not till after his death, (2Ch 20:7; Isa 41:8), to which our attention is called in the New Testament (Jas 2:23). When Jesus came in the flesh, His forerunner applied this name, in a certain sense, to himself (Joh 3:29); and into the same fellowship the Lord's chosen disciples are declared to have come (Joh 15:13-15). "The phrase here employed, "our friend Lazarus," means more than "he whom Thou lovest" in Joh 11:3, for it implies that Christ's affection was reciprocated by Lazarus" [Lampe]. Our Lord had been told only that Lazarus was "sick." But the change which his two days' delay had produced is here tenderly alluded to. Doubtless, His spirit was all the while with His dying, and now dead "friend." The symbol of "sleep" for death is common to all languages, and familiar to us in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, however, a higher meaning is put into it, in relation to believers in Jesus (see on [1830]1Th 4:14), a sense hinted at, and clearly, in Ps 17:15 [Luthardt]; and the "awaking out of sleep" acquires a corresponding sense far transcending bare resuscitation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There is such an analogy between death and sleep, that there is nothing more ordinary than to express death by sleep in Scripture, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.">Deu 31:16</a> <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm" title="And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.">2 Samuel 7:12</a> <a href="/1_kings/1-21.htm" title="Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.">1 Kings 1:21</a> <a href="/2_kings/20-21.htm" title="And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.">2 Kings 20:21</a> <a href="/job/7-21.htm" title="And why do you not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and you shall seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.">Job 7:21</a> 14:12</span> <span class="bld"><a href="/daniel/12-2.htm" title="And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.">Daniel 12:2</a></span>, and in a multitude of other texts, both in the Old Testament and in the New; so as it was evident our Saviour meant he was dead, which he knew as he was God, though as yet he had received no relation of it from the friends of the deceased. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">But I go</span> (saith our Saviour) to raise him up again from the dead, which he calls awaking him; pursuing the former metaphor, where he had compared death to a sleep. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These things said he,....

The journey thereby involved, however, they did not desire (<a href="/john/11-8.htm" title="His disciples say to him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone you; and go you thither again?">John 11:8</a>); the expression <span class="greekheb">κεκοίμηται</span> accordingly corresponded to their wishes; hence the conclusion at once drawn, that he must be on the way to recovery, and the effort, by calling attention to this fact, to make the journey appear unnecessary. The very earnestness of this their desire, caused them to overlook the <span class="ital">significant</span> nature of the words <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἐξυπνίσω αὐτόν</span>, and to fail to see that it would have been absurd thus to speak of one who was <span class="ital">really</span> asleep. Such a mistake on their part is psychologically intelligible enough.[77] The notion that <a href="/john/11-4.htm" title="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.">John 11:4</a> had led them to believe that Jesus had already <span class="ital">healed at a distance</span> (Ebrard, Hengstenberg), and that, <span class="ital">in consequence</span>, they necessarily understood sleep to refer to recovery, is incompatible with the fact that the words of <a href="/john/11-4.htm" title="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.">John 11:4</a> do not at all suggest such a healing (how different in <a href="/john/4-50.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Go your way; your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went his way.">John 4:50</a>!); and that if they had thought of such a healing having taken place, they would have grounded their <span class="greekheb">σωθήσεται</span> on that fact, and not on the approach of <span class="ital">sleep;</span> they would consequently, too, have dissuaded from this journey as unnecessary in a very <span class="ital">different</span> way. According to Bengel (and Luthardt), the disciples believed, “somnum ab Jesu immissum esse Lazaro ut eveniret quod praedixerat ipse <a href="/john/11-4.htm" title="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.">John 11:4</a>.” But there is no exegetical support for this view, not even in the use of the first person singular <span class="greekheb">πορεύομαι</span>, which finds its very natural explanation in the connection with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΥΠΝΊΣΩ</span></span></span> (the case is different with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΓΩΜΕΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="/john/11-7.htm" title="Then after that said he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.">John 11:7</a>), without that supposition (against Luthardt).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[77] “Discipuli <span class="ital">omni modo</span> quaerunt Dominum ab isto itinere avocare,” Grotius; “<span class="ital">libenter</span> hanc fugiendi periculi occasionem <span class="ital">arripiunt</span>,” Calvin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/11-11.htm" title="These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.">John 11:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ταῦτα εἶπε</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span>. “These things spake He, and after this,” how long after we do not know; but <a href="/john/11-15.htm" title="And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent you may believe; nevertheless let us go to him.">John 11:15</a>, “let us go to him,” indicates that the two days here intervened.

How He knows that Lazarus sleeps they do not inquire, accustomed as they are to His exercise of gifts they do not understand. <span class="greekheb">σωθήσεται</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/mark/5-28.htm" title="For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.">Mark 5:28</a>; <a href="/mark/5-34.htm" title="And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace, and be whole of your plague.">Mark 5:34</a>; <a href="/mark/6-56.htm" title="And wherever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and sought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.">Mark 6:56</a>, etc. Their misunderstanding was favoured by His having said (<a href="/john/11-4.htm" title="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.">John 11:4</a>) that the illness was “not to death”; naturally when Jesus spoke of Lazarus sleeping they understood Him to speak (<a href="/john/11-13.htm" title="However, Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.">John 11:13</a>) <span class="greekheb">περὶ τῆς κοιμήσεως τοῦ ὕπνου</span>, “of the <span class="greekheb">κοίμησις</span> of sleep”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">and after that</span>] <span class="ital">and after</span> <span class="bld">this</span>. These words indicate a pause in the narrative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Our friend Lazarus sleepeth</span>] Better, <span class="bld">Lazarus our friend is fallen asleep</span>, or, <span class="ital">is gone to rest</span>. Sleep as an image of death is common from the dawn of literature; but the Gospel has raised the expression from a figure to a fact. Comp. <a href="/matthew/27-52.htm" title="And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,">Matthew 27:52</a>; <a href="/acts/7-50.htm" title="Has not my hand made all these things?">Acts 7:50</a>; <a href="/acts/13-36.htm" title="For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid to his fathers, and saw corruption:">Acts 13:36</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm" title="The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-18.htm" title="Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.">1 Corinthians 15:18</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2 Peter 3:4</a>. The thoroughly Christian term ‘cemetery’ (= sleeping-place) in the sense of a place of repose for the dead comes from the same Greek root. The exact time of Lazarus’ death cannot be determined, for we do not know how long Christ took in reaching Bethany. Christ calls him ‘<span class="ital">our</span> friend,’ as claiming the sympathy of the disciples, who had shewn unwillingness to return to Judæa.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that I may awake him</span>] This shews that no messenger has come to announce the death. Christ sees the death as He foresees the resurrection: comp. <span class="ital"><a href="/john/11-4.htm" title="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.">John 11:4</a></span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/11-11.htm" title="These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.">John 11:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ταῦτα</span>—<span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>) <span class="ital">These things said He, and after this</span> saying forthwith <span class="ital">He saith</span>, etc. Comp. <a href="/john/11-7.htm" title="Then after that said he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.">John 11:7</a>, “<span class="ital">Then after this saith He</span>.”—<span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>, <span class="ital">He saith</span>) He said it at the very time in which Lazarus had died. Comp. ch. <a href="/john/4-52.htm" title="Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.">John 4:52</a>, [The nobleman’s son recovered of the fever] “at the same hour in the which Jesus said, Thy son liveth.” The disciples also had heard of the illness of Lazarus, <a href="/context/john/11-3.htm" title="Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick....">John 11:3-4</a>. No one had announced his death; and yet Jesus knew it.—<span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">our</span>) With what an entirely human feeling [<span class="ital">humanness</span>] Jesus communicates [imparts] His friendship to His disciples!—<span class="greekheb">κεκοίμηται</span>, <span class="ital">is fallen asleep</span>) Death is the sleep of the pious in the language of heaven; but the disciples did not here understand His language. The liberal freedom of the Divine language is incomparable: but the dulness of men causes that Scripture often descends to our more sombre mode of speaking. Comp. <a href="/matthew/16-11.htm" title="How is it that you do not understand that I spoke it not to you concerning bread, that you should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?">Matthew 16:11</a>, etc., “How is it that you do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of <span class="ital">the leaven</span> of the Pharisees?”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things spake he,</span> and probably many more words expository of the vast principle of service which he here propounded; <span class="cmt_word">and after this</span> (for <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> implies a break, during which the disciples pondered his words) <span class="cmt_word">he saith, Our friend Lazarus</span>; implying that Lazarus was well known to the disciples, and that the Lord classes himself here, in wondrous condescension, with <span class="accented">them</span>. He elsewhere speaks of the twelve as his "friends" (<a href="/john/15-14.htm">John 15:14, 15</a>, where he made it a higher designation than <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>; see also <a href="/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>). John the Baptist also calls himself "the Bridegroom's friend" (<a href="/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>). Though Lazarus had passed into the region of the unknown and unseen, he was still" our friend." <span class="cmt_word">Hath fallen asleep</span>. Meyer says that Jesus knew this by "spiritual far-seeing;" and Godet thinks that he knew it by supernatural process, and had known it all along. It does not require much beyond what we know to have occurred in thousands of instances, for our Lord to have perceived that his friend had died - had, as he said, "fallen asleep," in that new sense in which Jesus was teaching men to look on death. <span class="cmt_word">But I go, that I may awake him out of sleep</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> is a late Greek word; cf. <a href="/acts/16-27.htm">Acts 16:27</a>). Wunsche says the Talmud often speaks of a rabbi's death under the form of" sleep" ('Moed. K.,' fol. 28, a; cf. <a href="/matthew/9-24.htm">Matthew 9:24</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>). Homer spoke of death and sleep as "twin sisters," Christ's power and consciousness of power to awake Lazarus from sleep gives, however, to his use of the image a new meaning. It is not the eternal sleep of the Greek and Roman poets. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Sleepeth (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>More correctly, as Rev., hath fallen asleep.
