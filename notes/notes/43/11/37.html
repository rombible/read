The other miracles of raising the dead they must have heard of, but had not believed. What they think of here is not raising the dead, but the possibility of preventing death; and their question is meant to imply that He could not have prevented this death. If He could, surely He would have done so for one whom He had loved, and would have come at once, instead of waiting until death had taken place. The inference they would draw is that, after all, the present failure is a proof that He did not open the eyes of the blind.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:33-46 Christ's tender sympathy with these afflicted friends, appeared by the troubles of his spirit. In all the afflictions of believers he is afflicted. His concern for them was shown by his kind inquiry after the remains of his deceased friend. Being found in fashion as a man, he acts in the way and manner of the sons of men. It was shown by his tears. He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. Tears of compassion resemble those of Christ. But Christ never approved that sensibility of which many are proud, while they weep at mere tales of distress, but are hardened to real woe. He sets us an example to withdraw from scenes of giddy mirth, that we may comfort the afflicted. And we have not a High Priest who cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities. It is a good step toward raising a soul to spiritual life, when the stone is taken away, when prejudices are removed, and got over, and way is made for the word to enter the heart. If we take Christ's word, and rely on his power and faithfulness, we shall see the glory of God, and be happy in the sight. Our Lord Jesus has taught us, by his own example, to call God Father, in prayer, and to draw nigh to him as children to a father, with humble reverence, yet with holy boldness. He openly made this address to God, with uplifted eyes and loud voice, that they might be convinced the Father had sent him as his beloved Son into the world. He could have raised Lazarus by the silent exertion of his power and will, and the unseen working of the Spirit of life; but he did it by a loud call. This was a figure of the gospel call, by which dead souls are brought out of the grave of sin: and of the sound of the archangel's trumpet at the last day, with which all that sleep in the dust shall be awakened, and summoned before the great tribunal. The grave of sin and this world, is no place for those whom Christ has quickened; they must come forth. Lazarus was thoroughly revived, and returned not only to life, but to health. The sinner cannot quicken his own soul, but he is to use the means of grace; the believer cannot sanctify himself, but he is to lay aside every weight and hinderance. We cannot convert our relatives and friends, but we should instruct, warn, and invite them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jesus wept - It has been remarked that this is the shortest verse in the Bible; but it is exceedingly important and tender. It shows the Lord Jesus as a friend, a tender friend, and evinces his character as a man. And from this we learn:<p>1. That the most tender personal friendship is not inconsistent with the most pure religion. Piety binds stronger the ties of friendship, makes more tender the emotions of love, and seals and sanctifies the affections of friends.<p>2. It is right, it is natural, it is indispensable for the Christian to sympathize with others in their afflictions. <a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>; "rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."<p>3. Sorrow at the death of friends is not improper. It is right to weep. It is the expression of nature and religion does not forbid or condemn it. All that religion does in the case is to temper and chasten our grief; to teach us to mourn with submission to God; to weep without complaining, and to seek to banish tears, not by hardening the heart or forgetting the friend, but by bringing the soul, made tender by grief, to receive the sweet influences of religion, and to find calmness and peace in the God of all consolation.<p>4. We have here an instance of the tenderness of the character of Jesus, The same Savior wept over Jerusalem, and felt deeply for poor dying, sinners. To the same tender and compassionate Saviour Christians may now come <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>; and to him the penitent sinner may also come, knowing that he will not cast him away. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37. And&#8212;rather, "But."<p>some &#8230; said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that this man should not have died?&#8212;The former exclamation came from the better-feeling portion of the spectators; this betokens a measure of suspicion. It hardly goes the length of attesting the miracle on the blind man; but "if (as everybody says) He did that, why could He not also have kept Lazarus alive?" As to the restoration of the dead man to life, they never so much as thought of it. But this disposition to dictate to divine power, and almost to peril our confidence in it upon its doing our bidding, is not confined to men of no faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some only concluded Christ’s love to the deceased from his affection showed at his grave; but others made a worse conclusion, in derogation to Christ’s reputation, from the miracle he had wrought, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/9-1.htm" title="And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth....">John 9:1-34</a></span>, in restoring him that was born blind; for their speech soundeth in this sense, If he had indeed cured one that was born blind, certainly he could as well have kept this man, to whom (dead) he expresses so great affection, clear from death. A learned interpreter therefore calleth this, a devilish sarcasm; they go about to weaken the reputation of our Saviour, from the miracle which he had wrought, apparently showing his Divine power, because he did not keep his friend from dying. It is much like the scoff with which they afterward scoffed him, while he flung upon the cross, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/27-42.htm" title="He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.">Matthew 27:42</a></span>, <span class="ital">He saved others; himself he cannot save.</span> Or the words may have been spoken, if not with an irony, yet with admiration, that having cured the blind man, a stranger to him, he did not heal his sick friend; or as if they were uncertain whether his power of working miracles were not limited to some times, that he could not perform all things when he pleased. But how weak must this their argumentation be, which could stand upon no other foundation than this, That if Christ were the Son of God, he would at all times, and in all cases, have put forth his Divine power. As if God acted necessarily, not freely, governing his actions by his own wisdom, as he saw most conducing to the wise ends of his glory. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And some of them said,.... Who were averse to him, and bore him a secret grudge, and were willing to put the worst construction on every action of his: <p>could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind; as it is said, at least pretended, that he did, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6</a>, for this must be understood as calling the miracle into question, and as a sneer upon it, and not as taking it for granted that so it was; and even supposing that, it is mentioned to his reproach, since if so, he might <p>have caused that, even this man should not died: for either the above cure was a sham, or, if it was a real thing, he who did that could have prevented Lazarus's death; and if he could, and would not, where is his friendship? and what must be thought of all this show of affection to him? and what are these tears, but crocodile ones? but this reasoning, as specious as it may seem, was very fallacious; for he that cured the man born blind could raise Lazarus from the dead, which he intended; and therefore did not prevent his death, that he might still give more joy to the family, bring more glory to God, and himself, and more shame and confusion to his enemies. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/11-37.htm" title="And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?">John 11:37</a>. But this again suggested to the more thoughtful and wary the question, <span class="greekheb">Οὑκ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀποθάνῃ</span>; The tears of Jesus, which manifest His love for Lazarus, puzzle them. For if He opened the eyes of a blind man, He was able to prevent the death of His friend. The question with <span class="greekheb">οὐκ</span> expects an affirmative answer. Euthymius and the Greek interpreters in general think the question was ironical and scoffing. Thus Cyril, <span class="greekheb">Ποῦ ἡ ἰσχύς σου ὦ θαυματουργέ</span>; But there is nothing in the words to justify this.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">37</span>. <span class="ital">And some of them</span>] Better, <span class="bld">But</span> <span class="ital">some of them</span>, in contrast to those who speak in <span class="ital"><a href="/john/11-36.htm" title="Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!">John 11:36</a></span>, who are not unfriendly, while these sneer. The drift of this remark is ‘He weeps; but why did He not come in time to save His friend? Because He knew that He could not. And if He could not, did he really open the eyes of the blind?’ They use the death of Lazarus as an argument to throw fresh doubt on the miracle which had so baffled them at Jerusalem. Their reference to the man born blind instead of to the widow’s son, or Jairus’ daughter, has been used as an objection to the truth of this narrative. It is really a strong confirmation of its truth. An inventor would almost certainly have preferred more obvious parallels. But these Jews of course did not believe in those raisings of the dead: they much more naturally refer to a reputed miracle within their own experience. Moreover they are not hinting at raising the dead, but urging that if Jesus could work miracles He ought to have prevented, Lazarus from dying.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">should not have died</span>] Rather, <span class="ital">should not</span> <span class="bld">die</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/11-37.htm" title="And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?">John 11:37</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τινές</span>, <span class="ital">some</span>) who were more estranged [averse] from faith.—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἠδύνατο</span>, <span class="ital">could not?</span>) Jesus had shed tears.

They draw their conclusion from the greater exercise of power to the less. But then to raise the dead is, in its turn, a greater exercise of power, than to cure the sick or restore sight to the blind. The conclusion, which they ought to have drawn, was this: He hath given sight to the blind; therefore He can give life to the dead.
