But the first reason passes over the fact that their faith had been shown in their message to Him; and the second postulates His presence at Bethany as necessary for the restoration of Lazarus. (Comp. <a href="/context/john/4-49.htm" title="The nobleman said to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.">John 4:49-50</a>.) A juster view is that which remembers the principle which He had taught at the first miracle (<a href="/john/2-4.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.">John 2:4</a>), that the hours of His work were marked out by signs that He alone could read, but that every hour had its work, and every work its hour.

He came not to preserve his people from these afflictions, but to save them from their sins, and from the wrath to come; however, it behoves us to apply to Him in behalf of our friends and relatives when sick and afflicted. Let this reconcile us to the darkest dealings of Providence, that they are all for the glory of God: sickness, loss, disappointment, are so; and if God be glorified, we ought to be satisfied. Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. The families are greatly favoured in which love and peace abound; but those are most happy whom Jesus loves, and by whom he is beloved. Alas, that this should seldom be the case with every person, even in small families. God has gracious intentions, even when he seems to delay. When the work of deliverance, temporal or spiritual, public or personal, is delayed, it does but stay for the right time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He abode two days - Probably Lazarus died soon after the messengers left him. Jesus knew that (<a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a>), and did not hasten to Judea, but remained two days longer where he was, that there might not be the possibility of doubt that he was dead, so that when he came there he had been dead four days, <a href="/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39</a>. This shows, moreover, that he intended to raise him up. If he had not, it could hardly be reconciled with friendship thus to remain, without any reason, away from an afflicted family.<p>Where he was - At Bethabara <a href="/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40</a>, about 30 miles from Bethany. This was about a day's journey, and it renders it probable that Lazarus died soon after the message was sent. One day would be occupied before the message came to him; two days he remained; one day would be occupied by him in going to Bethany; so that Lazarus had been dead four days <a href="/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39</a> when he arrived. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. When he heard he was sick, he abode two days still &#8230; where he was&#8212;at least twenty-five miles off. Beyond all doubt this was just to let things come to their worst, in order to display His glory. But how trying, meantime, to the faith of his friends, and how unlike the way in which love to a dying friend usually shows itself, on which it is plain that Mary reckoned. But the ways of divine are not as the ways of human love. Often they are the reverse. When His people are sick, in body or spirit; when their case is waxing more and more desperate every day; when all hope of recovery is about to expire&#8212;just then and therefore it is that "He abides two days still in the same place where He is." Can they still hope against hope? Often they do not; but "this is their infirmity." For it is His chosen style of acting. We have been well taught it, and should not now have the lesson to learn. From the days of Moses was it given sublimely forth as the character of His grandest interpositions, that "the Lord will judge His people and repent Himself for His servants"&#8212;when He seeth that their power is gone (De 32:36).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Though he loved him and his sisters with a tender love, yet he did not presently go to them, to comfort Mary and Martha in their sorrow; nor yet to cure Lazarus, and prevent his death; but stayed still two days in the place where he was. He loved Mary, and Martha, and Lazarus, but he more loved the honour and glory of his Father, which was to be manifested in his raising of Lazarus from the dead. We must not judge of Christ’s love to us by his mere external dispensations of providence; nor judge that he doth not love us because he doth not presently come in to our help, at our times, and in such ways and methods as we would think reasonable. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When he had heard therefore that he was sick,....

It is to be explained by a reference back to <a href="/john/11-4.htm" title="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.">John 11:4</a>, according to which Jesus was conscious of its being the <span class="ital">divine will</span> that the miracle should be performed precisely under the circumstances and at the <span class="ital">time</span> at which it actually was performed, and no otherwise (comp. <a href="/john/2-4.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.">John 2:4</a>), for the glory of God. The divine <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span>, of which He was conscious, decided Him, and that, under a moral necessity, lest He should act <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ μοῖραν</span>, to remain still; the same <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span> again impelled Him at once to depart, when, in virtue of His immediate knowledge, He became aware of the death of His friend. Comp. on <a href="/john/11-17.htm" title="Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.">John 11:17</a>. All the more groundless was it to make use of the delay of Jesus as an argument against the historical truth of the narrative (Bretschneider, Strauss, Weisse, Gfrörer, Baur, Hilgenfeld), according to which Jesus intentionally allowed Lazarus to die, in order that He might be able to raise him up again (Baur, p. 193).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν</span>] for they were in Peraea, <a href="/john/10-40.htm" title="And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he stayed.">John 10:40</a>. The more definite goal, <span class="ital">Bethany</span>, is not at first mentioned; but is specified afterwards, <a href="/john/11-11.htm" title="These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.">John 11:11</a>; <a href="/john/11-15.htm" title="And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent you may believe; nevertheless let us go to him.">John 11:15</a>. The less reason, therefore, is there for finding a special design in the use of the words <span class="greekheb">εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδ</span>. (Luthardt: “into the land of unbelief and hostility”), a meaning which Godet and Gumlich import also into <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/11-6.htm" title="When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he stayed two days still in the same place where he was.">John 11:6</a>. Jesus loved the family, <span class="greekheb">ὡς οὖν ἤκουσεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">τότε μὲν ἔμεινεν</span>. We expect another consequence: “Jesus loved them, therefore He immediately went to Bethany”. But the consequence indicated in <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> is found in <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>, <a href="/john/11-7.htm" title="Then after that said he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.">John 11:7</a>, and the whole sentence should read: “When, therefore, He had heard that he was ill, for the present indeed [<span class="greekheb">τότε μὲν</span> = tum quidem], He remained for two days where He was; then after this He says to His disciples, Let us go into Judaea again”. The <span class="greekheb">μέν</span> after <span class="greekheb">τότε</span> suggests a <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> after <span class="greekheb">ἔπειτα</span> and unites the two clauses.

Jesus remained two days inactive, not to test the faith of the sisters, which Holtzmann justly characterises as “grausam”; but, as Godet, Holtzmann, and Weiss agree, because He awaited the prompting of the Father, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/john/2-4.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.">John 2:4</a>, <a href="/context/john/7-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him....">John 7:1-10</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">When he had heard therefore</span>] Omit ‘had.’ The connexion is a little difficult. ‘Therefore’ after the statement in <span class="ital"><a href="/john/11-5.htm" title="Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.">John 11:5</a></span> prepares us for ‘He set out immediately,’ but instead of that we have the reverse. ‘Therefore,’ however, really leads on to <span class="ital"><a href="/john/11-7.htm" title="Then after that said he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.">John 11:7</a></span>, and consequently there should be only a semicolon at the end of <span class="ital"><a href="/john/11-6.htm" title="When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he stayed two days still in the same place where he was.">John 11:6</a></span>. <span class="bld">When, therefore, He heard that he is sick, then indeed</span> <span class="ital">He abode two days in the place where He was; then after</span> <span class="bld">this</span> <span class="ital">He saith</span>, &c. The question <span class="ital">why</span> Christ remained the two days is futile: such was the Divine Will with regard to the mode of working this miracle and to His Messianic work generally. His life was a perfect fulfilment of the Preacher’s rule; ‘To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven’ (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm" title="To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>; comp. <span class="ital"><a href="/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?

He did not remain because he loved, but, <span class="accented">though</span> he remained, and <span class="accented">because</span> he loved, he said, "Let us," etc. So that we do not see here any intention on his part, by remaining, to test their love (Olshausen), nor to exaggerate the effect of the miracle by raising a dead man from his grave rather than from his death-bed or his bier. It is not difficult to gather from the sequel that when the message reached Jesus Lazarus was dead and buried. We find that when our Lord returned to Bethany four days had elapsed since the death of Lazarus, and the four days must be calculated thus: First one long day's journey from Peraea to Bethany, a distance of eight or nine leagues. If the messenger of the sisters had taken equal time to reach Jesus in Perked, or even a longer period, as time might easily be consumed in the effort to find our Lord in the mountains of Moab; then the two days of his waiting after receiving the message would, with those occupied by the double journey, make up the four that had passed when Jesus reached the grave. Lucke, Neander, Godet, and Westcott think that our Lord remained in Peraea because there was work in which he was engaged and could not relinquish. Meyer, Moulton, and Weiss, that he waited for some especial communication from his Father, for some revelation of moral necessity and heavenly inspiration, like those which dictated all his other movements. B. Weiss: "It was a sacrifice to his calling, of his heart's most ardent desires, that he remained quietly two days in the same place." "We see," says Edersheim, "Christ once more asleep while the disciples are despairing, swamped in the storm! Christ never in haste, because always sure." The silences of Scripture and the waitings of God are often without explanation. The event proves that deep purpose presided over them. The "let us go," etc., implies a lofty courage, a sense of coming crisis. Love conquers fear and peril for himself and his followers. "Judaea" is mentioned rather than Bethany for the same reason. The "again" points forcibly back to the last visit, when he told both friends and foes that the good Shepherd would snatch his sheep from the jaws of death, even though he lay down his own life in the doing of it. </body></html>
