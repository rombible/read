The time was come when the dead should hear his voice, as the Son of God, and live. Our Lord first refers to his raising those who were dead in sin, to newness of life, by the power of the Spirit, and then to his raising the dead in their graves. The office of Judge of all men, can only be exercised by one who has all knowledge, and almighty power. May we believe His testimony; thus our faith and hope will be in God, and we shall not come into condemnation. And may His voice reach the hearts of those dead in sin; that they may do works meet for repentance, and prepare for the solemn day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that heareth my word - To "hear," in this place, evidently denotes not the outward act of hearing, but to receive in a proper manner; to suffer it to make its proper impression on the mind; to obey. The word "hear" is often used in this sense, <a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>; <a href="/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>; <a href="/acts/3-23.htm">Acts 3:23</a>. Many persons outwardly hear the gospel who neither understand nor obey it.<p>My word - My doctrine, my teaching. All that Jesus taught about Himself, as well as about the Father.<p>On him that sent me - On the Father, who, in the plan of redemption, is represented as "sending" his Son to save men. See <a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>. Faith in God, who sent his Son, is here represented as being connected with everlasting life; but there can be no faith in him who "sent" his Son, without faith also in him who is "sent." The belief of one of the true doctrines of religion is connected with, and will lead to, the belief of all.<p>Hath everlasting life - The state of man by nature is represented as death in sin, <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>. Religion is the opposite of this, or is "life." The "dead" regard not anything. They are unaffected by the cares, pleasures, amusements of the world. They hear neither the voice of merriment nor the tread of the living over their graves. So with sinners. They are unmoved with the, things of religion. They hear not the voice of God; they see not his loveliness; they care not for his threatenings. But religion is "life." The Christian lives with God, and feels and acts as if there was a God. Religion, and its blessings here and hereafter, are one and the same. The happiness of heaven is living for God - being sensible of his presence, and glory, and power - and rejoicing in that. There shall be no more "death" there, <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>. This "life," or this religion, whether on earth or in heaven, is the same - the same joys extended and expanded forever. Hence, when a man is converted, it is said that he "has" everlasting life; not merely shall have but is already in possession of that life or happiness which shall be everlasting. It is life begun, expanded, ripening for the skies. He has already entered on his inheritance - that inheritance which is everlasting.<p>Shall not come into condemnation - He was by nature under condemnation. See <a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>. Here it is declared that he shall not return to that state, or he will not be again condemned. This promise is sure; it is made by the Son of God, and there is no one that can pluck them out of his hand, <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>. Compare the notes at <a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>.<p>But is passed from death unto life - Has "passed over" from a state of spiritual death to the life of the Christian. The word translated "is passed" would be better expressed by "has passed." It implies that he has done it voluntarily; that none compelled him; and that the passage is made unto "everlasting" life. Because Christ is the author of this life in the soul, he is called the "Life" <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>; and as he has "always" existed, and is the Source of "all life," he is called the "eternal life," <a href="/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. believeth on him that sent me&#8212;that is, believeth in Him as having sent Me.

And it is through His claims, His teaching, His offers, He brings Himself into connection with all. It is a general truth not confined to the impotent man. But to hear is not enough: <span class="greekheb">καὶ πιστεύων τῷ πέμψαντί με</span>, belief on Him that sent Jesus must accompany hearing. Not simply belief on Jesus but on God. The word of Jesus must be recognised as a Divine message, a word with power to fulfil it. In this case, by the very hearing and believing, <span class="greekheb">ἔχει ζωὴν αἰώνιον</span>. As the impotent man had, in his believing, physical life, so whoever believes in Christ’s word as God’s message receives the life of God into his spirit. Faith has also a negative result; <span class="greekheb">εἰς κρίσιν οὐκ ἔρχεται</span> [<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐθελόντων ὑμῶν ἐλθεῖν εἰς κρίσιν</span>, quoted from Demosthenes by Wetstein. Herodotus also uses the expression]. Literally this means “he does not come to trial”; but has it not the fuller meaning “come under condemnation”? Meyer says “yes”: Godet says “no”. Meyer is right. This clause is the direct negative of the former: to come to judgment is to come under condemnation, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/john/3-19.htm" title="And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.">John 3:19</a>, <span class="greekheb">αὕτη δὲ ἐστιν ἡ κρίσις</span>, etc. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ μεταβέβηκεν ἐκ τοῦ θανάτου εἰς τὴν ζωήν</span>. The perfect shows (1) that the previous <span class="greekheb">ἔχει</span> is an actual present, and does not merely mean “has in prospect” or “has a right to”; and (2) that the result of the transition continues. Had the impotent man not believed and obeyed, he would have remained in his living death, in now a self-chosen and self-fixed condemnation: but accepting the life that was in Christ’s command, he passed there and then from death to life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">He that heareth</span>] We see from this that ‘whom He will’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21</a></span>) implies no arbitrary selection.

In vers. 21-23, indeed Vers. 19-23, the Lord had been speaking prominently of the ideal sonship, of "the Son" on the Divine side of his  consciousness. The use of the first person, which is here resumed, calls more express attention to the consciousness of his human manifestation, which again reaches its climax in ver. 27. <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you -</span> I, whose voice you now hear, whom you are misunderstanding, rejecting, and seeking to slay. <span class="accented">I say</span> with most solemn emphasis - <span class="cmt_word">He that heareth my word</span> - this term, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, suggests moral as well as physical hearing, and means whosoever allows my thought to penetrate his nature, hears and understands, hears and acts accordingly (cf. <a href="/matthew/11-1.htm">Matthew 11:1</a><span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> 5; 13:9, 18; <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7, 17</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-22.htm">Revelation 3:22</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="accented">further <span class="cmt_word"></span>believeth him that sent me;</span> believeth <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that he has borne and is continually bearing true witness concerning me.

To believe on a person, or in one, conveys a different idea from believing that person with regard to any special assertion he may make. Here the belief of God has emphatic reference to the testimony the Father is bearing to the claims of Jesus. Such a hearer, such a believer, <span class="cmt_word">hath eternal life</span>; even here he has entered into the "eternal now;" on earth he is in possession of the blessed consummation. Such belief in words authenticated by the Father's commission is eternal life (cf. <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). It lifts a man out of the reach of corruption and condemnation, it ushers him into eternity, it is an eternal blessedness in itself; <span class="cmt_word">and he cometh not to judgment, but has passed from the death, into the life.</span> He is already translated from the death state to the renewed, quickened state. The decision and discrimination between him and the world have taken place. The judgment is over, the books are closed, the condemnation is no longer possible. He will not perish, he has eternal life. "The believer is tree from the judgment which executes itself in the exclusion inflicted on the unbeliever, by the revelation of Jesus as the Light, because he is already in possession of the saving blessing" (Luthardt). Judgment, being completed, does not require repetition" (Godet). "When that confidence in Christ has illumined the heart wherein we recognize that we have been verily accepted, listened to, ruled, and defended by God, peace follows, and high joyfulness, which is the realization of eternal life, and which covers the sins that erewhile had clung to our weakness" (Melancthon). In this life of faith "we taste the powers of the world to come," "our citizenship is in heaven." "This eternal life is a veritable resurrection of the dead" (Augustine). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Heareth<p>Closely connected with believeth.<p>Hath eternal life<p>See on <a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>.<p>Shall not come into condemnation (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>The present tense, cometh not.
