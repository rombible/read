Will this Stranger, whom he has never seen before, do for him what none of those who often saw him had ever done? Will he watch for the bubbling water, and place him first in it?

Day by day he has watched, listened for the first sound, caught the first movement in the bath, summoned the feeble vestiges of strength to an action on which all depended, and hoping each succeeding time, in spite of despair in which last time’s hope has been engulfed, has been coming, when “another goeth down before.” “I have no man” is to-day the helpless, unspoken cry of thousands imaged here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/john/5-7.htm" title="The weak man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.">John 5:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">The impotent man answered, I have no man </span>— I am poor as well as lame, and unable to hire any one <span class="ital">to put me into the pool when the water is troubled, </span>and I have neither friend nor relation to do this kind office for me. He seems to consider Christ’s question as implying an imputation of carelessness and neglect in him, and, therefore, gives the reason why he was not made whole, notwithstanding his desire. <span class="ital">While I am coming, another steppeth down before me </span>— He signifies that he had made many efforts to get into the pool, but hitherto without success, one or another always preventing him; and none having the charity to say, Your case is worse than mine; do you go in now, and I will stay till the next time; for the old maxim is but too true, <span class="ital">Every one for himself. </span>Observe, reader, how mildly this man speaks of the unkindness of those about him, making no peevish reflections on any one. As we should be thankful for the least kindness, so we should be patient under the greatest contempts: and whatever cause we may think we have for resentment, yet we should take care that our expressions be always calm. And observe further, to his praise, that though he had waited so long in vain, yet still he continued lying by the pool side, hoping that some time or other help would come.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 We are all by nature impotent folk in spiritual things, blind, halt, and withered; but full provision is made for our cure, if we attend to it. An angel went down, and troubled the water; and what disease soever it was, this water cured it, but only he that first stepped in had benefit. This teaches us to be careful, that we let not a season slip which may never return. The man had lost the use of his limbs thirty-eight years. Shall we, who perhaps for many years have scarcely known what it has been to be a day sick, complain of one wearisome night, when many others, better than we, have scarcely known what it has been to be a day well? Christ singled this one out from the rest. Those long in affliction, may comfort themselves that God keeps account how long. Observe, this man speaks of the unkindness of those about him, without any peevish reflections. As we should be thankful, so we should be patient. Our Lord Jesus cures him, though he neither asked nor thought of it. Arise, and walk. God's command, Turn and live; Make ye a new heart; no more supposes power in us without the grace of God, his distinguishing grace, than this command supposed such power in the impotent man: it was by the power of Christ, and he must have all the glory. What a joyful surprise to the poor cripple, to find himself of a sudden so easy, so strong, so able to help himself! The proof of spiritual cure, is our rising and walking. Has Christ healed our spiritual diseases, let us go wherever he sends us, and take up whatever he lays upon us; and walk before him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sir, I have no man ... - The answer of the man implied that he did wish it, but, in addition to all his other trials, he had no "friend" to aid him.

Sir, I have no man, &c.&#8212;Instead of saying he wished to be cured, he just tells with piteous simplicity how fruitless had been all his efforts to obtain it, and how helpless and all but hopeless he was. Yet not quite. For here he is at the pool, waiting on. It seemed of no use; nay, only tantalizing,<p>while I am coming, another steppeth down before me&#8212;the fruit was snatched from his lips. Yet he will not go away. He may get nothing by staying, he may drop into his grave ere he get into the pool; but by going from the appointed, divine way of healing, he can get nothing. Wait therefore he will, wait he does, and when Christ comes to heal him, lo! he is waiting his turn. What an attitude for a sinner at Mercy's gate! The man's hopes seemed low enough ere Christ came to him. He might have said, just before "Jesus passed by that way," "This is no use; I shall never get in; let me die at home." Then all had been lost. But he held on, and his perseverance was rewarded with a glorious cure. Probably some rays of hope darted into his heart as he told his tale before those Eyes whose glance measured his whole case. But the word of command consummates his preparation to receive the cure, and instantaneously works it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> What his particular impotency was the Scripture doth not tell us. Some have (not improbably) judged it the palsy, which deprives the person of motion, by the stoppage of the animal spirits, so that without help he cannot move from one place to another, which it is manifest this poor man could not; for he complains for want of help, that he could not get into the pool. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The impotent man answered him, Sir,.... Which was a common and courteous way of speaking, much in use with the Jews, especially to strangers. The Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions read, "yea Lord", which is a direct answer to the question: <p>I have no man; the Ethiopic version reads, "men"; he had no servant, so Nonnus, or servants, to wait upon him, and take him up in their arms, and carry him into the pool; he was a poor man, and such God is pleased to choose and call by his grace: <p>when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool; that is, as soon as it is troubled by the angel, to put him in first before any other; for it was the first man only that had a cure this way: <p>but while I am coming; in a slow way, by the help of his crutches, or in the best manner he could: <p>another steppeth down before me; not so much disordered, or more active and nimble: so among those that wait on the ministry of the word, some are sooner in Christ, or earlier called by his grace, than others; some lie here a long time, and see one and another come to Christ, believe in him, profess his name, and are received into the church; and they still left, in an uncalled and unconverted estate. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">I have no man</span>] He is not only sick but friendless.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is troubled</span>] No doubt this took place at irregular intervals, else there would be no need to wait and watch for it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to put me into the pool</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">in order to</span> (<a href="/john/4-47.htm" title="When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went to him, and sought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.">John 4:47</a>) <span class="bld">throw</span> <span class="ital">me into the pool</span>; perhaps implying that the gush of water did not last long and there was no time to be lost in quiet carrying.

This implies that some special advantage accompanied the troubling of the water. The sudden escape of the medicinal gas may have soon subsided, and, with it, the special virtue of the well. The difficulty which the sick man found in reaching the point of disturbance may be accounted for in many ways. The steps which led into the water; the weakness of the sufferer, which made it an impossible task without help; the eagerness at many other impotent folk to take advantage of the supposed cure, jostling one another with selfish haste; or the absence of any personal friend to fight his battle for him, and cast him (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;</span>) with the required plunge into water. The last point may be explained on the supposition that he was a comparative stranger in Jerusalem, and had made no friends; or by another, which several other allusions justify, viz. that he was a man who, from some reason or other, could neither make nor retain friendship. The melancholy recital of his frequent disappointment is given with an air of mendicant resignation - a kind of morbid satisfaction with his lot. The phrase, "while I am coming, another," etc., implies that he could move, if slowly, without help. The moroseness of self-dependence characterizes some sufferers, who rather glory in isolation than lament it. Still, the words express the hopelessness of thousands who, for lack of human help, are jostled out of life, peace, and salvation. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Put (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>Literally, cast; indicating the hasty movement required to bring him to the water before its agitation should have ceased.
