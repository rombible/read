They had not believed Moses, and therefore had not believed Him. They do not believe, for they do not read the spiritual meaning of the writings of Moses even now. What ground of hope is left? His words, revealing the deeper truths of the kingdom of God, will fall upon their ears as so many unmeaning sounds. (Comp.

And from this we may learn:<p>1. That many men who profess to believe the Bible have really no regard for it when it crosses their own views and inclinations.<p>2. It is our duty to study the Bible, that we may be established in the belief that Jesus is the Messiah.<p>3. The prophecies of the Old Testament are conclusive proofs of the truth of the Christian religion.<p>4. He that rejects one part of the Bible, will, for the same reason, reject all.<p>5. The Saviour acknowledged the truth of the writings of Moses, built his religion upon them, appealed to them to prove that he was the Messiah, and commanded men to search them. We have the testimony of Jesus, therefore, that the Old Testament is a revelation from God. He that rejects his testimony on This subject must reject his authority altogether; and it is vain for any man to profess to believe in the New Testament, or in the Lord Jesus, without also acknowledging the authority of the Old Testament and of Moses.<p>We have in this chapter an instance of the profound and masterly manner in which Jesus could meet and silence his enemies. There is not anywhere a more conclusive argument, or a more triumphant meeting of the charges which they had brought against him. No one can read this without being struck with his profound wisdom; and it is scarcely possible to conceive that there could be a more distinct declaration and proof that he was equal with God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>47.

Hence it may describe either a single character or a document. From this general notion several forms develop themselves in the New Testament. The word occurs in its narrower sense of characters, at <a href="/luke/23-38.htm">Luke 23:38</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-11.htm">Galatians 6:11</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/28-21.htm">Acts 28:21</a>, it means official communications. Paul, with a single exception (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>), uses it of the letter of scripture as contrasted with its spirit (<a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-27.htm">Romans 2:27</a>, <a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/16-6.htm">Luke 16:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/16-7.htm">Luke 16:7</a>, it denotes a debtor's bond (A.V., bill). In <a href="//biblehub.com/john/7-15.htm">John 7:15</a>, <a href="/acts/26-24.htm">Acts 26:24</a>) it is used in the plural as a general term for scriptural and Rabbinical learning. Compare Sept., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11</a>,<a href="/isaiah/29-12.htm">Isaiah 29:12</a>) where a learned man is described as &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, acquainted with letters. Once it is used collectively of the sacred writings - the scriptures (<a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>), though some give it a wider reference to Rabbinical exegesis, as well as to scripture itself. Among the Alexandrian Greeks the term is not confined to elementary instruction, but includes exposition, based, however, on critical study of the text. The tendency of such exegesis was often toward mystical and allegorical interpretation, degenerating into a petty ingenuity in fixing new and recondite meanings upon the old and familiar forms. This was illustrated by the Neo-Platonists' expositions of Homer, and by the Rabbinical exegesis. Men unacquainted with such studies, especially if they appeared as public teachers, would be regarded as ignorant by the Jews of the times of Christ and the Apostles. Hence the question respecting our Lord Himself: How knoweth this man letters (&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; <a href="/john/7-15.htm">John 7:15</a>)? Also the comment upon Peter and John (<a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>) that they were unlearned (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;). Thus, too, those who discovered in the Old Testament scriptures references to Christ, would be stigmatized by Pagans, as following the ingenious and fanciful method of the Jewish interpreters, which they held in contempt. Some such feeling may have provoked the words of Festus to Paul: Much learning (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;) doth make thee mad (<a href="/acts/26-24.htm">Acts 26:24</a>). It is well known with what minute care the literal transcription of the sacred writings was guarded. The Scribes (&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;) were charged with producing copies according to the letter (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;).<p>The one passage in second Timothy cannot be urged in favor of the general use of the term for the scriptures, especially since the best texts reject the article before &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, so that the meaning is apparently more general: "thou hast known sacred writings." The familiar formula for the scriptures was &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. A single book of the collection of writings was known as &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (<a href="/luke/4-17.htm">Luke 4:17</a>), or &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="/luke/20-42.htm">Luke 20:42</a>); never &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;, which was the term for a particular passage. See on <a href="/mark/12-10.htm">Mark 12:10</a>.<p>It seems to me, therefore, that the antithesis between the writings of Moses, superstitiously reverenced in the letter, and minutely and critically searched and expounded by the Jews, and the living words (&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, see on <a href="/luke/1-37.htm">Luke 1:37</a>), is to be recognized. This, however, need not exclude the other antithesis between Moses and Jesus personally. </body></html>
