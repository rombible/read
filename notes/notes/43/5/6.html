An angel went down, and troubled the water; and what disease soever it was, this water cured it, but only he that first stepped in had benefit. This teaches us to be careful, that we let not a season slip which may never return. The man had lost the use of his limbs thirty-eight years. Shall we, who perhaps for many years have scarcely known what it has been to be a day sick, complain of one wearisome night, when many others, better than we, have scarcely known what it has been to be a day well? Christ singled this one out from the rest. Those long in affliction, may comfort themselves that God keeps account how long. Observe, this man speaks of the unkindness of those about him, without any peevish reflections. As we should be thankful, so we should be patient. Our Lord Jesus cures him, though he neither asked nor thought of it. Arise, and walk. God's command, Turn and live; Make ye a new heart; no more supposes power in us without the grace of God, his distinguishing grace, than this command supposed such power in the impotent man: it was by the power of Christ, and he must have all the glory. What a joyful surprise to the poor cripple, to find himself of a sudden so easy, so strong, so able to help himself! The proof of spiritual cure, is our rising and walking. Has Christ healed our spiritual diseases, let us go wherever he sends us, and take up whatever he lays upon us; and walk before him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An infirmity - A weakness.

But our Lord asked the question. (1) To fasten attention upon Himself; (2) By making him detail his case to deepen in him the feeling of entire helplessness; (3) By so singular a question to beget in his desponding heart the hope of a cure. (Compare Mr 10:51).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Christ, as God, knew the particular time when this infirmity seized him, which was eight years or upward before our Saviour’s birth, and about the time when the temple was re-edified, or rather enlarged and further adorned, by Herod. As man, he pitieth his case; he asketh him if he was willing to be made whole. Not that he doubted of his willingness; for what sick man was ever unwilling to be healed? Besides that, he knew that the poor man lay there for that very purpose; but that he might make him declare his miserable, helpless state and condition, and draw out his faith and hope in himself; and from his answer take an occasion to heal him, and make the spectators more attentive to his miracle. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When Jesus saw him lie,....

The <span class="ital">self-evident</span> nature of this desire made the question an appropriate one to rouse the sufferer’s <span class="ital">attention</span> and <span class="ital">expectation</span>, and this was the object Jesus had in view in order to the commencement of His miraculous work. <span class="ital">This</span> question was inappropriate for the purpose (de Wette thinks) of merely <span class="ital">beginning a conversation upon the subject</span>. Paulus falsely supposes that the man might have been a dishonest beggar, <span class="ital">feigning</span> sickness, and that Jesus asks him with reproving emphasis, <span class="ital">“Wilt</span> thou be made whole? <span class="ital">art thou in earnest?”</span> So, too, Ammon; while Lange regards him as simply <span class="ital">languid in will</span>, and that Christ again roused his <span class="ital">dormant</span> will; but there is nothing of this in the text, and just as little of Luthardt’s notion, that the question was meant for all the people of whom the sick man is supposed to be the type. <span class="ital">This</span> miracle alone furnishes an example of an <span class="ital">unsolicited interrogation</span> upon Christ’s part (a feature which Weisse urges against it); but in the case of the man born blind, chap. 9, we have also an unsolicited <span class="ital">healing</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπον οὐκ ἔχω</span>] <span class="ital">ad morbum accedebat inopia</span>, Grotius; <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρ</span>. emphatically takes the lead; the <span class="greekheb">ἔρχομαι ἐγώ</span> follows answers to it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅταν ταραχθῇ τὸ ὕδωρ</span>] The occasional and intermittent disturbance of the water is not to be understood as a <span class="ital">regular</span> occurrence, but as something <span class="ital">sudden</span> and <span class="ital">quickly passing away</span>.

The apocryphal <a href="/john/5-4.htm" title="For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatever disease he had.">John 5:4</a> has perverted this circumstance, in conformity with a popular superstition, which probably reaches as far back as the time of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/5-6.htm" title="When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he said to him, Will you be made whole?">John 5:6</a>. Jesus when He saw the man lying and had ascertained (<span class="greekheb">γνοὺς</span>, having learned from the man or his friends) that already he had passed a long time (in that infirmity) says: <span class="greekheb">θέλεις ὑγιὴς γενέσθαι</span>; “Do you wish to become whole (healthy)?” This question was put to attract the man’s attention and awaken hope. But the man is hopeless: it is not a question of will, he says, but of opportunity. His very weakness enabled others to anticipate him; <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ ἔρχομαι ἐγὼ</span>, “while I am coming,” he could, then, move a little, but not quickly enough. At each bubbling up of the water, apparently only one could be healed. The <span class="greekheb">ἄλλος πρὸ ἐμοῦ καταβαίνει</span> was a great aggravation of his case.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">knew</span>] Or, <span class="bld">perceived</span>, perhaps supernaturally (see on <a href="/john/16-19.htm" title="Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me?">John 16:19</a>), but He might learn it from the bystanders: the fact was very likely notorious.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Wilt thou?</span>] Or, more strongly, <span class="bld">Dost thou will</span>? Note that the man does not ask first. Here and in the case of the man born blind (9), as also of Malchus’ ear (<a href="/luke/22-51.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, Suffer you thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.">Luke 22:51</a>), Christ heals without being asked to do so. Excepting the healing of the royal official’s son all Christ’s miracles in the Fourth Gospel are spontaneous. On no other occasion does Christ ask a question without being addressed first: why does He now ask a question of which the answer was so obvious? Probably in order to rouse the sick man out of his lethargy and despondency. It was the first step towards the man’s having sufficient faith: he must be inspired with some expectation of being cured. The question has nothing to do with religious scruples; ‘Art thou willing to be made whole, although it is the Sabbath?’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/5-6.htm" title="When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he said to him, Will you be made whole?">John 5:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κατακείμενον</span>, <span class="ital">lying</span>) He seems by this time to have habitually given up the attempt to get before others.—<span class="greekheb">γνούς</span>, <span class="ital">knowing</span>) though no one informed Him.—<span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>, <span class="ital">He saith</span>) of His own accord.

The leper came beseeching him, "Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean." The leper was quite sure of his own intense desire for cleansing, and all he questioned was the <span class="accented">will</span>, not the <span class="accented">power</span>, of Jesus. The admission of the power was a tacit cry for healing. The questioning of Jesus on this occasion involved an offer of mercy. "<span class="accented">Dost thou veritably wish</span> for health and strength?" The question implies a doubt. The man may have got so accustomed to his life of indolence and mendicancy as to regard deliverance from his apparent wretchedness, with all consequent responsibilities of work and energy and self-dependence, as a doubtful blessing. He whined out, with professional drawl, his oft-told story, reflecting very much upon his lovelessness and quarrelsomeness, and ugly temper. There are many who are not anxious for salvation, with all the demands it makes upon the life, with its summons to self-sacrifice and the repression of self-indulgence. There are many religious impostors who prefer tearing open their spiritual wounds to the first passerby, and hugging their grievance, to being made into robust men upon whom the burden of responsibility will immediately fall. In this case the sign of his palsied nature was written upon his face, and was probably known to every passerby. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Had been now a long time (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Literally, he hath already much time.<p>Wilt thou (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Not merely, do you wish, but are you in earnest?
