It was kept on the 14th of Adar (March), in commemoration of the deliverance of the Jews from the plots of Haman, and took its name from the lots cast by him (<a href="/esther/3-7.htm" title="In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.">Esther 3:7</a>; <a href="/esther/9-24.htm" title="Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;">Esther 9:24</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It was one of the most popular feasts (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xi. 6, § 13), and was characterised by festive rejoicings, presents, and gifts to the poor.

An angel went down, and troubled the water; and what disease soever it was, this water cured it, but only he that first stepped in had benefit. This teaches us to be careful, that we let not a season slip which may never return. The man had lost the use of his limbs thirty-eight years. Shall we, who perhaps for many years have scarcely known what it has been to be a day sick, complain of one wearisome night, when many others, better than we, have scarcely known what it has been to be a day well? Christ singled this one out from the rest. Those long in affliction, may comfort themselves that God keeps account how long. Observe, this man speaks of the unkindness of those about him, without any peevish reflections. As we should be thankful, so we should be patient. Our Lord Jesus cures him, though he neither asked nor thought of it. Arise, and walk. God's command, Turn and live; Make ye a new heart; no more supposes power in us without the grace of God, his distinguishing grace, than this command supposed such power in the impotent man: it was by the power of Christ, and he must have all the glory. What a joyful surprise to the poor cripple, to find himself of a sudden so easy, so strong, so able to help himself! The proof of spiritual cure, is our rising and walking. Has Christ healed our spiritual diseases, let us go wherever he sends us, and take up whatever he lays upon us; and walk before him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A feast - Probably the Passover, though it is not certain.

No question has more divided the Harmonists of the Gospels, and the duration of our Lord's ministry may be said to hinge on it. For if, as the majority have thought (until of late years) it was a Passover, His ministry lasted three and a half years; if not, probably a year less. Those who are dissatisfied with the Passover-view all differ among themselves what other feast it was, and some of the most acute think there are no grounds for deciding.

We read of the first, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/2-13.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 2:13</a></span>; and from that verse of that chapter to this chapter the evangelist (as they think) hath been relating so much of our Saviour’s actions, until the second passover, as it was the will of God we should have upon public authentic record, and had not been recorded by the other evangelists, who give a further account of his actions done this year, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/4-1.htm" title="Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil....">Matthew 4:1-25</a> 8:1-34 9:1-38 <a href="/context/mark/1-1.htm" title="The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;...">Mark 1:1-45</a> 2:1-28 <a href="/context/luke/4-1.htm" title="And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,...">Luke 4:1-44</a> 5:1-39</span>. In the time of our Saviour’s public ministry (which was three years and a half) there were four passovers. The other evangelists take notice but of one of them, and that the last. John is thought to have mentioned all the four; the first, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/2-13.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 2:13</a></span>, the second in this place, the third, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a></span>, the fourth, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/8-1.htm" title="Jesus went to the mount of Olives.">John 8:1</a></span>. Another reason they give why the feast of the passover should be here intended is, because from about that time to the harvest were four months, according to what our Saviour had said, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jesus went up</span> to the passover, to <span class="bld">Jerusalem, </span> to show his obedience to his Father’s law, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm" title="Three times in a year shall all your males appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:">Deu 16:16</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>After this there was a feast of the Jews,....

So Keppler, d’Outrein, Hug, Olshausen, Wieseler, Krabbe, Anger, Lange, Maier, Baeumlein, Godet, and most others. So also Holtzmann (Judenth. u. Christenth. p. 374) and Märcker (<span class="ital">Uebereinst. d. Matth. u. Joh</span>. 1868, p. 11). In favour of this interpretation is the fact that, as this feast was by no means a great one, but of less importance and less known to Hellenistic readers, the indefinite mention of it on John’s part is thoroughly appropriate; while he <span class="ital">names</span> the greater and well-known feasts,—not only the Passover, but the <span class="greekheb">σκηνοπηγία</span> in <a href="/john/7-2.htm" title="Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.">John 7:2</a>, and the <span class="greekheb">ἐγκαίνια</span> in <a href="/john/10-22.htm" title="And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.">John 10:22</a>. To suppose, in explanation of the fact that he does not give the name, that he had forgotten what feast it was (Schweizer), is compatible neither with the accuracy of his recollection in other things, nor with the importance of the miracle wrought at this feast. It is arbitrary, however, to suppose that John did not wish to lay stress upon the <span class="ital">name</span> of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἙΟΡΤΉ</span></span></span>, but upon the fact that Jesus did not go up to Jerusalem <span class="ital">save on occasion of a feast</span> (Luthardt, Lichtenstein); indeed, the giving of the name <span class="ital">after</span> <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἸΟΥΔΑΊΩΝ</span></span></span> (comp. <a href="/john/7-2.htm" title="Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.">John 7:2</a>) would in no way have interfered with that imaginary design. It is objected that the feast of <span class="ital">Purim</span>, which was not a temple feast, required no journey to Jerusalem (see especially Hengstenberg, <span class="ital">Christol</span>. III. p. 187 f., Lücke, de Wette, Brückner); and the high esteem in which it is held in <span class="ital">Gem. Hier. Megill</span>. i. 8 cannot be shown to refer to the time of Jesus. But might not Jesus, even without any legal obligation, have availed Himself of this feast as an occasion for His further labours in Jerusalem? And are we to suppose that the character of the feast—a feast for eating and drinking merely—should <span class="ital">hinder Him from going</span> to Jerusalem? The <span class="ital">Sabbath</span> (<a href="/john/5-9.htm" title="And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.">John 5:9</a>), on which apparently (but see Wieseler, p. 219) the feast could never occur, may have been before or after it; and, lastly, what is related of Jesus (<a href="/john/6-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.">John 6:1</a> ff.) between this festival and the Passover, only a month afterwards, may easily have occurred within the space of that month. In fine, it can neither have been the <span class="ital">Passover</span> (Cod. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Λ</span></span></span>., Irenaeus, Eusebius’ <span class="ital">Chron</span>., Rupertus, Luther, Calovius, Grotius, Jansen, Scaliger, Cornelius a Lapide, Lightfoot, Lampe, Paulus, Kuinoel, Süsskind, Klee, Neander, Ammon, Hengstenberg), nor <span class="ital">Pentecost</span> (Cyril, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Euthymius Zigabenus, Erasmus, Melancthon, Beza, Calvin, Maldonatus, Bengel), nor <span class="ital">the feast of Tabernacles</span> (Cod. 131, Cocceius, Ebrard, Ewald, Hilgenfeld, Lichtenstein, Krafft, Riggenbach), nor <span class="ital">the feast of the Dedication</span> (a possible surmise of Keppler and Petavius); nor can we acquiesce in leaving the feast <span class="ital">undeterminable</span> (Lücke, de Wette, Luthardt, Tholuck, Brückner. Baumgarten Crusius hesitates between Purim and the Passover, yet inclines rather to the latter).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[203] If <span class="ital">this feast itself</span> is taken to be the Passover, we are obliged, with the most glaring arbitrariness, to put a <span class="ital">spatium vacuum</span> of a year between it and the Passover of <a href="/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>, of which, however, John (<a href="/context/john/6-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias....">John 6:1-4</a>) has not given the slightest hint. On the contrary, he lets his narrative present the most uninterrupted sequence. Hengstenberg judges, indeed, that the gap can appear strange only to those who do not rightly discern the relation in which John stands to the Synoptics. But this is nothing more than the dictum of harmonistic presuppositions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/5-1.htm" title="After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 5:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">μετὰ ταῦτα</span>, “after this”; how long after does not concern the narrative.—<span class="greekheb">ἦν ἑορτὴ τῶν Ἰουδαίων</span>. See critical note. Even if the article were the true reading, this would not, as Lücke has shown, determine the feast to be the Passover. Rather it would be Tabernacles, see W.H[52] ii. 76. We are thrown upon general considerations and that these yield a very uncertain result is shown by the variety of opinion expressed by commentators. The feasts we have to choose from are: Purim in March, Passover in April, Pentecost in May, Tabernacles in October, Dedication in December. It is chiefly between Purim and Passover that opinion is divided, because some feast in spring is supposed to be indicated by <a href="/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a>. Against Passover it is urged that in chap. 6 another Passover is mentioned; but this is by no means decisive, as John elsewhere passes over equally long intervals of time. Lampe, Lightfoot, Grotius, Whitelaw, and Wordsworth argue for Passover: Tischendorf, Meyer, Godet, Farrar, Weiss, and others strongly favour Purim; while Lücke seems to prove that no sure conclusion can be reached.

If ‘<span class="ital">a</span> feast’ is the true reading, this alone is almost conclusive against its being the Passover; S. John would not call the Passover ‘a feast of the Jews.’ Moreover in all other cases where he mentions Passovers he lets us know that they are Passovers and not simply feasts, <a href="/john/2-13.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 2:13</a>, <a href="/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>, <a href="/john/11-55.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was near at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.">John 11:55</a>, &c. He gives us three Passovers; to make this a fourth would be to put an extra year into our Lord’s ministry for which scarcely any events can be found, and of which there is no trace elsewhere. Almost every other feast, and even the Day of Atonement, have been suggested; but the only one which fits in satisfactorily is Purim. We saw from <a href="/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a> that the two days in Samaria were either in December or January. The next certain date <a href="/isaiah/6-4.htm" title="And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.">Isaiah 6:4</a>, the eve of the Passover, i.e. April. Purim, which was celebrated in March (14th and 15th Adar), falls just in the right place in the interval. This feast commemorated the deliverance of the Jews from Haman, and took its name from the <span class="ital">lots</span> which he caused to be cast (<a href="/esther/3-7.htm" title="In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.">Esther 3:7</a>; <a href="/esther/9-24.htm" title="Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;">Esther 9:24</a>; <a href="/esther/9-26.htm" title="Why they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.

It was a boisterous feast, and some have thought it unlikely that Christ would have anything to do with it. But we are not told that He went to Jerusalem <span class="ital">in order to keep the feast</span>; Purim might be kept anywhere. More probably He went because the multitudes at the feast would afford great opportunities for teaching. Moreover, it does not follow that because some made this feast a scene of unseemly jollity, therefore Christ would discountenance the feast itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/5-1.htm" title="After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 5:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἑορτή</span>, <span class="ital">a feast</span>) The following authorities recognise this feast to be Pentecost: Epiphanius, Chrysostom, Cyril, Euthymius, Theophylact, the old Gospel harmony published by Ottomarus Luscinius, Lyranus, Stapulensis, Erasmus in his paraphrase, Maldonatus, Calvin, Piseator, Bullinger in his Acts, p. 4; comp.

"The feast" referred to in <a href="/john/4-45.htm">John 4:45</a> undoubtedly means the first Passover. "A feast" would leave the question open, though by no means excluding positively the second Passover, as the anarthrousness of the word might be chosen with a view to call special attention to it. However, the indefinite <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> has been identified by commentators with every feast in the calendar, so there can be no final settlement of the problem. If the feast be the Passover, then our Lord's ministry lasted a little more than three years. If not, it must be one or other of the feasts that elapsed between the Passovers of ch. 2 and ch. 6 Edersheim, with many others, refuses to accept any chronological hint in <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, and therefore throws the journey from Jerusalem to Galilee a few weeks after the first Passover, in the early summer, and supposes that Jesus returned to the unnamed feast in the autumn. Several critics say of <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, one part of the sentence must be parabolical and the other literal, and that the disciples might be anticipating a spiritual harvest after four months, and Jesus drew from the physically ripening corn fields his comparison. This seems to me entirely contrary to our Lord's ordinary method; and that the disciples were in too carnal a mood to be credited with an anticipation of spiritual results in Samaria at all. Those who think that <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a> does give a hint of four months preceding harvest, place the journey between the middle of December and the middle of January. To my mind there is consequently no difficulty in imagining that when those four months should have been spent, and before the regular calling and appointment of the twelve apostles, our Lord should have gone up to the feast - one of the feasts which did summon the adult men to the metropolis. This is the view of Irenaeus, Luther, Cretins, Lampe, Neander, Hengstenberg, Conder, and many others. Wieseler, Hug, Meyer Lance, Godet, Weiss, Farrar, Watkins, think that the Feast of Purim, celebrated on the 15th of Adar (or March) (2 Macc. 15:36), in commemoration of the deliverance of the people from the evil intention of Haman (<a href="/esther/9-21.htm">Esther 9:21</a>, etc.), was that national fast and feast which Jesus thus honoured. Purim was not one of the divinely appointed festivals, but it is also stated that the Lord undoubtedly attended one of the national and recently appointed festivals, that of Dedication (<a href="/john/10-22.htm">John 10:22</a>). The more serious objection is that it could, if desired, have been celebrated quite as well in Galilee as in Jerusalem, and that the method of celebration seemed contrary to the whole spirit of the Master, and the whole tone of the discourse which followed. It is said that part of the ritual of the feast was the free and frequent gifts made spontaneously by one to another. Westcott prefers the autumn Feast of Trumpets as more suitable on several grounds than the Passover, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because of the absence of the article, - this, however, is very problematical (see Tischendorf, 8th edit.); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because when at the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2</a>) the incident described in ch. 5 is still in lively recollection; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because the great events of the Feast of Trumpets, the commemoration of the Creation and the Law giving, correspond with the theme of the Lord's great discourse. The fact that this particular miracle on the sabbath should be referred to a few mouths later in Jerusalem, on Christ's third appearance there, is not improbable, if we bear in mind that Judaean emissaries in Galilee had been bitterly  assailing Jesus, on the ground of his persistent determination to heal sickness and hopeless maladies on the sabbath day. This Jerusalem "sign," and the claim he made on the ground of it, had roused the cry, and was still the matter of contention. The claims of the Purim feast turn principally on the fact that, since it occurred, about a month before the Passover, on the 14th or 15th of Adar, this visit might have taken place in the course of the four months referred to in <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, and therefore between the sojourn in Samaria and the Passover of <a href="/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>, which Jesus diet not attend. Dr. Moulton (assuming the anarthrous form of the <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>) thinks that the feast is left undetermined because there was nothing in it typical of our Lord's work, and fulfilled in his Person. Such a position renders the visit itself strange and apparently unealled for. These long gaps, silences, during which there is no record of event or discourse, constitute a leading feature of the gospel history, and indeed of most of the history of both Old and New Testaments. To my mind there is advantage rather than otherwise in supposing more time than a few months to have been consumed in the Galilaean ministry described in <a href="/mark/2.htm">Mark 2</a> and 3 Tregelles and the Revisers, with Westcott and Hort, have relegated the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> of <a href="/luke/6-1.htm">Luke 6:1</a> to the margin, but; Tischendorf (8th edit.) and Canon Cooke, etc., retain the remarkable expression, on the overwhelming evidence of a host of authorities. If it stand, which we believe it must, then during the Galilaean ministry, and in the interval which preceded the Passover mentioned in ch. 6:4, there is a reference to the proximity of a previous Passover and a previous harvest; the Galilaean opposition to Christ on this question of ritual being at its very height. If so, the feast must have been the Passover. The question cannot be finally settled, and commentators are in hopeless conflict with one another. It must be admitted that the majority of modern critics assume the Feast of Purim to be that intended, and thereby reduce the length of our Lord's ministry from Cana to Calvary to two short years. <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> This was before the formal call of the twelve apostles, and there is no proof that he was accompanied by his disciples. Many of the commentators (and see Weiss, 'Life of Christ,' vol. 2:321) urge that not even John himself was present on the occasion, from the absence of lifelike touches and particularity of incident. There is, however, much detail in the first fifteen verses. The great discourse that follows is not broken into dramatic dialogue, and does certainly present more of the biographer's subjective treatment than other portions of the narrative. It is more conceivable, however, that John did, on grounds mentioned by Caspari (see Introduction), accompany his Lord, and learned, by what he heard of these great words, and by subsequent converse with Jesus, the burden of the mighty revelation. Thoma sets to work in the most dogmatic way, and Weiss with a perfectly different spirit, to demonstrate the identity of the narrative which follows, with the famous story of the cure of the paralytic "borne of four" which occurs in the synoptic narrative. Thoma goes further, and imagines that the supposed healing of the paralytics by both Peter and Paul are also here idealized. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A feast (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;)<p>Or festival.
