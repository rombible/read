The Greek, indeed, distinguishes between the Incarnation at a definite point in time and the witness which was continued—<span class= "ital">And the Father Himself which sent Me</span> (not “hath sent Me”) <span class= "ital">hath borne witness of Me.</span><p>“His voice” and “His shape” are both general, and the “at any time” extends over the whole duration of previous revelation. Literally the clause is, <span class= "ital">Voice of Him ye have not at any time heard, nor shape of Him have ye seen.</span> The reference to the revelation of the Old Testament Scriptures is, moreover, demanded by the immediate context, while the voice at the Baptism and the Transfiguration are not only absent from the present circle of thoughts, but also from St. John’s Gospel. Jesus is answering a charge of breaking God’s law, and of making Himself equal with God because he has claimed God’s fatherhood in word for Himself, and has manifested it in life-power for man. That charge was but an example of their unreceptive spirit. Through the whole history of the nation. He had been revealing Himself to them. Through the chief knowledge-giving senses, eye and ear, they should have learnt in that past history to see God in the act of mercy, to hear Him in the word of love. They jealous for God’s honour! Ah! it was then as it had been ever. Voice of God they could not hear. Vision of God they could not see.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:30-38 Our Lord returns to his declaration of the entire agreement between the Father and the Son, and declared himself the Son of God. He had higher testimony than that of John; his works bore witness to all he had said. But the Divine word had no abiding-place in their hearts, as they refused to believe in Him whom the Father had sent, according to his ancient promises. The voice of God, accompanied by the power of the Holy Ghost, thus made effectual to the conversion of sinners, still proclaims that this is the beloved Son, in whom the Father is well pleased. But when the hearts of men are full of pride, ambition, and the love of the world, there is no room for the word of God to abide in them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Father himself ...hath borne witness of me - This God had done,<p>1. By the miracles which Jesus had performed, and of which he was conversing.<p>2. At the baptism of Jesus, where he said, "This is my beloved Son," <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>.<p>3. In the prophecies of the Old Testament. It is not easy to say here to which of these he refers. Perhaps he has reference to all.<p>Ye have neither heard his voice - This difficult passage has been interpreted in various ways. The main design of it seems to be clear - to reprove the Jews for not believing the evidence that he was the Messiah. In doing this he says that they were indisposed to listen to the testimony of God. He affirmed that God had given sufficient evidence of his divine mission, but they had disregarded it. The first thing that he notices is that they had not heard his voice. The word "hear," in this place, is to be understood in the sense of "obey" or listen to. See the notes at <a href="/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25</a>. The voice of God means his commands or his declarations, however made; and the Saviour said that it had been the "characteristic" of the Jews that they had not listened to the voice or command of God. As this had been their general characteristic, it was not wonderful that they disregarded now his testimony in regard to the Messiah. The voice of God had been literally heard on the mount. See <a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>; "Ye heard the voice of the words."<p>At any time - This has been the uniform characteristic of the nation that they have disregarded and perverted the testimony of God, and it was as true of that generation as of their fathers.<p>Nor seen his shape - No man hath seen God at any time, <a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>. But the word "shape," here, does not mean "God himself." It refers to the visible "manifestation" of himself; to the "appearance" which he assumed. It is applied in the Septuagint to his manifesting himself to Moses, <a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>; "With him will I speak mouth to mouth, 'even apparently;'" in Greek, "in a form" or "shape" the word used here. It is applied to the visible symbol of God that appeared in the cloud and that rested on the tabernacle, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-16</a>. It is the same word that is applied to the Holy Spirit appearing in bodily shape like a dove, <a href="/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>. Jesus does not here deny that God had "appeared" in this manner, but he says they had not seen - that is, had not "paid attention to," or "regarded," the appearance of God. He had manifested himself, but they disregarded it, and, in particular, they had disregarded his manifestations in attestation of the Messiah. As the word "hear" means to obey, to listen to, so the word "see" means "to pay attention to, to regard" <a href="/2_john/1-8.htm">2 John 1:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6</a>, and thus throws light on <a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>; "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father."

The subject, which is placed at the beginning of the sentence, the independence (immediateness) expressed by <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span>, together with the Perfect <span class="greekheb">μεμαρτ</span>., unite to prove that there is no longer any reference here to the previous testimony, that of the <span class="ital">works</span>, by which God had borne testimony (against Augustine, Grotius, Maldonatus, Olshausen, Baur, and most others). Quite arbitrary, and in opposition to the account of the baptism <span class="ital">given by John</span>, is the view which <span class="ital">others</span> take, that the divine witness given in <span class="ital">the voice at the baptism</span>, <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a> (but see rather <a href="/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>), is here meant (Chrysostom, Rupertius, Jansen, Bengel, Lampe, Paulus, Godet). While Ewald (<span class="ital">Johann. Schr</span>. I. 216) includes together both the baptism <span class="ital">and</span> the works, Hengstenberg adds to these two the witness of <span class="ital">Scripture</span> likewise; others, again, “<span class="ital">the immediate divine witness in the believer’s heart</span>, by means of which the indirect testimony of the works is first apprehended” (De Wette, B.

But there is not the slightest indication in the text that an outward, perceptible, concrete, and objective witness is meant; nay more, in the face of the following connection (<span class="greekheb">φωνήν</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἶδος</span>). The only true interpretation in harmony with the context is that which takes it to mean <span class="ital">the</span> witness which God Himself has given in His <span class="ital">word, in the Scriptures of the O. T</span>. (Cyril, Nonnus, Theophylact, Euthymius Zigabenus, Beda, Calvin, Kuinoel, Lücke, Lange, Maier, Luthardt). In the O. T. prophecies, God Himself has lifted up His voice and revealed His form.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὔτε φωνήν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Reproach of <span class="ital">want of susceptibility</span> for this testimony, all the <span class="ital">more emphatic</span> through the absence of any antithetic particle. <span class="ital">Neither a voice of His have ye ever heard, nor a form of His have ye ever seen</span>. With respect to what God had <span class="ital">spoken</span> in the O. T. as a testimony to Christ (<span class="greekheb">μεμαρτύρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">περὶ ἐμοῦ</span>), or as to the manner in which, with a like purpose, He had therein given His <span class="ital">self-manifestation</span> to the spiritual contemplation (He had made known his <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>; comp. <span class="greekheb">μορφὴ θεοῦ</span>, <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Php 2:6</a>),—to the one ye were spiritually <span class="ital">deaf</span>, to the other ye were spiritually <span class="ital">blind</span>. As the first cannot, conformably with the context, be taken to mean the revealing voice of God within, vouchsafed to the prophets (De Wette), so neither can the second refer merely to the <span class="ital">Theophanies</span> (in particular, to the appearances of the <span class="ital">Angel</span> of the Lord, Hengstenberg) and prophetic <span class="ital">visions,</span>[221] but to the entire <span class="ital">self-revelation of God in the O. T. generally</span>, by virtue of which He lets Himself be seen by him who has eyes to see;—a general and broad interpretation, which corresponds with the general nature of the expression, and with its logical relation to <span class="greekheb">μεμαρτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐμοῦ</span>. The Jews <span class="ital">could</span> not have heard the <span class="ital">voice at the baptism</span>, nor <span class="ital">could</span> they have seen the form of God as the Logos had seen it, <a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>, <a href="/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>; and for this reason neither the one meaning nor the other can be found in the words (Ewald). Every interpretation, moreover, is incorrect which finds in them anything but a reproach, because Jesus speaks in the second person, and continues to do so in <a href="/john/5-38.htm" title="And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.">John 5:38</a>, where the tone of censure is still obvious. We must therefore reject the explanation of B. Crusius: “never hitherto has this immediate revelation of God taken place;” and that of Tholuck: “ye have not received a more direct revelation than did Moses and his cotemporaries (<a href="/numbers/12-8.htm" title="With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?">Numbers 12:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-15.htm" title="Take you therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire:">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-24.htm" title="And you said, Behold, the LORD our God has showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the middle of the fire: we have seen this day that God does talk with man, and he lives.">Deuteronomy 5:24</a>), but ye have not received within you the witness of the revelation in the word,”—an artificial connecting of <a href="/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me.

Paulus and Kuinoel (comp. Euthymius Zigabenus) likewise erroneously say that “Jesus here <span class="ital">concedes</span>, in some degree, to the Jews what they had themselves wished to urge <span class="ital">in objection</span>, viz. that they had heard no divine voice, etc. Comp. Ebrard (in Olshausen), who imports the idea of irony into the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[221] Jesus could not reproach His opponents with not having received prophetic revelations, such as Theophanies and Visions, for these were marks of distinction bestowed only on individuals. This also against Weiss, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr</span>. pp. 104, 105.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37</a>. But over and above the evidence of the works <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ πέμψας με πατήρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς μεμαρτύρηκε</span>, “And the Father who sent me has Himself also testified”. Where and how this testimony of the Father’s separate from the works has been given, is explained, <a href="/john/5-38.htm" title="And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.">John 5:38</a>; <a href="/john/5-40.htm" title="And you will not come to me, that you might have life.">John 5:40</a> But, first, Jesus states how it has no been given: <span class="greekheb">οὔτε φωνὴν αὐτοῦ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἑωράκατε</span>. It is not by coming into your midst in a visible form and speaking as I speak that the Father has testified. “His voice you have never heard: His form you have never seen.” It is not by sensible sights and sounds the Father has given His testimony. [This interpretation is however ignored by most: by Meyer, who thinks the reference is to their insensibility to the revelation of God in Scripture; by Westcott, who says “the Jews by their disbelief of Christ failed to hear and see Him”; by Godet, who finds “a declaration of man’s natural impotence to rise to the immediate and personal knowledge of God”. Reference to the baptism is put out of the question by <span class="greekheb">πώποτε</span>. The reference to the two chief forms of prophetic revelation (Weiss) is too remote.]<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">37–40</span>. The connexion of thought in the next few verses is very difficult to catch, and cannot be affirmed with certainty. This is often the case in S. John’s writings. A number of simple sentences follow one another with an even flow; but it is by no means easy to see how each leads on to the next. Here there is a transition from the <span class="ital">indirect</span> testimony to the Messiahship of Jesus given by the <span class="ital">works</span> which He is commissioned to do (<span class="ital"><a href="/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36</a></span>), to the <span class="ital">direct</span> testimony to the same given by the <span class="ital">words</span> of Scripture (<a href="/context/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape....">John 5:37-40</a>). The Jews were rejecting both.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which hath sent me, hath borne witness</span>] There is a difference of tense in the Greek which should be retained: <span class="ital">the Father</span> <span class="bld">which sent</span> <span class="ital">Me</span> (once for all at the Incarnation) <span class="bld">He</span> <span class="ital">hath borne witness</span> (for a long time past, and is still doing so) <span class="ital">of Me</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ye have neither</span>, &c.] These words are a <span class="ital">reproach</span>; therefore there can be no allusion (as suggested in the margin) to the Baptism or the Transfiguration. The Transfiguration had not yet taken place, and very few if any of Christ’s hearers could have heard the voice from heaven at the Baptism. Moreover, if that particular utterance were meant, ‘voice’ in the Greek would have had the article. Nor can there be any reference to the theophanies, or symbolical visions of God, in O.T. It could be no matter of <span class="ital">reproach</span> to these Jews that they had never beheld a theophany. A paraphrase will shew the meaning; ‘neither with the ear of the heart have ye ever heard Him, nor with the eye of the heart have ye ever seen Him, in the revelation of Himself given in the Scriptures; and so ye have not the testimony of His word present as an abiding power within you.’ There should be no full stop at ‘shape,’ only a comma or semi-colon.

If the "himself" be the genuine reading (and it is defended by Godet, M'Clellan, and Meyer), there would seem to be a special or direct and additional form of the Father's testimony. And several ancient and modern critics (Chrysostom, Bengel, Paulus, Godet) have seen in it a reference to the special "voice and shape" which were heard and teen by John and Jesus at the baptism, when heaven was opened, when a voice from heaven proclaimed him to be the well beloved and only begotten Son of God, and when the Spirit of God descended as a dove and abode upon him. This testimony was only given to the world through the consciousness and word of John, who, after receiving it, bore record that this was the Son of God. Meyer and many others, rather following the suggestion of De Wette that the inward drawing of the Father to the Son was that to which the Lord referred, would thus complete the testimony of the "works." This testimony, then, which is cited against the challenge, "Thou bearest witness concerning thyself," would be a purely subjective one. Westcott thinks it refers to the whole of the Old Testament ministry and prophetic and typical anticipation of the Christ, culminating in John the Baptist. This particular series of testimonies is referred to in vers. 39 and 47, etc. Moulton, who rejects the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> sees no new, no direct, testimony in addition to that of the works, but the assertion that they are the voice of the Father - in a sense the very form of the Father, for the conviction of those who might if they would come to him. If the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> must be retained, I think that we must suppose our Lord referring to the whole of those objective manifestations of the Father's will and mind concerning Christ which were outside of his own act or work; and all that shining through his face, that whispering through his word of what was the eternal Father's face and voice, and plainly distinguished from the work of the Son; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the angels' song, the miraculous providence which protected his childhood, the opening of heaven at his baptism, the Divinity which attended him and which made his ministry so strange and strong an influence. Nor could he who had the whole of his life before him fail to be conscious of further testimonies from heaven and from Providence which, though unrecorded, would continue to set their seal upon his character and work. We must never forget that our Lord himself was a revelation of <span class="accented">the Son.</span> But the revelation of the Son in his <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span> was accompanied throughout with another manifestation - that <span class="accented">of the Father.</span> The glory of the Lord shone round about him. Nevertheless, a difficulty is conceded as arising out of the unsusceptibility and limited opportunities of his hearers. <span class="cmt_word">Never have ye heard a voice of him, or seen a form of him.</span> These voices and these sounds need opened ears and unsealed eyes. You (says Christ) have not heard that which you might have heard. You have not seen that which you might have seen. On a subsequent occasion he said to one of his disciples, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. How sayest thou, then, Show us the Father?" So that there was, indeed, the condition of adequate revelation of the Father provided for the disciples in the life of Christ, in the ministry of the Son of the Father. Moreover, it far exceeded the vision of God which was granted to patriarchs and prophets under the Old Testament dispensation. Doubtless the voice of Jehovah had been heard (<a href="/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>), the face of Jehovah had been seen (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>; <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-4.htm">Deuteronomy 5:4, 24</a>). Isaiah saw the glory of the Angel of the Lord (6; cf. <a href="/john/12-41.htm">John 12:41</a>), and Ezekiel likewise by the river of Chebar (Ezekiel 3:23). Nevertheless, the evangelist, on the credit of the great utterance before us, has laid down, as the very climax of the prologue, "No man hath seen God at any time (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared  him." This language of the <span class="accented">prologue</span> shows that the true revelation of the Father's heart was not even granted to the noblest of the seers and patriarchs. Such manifestations as the visions of the Old Testament saints were not the veritable voice or form of the Father. Should mankind ever obtain vision or audition of the Father, it must be through the presence among them of him who had been forever in the bosom of the Father. Though these captious critics were in a position to have received this revelation of the Highest, they had not done so. "<span class="accented">Ye have neither heard a voice of him, nor seen a form of him.</span> You might have seen and heard and handled if you had chosen, but You will not come to me, you will not believe me, you will not yield to my claims as One sent to you from the Father!" <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Himself (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>The best texts substitute &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, he; reading, "the Father which sent me, He hath born witness."
