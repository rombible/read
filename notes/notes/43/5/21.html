But all things now, and at the final judgment, are committed to the Son, purposely that all men might honour the Son, as they honour the Father; and every one who does not thus honour the Son, whatever he may think or pretend, does not honour the Father who sent him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the Father raiseth up the dead - God has power to raise the dead. By his power it had been done in at least two instances - by the prophet Elijah, in the case of the son of the widow of Sarepta <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a>, and by the prophet Elisha, in the case of the Shunamite's son, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-32.htm">2 Kings 4:32-35</a>. The Jews did not doubt that God had power to raise the dead. Jesus here expressly affirms it, and says he has the same power.<p>Quickeneth them - Gives them "life." This is the sense of the word "quickeneth" throughout the Bible.<p>Even so - In the same manner. By the same authority and power. The power of raising the dead must be one of the highest attributes of the divinity. As Jesus affirms that he has the power to do this "in the same manner" as the Father, so it follows that he must be equal with God.<p>The Son quickeneth - Gives life to. This may either refer to his raising the dead from their graves, or to his giving spiritual life to those who are dead in trespasses and sins. The former he did in the case of Lazarus and the widow's son at Nain, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14-15</a>. The latter he did in the case of all those who were converted by his power, and still does it in any instance of conversion.<p>Whom he will - It was in the power of Jesus to raise up any of the dead as well as Lazarus. It depended on his will whether Lazarus and the widow's son should come to life. So it depends on his will whether sinners shall live. He has power to renew them, and the renewing of the heart is as much the result of his "will" as the raising of the dead. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21-23. raiseth the dead and quickeneth them&#8212;one act in two stages.

This statement is of immense importance in relation to the miracles of Christ, distinguishing them from similar miracles of prophets and apostles, who as human instruments were employed to perform super-natural actions, while Christ did all as the Father's commissioned Servant indeed, but in the exercise of His own absolute right of action.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He seemeth not to speak of what God will do in the general resurrection, but of those whom the Lord raised up from the dead in the Old Testament, by Elijah and Elisha.

Which may be understood either spiritually of raising dead sinners from the death of sin, to a life of grace and holiness; and the rather, because it is expressed in the present tense "raiseth", and not "hath raised"; or naturally of raising those that are dead in a corporeal sense, and quickening them, as the widow of Sarepta's son by Elijah, and the Shunamite's son by Elisha: <p>even so the Son quickeneth whom he will; both in a spiritual sense, being the resurrection and the life, or the author of the resurrection from a moral death to a spiritual life, whose voice, in the Gospel, the dead in sin hear, and live; and in a natural sense, as in the above instances of Jairus's daughter, the widow of Naim's son, and Lazarus; and in the general resurrection, when at his voice, and word of power, all that are in their graves shall come forth, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting damnation; and all this as he wills: he quickens, in a spiritual sense, whom he pleases, even as many as the Father has given him; and he will raise up to everlasting life, at the last day, whom he pleases, even as many as were made his care and charge, whom he has redeemed by his blood; and called by his grace. Now as the quickening of the dead is an act of almighty power, and this being exercised by the Son in a sovereign way, as is by his Father, it shows his proper deity, and full equality with the Father. The resurrection of the dead is here expressed by "quickening", as it frequently is by the Jews, who often speak of , "the quickening the dead", for the resurrection; so the Targumist on <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>, "in the quickening of the dead",  "I will quicken thee"; see the Jerusalem Targum on  <a href="/genesis/29-26.htm">Genesis 29:26</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth <i>them</i>; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</span><p>(4) The Father makes no man partaker of everlasting life except in Christ, in whom alone also he is truly worshipped.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21</a>.

This is one of the “greater works” which the Father shows to the Son. The Jews believed in the power of God to give life and to raise the dead; see <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm" title="See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-6.htm" title="The LORD kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up.">1 Samuel 2:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm" title="Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.">Isaiah 26:19</a>. In our Lord’s time there was in use the following prayer: “Thou, O Lord, art mighty for ever; Thou quickenest the dead; Thou art strong to save; Thou sustainest the living by Thy mercy; Thou quickenest the dead by Thy great compassion; Thou makest good Thy faithfulness to them that sleep in the dust; Thou art faithful to quicken the dead. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who quickenest the dead.” There is therefore no need to ask, what quickening of the dead is here meant? What was meant was that the power which they all believed to be in God was likewise in the Son. He quickens <span class="greekheb">οὓς θέλει</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, no matter how dead the person is; even though he has lain as long useless as the impotent man. The question of the human will is not touched here, but it may be remarked that the will of the impotent man was consulted as the prime requisite of the cure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">raiseth up the dead</span>] This is one of the ‘greater works’ which the Father sheweth the Son, and which the Son imitates, the raising up those who are spiritually dead.

The ‘whom He will’ would be almost unintelligible if actual resurrection from the grave were intended.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">21–27</span>. The Father imparts to the Son the power of raising the spiritually dead. It is very important to notice that ‘raising the dead’ in this section is <span class="ital">figurative</span>; raising from moral and spiritual death: whereas the resurrection (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/john/5-28.htm" title="Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,...">John 5:28-29</a></span>) is <span class="ital">literal</span>; the rising of dead bodies from the graves.

This thing the Son sees, and this same thing he will do, whether these Jews attempt to put any arrest upon his will or not. The majority of commentators regard vers. 21-27 as descriptive of the moral and spiritual resurrection of dead souls, and hold that a transition is made in vers. 28, 29 to the resurrection of dead bodies and the final consummation. There are some, however, who regard the whole passage - even vers. 28, 29 - as referring, with the previous verses, to <span class="accented">moral</span> resurrection, although the words, "in their tombs" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) are there added to give distinctness and explicitness to that future resurrection; and though "now is" of ver. 25 is not there predicated or repeated. Others (with many of the older expositors) refer the entire passage to the <span class="accented">final</span> resurrection, which, however, is incompatible with ver. 20 and with the "now <span class="accented">is"</span> of ver. 25. Others, again, see in ver. 21, in <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>,, the whole process of resurrection and renewal, both physical and moral, bodily and spiritual. They suppose that in ver. 25 Christ refers first to the spiritual renovation, to be affirmed and consummated in the universal resurrection and judgment of the last day. The generality of the terms <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, attributed to the Father, makes it possible that the Lord was referring to the numerous events of uplifting from the pit, from the lowest <span class="accented">sheol</span>, which formed the staple religious nutrition of the Jewish race. The history of Divine revelation is one lengthened series of interpositions and deliverances, of resurrections of the people of Israel, and of the theocracy from bondage, exile, and spiritual and civil death, and of references to the wonderful transformations of saints and prophets and kings from the depths of despair to the light of life and Divine favour. Ezekiel (37) had likened the most memorable of these resurrections to the uprising of a huge army from a valley of vision, strown with the dry bones of both houses of Israel. "So also," says Jesus, "the Son quiekeneth." including  under this term, it may be, the physical healing which is often the precursor and condition of spiritual awakening and moral health and vigour. The Son, the incarnate Logos, revealing himself on earth, both as Logos and Son of man, <span class="accented">is now quickening after the same fashion whom he will.</span> The will of Christ is in such entire harmony with the Father's will that there is no rivalry here. The will of the Son is in spontaneous accord with the Divine purpose of resurrection and quickening. He is already doing thus here on earth, as the great organ of the Father, that which makes his will the revelation of the Father. There is no arbitrary decree, such as Calvin found here, nor such as Roues insists upon. The emphasis is simply upon the subject of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; and we have in the expression a vindication of the nineteenth verse, "The Son doeth that which he sees the Father doing." His own <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> being the origin and revealed centre on earth of Divine manifestations. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Raiseth - quickeneth<p>Physically and spiritually.<p>The Son quickeneth<p>Not raiseth and quickeneth.
