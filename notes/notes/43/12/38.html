These things therefore the soldiers did.">John 19:24</a>; <a href="/john/19-36.htm" title="For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.">John 19:36</a>. Its frequency is one of the characteristics of the two Gospels which are most allied to Hebrew modes of thought. St. Matthew and St. John both regard the events of our Lord’s life as fulfilling the prophecies of the Old Testament Scriptures. These prophecies foretold what in the divine plan was destined to occur, and therefore the events are regarded as occurring, in order that the will of God, as expressed in the prophecy, may be fulfilled. (Comp. Note on <a href="/matthew/1-22.htm" title="Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,">Matthew 1:22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Lord, who hath believed our report? . . .</span>—The quotation is from the Greek version of <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm" title="Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?">Isaiah 53:1</a>. That prophecy was by all understood of the Messiah. The prophet’s lamentation of the neglect of the prophetic message by the people is here placed by the Evangelist, in his interpretation of it, in the lips of the Messiah Himself, as He, in the fuller meaning, addresses the Father with the words, “Who hath believed our report?” (Comp. the words as quoted by St. Paul in <a href="/romans/10-16.htm" title="But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias said, Lord, who has believed our report?">Romans 10:16</a>.) Here the “our report” means the “truth which we have declared unto them.” (So <a href="/jeremiah/10-22.htm" title="Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.">Jeremiah 10:22</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-2.htm" title="This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span>—Comp.

The phrase was used, as in <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm" title="Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Are you not it that has cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?">Isaiah 51:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm" title="The LORD has made bore his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.">Isaiah 52:10</a>, to express the power of the Lord, and here refers especially to the power of the Lord manifested in the whole life of Christ. The signs which were revelations of this power are, of course, prominent in the thought, and the question strongly expresses the negative of the previous verse.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:37-43 Observe the method of conversion implied here. Sinners are brought to see the reality of Divine things, and to have some knowledge of them. To be converted, and truly turned from sin to Christ, as their Happiness and Portion. God will heal them, will justify and sanctify them; will pardon their sins, which are as bleeding wounds, and mortify their corruptions, which are as lurking diseases. See the power of the world in smothering convictions, from regard to the applause or censure of men. Love of the praise of men, as a by-end in that which is good, will make a man a hypocrite when religion is in fashion, and credit is to be got by it; and love of the praise of men, as a base principle in that which is evil, will make a man an apostate, when religion is in disgrace, and credit is to be lost for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The saying - The word of Isaiah, or that which Isaiah predicted. This occurs in <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>.<p>Might be fulfilled - That the same effect should occur which occurred in the time of Isaiah. This does not mean that the Pharisees rejected Christ in order that the prophecy of Isaiah should be fulfilled, but that by their rejection of him the same thing had occurred which took place in the time of Isaiah. His message was despised by the nation, and he himself put to death. And it was also true - by the same causes, by the same nation that the same gospel message was rejected by the Jews in the time of Christ. The same language of the prophet would express both events, and no doubt it was intended by the Holy Spirit to mark both events. In this way it was completely fulfilled. See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>.<p>Our report - Literally, by report is meant "what is heard." Our speech, our message. That is, few or none have received the message. The form of the question is an emphatic way of saying that it was rejected.<p>The arm of the Lord - The arm is a symbol of power, as it is the instrument by which we execute our purposes. It is put for the power of God, <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>. Thus, he is said to have brought out the children of Israel from Egypt with a high arm that is, with great power. It hence means God's power in defending his people, in overcoming his enemies, and in saving the soul. In this place it clearly denotes the power displayed by the miracles of Christ.<p>Revealed - Made known, seen, understood. Though the power of God was displayed, yet the people did not see and understand it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38.

Prophets are always wondering at the condition of mankind. Even Jesus marveled at the unbelief of his hearers. The <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of Isaiah shows that prophets foresaw the issue of the kind of reception that a people who had been so faithless to Jehovah's lesser manifestations would give to the most amazing of all his self-disclosures. The <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span> must not be explained away, the outline was presented by Isaiah of the reception which the favored but prejudiced and hardened house of Israel gave to Divine revelations. It would be filled in by the events which were then about to be enacted. God's intuition of actual facts, his unconditional foreknowledge of all contingent phenomena, do not necessitate their occurrence so as to deprive sinners of their guilt; yet when they have occurred, the causes which produced the widespread unbelief in the days of Isaiah were seen to be still at work, and to account for the strange incomprehensible mystery that blindness in part had happened to Israel. God works by law, and works freely by men and in them, not only foreseeing the evil and blindness, but positively punishing sin by blindness, taking away from a man that which he seemeth to have. By this means the "altar was built, the wood and the knife" for the great sacrifice. The use made of various portions of this oracle, by the Lord, by evangelists, by the apostles, by the deacon Philip, by Paul and Peter, shows that the early Church regarded it as the detailed description of the character suffering, and work of Christ. It became virtually a portion of the New Testament, and it was practically treated as such by Barnabas (100. 5, 'Ep. to Diog.,' 100. 49) and Justin Martyr (1 'Apol.,' 100. 50). The fifty-third of Isaiah may have been imperfectly understood by its author, may in his mind have had this, that, or the other original reference, and have suffered various Judaic interpretations. Modern criticism may scoff at it as a Messianic prophecy. All this does not touch the patent fact that nearly all the writers of the New Testament and numerous classes in the early Church used it as descriptive of their idea of Christ's work. It thus becomes of priceless value. </body></html>
