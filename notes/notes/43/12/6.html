We have to think of Judas as treasurer of the common fund which supplied the wants of the little band, and from which gifts to the poor were made. The word rendered “bag” here, the only passage where it occurs in the New Testament, and “chest,” in <a href="/context/2_chronicles/24-8.htm" title="And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 24:8-11</a>, means literally the “key-chest,” in which musicians carried their flute-keys.

The form of the word expresses continuance of the act, and may refer to the recurring opportunities of fraud as distinct from the mere fact of carrying the chest with a known sum in it. But we may certainly render the word “bare away,” for St. John himself uses it in this sense in <a href="/john/20-15.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you?

But she did not leave off serving, as some, who when found fault with for going too far in one way, peevishly run too far another way; she still served, but within hearing of Christ's gracious words. Mary gave a token of love to Christ, who had given real tokens of his love to her and her family. God's Anointed should be our Anointed. Has God poured on him the oil of gladness above his fellows, let us pour on him the ointment of our best affections. In Judas a foul sin is gilded over with a plausible pretence. We must not think that those do no acceptable service, who do it not in our way. The reigning love of money is heart-theft. The grace of Christ puts kind comments on pious words and actions, makes the best of what is amiss, and the most of what is good. Opportunities are to be improved; and those first and most vigorously, which are likely to be the shortest. To consult to hinder the further effect of the miracle, by putting Lazarus to death, is such wickedness, malice, and folly, as cannot be explained, except by the desperate enmity of the human heart against God. They resolved that the man should die whom the Lord had raised to life. The success of the gospel often makes wicked men so angry, that they speak and act as if they hoped to obtain a victory over the Almighty himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Had the bag - The word translated "bag" is compounded of two words, meaning "tongue," and "to keep or preserve." It was used to denote the bag in which musicians used to keep the tongues or reeds of their pipes when traveling. Hence, it came to mean any bag or purse in which travelers put their money or their most precious articles. The disciples appear to have had such a bag or purse in common, in which they put whatever money they had, and which was designed especially for the poor, <a href="/luke/8-3.htm">Luke 8:3</a>; <a href="/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a>; <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44</a>. The keeping of this, it seems, was intrusted to Judas; and it is remarkable that the only one among them who appears to have been naturally avaricious should have received this appointment. It shows us that every man is tried according to his native propensity. This is the object of trial - to bring out man's native character; and every man will find opportunity to do evil according to his native disposition, if he is inclined, to it.<p>And bare ... - The word translated "bare" means literally "to carry as a burden." Then it means "to carry away," as in <a href="/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a>; "If thou hast borne him hence." Hence, it means to carry away as a thief does, and this is evidently its meaning here. It has this sense often in classic writers. Judas was a thief and stole what was put into the bag. The money he desired to be entrusted to him, that he might secretly enrich himself. It is clear, however, that the disciples did not at this time know that this was his character, or they would have remonstrated against him. They learned it afterward. We may learn here:<p>1. that it is not a new thing for members of the church to be covetous. Judas was so before them.<p>2. that such members will be those who complain of the great waste in spreading the gospel.<p>3. that this deadly, mean, and grovelling passion will work all evil in a church. It brought down the curse of God on the children of Israel in the case of Achan <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, and it betrayed our Lord to death. It has often since brought blighting on the church; and many a time it has betrayed the cause of Christ, and drowned men in destruction and perdition, <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. had the bag&#8212;the purse.<p>bare what was put therein&#8212;not, bare it off by theft, though that he did; but simply, had charge of its contents, was treasurer to Jesus and the Twelve. How worthy of notice is this arrangement, by which an avaricious and dishonest person was not only taken into the number of the Twelve, but entrusted with the custody of their little property! The purposes which this served are obvious enough; but it is further noticeable, that the remotest hint was never given to the eleven of His true character, nor did the disciples most favored with the intimacy of Jesus ever suspect him, till a few minutes before he voluntarily separated himself from their company&#8212;for ever!<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This he said, not that he cared for the poor,....

But the next clauses, being in the imperfect, imply that his pilfering was habitual.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ γλωσσόκομον</span>, “the bag,” better “the purse,” or “box,” “loculos habens,” Vulgate. In the form <span class="greekheb">γλωσσοκομεῖον</span> (which Phrynichus declares to be the proper form, see Rutherford, p. 181) the word occurs in the <span class="ital">Bacchae</span> of Lysippus to denote a case for holding the tongue pieces of musical instruments (<span class="greekheb">γλῶσσαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κομέω</span>). Hence it came to be used of any box, chest, or coffer. In Sept[79] it occurs in <a href="/2_samuel/6-11.htm" title="And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.">2 Samuel 6:11</a> (Codd. A, 247, and Aquila) of the Art of the Lord; in <a href="/2_chronicles/24-8.htm" title="And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.">2 Chronicles 24:8</a> of the chest for collections in the Temple. This chest had a hole in the lid, and the people cast in (<span class="greekheb">ἐνέβαλον</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">τὰ βαλλόμενα</span> here) their contributions. (Further see Hatch, <span class="ital">Essays in Biblical Greek</span>, p. 42, and Field’s <span class="ital">Otium Norvic.</span>, 68.)—<span class="greekheb">τὰ βαλλόμενα ἐβάσταζεν</span>. The R.V[80] renders “took away what was put therein”. Certainly, to say that Judas had the money box and carried what was put therein is flat and tautological. And that <span class="greekheb">ἐβάσταζεν</span> can bear the sense of “take away” or “make away with” is beyond dispute. The passages cited by Kypke and Field (Soph., <span class="ital">Philoct.</span>, 1105; Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiq.</span>, ix. 2; Diog., <span class="ital">Laert.</span>, iv. 59) prove that it was used of “taking away by stealth” or “purloining”; and <span class="ital">cf.</span> the use of <span class="greekheb">φέρειν</span> in Eur., <span class="ital">Hec.</span>, 792. Liddell and Scott aptly compare the Scots use of “lift” in “cattle-lifting” and so forth. Mary found a prompt champion in Jesus: <span class="greekheb">Ἄφες αὐτήν</span>, “let her alone”. R.V[81] renders: “Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying”; and in margin: “Let her alone: <span class="ital">it was</span> that she might keep it”. This Westcott understands as meaning “suffer her to keep it—this was her purpose, and let it not be disturbed—for my preparation for burial”. But, however we understand it, there is a palpable absurdity in our Lord’s requesting that which had already been poured out to be kept for His burial. On the other hand, if the reading of [82] adopted in T.R. <span class="greekheb">τετήρηκεν</span> was the original reading, it might naturally be altered owing to the scribe’s inability to perceive how this day of anointing could be called the day of His <span class="greekheb">ἐνταφιασμός</span>, and how the ointment could be said to have been kept till that day (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Field, <span class="ital">Otium Norvic.</span>, p. 69). <span class="greekheb">τετήρηκεν</span> is opposed to <span class="greekheb">ἐπράθη</span> (<a href="/john/12-5.htm" title="Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?">John 12:5</a>); she had not sold, but kept it; and she kept it, perhaps unconsciously, against the day of His entombment or preparation for burial. <span class="greekheb">ἐνταφιασμός</span> is rather the preparation for burial than the actual interment. <span class="ital">Vide</span> especially Kypke on <a href="/mark/14-8.htm" title="She has done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body to the burying.">Mark 14:8</a>. This anointing was His true embalming. Mary’s love was representative of the love of His intimate friends in whose loyal affection He was embalmed so that His memory could never die. The significance of the incident lies precisely in this, that Mary’s action is the evidence that Jesus may now die, having already found an enduring place for Himself in the regard of His friends. It is possible that Mary herself, enlightened by her love, had a presentiment that this was the last tribute she could ever pay her Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[79] Septuagint.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[80] Revised Version.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[81] Revised Version.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[82] Codex Alexandrinus of the fifth century, a chief representative of the “Syrian” text, that is, the revised text formed by judicious eclectic use of all existing texts, and meant to be <span class="ital">the</span> authoritative New Testament.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">the bag</span>] Better, <span class="ital">the</span> <span class="bld">box</span>, the cash-box in which the funds of the small company were kept.

It seems to me desirable, in this place in particular, to observe the nature of the apostolic style. The sacred writers were not solicitous as to whether fastidious ears were likely to judge each particular word to be Attic or a barbarism: a fact which may be established sufficiently even by this one argument, that of the terms which the Atticists examine [as dubious in point of good style], a considerable part occur in the New Testament. For instance, let Phrynichus be looked into as to the term <span class="greekheb">γλωσσόκομον</span>;[310] also Thomas Magister on <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>; Mœris on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝΕΤΕΙΛΆΜΗΝ</span></span></span>; with which word compare this passage, and <a href="/revelation/22-14.htm" title="Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.">Revelation 22:14</a> [<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ΠΟΙΟῦΝΤΕς Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἘΝΤΟΛᾺς</span></span></span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ ἜΣΤΑΙ</span></span></span>], <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.

Moreover the Sacred writers most exactly observe the proper [strict] signification of words: for instance, <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; <a href="/john/1-17.htm" title="For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.">John 1:17</a>. notes:[311] inasmuch as accuracy in this latter respect, not in respect to the former [purity of Attic style], was conducive to making the Divine mind known.—<span class="greekheb">εἶχε</span>) <span class="ital">was having</span>: either he used to have it always, or he was having it then [in his turn] after the other disciples, at that the last time. Judas himself seems to have taken to himself this office; which, however, was left to him, even though he was a thief: ch. <a href="/john/13-29.htm" title="For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.">John 13:29</a>, “Some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or that he should give something to the poor.”—<span class="greekheb">τὰ βαλλόμενα</span>, which were contributed to it [what was put therein]) Jesus was poor and needy.—<span class="greekheb">ἐβάσταζεν</span>, <span class="ital">he was carrying</span>) for the ordinary necessities of the Saviour’s bodily sustenance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[310] For which the ancients used <span class="greekheb">γλωσσοκομεῖον</span> and <span class="greekheb">γλωσσοκόμιον</span>, and in the sense of <span class="ital">the receptacle of the mouth-piece of the tibia</span> or flageolet, not in the recent sense, a <span class="ital">coffer</span> or <span class="ital">purse</span>.—E. and T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[311] The distinction is accurately observed between <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἐδόθη</span>, so that one could not be substituted for the other without injury to the sense.—E. and T.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>And had the bag, and bare what was put therein (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>The best texts read &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, having, and omit the second &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; and. The rendering would then be, and having the bag bare, etc.<p>The bag (&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here and <a href="/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a>. Originally a box for keeping the mouth-pieces of wind instruments. From &#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;, tongue, and &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, to tend. The word was also used for a coffin. Josephus applies it to the coffer in which the golden mice and emerods were preserved (<a href="/1_samuel/6-11.htm">1 Samuel 6:11</a>). In the Septuagint, of the chest which Joash had provided for receiving contributions for the repairing of the Lord's house (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-8.htm">2 Chronicles 24:8</a>). Rev. gives box, in margin.<p>Bare (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Carried away or purloined. This meaning is rather imparted by the context than residing in the verb itself, i.e., according to New Testament usage (see on <a href="/john/10-21.htm">John 10:21</a>). Unquestionably it has this meaning in later Greek, frequently in Josephus. Render, therefore, as Rev., took away. The rendering of the A.V. is tautological. </body></html>
