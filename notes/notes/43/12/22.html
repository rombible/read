The names have occurred together before (<a href="/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>; <a href="/context/john/6-7.htm" title="Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.">John 6:7-8</a>): they were fellow-townsmen and friends. But Andrew was also brother of Simon Peter, and is one of the first group of four in the apostolic band. (Comp. <a href="/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3</a>.) The Greeks then naturally come to Philip, and Philip consults his friend Andrew, who is in a position of greater intimacy with the Lord than he himself is, and they come together and tell Jesus.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:20-26 In attendance upon holy ordinances, particularly the gospel passover, the great desire of our souls should be to see Jesus; to see him as ours, to keep up communion with him, and derive grace from him. The calling of the Gentiles magnified the Redeemer. A corn of wheat yields no increase unless it is cast into the ground. Thus Christ might have possessed his heavenly glory alone, without becoming man. Or, after he had taken man's nature, he might have entered heaven alone, by his own perfect righteousness, without suffering or death; but then no sinner of the human race could have been saved. The salvation of souls hitherto, and henceforward to the end of time, is owing to the dying of this Corn of wheat. Let us search whether Christ be in us the hope of glory; let us beg him to make us indifferent to the trifling concerns of this life, that we may serve the Lord Jesus with a willing mind, and follow his holy example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Telleth Andrew - Why he did not at once tell Jesus is not known.

They were both of Bethsaida (<a href="/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>), and possibly these Greeks may have come from the same district. S. Philip seems to shrink from the responsibility of introducing Gentiles to the Messiah, and applies in his difficulty to the Apostle who had already distinguished himself by bringing others to Christ (<a href="/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>, <a href="/context/john/6-8.htm" title="One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,...">John 6:8-9</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and again</span>] The true reading is <span class="bld">Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they</span> <span class="ital">tell Jesus</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/12-22.htm" title="Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.">John 12:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ λέγει</span>, <span class="ital">and telleth</span>) Philip, from a feeling of reverence, feared alone [by himself] to introduce the Greeks: in company with a friend, he ventures to do so.

Philip receives the respectful request of the Greeks, "Sir [my lord], we would see Jesus," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "converse with." They probably sought to bring some proposal before him. Surely they must have had, if they wished it, many opportunities of merely <span class="accented">seeing</span> Jesus, when he crossed the Mount of Olivet during those three days, or tarried in the court of the Gentiles; now they pressed for an interview. <span class="cmt_word">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew.</span> Andrew was the earliest of the disciples, who brought his own brother Simon to Jesus (<a href="/john/1-40.htm">John 1:40-42</a>). He is mentioned as in close association with Simon, James, and John, as partners with them in the fishing-trade on the lake of Galilee (see <a href="/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16, 29</a>, and Mark 3:18, compared with <a href="/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>). There is some hint that Andrew and John, after the first call to become followers of Christ, clung to him, and went with him to Jerusalem, and then returned with him through Samaria, after which occurred the second call of the brothers <span class="accented">Simon</span> and <span class="accented">James</span>. The frequent references to Andrew and Philip in this Gospel correspond with the tradition preserved in the <span class="accented">Muratorian Fragment on the Canon</span>, touching Andrew's part in the composition of this Gospel. These two disciples are represented as consulting with each other on previous occasions, as though peculiarly related in sympathy. Philip sees certain difficulties, and Andrew has a practical mind, and proposes a way out of them (see <a href="/john/6-7.htm">John 6:7, 8</a>). There was something now to be said on both sides. Their ancient prophecies anticipated a world-wide aspect of the Messianic kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4, 5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3, 7</a>; as well as <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). Now, if this incident occurred after Jesus had claimed the hundred and tenth psalm as an oracle which described his own Divine claims and his universal victory as the Lord and Son of David and royal Warrior-Prest (<a href="/matthew/22-41.htm">Matthew 22:41-46</a>, and parallel passages), Philip may have felt this moment to be a most critical one in his history; for he may have been perfectly aware of the outbreak of peril which converse with Greek proselytes might at that moment have provoked in the minds of the turbulent populace. <span class="cmt_word">Andrew cometh and Philip, and they</span> (together) <span class="cmt_word">tell Jesus</span>. Jesus alone could solve the difficulty at that time, and Jesus himself is the just and reasonable Source of all enlightenment. Jesus is at this hour the highest Expression of man and his destiny, and he is also the perfect Manifestation of the Father, the only Mediator between God and man, absolutely one with both. We still go to him to know what God is and what God would have us to think and to be, and to learn what man may become. We take to him the puzzles of our logic, the accusations of our conscience, and the burdens of our heart. Additional interest is thrown round this narrative by a suggestion of Archdeacon Watkins, that, in the course of this week, our Lord had cleansed the temple and courts of its profane traffic, and declared it to be a <span class="accented">house of prayer for all nations</span>. Such grand revolutionary conceptions as those of our Lord must have deeply stirred the souls of the susceptible Greeks. Aliens were, as we know from Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:11.5), forbidden to pass beyond the balustrade round the <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>,. M. Ganneau has found among the ruins of Jerusalem one of the slabs of stone which recorded this exclusion. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Philip - Andrew<p>They appear together in <a href="/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/6-7.htm">John 6:7</a>, <a href="/john/6-8.htm">John 6:8</a>.
