The Entry into Jerusalem is described by each of the evangelists, and the outer incidents are told more briefly by St. John than by any one of the others. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/21-1.htm" title="And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,">Matthew 21:1-11</a>; <a href="/context/mark/11-1.htm" title="And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples,">Mark 11:1-11</a>; <a href="/context/luke/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,">Luke 19:29-44</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">On the next day.</span>—See Note on <a href="/john/12-1.htm" title="Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.">John 12:1</a>. St. John only gives us this definite note of time, connecting the Entry with the previous sojourn at Bethany. The Synoptic narrative is more general, describing the approach from Jericho, and naming Bethphage (Matt. and Luke) and Bethany (Mark and Luke) as stages in the journey, but not connecting the Supper at Bethany with the Entry.<p><span class= "bld">When they heard that Jesus was coming.</span>—They heard probably from those of the Jews (<a href="/john/12-9.htm" title="Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.">John 12:9</a>) who had gone to Bethany. Note that these multitudes are not called Jews, though, of course, in the ordinary sense they were so. They were not “Jews” in the sense in which St. John uses the word, and he describes them as “much people that were come to the feast.” (Comp. <a href="/john/11-54.htm" title="Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went there to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.">John 11:54</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/john/12.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>John<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A NEW KIND OF KING<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/john/12-12.htm" title="On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,">John 12:12</a> - <a href="/john/12-26.htm" title="If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor.">John 12:26</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The difference between John’s account of the entry into Jerusalem and those of the Synoptic Gospels is very characteristic. His is much briefer, but it brings the essentials out clearly, and is particular in showing its place as a link in the chain that drew on the final catastrophe, and in noting its effect on various classes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘The next day’ in <a href="/john/12-12.htm" title="On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,">John 12:12</a> was probably the Sunday before the crucifixion. To understand the events of that day we must try to realise how rapidly, and, as the rulers thought, dangerously, excitement was rising among the crowds who had come up for the Passover, and who had heard of the raising of Lazarus. The Passover was always a time when national feeling was ready to blaze up, and any spark might light the fire. It looked as if Lazarus were going to be the match this time, and so, on the Saturday, the rulers had made up their minds to have him put out of the way in order to stop the current that was setting in, of acceptance of Jesus as the Messiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They had already made up their minds to dispose of Jesus, and now, with cynical contempt for justice, they determined to ‘put Lazarus also to death.’ So there were to be two men who were to ‘die for the people.’ Keeping all this wave of popular feeling in view, it might have been expected that Jesus would, as hitherto, have escaped into privacy, or discouraged the offered homage of a crowd whose Messianic ideal was so different from His.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> John is mainly concerned in bringing out two points in his version of the incident. First, he tells us what we should not have gathered from the other Evangelists, that the triumphal procession began in Jerusalem, not in Bethany. It was the direct result of the ebullition of enthusiasm occasioned by the raising of Lazarus. The course of events seems to have been that ‘the common people of the Jews’ came streaming out to Bethany on the Sunday to gape and gaze at the risen man and Him who had raised him, that they and some of those who had been present at the raising went back to the city and carried thither the intelligence that Jesus was coming in from Bethany next day, and that then the procession to meet Him was organised.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The meaning of the popular demonstration was plain, both from the palm branches, signs of victory and rejoicing, and from the chant, which is in part taken from <a href="/psalms/118-1.htm" title="O give thanks to the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endures for ever.">Psalm 118:1</a> - <a href="/psalms/118-29.htm" title="O give thanks to the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endures for ever.">Psalm 118:29</a> The Messianic application of that quotation is made unmistakable by the addition, ‘even the King of Israel.’ In the Psalm, ‘he that cometh in the name of Jehovah,’ means the worshipper drawing near to the Temple, but the added words divert the expression to Jesus, hail Him as the King, and invoke Him as ‘Saviour.’ Little did that shouting crowd understand what sort of a Saviour He was. Deliverance from Rome was what they were thinking of.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We must remember what gross, unspiritual notions of the Messiah they had, and then we are prepared to feel how strangely unlike His whole past conduct Jesus’ action now was. He had shrunk from crowds and their impure enthusiasm; He had slipped away into solitude when they wished to come by force to make Him a King, and had in every possible way sought to avoid publicity and the rousing of popular excitement. Now He deliberately sets Himself to intensify it. His choice of an ass on which to ride into Jerusalem was, and would be seen by many to be, a plain appropriation to Himself of a very distinct Messianic prophecy, and must have raised the heat of the crowd by many degrees. One can fancy the roar of acclaim which hailed Him when He met the multitude, and the wild emotion with which they strewed His path with garments hastily drawn off and cast before Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Why did He thus contradict all His past, and court the smoky enthusiasm which He had hitherto damped? Because He knew that ‘His hour’ had come, and that the Cross was at hand, and He desired to bring it as speedily as might be, and thus to shorten the suffering that He would not avoid, and to finish the work which He was eager to complete. The impatience, as we might almost call it, which had marked Him on all that last journey, reached its height now, and may indicate to us for our sympathy and gratitude both His human longing to get the dark hour over and His fixed willingness to die for us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But even while Jesus accepted the acclamations and deliberately set Himself to stir up enthusiasm, He sought to purify the gross ideas of the crowd. What more striking way could He have chosen of declaring that all the turbulent passions and eagerness for a foot-to-foot conflict with Rome which were boiling in their breasts were alien to His purposes and to the true Messianic ideal, than that choosing of the meek, slow-pacing ass to bear Him? A conquering king would have made his triumphal entry in a chariot or on a battle-horse. This strange type of monarch is throned on an ass. It was not only for a verbal fulfilment of the prophecy, but for a demonstration of the essential nature of His kingdom, that He thus entered the city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> John characteristically takes note of the effects of the entry on two classes, the disciples and the rulers. The former remembered with a sudden flash of enlightenment the meaning of the entry when the Cross and the Resurrection had taught them it. The rulers marked the popular feeling running high with bewilderment, and were, as Jesus meant them to be, made more determined to take vigorous measures to stop this madness of the mob.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second incident in this passage contrasts remarkably with the first, and yet is, in one aspect, a continuation of it. In the former, Jesus brought into prominence the true nature of His rule by His choosing the ass to carry Him, so declaring that His dominion rested, not on conquest, but on meekness. In the latter, He reveals a yet deeper aspect of His work, and teaches that His influence over men is won by utter self-sacrifice, and that His subjects must tread the same path of losing their lives by which He passes to His glory. The details of the incident are of small importance as compared with that great and solemn lesson; but we may note them in a few words. The desire of a few Greeks to see Him was probably only a reflection of the popular enthusiasm, and was prompted mainly by curiosity and the characteristic Greek eagerness to see any ‘new thing.’ The addressing of the request to Philip is perhaps explained by the fact that he ‘was of Bethsaida of Galilee,’ and had probably come into contact with these Greeks in the neighbouring Decapolis, on the other side of the lake. Philip’s consultation of his fellow-townsman, Andrew, who is associated with him in other places, probably implies hesitation in granting so unprecedented a request. They did not know what Jesus might say to it. And what He did say was very unlike anything that they could have anticipated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The trivial request was as a narrow window through which Jesus’ yearning spirit saw a great expanse-nothing less than the coming to Him of myriads of Gentiles, the ‘much fruit’ of which He immediately speaks, the ‘other sheep’ whom He ‘must bring.’ The thought must have been ever present to Him, or it would never have leaped to utterance on such an occasion. The little window shows us, too, what was habitually in His mind and heart. He, as it were, hears the striking of the hour of His glorification; in which expression the ideas of His being glorified by drawing men to the knowledge of His love, and of the Cross being not the lowest depth of His humiliation, but the highest apex of His glory-as it is always represented in this Gospel-seemed to be fused together.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The seed must die if a harvest is to spring from it. That is the law for all moral and spiritual reformations. Every cause must have its martyrs. No man can be fruit-bearing unless he sacrifices himself. We shall not ‘quicken’ our fellows unless we ‘die,’ either literally or by the not less real martyrdom of rigid self-crucifixion and suppression.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But that necessity is not only for Apostles or missionaries of great causes; it is the condition of all true, noble life, and prescribes the path not only for those who would live for others, but for all who would truly live their own lives. Self-renunciation guards the way to the ‘tree of life.’ That lesson was specially needed by ‘Greeks,’ for ignorance of it was the worm that gnawed the blossoms of their trees, whether of art or of literature. It is no less needed by our sensuously luxurious and eagerly acquisitive generation. The world’s war-cries to-day are two-’Get!’ ‘Enjoy!’ Christ’s command is, ‘Renounce!’ And in renouncing we shall realise both of these other aims, which they who pursue them only, never attain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Christ’s servant must be Christ’s follower: indeed service is following. The Cross has aspects in which it stands alone, and is incapable of being reproduced and makes all repetition needless. But it has also an aspect in which it not only may, but must, be reproduced in every disciple. And he who takes it for the ground of his trust only, and not as the pattern of his life, has need to ask himself whether his trust in it is genuine or worth anything. Of course they who follow a leader will arrive where the leader has gone, and though our feet are feeble and our progress devious and slow, we have here His promise that we shall not be lost in the desert, but, sustained by Him, will reach His side, and at last be where He is.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/12-12.htm" title="On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,...">John 12:12-16</a>. </span><span class="ital">On the next day </span>— On Sunday; <span class="ital">much people that were come to the feast </span>— From different parts of the country, particularly from Galilee; <span class="ital">took branches of palm-trees, </span>&c. — So that this multitude consisted chiefly, not of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, but of persons from other places.

It was, therefore, becoming the meekness of the lowly Jesus, that in his most public entry into the capital city, he chose to ride on an ass.

In like manner, the design of God’s providential dispensations is seldom understood at first.

S. John seems distinctly to assert that the Triumphal Entry followed the supper at Bethany: S. Matthew and S. Mark both place the supper after the entry, S.

(On the differences between John's account of this transaction and that of the synoptic narrative, cf. commentaries, <a href="/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1-11</a>; <a href="/mark/11-1.htm">Mark 11:1-10</a>; <a href="/luke/19-29.htm">Luke 19:29-44</a>.) On the precise order of events it is difficult to speak with absolute decision. The main difference between the synoptists and John is in the break at Bethany of the journey from Jericho to Jerusalem, to introduce a feast, which is related afterwards by the synoptists, though not <span class="accented">limited</span> by them to any later chronological position. It should be observed, moreover, that the synoptic narrative contains numerous references to the residence in Bethany during several days of the week (cf. <a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>) which followed. John adds important details, and while he omits the great discussions in the temple, the withering of the fig tree, the cleansing of the temple, the parables of the judgments on scribes and Pharisees, and the prophecy of the future, he portrays the inner life of the Lord, and records his most gracious esoteric teaching and sublime prayer. The current tradition of the Church, the distinct note of time for Christ's arrival at Bethany (six days before the Passover), make the triumphal entry take place on Sunday afternoon (cf. ver. 1) of Passion week. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The next day</span> (on the morrow) must be the day after the feast. We have seen that that feast probably took place on the evening of the sabbath. The events that happened are far more abundantly described in Matthew, Mark, and Luke - the excitement in Jerusalem, the method in which the triumph was carried through, the mode adopted to secure "the young ass," the weeping ever Jerusalem from the summit of the hill; none of these circumstances are inconsistent with this account. Brief, however, as our narrative is, it adds some features which are peculiar and highly historic. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">vast crowd that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.</span> These that had come from the country, and had already encamped near or in Jerusalem, came group after group to Bethany to escort him into the city. The synoptists, not mentioning the pause of the sabbath at Bethany, and not clearly indicating where and when the feast at Bethany took place, naturally connect the journey from Jericho with the entrance into Jerusalem. John explains, in addition, that there were of the Jerusalemites themselves certain who had been led to go to Bethany and throw in their lot with the Lord. The early pilgrims mentioned in <a href="/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55, 56</a>, also came forth from the city to hail and welcome his approach. Took branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him. The synoptists had mentioned that the triumphant host had cut "branches," <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/matthew/21-8.htm">Matthew 21:8</a>), from the trees, and Mark (<a href="/mark/11-8.htm">Mark 11:8</a>) had said <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, fragments of trees, grass, small branches, that could be strewn in the way. Luke (<a href="/luke/19-35.htm">Luke 19:35</a>) simply mentions the <span class="accented">garments</span> thus strewn - a fact mentioned also by Mark and Matthew. Our narrative gives greater definiteness, and even adds a new feature, by speaking of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "the palm branches of the palm trees," which they waved probably in triumph, as they had been accustomed to do in token of the approach of a conqueror (cf. 1 Macc. 13:51, where Simon's return to the city was celebrated with "thanksgiving and <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> and with harps and cymbals," etc.). The use to which the branches of the well-known palm trees were put, differs from, but does not exclude, the use to which <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were also put. Bethany (see note, <a href="/john/11-1.htm">John 11:1</a>) was "the house of dates," and the palm branches for the Feast of Tabernacles, on its first celebration after the Captivity (cf. <a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>), Were fetched from <span class="accented">the</span> mount (<a href="/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>). The palm tree was a sacred symbol for Israel "Tamar," a palm <span class="accented">tree</span>, was a favorite name for a woman. The Maccabaean coins were decorated with the palm and vine. The medal struck by Titus represented a captive sitting under a palm. Throughout their history, in their gorgeous temple ritual, it continually reappears, and at the last the Apocalypse represents the victorious songs of triumphant elders accompanied by the waving of the palm. If we compare the four accounts of the demonstration, we shall see again how in combination they vividly represent the whole scene. The multitude cry, according to - <a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>: "Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest." <a href="/mark/11-9.htm">Mark 11:9, 10</a>: "Hosanna; Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: Blessed be the coming kingdom of our father David: Hosanna in the highest." <a href="/luke/19-38.htm">Luke 19:38</a>, remembering the angel's song: "They praised God with a loud voice....  Blessed be the King that cometh in the Name of the Lord: in heaven peace, and glory in the highest." John says they went forth to meet him, palm branch in hand, and cried, <span class="cmt_word">Hosanna: Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, and</span> (blessed be) <span class="cmt_word">(even) the King of Israel.</span> These differences show how various groups used with freedom the tones and sentiment of the hundred and eighteenth psalm, adopting the welcome with which the priests were accustomed to greet the pilgrims to the festival. But each account demonstrates that, on this occasion, there was a general ascription to our Lord of Messianic honor. He is hailed by the people as King of Israel, as the Head of the coming kingdom of their father David, and as giving glory to God. <span class="accented">The Name of the Lord</span> is the manifestation and compendium of all the perfections of the Lord. For centuries the gracious hope had rung forth in the sacred liturgy, and now the people see that the hope is on the point of realization. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A great multitude (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Some editors add the article and render, the common people. </body></html>
