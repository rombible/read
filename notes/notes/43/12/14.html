John cites very freely from memory; hence the omission of the other prophetic predicates (even of the <span class="greekheb">πραΐς</span> in Matt.), because he has in his eye simply the point of the <span class="ital">riding in upon the young ass</span>, as a Messianic <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> excluding all doubt.

Instead of <span class="greekheb">μὴ φοβοῦ</span>, John might also have said <span class="greekheb">χαῖρε σφόδρα</span> (LXX.); but there floated before him, in his citation from memory, simply the opposition to that terror by which otherwise a royal entrance may be accompanied. “<span class="ital">The Church’s figure of the cross</span>” (Hengstenberg) did not yet lie on this ass’s foal, otherwise John would not have passed over the <span class="greekheb">עָנִי</span> of the passage, nor have found the emphasis in <span class="greekheb">μὴ φοβοῦ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/12.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/12-14.htm" title="And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,">John 12:14</a>.

The significance of the “ass” is shown in what follows: “He shall destroy the chariots out of Ephraim and the horse out of Jerusalem, and the war-bow shall be utterly destroyed: and there shall be abundance and peace”. By riding into Jerusalem as king but on an ass, not on a war horse, He continued to claim to be Messiah but ruling by spiritual force for spiritual, ends.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">It is written</span>] See on <a href="/john/2-17.htm" title="And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your house has eaten me up.">John 2:17</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/12-14.htm" title="And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,">John 12:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εὑρών</span>, <span class="ital">having obtained</span> [when He had found]) He was poor [and therefore had not one of His own].—<span class="greekheb">ὀνάριον</span>) <span class="greekheb">ὀνάριον</span>, <span class="ital">a young or little ass</span> [asellus], a diminutive, is not so much opposed in this passage to the ass [of ordinary size], as to the fiery horse, which our Lord did not use.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written.</span> The whole account of the process by which our Lord secured this <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is described at great length by the synoptists (see <a href="/matthew/21-2.htm">Matthew 21:2</a>; <a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12</a>; <a href="/luke/19-30.htm">Luke 19:30</a>). The foal implies that the animal had never borne another burden. The account of Matthew refers to the mother and the foal, as though they were inseparable, and together bore the sacred burden. Mr. Holman Hunt, in his picture of the 'Triumph of the Innocents,' has represented the beast bearing Mary and her Child as accompanied by the colt. The entire process of securing both must have taken time, and augmented the excitement. Christ at length, on the eve of his Passion which he so distinctly foreshadowed, allowed the enthusiasm of the people to prevail, and accepted the homage. The Galilee pilgrims take up the demonstration, which was commenced, as we see from John's Gospel, by "the Jews" and those Jerusalemites who had been profoundly moved by the significance of the resurrection of Lazarus. The circumstances thus elucidated from the four narratives, reveal undesigned coincidences. The entry into Jerusalem did not take place till the afternoon, and so we find that all that our Lord did on arrival was to "go to the temple, look round on all things, and, now that the even was come, to revisit Bethany with the twelve" (<a href="/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A young ass (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here in the New Testament.
