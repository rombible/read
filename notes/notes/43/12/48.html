His own conscience will condemn him. The words which I have spoken will be remembered and will condemn him, if there were nothing further.

This will make him miserable, and there will be no possibility of his being happy.<p>4. that the conscience of the sinner will concur with the sentence of Christ in the great day, and that he will go to eternity self-condemned.
