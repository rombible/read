Nevertheless, his real motive was covetousness; for as he carried the bag, he thought if his Master had sold the ointment, he would have gotten the money to keep, and so might have applied part of it to his own private use. But it is no new thing for the basest men to cover their blackest crimes with the fair pretence of zeal for the honour of God and the interests of religion. <span class="ital">For three hundred pence</span> — These were Roman pence, and consequently amounted to nine pounds seven shillings and sixpence.

But she did not leave off serving, as some, who when found fault with for going too far in one way, peevishly run too far another way; she still served, but within hearing of Christ's gracious words. Mary gave a token of love to Christ, who had given real tokens of his love to her and her family. God's Anointed should be our Anointed. Has God poured on him the oil of gladness above his fellows, let us pour on him the ointment of our best affections. In Judas a foul sin is gilded over with a plausible pretence. We must not think that those do no acceptable service, who do it not in our way. The reigning love of money is heart-theft. The grace of Christ puts kind comments on pious words and actions, makes the best of what is amiss, and the most of what is good. Opportunities are to be improved; and those first and most vigorously, which are likely to be the shortest. To consult to hinder the further effect of the miracle, by putting Lazarus to death, is such wickedness, malice, and folly, as cannot be explained, except by the desperate enmity of the human heart against God. They resolved that the man should die whom the Lord had raised to life. The success of the gospel often makes wicked men so angry, that they speak and act as if they hoped to obtain a victory over the Almighty himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3-16</a>.<p><a href="/john/12-2.htm">John 12:2</a><p>A supper - At the house of Simon the leper, <a href="/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>.<p>Lazarus was ... - The names of Martha and Lazarus are mentioned because it was not in their own house, but in that of Simon. Lazarus is particularly mentioned, since it was so remarkable that one who had been once dead should be enjoying again the endearments of friendship. This shows, also, that his resurrection was no illusion - that he was really restored to the blessings of life and friendship. Calmet thinks that this was about two months after his resurrection, and it is the last that we hear of him. How long he lived is unknown, nor is it recorded that he made any communication about the world of spirits. It is remarkable that none who have been restored to life from the dead have made any communications respecting that world.

Thayer, <span class="greekheb">πιστικῆς</span> is sometimes derived from <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>, and rendered “genuine,” <span class="greekheb">γνήσιος</span>, <span class="greekheb">δόκιμος</span>. Thus Euthymius, <span class="greekheb">ἀκράτου καὶ καταπεπιστευμένης εἰς καθαρότητα</span>, unadulterated and guaranteed pure. But <span class="greekheb">πιστός</span> is the common form; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">Θηρικλέους πιστὸν τέκνον</span>, Theopomp. in <span class="ital">Com. Frag</span>. Some suppose it indicates the name of the place where the nard was obtained. Thus Augustine: “Quod ait ‘pistici,’ locum aliquem credere debemus, unde hoc erat unguentum pretiosum”. Similarly some modern scholars derive it from Opis (sc. Opistike), a Babylonian town. In the <span class="ital">Classical Review</span> (July, 1890) Mr. Bennett suggests that it should be written <span class="greekheb">πιστακῆς</span>, and that it refers to the <span class="ital">Pistacia Terebinthus</span>, which grows in Cyprus, Chios, and Palestine, and yields a turpentine in such inconsiderable quantities as to be very costly. The word is most fully discussed by Fritzsche on <a href="/mark/14-3.htm" title="And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head.">Mark 14:3</a>, who argues at great length and with much learning for the meaning “drinkable”. He quotes Athenaeus in proof that some ointments were drunk, mixed with wine. <span class="greekheb">πιστός</span> is the word commonly used for “potable,” as in Aesch., <span class="ital">Prom. Vinct.</span>, 480, where Prometheus says man had no defence against disease <span class="greekheb">οὔτε βρώσιμον</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐ χριστὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὔτε πιστόν</span>. And Fritzsche holds that while <span class="greekheb">πιστός</span> means “qui bibi potest,” <span class="greekheb">πιστικός</span> means “qui facile bibi potest”. The weight and nature of the ointment are specified to give force to the added <span class="greekheb">πολυτίμου</span>; see <a href="/john/12-5.htm" title="Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?">John 12:5</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἤλειψε τοὺς πόδας τοῦ Ἰησοῦ</span>, Mt. and Mk. say “the head,” which was the more natural but less significant, and in the circumstances less convenient, mode of disposing of the ointment.—<span class="greekheb">κα ἐξέμαξε</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, “and wiped High feet with her hair”. Holtzmann thinks this an infelicitous combination of <a href="/mark/14-3.htm" title="And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head.">Mark 14:3</a> and <a href="/luke/7-38.htm" title="And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.">Luke 7:38</a>; infelicitous because the anointing of the feet which was appropriate in the humbled penitent was not so in Mary’s case; and the drying with her hair which was suitable where tears had fallen was unsuitable where anointing had taken place, for the unguent should have been allowed to remain. This, however, is infelicitous criticism. In Aristoph., <span class="ital">Wasps</span>, 607, the <span class="ital">daughter</span> anoints her father’s feet: <span class="greekheb">ἡ θυγάτηρ</span> … <span class="greekheb">τὼ πόδʼ ἀλείφῃ</span>; and if, as Fritzsche supposes, the ointment was liquid, there is nothing inappropriate but the reverse in the wiping with the hair.—<span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ οἰκία ἐπληρώθη ἐκ τῆς ὀσμῆς τοῦ μυροῦ</span>, at once attracting attention and betraying the costliness of the offering.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">took Mary a pound</span>] S.

John very likely had seen: his account has all the independence of that of an eye-witness, but may have been influenced by the Synoptic narratives. The meaning of the Greek is not certain: it may mean (1) ‘genuine nard,’ and spikenard was often adulterated; or (2) ‘drinkable, liquid nard,’ and unguents were sometimes drunk; or (3) ‘Pistic nard,’ ‘Pistic’ being supposed to be a local adjective. But no place from which such an adjective could come appears to be known.

John records the less usual act, which again is evidence of Mary’s devotion. The rest of this verse is peculiar to S. John, and shews that he was present.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐκ τῆς ὀσμῆς</span>, <span class="ital">owing to</span> [“with”] <span class="ital">the odour</span>) It was at this very odour that Judas took offence.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mary therefore took a pound</span> (the synoptists Matthew and Mark say "an alabaster," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a flask made of the costly spar, which was peculiarly adapted to the preservation of liquid perfume, hermetically sealed before it was broken for immediate use. The fact, as stated by Matthew and Mark, is inconsistent with her reserving any of the precious fluid for another occasion) <span class="cmt_word">of ointment</span> ("liquid perfume," sometimes added to the more ordinary oil), <span class="cmt_word">of pure</span> (or possibly; <span class="accented">pistie</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>nard</span>. Mark uses this unusual word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which belongs to later Greek. The derivation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, equivalent to "potable," is not appropriate in meaning, though this "nard" was used for perfuming wine. In <a href="/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a> also the Authorized Version translates it "spikenard," as it does here (cf. also <a href="/songs/1-12.htm">Song of Solomon 1:12</a> and Song 4:13, 14, where Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). But the one place where the word was supposed to be found in Aristotle is now seen not to be <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, trustworthy, or unadulterated. It is possible that the word may have had a local geographical value, belonging to some proper name, and is untranslatable. <span class="cmt_word">Very precious.</span> Mark (<a href="/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>) uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, and Matthew (<a href="/matthew/26-7.htm">Matthew 26:7</a>) <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. John appears to combine the idea of both words in his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Each of the synoptists severally mentions a fact which John omits - that Mary <span class="accented">broke</span> the alabaster box, and poured the costly unguent on his head in rich abundance, as though hers had been the royal or high-priestly anointing (cf. <a href="/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133</a>.); but John shows that this at least was not all she did. <span class="cmt_word">She anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</span> Thoma thinks that, conformably with John's idea, the anointing of the head of the true High Priest was the work of God alone, quoting Philo's comment on <a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, etc., "The head of the Logos, as High Priest, is anointed with oil, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his innermost essence gleams with dazzling light;" and adds, that as the feet of the high priest were washed with water from recent defilement of the world's dust, so God's anointed Lamb and Priest was anointed on his feet with the spikenard of faith, the best and costliest thing that man could offer. So profound an analogy seems to us contrary to the simplicity of the narrative, which is perfectly natural in its form. The perfumed nard ran down to the Savior's feet and the skirts of his garments, and there accumulating, the significant act is further recounted how Mary wiped off the superfluous perfume from his feet with the tresses of her loosened hair. This simple act proclaimed the self-humiliation and adoration of her unbounded love, seeing that the loosening of a woman's hair was a mark of unusual self-abandonment, Many most unnecessary inferences have been drawn from this. John adds an interesting feature, revealing the sensitive eye-witness of the scene, "and the house <span class="accented">was filled with the odor of the ointment</span>;" and the whole house of God ever since has been fragrant with her immortal and prophetic act. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A pound (&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here and <a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>.
