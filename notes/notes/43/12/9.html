Such was their unparalleled wickedness! Here we have the plain reason why the other evangelists, who wrote while Lazarus was living, did not relate this story. <span class="ital">Many of the Jews went away </span>— That is, say most commentators, went to Bethany; and after seeing Lazarus, <span class="ital">believed on Jesus </span>— Namely, as their long-expected Messiah.

But she did not leave off serving, as some, who when found fault with for going too far in one way, peevishly run too far another way; she still served, but within hearing of Christ's gracious words. Mary gave a token of love to Christ, who had given real tokens of his love to her and her family. God's Anointed should be our Anointed. Has God poured on him the oil of gladness above his fellows, let us pour on him the ointment of our best affections. In Judas a foul sin is gilded over with a plausible pretence. We must not think that those do no acceptable service, who do it not in our way. The reigning love of money is heart-theft. The grace of Christ puts kind comments on pious words and actions, makes the best of what is amiss, and the most of what is good. Opportunities are to be improved; and those first and most vigorously, which are likely to be the shortest. To consult to hinder the further effect of the miracle, by putting Lazarus to death, is such wickedness, malice, and folly, as cannot be explained, except by the desperate enmity of the human heart against God. They resolved that the man should die whom the Lord had raised to life. The success of the gospel often makes wicked men so angry, that they speak and act as if they hoped to obtain a victory over the Almighty himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Had the bag - The word translated "bag" is compounded of two words, meaning "tongue," and "to keep or preserve." It was used to denote the bag in which musicians used to keep the tongues or reeds of their pipes when traveling. Hence, it came to mean any bag or purse in which travelers put their money or their most precious articles. The disciples appear to have had such a bag or purse in common, in which they put whatever money they had, and which was designed especially for the poor, <a href="/luke/8-3.htm">Luke 8:3</a>; <a href="/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a>; <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44</a>. The keeping of this, it seems, was intrusted to Judas; and it is remarkable that the only one among them who appears to have been naturally avaricious should have received this appointment. It shows us that every man is tried according to his native propensity. This is the object of trial - to bring out man's native character; and every man will find opportunity to do evil according to his native disposition, if he is inclined, to it.<p>And bare ... - The word translated "bare" means literally "to carry as a burden." Then it means "to carry away," as in <a href="/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a>; "If thou hast borne him hence." Hence, it means to carry away as a thief does, and this is evidently its meaning here. It has this sense often in classic writers. Judas was a thief and stole what was put into the bag. The money he desired to be entrusted to him, that he might secretly enrich himself. It is clear, however, that the disciples did not at this time know that this was his character, or they would have remonstrated against him. They learned it afterward. We may learn here:<p>1. that it is not a new thing for members of the church to be covetous. Judas was so before them.<p>2. that such members will be those who complain of the great waste in spreading the gospel.<p>3. that this deadly, mean, and grovelling passion will work all evil in a church. It brought down the curse of God on the children of Israel in the case of Achan <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, and it betrayed our Lord to death. It has often since brought blighting on the church; and many a time it has betrayed the cause of Christ, and drowned men in destruction and perdition, <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-11. Crowds of the Jerusalem Jews hastened to Bethany, not so much to see Jesus, whom they knew to be there, as to see dead Lazarus alive; and this, issuing in their accession to Christ, led to a plot against the life of Lazarus also, as the only means of arresting the triumphs of Jesus (see Joh 12:19)&#8212;to such a pitch had these chief priests come of diabolical determination to shut out the light from themselves, and quench it from the earth!<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Bethany was so near to Jerusalem, that many of the Jews came thither, as well to see Lazarus, raised from the dead, as to see Christ: nor was this without the special providence of God, that the name of Christ might be made more famous just before his suffering. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Much of the people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there,....
