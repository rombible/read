Notes on <a href="/context/john/6-70.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?">John 6:70-71</a>. St. Matthew tells us that the question was asked by “the disciples;” St. Mark, that it was asked by “certain persons;” St. John remembers that it was Judas who spoke, and he remembers that his words were characteristic of the man (<a href="/john/12-6.htm" title="This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put therein.">John 12:6</a>). He implies by the form in which he relates these words, that he spoke for himself, and that the others did not join in his feeling.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-11 Christ had formerly blamed Martha for being troubled with much serving. But she did not leave off serving, as some, who when found fault with for going too far in one way, peevishly run too far another way; she still served, but within hearing of Christ's gracious words. Mary gave a token of love to Christ, who had given real tokens of his love to her and her family. God's Anointed should be our Anointed. Has God poured on him the oil of gladness above his fellows, let us pour on him the ointment of our best affections. In Judas a foul sin is gilded over with a plausible pretence. We must not think that those do no acceptable service, who do it not in our way. The reigning love of money is heart-theft. The grace of Christ puts kind comments on pious words and actions, makes the best of what is amiss, and the most of what is good. Opportunities are to be improved; and those first and most vigorously, which are likely to be the shortest. To consult to hinder the further effect of the miracle, by putting Lazarus to death, is such wickedness, malice, and folly, as cannot be explained, except by the desperate enmity of the human heart against God. They resolved that the man should die whom the Lord had raised to life. The success of the gospel often makes wicked men so angry, that they speak and act as if they hoped to obtain a victory over the Almighty himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which should betray him - Greek, "who was to betray him" - that is, who would do it.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

Westcott, however, with a harmonising tendency, says “Judas expressed what others felt”.

Matthew refers the speech to the disciples generally, in whom the suggestion of Judas had stirred up (without guile or blame on their part) a not unnatural inquiry. Mark says "some" murmured to themselves, "Why this waste?" (loss, destruction). John (without the malice which Renan has attributed to the writer) mentions the source of the suggestion, "Judas Iscariot, Simon's son." The word <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, contained in T.R., is omitted here in the best texts. The fact that he was the traitor, being one of the well-known and awful events of the gospel history when John wrote some half a century later, might well be introduced by the evangelist, with no other than a purely historical motive. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Simon's son<p>Omit. </body></html>
