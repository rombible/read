As if he had said, My doctrine, declarations, and promises are so evidently from God, that he who believeth on me, may more properly be said to believe on God, by whose authority and whose word I preach. <span class="ital">And he that seeth me </span>— He that seeth the miracles which I perform, seeth the operation of his power by whom, as man, I act. Or, He that sees me and regards me with a lively faith, <span class="ital">seeth him that sent me </span>— As the perfections of the Father are displayed in me: whereas, he that shuts his eyes against me, excludes the only means of being brought to the true knowledge of the Father. <span class="ital">I am come a light into the world </span>— I am the Sun of righteousness, whose beams dispel the darkness of ignorance, folly, and sin, in which men are involved, and am come to deliver all who believe on me out of that darkness. <span class="ital">And if any man hear my words — </span>Which I am so frequently and continually speaking; <span class="ital">and </span>yet <span class="ital">believe not, I judge him not </span>— Rather, I condemn him not; <span class="ital">for I came not </span>— I am not at present come; <span class="ital">to judge </span>(to condemn) <span class="ital">the world — </span>Or to perform any work of wrath and terror, whatever ill usage I may meet with in it; <span class="ital">but </span>the design of my present appearance is mild, kind, and gracious, and I am come <span class="ital">to save the world </span>— And make its inhabitants happy, in time and in eternity, if they will be so wise as to hearken to the proposals I offer. See! Christ came to save even those that finally perish! Even they are a part of that world which he lived and died to save. <span class="ital">He that rejecteth me, &c., hath one that judgeth him </span>— But though I shall not now execute judgment upon those who hear my doctrine and do not believe and obey it, nevertheless they shall not pass unpunished. <span class="ital">The word that I have spoken shall judge, </span>&c. — For the doctrine which I have preached shall bear witness against them at the day of judgment; and because it has aggravated their sin, it shall heighten their punishment. <span class="ital">For I have not spoken of myself — </span>Either on my own motion, or on any precarious conclusions, drawn from principles divinely taught; <span class="ital">but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment </span>— Gave me ample instructions; <span class="ital">what I should say, and what I should speak </span>— Two words signifying the same thing. The Old Testament prophets sometimes spoke of themselves, but Christ spake by the Holy Spirit at all times. God the Father gave him, 1st, His commission; he sent him, as his agent and plenipotentiary, to concert matters between him and man; to set on foot a treaty of peace, and to settle the articles thereof. 2d, His instructions; which are here called a commandment; for they were like those given to an ambassador, directing him not only what he <span class="ital">may </span>say, but what he <span class="ital">must </span>say. The Messenger of the covenant was intrusted with a message which it was necessary he should deliver. Christ, as <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of man, </span>did not speak that which was of human device or contrivance; and, as <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of God, </span>he did not act separately from, but in perfect union with, his eternal Father. Observe, reader, our Lord Jesus, <span class="ital">though he were a Son, </span>learned obedience himself before he taught it us. <span class="ital">And I know that his commandment — </span>Understood, believed, and obeyed; <span class="ital">is life everlasting </span>— That is, is the way to it, and the beginning of it. <span class="ital">Whatsoever I speak, therefore </span>— Whatsoever I declare in my doctrine to those that hear me; <span class="ital">even as the Father said unto me, so I speak </span>— I alter nothing in the message which he has sent me to deliver. In other words, because I am sensible that the doctrines and precepts which the Father hath commanded me to declare, are the only conditions of eternal life, and that it depends upon the knowledge and observance of them; therefore I have proposed them with the greatest faithfulness, plainness, and confidence. Hence I am worthy of credit; both in respect of my commission, and in respect of the fidelity with which I have executed it. So that the doctrine which I preach should be received as coming from the Father, and you should consider that by rejecting it you will be guilty of despising his authority. Thus, what is contained in this last paragraph appears to be, with St. John, the epilogue of our Lord’s public discourses, and a kind of recapitulation of them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:44-50 Our Lord publicly proclaimed, that every one who believed on him, as his true disciple, did not believe on him only, but on the Father who sent him. Beholding in Jesus the glory of the Father, we learn to obey, love, and trust in him. By daily looking to Him, who came a Light into the world, we are more and more freed from the darkness of ignorance, error, sin, and misery; we learn that the command of God our Saviour is everlasting life. But the same word will seal the condemnation of all who despise it, or neglect it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jesus cried and said - John does not say where or when this was; it is probable, however, that it was a continuation of the discourse recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/12-30.htm">John 12:30-36</a>. Jesus saw their unbelief, and proceeded to state the consequence of believing on him, and of rejecting him and his message.<p>Believeth not on me - That is, not on me alone, or his faith does not terminate on me. Compare <a href="/matthew/10-20.htm">Matthew 10:20</a>; <a href="/mark/9-37.htm">Mark 9:37</a>. It involves, also, belief in him that sent me. Jesus uniformly represents the union between himself and God as so intimate that there could not be faith in him unless there was also faith in God.

Jesus cried&#8212;in a loud tone, and with peculiar solemnity. (Compare Joh 7:37).<p>and said, He that believeth on me, &c.&#8212;This seems to be a supplementary record of some weighty proclamations, for which there had been found no natural place before, and introduced here as a sort of summary and winding up of His whole testimony.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The words, at first view, seem to contain a contradiction, and denying the same act as to the same person; as if any man could believe, and yet not believe on Christ; but there is nothing less in them. By the same figurative way of speaking God tells the prophet Samuel, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you: for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.">1 Samuel 8:7</a></span>, the people had not rejected Samuel, (that is, not Samuel alone), but they had rejected him. So <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/9-37.htm" title="Whoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receives me: and whoever shall receive me, receives not me, but him that sent me.">Mark 9:37</a></span>, <span class="ital">Whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, </span>( that is, not me alone), <span class="ital">but him that sent me.</span> So <span class="bld"><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-8.htm" title="He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given to us his holy Spirit.">1 Thessalonians 4:8</a></span>. Or else thus, He that believeth on me, doth not believe on a mere man, as I appear at present to the world, but he also believeth on God that sent me. The Jews owned one God the Father, and acknowledged him the object of their faith, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/14-1.htm" title="Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, believe also in me.">John 14:1</a></span>, <span class="ital">Ye believe in God; </span> but they were blinded as to Christ, appearing only in the form of a man. So that our Saviour again by these words asserts his Divine nature, his oneness and equality with his Father; so as he was also the object of their faith, as well as his Father. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus cried and said,.... Upon this occasion, on account of the prevailing hardness and unbelief of the Jewish nation, and the non-confession of him by those who did believe him to be the Messiah. He cried with a loud voice, that he might be heard, and his audience left inexcusable; it denotes the concern of his mind, the vehemence of his spirit, and that openness and freedom in which he discharged his ministry, by showing the nature, excellency, and usefulness of believing in him, and the dangerous consequences of unbelief: <p>he that believeth on me, believeth not on me; which is not to be understood simply and absolutely, for this would be a contradiction in terms: they that believe in Christ, do believe in him, and they do right to believe in him; Christ is the object of faith; he is proposed as such in the Gospel; and it is his Father's will, and his own advice, that his people should believe in him: but then those that truly believe in him, do not believe in him as a mere man, but as God, as the Son of God; and not as separate from, or to the exclusion of his Father: nor do they believe in him as a new, or another God, but as the one God with the Father, and the Spirit; for he and his Father are one: nor do they believe in him "only"; and so the Arabic version reads; but in God the Father also: nor does their faith rest in him, but it proceeds through him, as the Mediator unto God; see <a href="/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>. Besides, he is here to be considered in his office capacity, as being sent of God; and he that believes on him as the sent of God, does not so much believe on him, as on the sender of him, as follows: <p>but on him that sent me; just as whatever honour or dishonour are done to an ambassador, sent by an earthly king to a foreign court, are not so much done to the ambassador that is sent, as to the king that sends him; for what is done to him, is all one as if it was personally done to his prince: so he that despises Christ, despises him that sent him; and he that receives Christ, receives him that sent him; and he that believes on Christ, believes on him that sent him; see <a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{11}</span> Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> not on me, but on him that sent me.</span><p>(11) The sum of the gospel, and therefore of salvation, which Christ witnessed in the midst of Jerusalem by his crying out, is this: to rest upon Christ through faith as the only Saviour appointed and given us by the Father.<p>(i) This word not does not take anything away from Christ which is spoken of here, but is rather spoken in way of correction, as if he said, He that believes in me does not so much believe in me as in him that sent me.

These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.">John 12:36</a> is decisive for the correctness of this interpretation, according to which Jesus has departed from the public scene of action without any announcement of His reappearance; and it is confirmed partly by the nature of the following discourse, which contains mere echoes of earlier utterances; partly by the fact that throughout the whole discourse there are no addressed persons present; partly by the aorists, <span class="greekheb">ἐλάλησα</span>, <a href="/context/john/12-48.htm" title="He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day....">John 12:48-49</a>, pointing to the concluded past. This is not in opposition to <span class="greekheb">ἔκραξε καὶ εἶπεν</span> (against Kling, De Wette, Hengstenberg; also Strauss in the interest of the non-originality of the Johannean discourses), since these words (comp. <a href="/john/7-28.htm" title="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.">John 7:28</a>; <a href="/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>, <a href="/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>) do not of themselves more closely define the point of time which is intended. Hence we are neither to assume, with De Wette, that with John the recollection of the discourses of Jesus shaped itself “under his hand” into a discourse, genuine indeed, but never delivered in such language (what unconsciousness and passivity he is thereby charged with! and see, in opposition, Brückner); nor are we to say, with Chrysostom and all the older commentators, also Kling and Hengstenberg, that Jesus here for once did publicly so speak (<span class="greekheb">ἐνδόντος τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις τοῦ θυμοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">πάλιν ἀνεφάνη κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">διδάσκει</span>, Euth.

The portion of the chapter which follows is regarded by most commentators, Lucke, Meyer, Godet, Olshausen, and Westcott, as a summary of our Lord's teaching, as a reiteration by the evangelist of those salient points of the Lord's ministry which, while they are the life of the world, are nevertheless the grounds on which blinded eyes and hardened hearts rejected him. Vers. 44-46 characterize the believer; vers. 47, 48 emphasize Christ's relation to the unbeliever; vers. 49, 50 the principle upon which both deliverances turn and will continue to turn. There are those who think that these were special private addresses to the disciples, uttered after our Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>) was hidden, but the word (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>) "cried aloud," would not then have been used, as it was used for the most public expressions of his doctrine, when given once for all (here comp. <a href="/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28, 37</a>, with <a href="/luke/18-39.htm">Luke 18:39</a>). Keim, De Wette, Baur, and Hilgenfeld think that, because there is no fresh departure here, it is proof that <span class="accented">all</span> the discourses of Christ in John are similarly put together with no historical basis. But if it be so, this differs strangely from all the rest of our Lord's discourses recorded by John in that it has no occasion, or persons, or opportunity to which it seems to fit. Certain aorists suggest the idea that John has here given specimens of our Lord's appeals which had ended in his being rejected by the nation as a whole. Luthardt takes the view of these words being spoken <span class="accented">totidem verbis</span> on our Lord's departure, and with him Hengstenberg also agrees. These critics suppose that they form the closing words of our Lord's public ministry, delayed by the intercalary remarks of the evangelist, and really belong to the close of the thirty-sixth verse. Though the expressions flint follow are built upon the discourses elsewhere uttered, we admit, with Hengstenberg, that there is no verbal parallel that is at all close, and that therefore the evangelist must not be quoting from what he had already reported, but giving the substance of a threefold class of observations found from one end of the Gospel to the other, and in words that he had heard the Master use. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44, 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me,PGBR> <span class="cmt_word">but on him that sent me; and he that beholdeth me, beholdeth him that sent me</span>. These words do not occur before, but in every form our Lord had exalted "him that sent him." His doctrine or teaching, his purpose in manifestation, the secret food that sustained him, the Divine presence that never left him alone, the entire background of the mission of his human will and life into the world, the object of faith to men as revealed in his humanity, and that which the spiritual eye ought to see, nay - if the beholder did but know it does see, constitute an unveiling of the eternal Father who sent him into the world (see <a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>; <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>; <a href="/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17, 18, 29</a>; <a href="/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28, 42</a>; <a href="/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a>; cf. also <a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1, 9, 24</a>). It becomes, then, of high value to grasp the truth. We actually believe in God when believing in him. His mission is lost in the glory of God who appears in him. So far as he is <span class="accented">sent</span>, he was necessarily of lower order and rank than he who sent him. His humanity began to be in time; it was generated in the womb of the Virgin; it was sanctified and sent into the world; and yet through it there was the highest revelation of the Father. We cannot attribute so stupendous a thought to the evangelist, and at the same time we admit the portentous singularity and uniqueness of the consciousness which could thus aver identity of nature with God and the completeness of revelation that the Speaker was making in himself of the Father. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Cried (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>This is not meant to relate a reappearance of Jesus in public. The close of His public ministry is noted at <a href="/john/12-36.htm">John 12:36</a>.

This rendering in <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a> is an error. See <a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a>. The phrase is constantly associated with our Lord. At the same time it is to be noted that it contemplates the Father as the source of the special revelation of Christ, and therefore is not absolutely an exception to the habitual usage. The same is true of <a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a>. </body></html>
