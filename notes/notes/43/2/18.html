The Mosaic legislation contained a warning against the efficiency of the test by signs (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/13-1.htm" title="If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,">Deuteronomy 13:1-3</a>), but it was of the essence of Pharisaism to cling to it (<a href="/matthew/12-38.htm" title="Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from you.">Matthew 12:38</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:">1Corinthians 1:22</a>). It supplied an easy means of rejecting the moral conviction. A sign can only be evidence to the mind open to read the underlying truth. For “an evil and adulterous generation” it has no voice, and they can, after the feeding of the thousands, still demand “What sign showest Thou?” (<a href="/john/6-30.htm" title="They said therefore to him, What sign show you then, that we may see, and believe you? what do you work?">John 6:30</a>). There are bigots of incredulity. Knowledge is dependent upon action and will (comp. <a href="/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>). There is a mental condition which no evidence can convince, for it can always demand more. “If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead” (<a href="/luke/16-31.htm" title="And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.">Luke 16:31</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/2-18.htm" title="Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign show you to us, seeing that you do these things?...">John 2:18-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then answered the Jews </span>— “A fact so public and remarkable as that just mentioned, could not but immediately come to the knowledge of the priests and rulers of the Jews, whose supreme council sat in a magnificent chamber belonging to the temple;” some of them, therefore, <span class="ital">said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing thou doest these things </span>— That is, to prove thyself authorized and commissioned to do them? This they ask because it belonged only to the magistrate, as being God’s minister and vicegerent, or to a prophet, to reform abuses in God’s worship. The authority of the magistrate they knew Christ had not, for acting as he had done; and if he alleged that he acted as a prophet, they require him to give them proof of his being such, by some miracle or prediction, to be accomplished before their eyes. But was not the thing itself a sufficient sign? His ability to drive so many from their posts, without opposition, was surely a proof of his authority to do it: he that was armed by such a divine power, must have been armed with a divine commission. The truth is, they required a miracle to confirm a miracle! This unreasonable demand Jesus did not think proper to grant them; but refers them to the miracle of his resurrection: which, however, he does in such obscure terms, as prejudiced minds could not understand, till the prediction was cleared and explained by the event. <span class="ital">Jesus answered, Destroy this temple </span>— Pointing probably to his body, which, with the greatest propriety, he called a temple, on account of the divinity residing in it. By a like figure of speech, the apostle calls the bodies of believers <span class="ital">the temples of God. </span>When Christ said, <span class="ital">Destroy this temple, </span>he meant, You will be permitted to destroy it, and you will destroy it: for at the very beginning of his ministry he had a clear foresight of all his sufferings, and of his death at the end of it; and yet he went on cheerfully in his work. Observe, reader, our Lord spake thus to them in parables because they were willingly ignorant, and shut their eyes against the clear light issuing from his life, his doctrine, and his miracles. For they that will not see shall not see; but shall stumble and fall, and be broken, and snared, and taken, <a href="/context/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem....">Isaiah 8:14-15</a>. Accordingly, the figurative speech here used by our Lord, proved such a stumbling-block to them, that it was produced in evidence against him at his trial, to prove him a blasphemer, <a href="/context/matthew/26-60.htm" title="But found none: yes, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,...">Matthew 26:60-61</a>. Had they, in humility, asked him the meaning of what he said, he would have informed them, and it would have been <span class="ital">a savour of life unto life to them; </span>but they resolved to cavil, and it proved <span class="ital">a savour of death unto death. </span>They that would not be convinced were hardened, and the manner of the expression of this prediction occasioned the accomplishment of the prediction itself. In his saying, <span class="ital">In three days I will raise it up </span>— Our Lord not only foretold his resurrection, but that it should he effected by his own power. There were others that were raised at different times from the dead, but Christ was the only person that ever raised himself! They, supposing that he spake of the temple in which they were standing, replied, <span class="ital">Forty and six years was this temple in building </span>— Dr. Lightfoot computes that it was just forty-six years from the founding of Zerubbabel’s temple, in the second year of Cyrus, to the complete settlement of the temple service, in the thirty- second year of Artaxerxes. The original expression, however, <span class="greekheb">ωκοδομηθη ο ναος ουτος</span>, instead of, <span class="ital">was this temple in building, </span>is translated by Doddridge, Heylin, and Worsley, <span class="ital">hath been building, </span>“proceeding on the supposition, that those who made this reply alluded to the additional buildings which the temple had received, and which had been begun by Herod, and continued by those who succeeded him in the government of Judea, to the time then present. But let it be observed, that the Jews never did, nor do to this day, speak of more than two temples possessed by their fathers; the first built by Solomon, the second by Zerubbabel. The great additions made by Herod, were considered as intended only for decorating and repairing the edifice, not for rebuilding it; for, in fact, Zerubbabel’s temple had not then been destroyed. Nor need we, I think, puzzle ourselves to make out exactly the <span class="ital">forty-six </span>years spoken of. Those men were evidently in the humour of exaggerating, in order to represent to the people as absurd what they had immediately heard advanced by our Lord. In this disposition, we may believe, they would not hesitate to include the years in which the work was interrupted, among the years employed in building.” — Campbell. <span class="ital">But he spake of the temple of his body </span>— And therefore they were entirely mistaken as to the sense of what he said; <span class="ital">When, therefore, he was risen from the dead </span>— Just on the third day after his crucifixion; <span class="ital">his disciples remembered that he had said this </span>— Which, when they heard him utter it, they did not at all understand; <span class="ital">and they believed the Scripture, </span>&c. — As they believed the Scriptures, which predicted the Messiah’s death, so they believed the more firmly in their Master on account of this prophecy, which, by foretelling his resurrection so long beforehand, rendered that event, when it happened, a most illustrious proof of his mission from God. Dr. Campbell translates the clause, <span class="ital">They understood the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken; </span>observing, that the word <span class="greekheb">πιστευειν</span>, in the sacred writers, sometimes signifies, not so much <span class="ital">to believe, </span>as <span class="ital">to apprehend </span>aright. “In this sense, it is once and again employed by this writer in particular. It is not intimated here, that the disciples did not, before this time, <span class="ital">believe </span>the Scriptures, or their Master’s word: but that they did not, till now, <span class="ital">rightly apprehend </span>the meaning of either, in relation to this subject. Another instance of this application of the verb <span class="greekheb">πιστευω</span>, we have <a href="/john/3-12.htm" title="If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?">John 3:12</a>.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:12-22 The first public work in which we find Christ engaged, was driving from the temple the traders whom the covetous priests and rulers encouraged to make a market-place of its courts. Those now make God's house a house of merchandise, whose minds are filled with cares about worldly business when attending religious exercises, or who perform Divine offices for love of gain. Christ, having thus cleansed the temple, gave a sign to those who demanded it, to prove his authority for so doing. He foretells his death by the Jews' malice, Destroy ye this temple; I will permit you to destroy it. He foretells his resurrection by his own power; In three days I will raise it up. Christ took again his own life. Men mistake by understanding that according to the letter, which the Scripture speaks by way of figure. When Jesus was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered he has said this.

For this seemeth to have been their principle, that let corruptions and abuses in a church be never so great, yet they were not to be reformed, but either by the ordinary authority of the magistrate, or by all extraordinary authority from God.

But John’s explanation is abandoned, since the time of Herder (<span class="ital">vom Sohne Gottes</span>) and Henke (<span class="ital">Programm</span> 1798, in Pott, <span class="ital">Sylloge</span>, I. p. 8 ff.), by Eckermann, Paulus, Lücke, Schweizer, Bleek, B. Crusius, Ammon, Strauss, Gfrörer, De Wette, Ewald, Weizsacker, Schenkel, Scholten, and many others, who, with various modifications, explain the pulling down of the temple of the <span class="ital">decay of the old temple religion</span>, and the setting up in three days of <span class="ital">the new spiritual theocracy</span> so soon to be established; thus the imperative is taken by some as a challenge (as above) (Herder, Henke, Ewald), by some again as a concession (Schenkel), and by some as an hypothesis (Lücke, B. Crusius, De Wette: “Granted that ye destroy”)—according to De Wette, with allusion perhaps to the late partial pulling down of the temple by Herod. But (1) before we can assume that John of all men, who yet elsewhere was so deeply imbued with the mind of Jesus, wholly misunderstood Him, and that too at the time when he wrote his Gospel, when, consequently, the old degenerate religion had been long ago overthrown, and the new spiritual sanctuary long ago set up,—the most decisive evidence of such a misunderstanding is requisite. If this be not forthcoming, we are bound to seek the <span class="ital">true</span>, interpretation of any saying of Jesus from <span class="ital">him</span>, and especially <span class="ital">in this case</span>, where he distinctly gives his own explanation <span class="ital">in opposition</span> to the misconception of the Jews, and gives it not only as <span class="ital">his own</span>, but as that of <span class="ital">the rest of the disciples</span> likewise. (2) The accusation in <a href="/matthew/26-61.htm" title="And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.">Matthew 26:61</a>, <a href="/mark/14-58.htm" title="We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.">Mark 14:58</a> (comp. <a href="/acts/6-13.htm" title="And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:">Acts 6:13</a>) is no argument in favour of the modern interpretation, for it is based only upon the Jewish misunderstanding of the saying. (3) The place and occasion alike suggested the temple as an <span class="ital">illustration</span>, but they determined nothing as to the <span class="ital">subject-matter</span> of the comparison; a <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> in general was asked for, not one <span class="ital">bearing specially upon the temple</span>. (4) The setting up of the spiritual temple was an event not at all dependent upon a <span class="ital">previous</span> <span class="greekheb">λύειν</span> of the old economy; on the contrary, a beginning had already been made, the further development of which was not the effect but the cause (the fermenting element) of the dissolution of the old theocracy: hence the relation of the protasis to the apodosis of the sentence would be neither logically nor historically correct. (5) This spiritual building up was so far from being a momentary act, and was to so great a degree a gradual development, that neither the conception of a <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΗΜΕῖΟΝ</span></span></span> in general, nor the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΤΡΙΣῚΝ ἩΜΈΡΑΙς</span></span></span>, which belong essentially to this conception, have any corresponding relation thereto; the latter expression, even if taken in a proverbial sense (<a href="/hosea/6-2.htm" title="After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.">Hosea 6:2</a>, not <a href="/luke/13-32.htm" title="And he said to them, Go you, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.">Luke 13:32</a>; but see Dissen <span class="ital">ad Dem. de cor</span>. p. 362), could only mean “<span class="ital">in a few days</span>,” and therefore would be quite unsuited to the comparison, and would even have the appearance of grandiloquence. Moreover, as the <span class="ital">three days</span> joined to the <span class="greekheb">ἐγερῶ</span> were always the <span class="ital">fixed</span> correlative of Christ’s <span class="ital">resurrection</span>, this ought itself to have excluded the modern explanation. (6) A new temple would of necessity have been spoken of as <span class="ital">another</span> (comp. <a href="/mark/14-58.htm" title="We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.">Mark 14:58</a>), but <span class="greekheb">ἐγερῶ αὐτόν</span> can only mean the <span class="ital">same;</span> and thus the Jews as well as John rightly understood it, for Jesus did not say <span class="greekheb">ἐγερῶ ἄλλον</span> or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἝΤΕΡΟΝ</span></span></span>, or the like.[144] (7) It is only a seeming objection to John’s explanation, that according to N. T. theology Christ did not raise Himself from the dead, but was raised by the Father; comp. <a href="/john/2-22.htm" title="When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this to them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.">John 2:22</a>; <a href="/acts/2-24.htm" title="Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held of it.">Acts 2:24</a>; <a href="/acts/2-31.htm" title="He seeing this before spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.">Acts 2:31</a> ff., <a href="/acts/3-15.htm" title="And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.">Acts 3:15</a>; <a href="/acts/4-10.htm" title="Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him does this man stand here before you whole.">Acts 4:10</a>; <a href="/acts/5-30.htm" title="The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.">Acts 5:30</a>, <span class="ital">al.;</span> <a href="/romans/4-24.htm" title="But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;">Romans 4:24</a>; <a href="/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.">1 Corinthians 6:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-21.htm" title="Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.">1 Peter 1:21</a>. Any such contradiction to the Christian mode of view, if real, must have prevented John himself above every one from referring the words to the resurrection. But the objection disappears if we simply give due weight to the figurative nature of the expression, which rests upon that visible contemplation of the <span class="ital">resurrection</span>, according to which the <span class="ital">Subject</span> that arises, whose resurrection is described as the re-erecting of the destroyed temple, must also be the Subject that erects the temple,—without affecting the further doctrine, which, moreover, does not come under consideration, that the <span class="ital">causa efficiens, i.e</span>. the actual revivifying power, is the father. Christ receiving His life again from the Father (<a href="/john/10-17.htm" title="Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.">John 10:17</a>) and rising again, Himself raises up by His very resurrection the destroyed temple.

John, at least, saw the rising storm of enmity already hurtling, but says nothing. Nevertheless, as if in reply to the imperial prophetic act (which corresponded with John the Baptist's prediction of One who would come axe in hand), the Jews approached with answer (of., for this use of the word "answer," <a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>; <a href="/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>; <a href="/mark/11-14.htm">Mark 11:14</a>). The "answer" here is in the form of a question, which shows that they had not recognized the sign he had already given, that this temple was his "Father's house," and that he had solemnly claimed the authority of "Son" over the house. <span class="cmt_word">What sign showest thou, because</span> (or, <span class="accented">seeing that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thou doest these things?</span> (cf. <a href="/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>, etc.; <a href="/john/6-30.htm">John 6:30</a>). Thou art bound to give us some "sign" that thou hast a right to deal thus with established customs and to assume the position of a public reformer. Upon what does thine (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) authority rest? Give us some miraculous proof of these high assumptions, "seeing that (<span class="accented">quatenus</span>) thou art doing these things," whose consequences are now so conspicuous. It might be supposed that the extraordinary effect just produced upon the crowd of traffickers was sufficient proof of power, if not of authority. The Jews were within their right in asking for these authentications; but their continuous demand for outward signs is one of the conspicuous features of their character (<a href="/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>). In the fundamental nature of a "sign" there is a hint of the true solution of the enigmatical saying which is the first public utterance of our Lord. He gave to the act which he was about to perform the characteristic of a "sign." It would be an outward and visible manifestation of a stupendous spiritual event. This, among other reasons, refutes the modern speculation of Herder, Ewald, Lucke, Renan, and even of Neander, Geikie, and others, that the evangelist was wrong in the explanation of this remarkable saying which he offered in the twenty-first verse. John, who, better than modern commentators can do, ought to have known what the Lord meant, declares that Jesus was speaking of "the temple of his body" when, as the context shows, he was vindicating his right to cleanse the existing temple; and by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "this sanctuary," he was also pointing to and referring in some sense to the temple structure in the midst of which he and the Jews were standing. The commentators have said, "John was wrong, and was led astray by his own fancies. There was no reference to the death or resurrection of Christ. The Lord meant," say they, "as follows: 'Persist in your lawless, irreverent, unbelieving treatment of the temple, and so destroy it. Let it cease by this handling of yours from being a temple, and I will prove my right to cleanse it, and to reform, rebuke, or condemn your immoral practices in it, by building it again, or rather erecting a spiritual temple, a temple without hands, and in three days, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a short time after you have consummated your impiety, I will complete my restorative work - I will build a new temple and fill it with my glory.'" If John had not appended the twenty-first verse, "Howbeit he spake concerning the temple of his body," the above interpretation would deserve very close attention and perhaps acceptance. But there are sundry difficulties in it, even if the evangelist had not supplied the true key: - <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Christ does not say, "I will raise up 'another' temple or a 'spiritual' temple on the ruins of the old;" but "I will raise <span class="accented">it</span> up," viz. the temple which I challenge you to "destroy." Though <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "in three days," is used in this indefinite sense, in Hosea (<a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>, LXX.), yet it is the accepted term for the period of three days, which counted from the death to the resurrection of the Lord, and which in the synoptic Gospels (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>) is distinctly foretold to be the great "sign" given to that generation. Moreover, from the Jewish misunderstanding of the words which appear in the synoptic narrative, viz. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "during three days," the literal character of the time specified had laid hold, not only of the disciples, but of the multitude. Again, the erection of the spiritual temple would not be an <span class="accented">outward and visible sign</span> of the grace and authority of the Lord; but rather the great spiritual reality itself - invisible indeed, and requiring signs to manliest and demonstrate its own occurrence and existence. We conclude, then, that the apostle knew better than his critics, and that we are to believe that, when the Lord said to the Jews, <span class="cmt_word">Destroy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, dissolve, break up) <span class="cmt_word">this temple</span>, "he was speaking of the temple of his body," and at the same time linking and identifying the two temples, relating the one to the other so closely that the destruction of his body became <span class="accented">ipso facto</span> the demolition of the temple character of the building where they then stood. The temple of stone and gold, of stately decoration and ceremonial, derived all its true meaning from its being the gorgeous crystallization of a Divine idea embodied in his life. The temple had no value save as a meeting place for God and man, where by sacrifice and worship man might approach the Father, who declared himself to be reconciled, long suffering, and yet just. The Lord has come to the temple, but was himself  One holier and "greater than the temple." <span class="accented">God</span> is manifested in the glory of that holy life, and man is set forth also in Christ's perfect high-priestly approach to and commerce with the excellent glory. The Lord knows that he is the Lamb, and the only begotten Son of God, and he knows also that his death is part of the awful method in which the vast designs of his righteous love will be secured. He has a baptism to be baptized with, and he is straitened until it be accomplished. He anticipates the end. As he said afterwards to Judas, "That thou doest do quickly;" so at this moment he said, <span class="cmt_word">Destroy this temple</span> (of my body), and you will destroy therein the temple character of this historic embodiment of a grand prophetic hope; and <span class="cmt_word">I will raise it up,</span> viz. - the temple of my body - <span class="cmt_word">in three days</span> (not, I will raise it by quiet, unobserved, spirit processes in the souls of men, but) the very temple which you will bring down shall henceforth be the living and eternal temple of all the glory of God and all the possibilities of man. The great bulk of expositors of many types, who do not repudiate St. John's own words, see thus (with more or less of a double reference in it) the first main significance of the enigma. Whether our Lord pointed to his own Person as he uttered these words cannot be determined. It is said by some - If he had done so, all ambiguity would have been removed, and the misunderstanding which followed would have been impossible! Surely the Jews were not usually ready to receive parabolic truth of this kind so readily, and after their fashion were almost sure to misconceive and falsely to misrepresent it. Even the disciples did not see into its meaning until after the Resurrection (ver. 22). How could they? Verily, then, and not till then, was it seen that the sign of the Prophet Jonas had been given to that generation. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Answered<p>Often used in reply to an objection or criticism, or to something present in another's mind, as <a href="//biblehub.com/john/19-7.htm">John 19:7</a>, or <a href="//biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>, where Jesus answers with reference to the error in Nicodemus' mind, rather than in direct reply to his address.<p>Destroy this temple (&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Destroy, Literally, loosen.
