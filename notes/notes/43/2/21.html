Those now make God's house a house of merchandise, whose minds are filled with cares about worldly business when attending religious exercises, or who perform Divine offices for love of gain. Christ, having thus cleansed the temple, gave a sign to those who demanded it, to prove his authority for so doing. He foretells his death by the Jews' malice, Destroy ye this temple; I will permit you to destroy it. He foretells his resurrection by his own power; In three days I will raise it up. Christ took again his own life. Men mistake by understanding that according to the letter, which the Scripture speaks by way of figure. When Jesus was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered he has said this. It helps much in understanding the Divine word, to observe the fulfilling of the Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then said the Jews ... - The Jews, either from the ambiguity of his language, or more probably from a design to cavil, understood him as speaking of the temple at Jerusalem. What he said here is all the evidence that they could adduce on his trial <a href="/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/14-58.htm">Mark 14:58</a>, and they reproached him with it when on the cross, <a href="/matthew/27-40.htm">Matthew 27:40</a>. The Jews frequently perverted our Saviour's meaning. The language which he used was often that of parables or metaphor; and as they Sought to misunderstand him and pervert his language, so he often left them to their own delusions, as he himself says, "that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand," <a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13</a>. This was a case which they "might," if they had been disposed, have easily understood. They were in the temple; the conversation was about the temple; and though he probably pointed to his body, or designated it in some plain way, yet they chose to understand him as referring to the temple itself; and as it appeared so improbable that he could raise up that in three days, they sought to pervert his words and pour ridicule on his pretensions.<p>Forty and six years ... - The temple in which they then were was that which was commonly called "the second temple," built after the return of the Jews from Babylon. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>. This temple Herod the Great commenced repairing, or began to rebuild, in the eighteenth year of his reign - that is, sixteen years before the birth of Christ (Jos. 'Ant.,' b. xv. Section 1). The main body of the temple he completed in "nine years and a half" (Jos. 'Ant.,' xv. 5, 6), yet the temple, with its outbuildings, was not entirely complete in the time of our Saviour. Herod continued to ornament it and to perfect it even until the time of Agrippa (Jos. 'Ant.,' b. xx. chapter viii. Section 11). As Herod began to rebuild the temple sixteen years before the birth of Jesus, and as what is here mentioned happened in the thirtieth year of the age of Jesus, so the time which had been occupied in it was "forty-six years." This circumstance is one of the many in the New Testament which show the accuracy of the evangelists, and which prove that they were well acquainted with what they recorded. It demonstrates that their narration is true. Impostors do not trouble themselves to be very accurate about names and dates, and there is nothing in which they are more liable to make mistakes.<p>Wilt thou ... - This is an expression of contempt. Herod, with all his wealth and power, had been engaged in this work almost half a century. Can you, an obscure and unknown Galilean, accomplish it in three days? The thing, in their judgment, was ridiculous, and showed, as "they" supposed, that he had no authority to do what he had done in the temple. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. temple of his body&#8212;in which was enshrined the glory of the eternal Word. (See on [1773]Joh 1:14). By its resurrection the true Temple of God upon earth was reared up, of which the stone one was but a shadow; so that the allusion is not quite exclusively to Himself, but takes in that Temple of which He is the foundation, and all believers are the "lively stones." (1Pe 2:4, 5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> But, alas, our Saviour spoke not of their material temple, but of the temple of his body; which yet was proper speaking: for if the apostle calleth our bodies <span class="ital">the temple of God, </span> as he doth, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a> 6:19 <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2 Corinthians 6:16</a></span>; it much more may be said so of the body of Christ: for as God dwelt in the temple, and there revealed his will, and would be there worshipped; how properly must the notion of <span class="ital">the temple</span> agree to Christ, in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwelt bodily, <span class="bld"><a href="/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a></span>, who revealeth his Father’s nature and will to men, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/11-27.htm" title="All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.">Matthew 11:27</a></span>, and in whom all must worship him?
