It is natural that an eyewitness should remember the number and know roughly their size. There were six of them, containing about twenty gallons apiece; but hidden meanings referring to the number or the quantity are brought to the text, not derived from it. The measure rendered “firkin” is <span class= "ital">metretes,</span> which is used for the Hebrew, “bath” in <a href="/2_chronicles/4-5.htm" title="And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.">2Chronicles 4:5</a>. This (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> viii. 2, § 9) gives nearly nine gallons as the value of the “firkin,” which multiplied by two or three gives the contents of each pitcher as from about eighteen to twenty-seven gallons; or, approximately, from 100 to 150 gallons for the whole. Our own word “firkin” is probably “a little fourth,” and equal to nine gallons, or the fourth of a barrel (comp. Tierce, which is one-third). It is used only here in the Bible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/john/2-6.htm" title="And there were set there six water pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.">John 2:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">There were six water-pots of stone — </span>Which were placed there, some of them for the cleansing of cups and tables, &c., and others for such purifications as required the immersion of the whole body; <span class="ital">after the manner of the purifying of the Jews </span>— Who were accustomed to purify themselves by frequent washings, particularly before eating; <span class="ital">containing two or three firkins apiece </span>— A large quantity, but exactly how much, is not now easy to be ascertained. The original word, <span class="greekheb">μετρητας</span>, here used, is translated by Dr. Campbell <span class="ital">baths, </span>because the Hebrew measure, <span class="ital">bath, </span>is thus rendered in the Septuagint, <a href="/2_chronicles/4-5.htm" title="And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.">2 Chronicles 4:5</a>. He acknowledges, however, that this is not a decisive proof that it ought to be so rendered: but says, “I have not found any thing better in support of a different opinion. Some think, that as <span class="greekheb">μετρητης </span>was also the name of an Attic measure, the evangelist (most of whose readers were probably Greeks) must have referred to it, as best known in that country. There are other suppositions made, but hardly any thing more than conjecture has been advanced in favour of any of them. It ought not to be dissembled, that in most of the explanations which have been given of the passage, the quantity of liquor appears so great as to reflect an improbability on the interpretation.” The doctor observes, however, that the English translation is more liable to this objection than his version, the <span class="ital">firkin </span>containing nine gallons, whereas the bath is commonly rated at seven and a half, and, according to some, but four and a half; in which case the amount of the whole is but half of what the English translation makes it. The quantity thus reduced, he thinks, will not be thought so enormous, considering 1st, The length of time, commonly a week, spent in feasting on such occasions, and the great concourse of people which they were wont to assemble. To this may be added, that whatever the quantity of water contained in these water-pots might be, there is no proof that our Lord turned the whole of it into wine, or that he turned into wine any of it, any otherwise than as it was drawn out.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 It is very desirable when there is a marriage, to have Christ own and bless it. Those that would have Christ with them at their marriage, must invite him by prayer, and he will come. While in this world we sometimes find ourselves in straits, even when we think ourselves in fulness. There was want at a marriage feast. Those who are come to care for the things of the world, must look for trouble, and count upon disappointment. In our addresses to Christ, we must humbly spread our case before him, and then refer ourselves to him to do as he pleases. In Christ's reply to his mother there was no disrespect. He used the same word when speaking to her with affection from the cross; yet it is a standing testimony against the idolatry of after-ages, in giving undue honours to his mother. His hour is come when we know not what to do. Delays of mercy are not denials of prayer. Those that expect Christ's favours, must observe his orders with ready obedience. The way of duty is the way to mercy; and Christ's methods must not be objected against. The beginning of Moses' miracles was turning water into blood, Ex 7:20; the beginning of Christ's miracles was turning water into wine; which may remind us of the difference between the law of Moses and the gospel of Christ. He showed that he improves creature-comforts to all true believers, and make them comforts indeed. And Christ's works are all for use. Has he turned thy water into wine, given thee knowledge and grace? it is to profit withal; therefore draw out now, and use it. It was the best wine. Christ's works commend themselves even to those who know not their Author. What was produced by miracles, always was the best in its kind. Though Christ hereby allows a right use of wine, he does not in the least do away his own caution, which is, that our hearts be not at any time overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, Lu 21:34. Though we need not scruple to feast with our friends on proper occasions, yet every social interview should be so conducted, that we might invite the Redeemer to join with us, if he were now on earth; and all levity, luxury, and excess offend him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Six water-pots of stone - Made of stone; or, as we should say, stoneware.<p>After the manner - After the usual custom.<p>Of the purifying - Of the "washings" or ablutions of the Jews.

For the contents of these vessels, it is uncertain; the reason is, because the Jewish measures, both for things dry and liquid, are much unknown to us, most countries varying in their measures. According to our measures, these vessels should contain three hogsheads, or near it; but it is not probable that so great vessels of stone should stand in a room: the end of their standing there was for the people to wash in, before they did eat, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/15-2.htm" title="Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.">Matthew 15:2</a> <a href="/mark/7-3.htm" title="For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.">Mark 7:3</a></span>, and to wash their vessels in, <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/7-4.htm" title="And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not.

The Attic metretes contained 12 <span class="greekheb">χόες</span> or 144 <span class="greekheb">κοτύλαι</span>, 1½ Roman amphorae, i.e. about 21 Würtemburg measures (see Wurm, de ponderum etc. rationib. 126), and about 33 Berlin quarts, in weight eighty pounds of water [about 87/8 gallons] (Bertheau, Gesch. d. Israel, p. 77). Comp. Böckh, Staatshaush. I. 127; Hermann, Privatalterth. § 46. 10. Each pitcher contained two or three metretae (which are not, with Ammon, to be referred to a smaller measure, nor even, with Ebrard, to that of an amphora); for as a row of six pitchers is named, <span class="greekheb">ἀνά</span> can, consistently with the context, only be taken in a distributive sense, not in the signification—which is, besides, linguistically untenable (see Winer, p. 372 [E. T. pp. 496–7])—of circiter, according to which all six must have held only about two or three metretae (Paulus, Hug). The great quantity of water thus turned into wine (252–378 Würtemburg measures, 106–160 gallons) seems out of all proportion, and is used by Strauss and Schweizer to impugn the historic character of the narrative; but it is conceivable if we consider the character of the miracle as one of blessing (compare the miraculous Feedings), and that we are to suppose that what was left over may have been intended by Jesus as a present for the married pair, while the possible abuse of it during the feast itself was prevented by the presence of the Giver. We must also bear in mind that the quantity was suggested to Him by the six pitchers standing there; and therefore, if the blessed Wonder worker had not merely to measure the amount of the need, He had occasion all the more not to keep within the exact quantity which the circumstances demanded, by changing the contents of only one or two pitchers into wine, and omitting the rest. The blessing conferred by the Wonderworker has also, considering the circumstances, its appropriateness and decorum, in keeping with which He was not to act in a spirit of calculation, but, on the contrary, to give plentifully, especially when, as was here the case, this abundance was suggested by the vessels which were standing there.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/2-6.htm" title="And there were set there six water pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.">John 2:6</a>. There were there, hard by or in the feast-room, there were <span class="greekheb">ὑδρίαι λίθιναι ἓξ κείμεναι</span>, “six stone water jars standing”. Stone was believed to preserve the purity and coolness of the water. [According to Plutarch, <span class="ital">Tib. Gracchus</span>, these jars were sometimes used for drawing lots, wooden tablets being put in the jars and shaken.] Similar stone jars are still used in Cana and elsewhere. They were <span class="greekheb">κείμεναι</span>, set; “in purely classical Greek <span class="greekheb">κεῖμαι</span> is the recognised passive perfect of <span class="greekheb">τίθεμαι</span>” (Holden, Plutarch’s <span class="ital">Themist.</span>, p. 121).—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν καθαρισμὸν τῶν Ἰουδαίων</span>.

The number and size are given that the dimensions of the miracle may appear. There were six <span class="greekheb">χωροῦσαι ἀνὰ μετρητὰς δύο ἢ τρεῖς</span>, “holding two or three firkins each”.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνὰ</span> is here distributive, a classical use; <span class="ital">cf.</span> also <a href="/context/matthew/20-9.htm" title="And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny....">Matthew 20:9-10</a>, <a href="/mark/6-40.htm" title="And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.">Mark 6:40</a>. Accordingly the Vulgate translates “capientes singulae metretas binas”. The Attic <span class="greekheb">μετρητής</span> held about nine gallons, so that averaging the jars at twenty gallons the six would together contain 120 gallons. The English translation has <span class="ital">firkin</span>, that is, <span class="ital">vierkin</span>, the fourth of a barrel, a barrel being thirty imperial gallons. It is difficult to assign any reason for giving the number and capacity of these jars, except that the writer wished to convey the idea that their entire contents were changed into wine. This prodigality would bring the miracle into closer resemblance to the gifts of nature. Also it would furnish proof, after the marriage was over, that the transformation had been actual. The wedding guests had not dreamt it. There was the wine. It was no mesmeric trick.

With these seventy priests were filled, besides women and children.

Nor is there any doubt but that the remains left over were large. On this analogy the 15 metretæ in Cana could have sufficed for the giving drink to more than 175 men, besides women and children, certainly not fewer; for giving food to whom, 30 artabæ (a Persian measure = 1 medimnus + 2 chœnices) or 1530 chœnices, and 100 sheep, would be needed. I say purposely, on this analogy; and also, presently after, I refer the words, for giving food to whom, to the words, more than 175, not to 175; and thereby the word more itself is much enlarged in its meaning. Comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/8-22.htm" title="I command you also, that ye require no tax, nor any other imposition, of any of the priests, or Levites, or holy singers, or porters, or ministers of the temple, or of any that have doings in this temple, and that no man have authority to impose any thing upon them.">1Es 8:22</a> (20). Matt. Hostus shows that 12 metretæ (at Frankfort on the Oder) are 7773/5 nossellæ; but that 18 metretæ are 11662/5 nossellæ: thus the mean between for 15 metret145 will be 972 nossellæ.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there were</span> (<span class="accented">set</span>, or) <span class="cmt_word">placed there six water pots of stone, after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.</span> Stone was often used for these receptacles, as more calculated to preserve the purity of the water (Wunsche refers to 'Beza,' 2:2; Westcott quotes 'Sofa,'  4; Barclay, in his translation of 'Mishna,' &sect; 17, enumerates earthenware and other material as lawful). It is interesting that these stone jars are still used in this very neighbourhood for like purposes ('Pict. Palestine'). This large number of jars of considerable magnitude was doubtless due in part to the number of the guests, and to the scrupulous attention to ceremonial purity that was enjoined by the oral law (see 'Mishna,' &sect; 17; and Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). They were accustomed to wash, not only the hands, but "cups, brazen vessels, and tables" (see <a href="/matthew/15-2.htm">Matthew 15:2</a> and parallel passages). (For this use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, see <a href="/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>, in which "according to" easily passes into the sense of "for the sake of, after the manner of.") The Attic measure <span class="accented">metretes</span> was equal to the Hebrew <span class="accented">bath</span> (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 8:02. 9), and stands for it in the LXX. of <a href="/2_chronicles/4-5.htm">2 Chronicles 4:5</a>, and this equalled 1.5 Roman <span class="accented">amphorae</span>, 8 gallons + 7.5 pints. So that six jars containing 2 or 3 metretes, say 2.5   =   6 x 2.5 x 8 gallons + 7.5 pints   =   6 x 2.5 &times; 71.5 pints   =   134 gallons and a fraction. The jars may have differed in shape, according as they were adapted for different purposes; but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span> must be translated distributively, and we cannot evade the enormous capacity of the jars, and therefore the abundance of the gift thus provided. Various efforts have been made to reduce the extent of the provision; but the obvious implication of the narrative is that the six jars were the <span class="accented">locale</span> of the miracle. Dr. Moulton and Dr. Westcott suggest that these water pots were filled with pure water, but that the wine was "drawn" from the water supply to which the servants had access, and that no more wine was provided than that which was borne to the governor of the feast. Others have supposed that simply the water <span class="accented">drawn</span> from the jars was transformed in the process. These suppositions make the entire reference to the water pots extremely obscure and unnecessary. The large quantity of wine thus offered to these humble folks corresponds with the affluence of Nature in all her moods - the munificence of spring blossoms, the harvest of the sea, the exuberance of sunlight, the superfluity of rain that falls on the oceans, the copiousness of all God's ways. When, on other occasions, the Lord added to the supplies of food in fishes and bread, his lavish abundance corresponds with the riches of his loving kindness on this occasion. There was provided, not the material for a meal, but an ample dowry for such a bride. No mere magical change, momentarily confounding perception and leaving no trace behind, but a supply which would be a standing proof of the reality of what had been done. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Water-pots (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Used by John only, and only in the Gospel, <a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7</a>; <a href="/john/4-28.htm">John 4:28</a>.
