It means to put "trust" or "confidence in." Jesus did not put "trust" or "reliance" in them. He did not leave himself in their hands. He acted cautiously and prudently. The proper time for him to die had not come, and he secured his own safety. The reason why he did not commit himself to them is "that he knew all men." He knew the "inconstancy" and "fickleness" of the multitude. He knew how easily they might be turned against him by the Jewish leaders, and how unsafe he would be if they should be moved to sedition and tumult. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. did not commit&#8212;"entrust," or let Himself down familiarly to them, as to His genuine disciples.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Christ did not take all these seeming believers into his bosom, nor call them after him, nor maintain any familiar fellowship and communion with them; but made haste again into Galilee, till his time was come, knowing that in so public a place of danger they were not to be trusted; for being God blessed for ever, he had knowledge of the hearts of all men. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Jesus did not commit himself unto them,.... The sense according to some of the ancients is, that he did not commit the whole of the Gospel to them; he did not make known to them all his mind and will; this he only did to the twelve apostles, his special disciples and friends; nor was the time come, that he would make known, or have made known, the things concerning his person, office, obedience, sufferings, death, and resurrection from the dead: but rather the meaning is, that he did not trust himself with these persons, who believed in him, on the basis of his miracles; he did not take them into the number of his associates; he did not admit them to intimacy with him; nor did he freely converse with them, or make any long stay among them; but soon withdrew himself from hence, and went into other parts of Judea, and into Galilee: <p>because he knew all men: good and bad: all openly profane sinners, and all their actions; not only their more public ones, but those that are done in the dark, and which are the most secretly devised, and levelled against the saints; and he so knew them, as to bring them into judgment: and all good men, true believers; he knows their persons, as they are his Father's choice, his gift of them to him, his own purchase, and as called by his grace; and so as to distinguish them at the last day, and give up the full account of every one of them to his Father: he knows the worst of them, the sin that dwells in them, their daily infirmities, their secret personal sins; their family sins, both of omission and commission; and their church sins, or which are committed in the house of God; and takes notice of them, so as to resent them, and chastise them for them; he knows the best of them, their graces, their faith, hope, love, patience, humility, self-denial, &amp;c; he knows their good works, and all their weaknesses and their wants: and he knows all nominal professors, on what basis they take up their profession, and what trust they place in it; he can distinguish between grace and mere profession, and discern the secret lusts which such indulge, and the springs and progress of their apostasy: he knew all these men, that upon seeing his miracles, professed at this time to believe in him; he knew the hypocrisy and dissimulation of some of them; and he knew the notions they had of a temporal Messiah, and the temporal views they had in believing in him; and their design to set him up as a temporal prince, as some afterwards would have done: knew the flashy affections of others, who were like John's hearers, that were pleased for a while; he knew what sort of faith it was they believed in him with, that it would not hold long, nor they continue with him; for he knew not only all persons, but  "all things", as some copies read here; see <a href="/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all <i>men</i>,</span><p>(6) It is not good giving credit to those who trust only because of miracles.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/2-24.htm" title="But Jesus did not commit himself to them, because he knew all men,...">John 2:24-25</a>. <span class="greekheb">Αὐτὸς δὲ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">But He on His part</span>, though they on their part, on account of His miracles, believed on Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐπίστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτόν</span>] an intentional antithesis to the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἐπίστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ</span>.

This remarkable expression corresponds with many actions and methods of Jesus. When he was offered the homage of devils, he forbade them to speak. When those who had been simply healed of bodily disease began garrulously to proclaim his praises, he silenced them. He had no faith in their faith, and consequently did not open to them more of his nature; still less did he assume, as they would have liked him to do, an immediate and outward Messiahship of political revolt. He did not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax, and often made use of the smallest remnant of spiritual apprehension; but even in Galilee, when they would by force have made him a king, "he sent the multitudes away." The apparently arbitrary permission given to others to proclaim his Name (as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, to the healed demoniac of Gergesa, <a href="/luke/8-39.htm">Luke 8:39</a>; cf. Luke 9:57-62) suggests the precise inquiry which John had felt from the first Jerusalem visit, and which, with profound insight, he thus meets: "He did not trust himself to them," <span class="cmt_word">owing to the fact that he knew</span> - (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by apperceptive and continuous processes) - <span class="cmt_word">all</span> (<span class="accented">men</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>persons</span>. He penetrated their thoughts, discerned their character, saw the meaning of their faith, the burden of their wishes, the regal passions that consumed them - he knew all. <span class="cmt_word">And also because he had no need that any should testify what was in</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">man; for he himself</span> - without such aid - <span class="cmt_word">knew what was in</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">man</span>. The definite articles here may either restrict the meaning to the men who happened one by one to come under his searching glance (<a href="/john/7-51.htm">John 7:51</a>; Meyer), or it may mean "man" generically, "human nature" in all its peril, weakness, and self-deception. Geikie ('Life of Christ,' 1, 508) gives a novel, though entirely indefensible, translation: "He needed not that any should bear witness respecting him as man." The better and more accurate translation is the first; but since his glance is universal and contact with souls continuous - man by man - the statement thus embraces even <span class="accented">more than is</span> involved in the generic sense. The knowledge of man (<span class="accented">homo</span>) "generically" would not embrace his individualities - would leave out the specialities of each case. The particularism of Christ's penetrative glance gives the stronger and better explanation of the reserve of Christ in dealing with these half-believers, than the generic or rather universal knowledge which is supposed to be involved.

"He had no faith in their faith" (Godet).<p>Because He knew (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>Literally, on account of the fact of His knowing. John describes the Lord's knowledge by two words which it is important to distinguish. &#x393;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, as here, implies acquired knowledge; knowledge which is the result of discernment and which may be enlarged. This knowledge may be drawn from external facts (<a href="/john/5-6.htm">John 5:6</a>; <a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>) or from spiritual sympathy (<a href="//biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>, <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>; <a href="/john/17-25.htm">John 17:25</a>). &#x395;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (<a href="/john/1-26.htm">John 1:26</a>) implies absolute knowledge: the knowledge of intuition and of satisfied conviction. Hence it is used of Christ's knowledge of divine things (<a href="/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11</a>; <a href="/john/5-32.htm">John 5:32</a>; <a href="/john/7-29.htm">John 7:29</a>), Of the facts of His own being (<a href="/john/6-6.htm">John 6:6</a>; <a href="/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>; <a href="/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1</a>), and of external facts (<a href="//biblehub.com/john/6-61.htm">John 6:61</a>, <a href="/john/6-64.htm">John 6:64</a>; <a href="/john/13-11.htm">John 13:11</a>). In <a href="/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a> the two words appear together. Peter says to Jesus, appealing to His absolute knowledge, "Thou knowest (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;) all things:" appealing to his discernment, "Thou knowest or perceivest (&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;) that I love Thee." </body></html>
