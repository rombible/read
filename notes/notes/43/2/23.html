It was a favorable opportunity for making known his doctrines and showing the evidence that he was the Christ, and he embraced it.

The meaning is, that they believed the things which were published concerning his person and office: yet the periphrasis, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Believed in his name, </span> is not vain; but declareth a mutual relation between God and the word, by the preaching of which he maketh himself known to the world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">True faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</span> I think it is to no purpose disputed here by some, whether the faith here mentioned was true faith, yea or no. It appeareth by what followeth, that it was not true justifying faith; but it was true in its kind. To make up true justifying, saving faith, which the apostle calls <span class="ital">the faith of God’s elect, </span> three things are required: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. A knowledge of the proposition of the word revealing Christ: this is acquired by reading, hearing, meditation, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The second is assent, which is the act of the understanding, agreeing in the truth of the word revealed, when such an assent is given to a proposition, if merely upon the Divine revelation of it: this is faith, a true faith in its kind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Upon this now (in those who savingly believe) the will closes with Christ as an adequate object; for it receiveth him, accepteth him, relies on him as its Saviour, and moveth by the affections to love, desire, hope, rejoice in him; and commandeth the outward man into an obedience to his law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now it is very possible, that, through a common influence of the Holy Spirit of God, men upon the hearing of the word, especially having the advantage of seeing miraculous operations confirming the word, may give a true assent to the proposition of the word, as a proposition of truth, and yet may never receive Christ as their Saviour, close with him, trust in him, desire, love, or obey him; this was the case of these persons, many at least of them. They believed, seeing the miracles which Christ did: they wanted a due knowledge of Christ founded in the word; neither had they any certain, steady, fixed assent, founded in the discerning the truth of the proposition; their assent was sudden, founded only upon the miracles they saw wrought; so as though they might have some confidence in him, as a famous person, and some great prince, from whom they might expect some earthly good, yet this was all, which was far enough from true saving faith. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover,.... Whither he went, in order to keep it, that being at hand, and now come; see <a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13</a>; <p>in the feast day; either on the day the Chagigah was eaten, which was sometimes emphatically called "the feast", as in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-16.htm">Numbers 28:16</a>, "and in the fourteenth day of the first month, is the passover of the Lord; and in the fifteenth day of this month, is the feast"; the passover lamb was eaten on the fourteenth day of the month "Nisan", and the "Chagigah" was on the fifteenth; in the former only a lamb was eaten, in the other, cattle out of the herds; hence mention is made, both of flocks and herds, for the keeping the passover, <a href="/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>. Jarchi's note upon the place is, that the herds were for the Chagigah, with which the Talmud (l) agrees; and Jonathan ben Uzziel paraphrases the words thus, <p>"and ye shall slay the passover before the Lord your God, between the evenings, and the sheep and oxen on the morrow, in that very day, for the joy of the feast;'' <p>for it was observed with great joy and mirth: and the rather this is here meant, since the "Chagigah" is not only called "the feast", but this here is distinguished from the passover, as that is in the passage above cited, <a href="/numbers/28-16.htm">Numbers 28:16</a>. For the passover here, seems to be the general name for the whole seven days of the festival; and the feast to be the particular feast of the first day of it, which was the fifteenth; to which may be added, that on this day all the males made their appearance in court (m); and so was a very proper time for Christ to work his miracles in, when there were so many spectators: though it may design the whole time of the feast, all the seven days of unleavened bread; during which time Christ was at Jerusalem, and wrought miracles, which had the following effect: <p>many believed in his name; that he was some great prophet, or the prophet, or the Messiah; they gave an historical assent unto him as such, at least for that time: <p>when they saw the miracles which he did; for as miracles, according to the prophecies of the Old Testament, were to be performed by the Messiah, such as giving sight to the blind, causing the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, and the lame to walk, <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>; so they were expected by the ancient Jews, that they would be wrought by him, when he came; wherefore these Jews, seeing such like wonderful things wrought by Jesus, they concluded he must be the Messiah: though the modern ones, in order to shift off the evidence of Jesus being the Messiah, from his miracles, deny that miracles are the characteristic of the Messiah, or will be performed by him; at least, that there is no necessity of them to prove him to be the person. What miracles these were, which were now wrought by Christ, are not recorded by this, or any other evangelist; see <a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30</a>. However, being surprised at the marvellous things he did, and upon the evidence of these extraordinary works, there were many that concluded he must be come from God; among these it seems as if Nicodemus was one; see <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>; great part of these, at least some of them, were only nominal and temporary believers, who were not to be confided in as true disciples, and hearty followers of Christ; and who continued not long in the same mind and profession, as appears by what follows. <p>(l) Pesachim, fol. 70. 2.((m) Maimon.

Then the feast was near, now it had arrived. We are to hear what happened while Jesus resided in Jerusalem <span class="ital">during the feast</span>.—<span class="greekheb">πολλοὶ ἐπίστευσαν εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ</span>, which can scarcely mean less than that they believed He was the Messiah. Nicodemus, however, seems willing only to admit He is “a teacher come from God”. Their belief was founded on the miracles they saw.—<span class="greekheb">θεωροῦντες αὐτοῦ τὰ σημεῖα ἃ ἐποίει</span>, seeing day by day the signs He was doing, and of which John relates none. This faith, resting on miracles, is in this Gospel never commended as the highest kind of faith, although it is by no means despised. It is what Luther calls “milk faith” and may grow into something more trustworthy. Accordingly, although Jesus had at once committed Himself to the men who were attracted without miracle by His personality and the testimony of the Baptist, to these <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς Ἰησοῦς οὐκ ἐπίστευεν ἑαυτὸν</span>, “Jesus on His part did not commit Himself”. It is necessary to consider not only whether we have faith in Christ but whether Christ has faith in us. Thoroughgoing confidence must always be reciprocal. Christ will commit Himself to the man who thoroughly commits himself to Him. The reason of this reserve is given in a twofold expression: positive, <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸ αὐτὸν γινώσκειν πάντας</span>, “because He Himself knew all men”; negative, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὅτι οὐ χρείαν εἶχεν ἵνα τὶς μαρτυρήσῃ περὶ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου</span>, “and because He had no need that any one should witness concerning man”. Holtzmann, following Winer, thinks that the article is inserted because reference is made to the individual with whom Jesus had on each occasion to do. This seems quite unnecessary. <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἄνθρωπος</span> is here, as in A.V[37], “man,” the ordinary generic use of the article. The reason for this again is given in the closing words, <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς γὰρ</span> … “For He Himself knew what was in man,” knew human nature, the motives, governing ideas, and ways of man. This knowledge was not supernatural. Westcott has an important note on this point, in which he points out that John describes the knowledge of Jesus “both as relative, acquired (<span class="greekheb">γινώσκειν</span>) and absolute, possessed (<span class="greekheb">εἰδέναι</span>)”. Each constitutes a higher degree of the kind of knowledge found among men. Reynolds says: “There are many other indications of this thought mastery, which the evangelists appear to regard as proofs of divine power; so that I think the real significance of the passage is an ascription to Jesus of Divine power. The supernatural in mind, the superhuman mental processes of Jesus, are part of the proof we have that though He was man He created the irresistible impression that He was more than man.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[37] Authorised Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23–25</span>.

The conversation with Nicodemus is prefaced by a very remarkable summary of facts, and a hint of principles of action, which are intended to throw light on the great discourse, which hears the same kind of relation to St. John's Gospel that the sermon on the mount does to St. Matthew's Gospel. It is a compendium of the Christian faith. The very fulness and sufficiency of it suggests the doubt of its authenticity. Is not the Lord's reticence on other occasions, and even his enigmatic, parabolic methods of teaching, in decided contrast with the abundance of the revelations with which Nicodemus was favoured? We are tempted to ask - What was the evangelist's source of information? The only reply that seems to me rational is that John himself was the auditor of this discourse, and has preserved it for the edification and solace of the world. The disciple whom Jesus loved never left him, but was perpetually drinking in his words, and, with a genuine Hebrew retentiveness, preserved them intact; at all events, he so reproduced the leading ideas of the conversation. This is, we maintain, a far more scientific treatment of the authorities than the hypothesis of a Johannist of the second century having gathered up and idealized the synoptic records of the scribes, who, by sundry questions, brought forth from the Lord some of his most characteristic teaching. Thoma urges that we have here a  spiritual <span class="accented">rechauffe</span> of "the rich young man," of "the lawyer," and of the story of Paul, himself a Pharisee, when finally convinced that he needed a new creation and a spiritual life! First of all, then, we have the place, general period, and specific time referred to: <span class="cmt_word">Now when he was in Jerusalem</span> - not the temple, but in the houses and streets, and perhaps suburbs, of Jerusalem (<span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> the plural form used generally in the Gospel, while <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;</span> is used in the Revelation in symbolic sense) - <span class="cmt_word">at the Passover</span>; a period generally covering nine or ten days of celebration, extending from the first purifying of the houses from all leaven and the drawing of pure water on the thirteenth Nisan, the paschal meal on the fourteenth Nisan, the feasts in the evenings of the great days of convocation, fifteenth and twenty-first of the month, and the ceremonies of the intervening six days. <span class="cmt_word">In the feast</span> must refer to one or ether of the great days of convocation, worship, and feasting. <span class="cmt_word">Many believed on his Name;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on his Messiahship, rather than on himself, as their Prophet, Purifier, self-sacrificing Priest, or than on himself as Lamb of God or Son of God. They accepted on easy terms, with a fickle and perhaps eager fanaticism, the first impression produced by him <span class="cmt_word">when they saw the signs which he was making</span> of his heavenly mission and nature. We must conclude, therefore, that he did in many ways partially unveil himself. Nicodemus heard of these "signs," and referred them to a Divine commission. John does not here, nor elsewhere, say what these signs were - whether they consisted of effects produced on nature or on men, whether they were deeds of healing, or of moral compulsion, or repression, or reformation. Great expectations with reference to a coming Christ had been excited in the breasts of tens of thousands by John the Baptist's fiery ministry. The result was that men now flocked to Jesus in greater numbers than they had done to him (<a href="/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>). The faith that they exercised was neither deep nor appreciative, yet it was worthy of the name of faith. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>At the passover<p>Note the omission of of the Jews (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13</a>).<p>In the feast-day (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;)<p>Rev., during the feast.

With the phrase believe on His name, compare believe on Him (<a href="/john/8-30.htm">John 8:30</a>), which is the stronger expression, indicating a casting of one's self upon Him; while to believe on the name is rather to believe in Him as being that which he claims to be, in this case the Messiah. It is believing recognition rather than appropriation. "Their faith in His name (as that of the Messiah) did not yet amount to any decision of their inner life for Jesus, but was only an opinion produced by the sight of His miracles, that He was the Messiah" (Meyer).<p>When they saw (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., literally and rightly, beholding (see on <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p>He did (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Better, was doing; the imperfect denoting the wonderful works as in progress. </body></html>
