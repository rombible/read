Never any man spake with that wisdom, and power, and grace, that convincing clearness, and that sweetness, wherewith Christ spake. Alas, that many, who are for a time restrained, and who speak highly of the word of Jesus, speedily lose their convictions, and go on in their sins! People are foolishly swayed by outward motives in matters of eternal moment, are willing even to be damned for fashion's sake. As the wisdom of God often chooses things which men despise, so the folly of men commonly despises those whom God has chosen. The Lord brings forward his weak and timid disciples, and sometimes uses them to defeat the designs of his enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/2-4.htm">Matthew 2:4-6</a>.<p>Where David was - <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>44-49. would have taken him; but, &c.&#8212;(See on [1803]Joh 7:30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There were some that had an ill opinion of Christ, and put on the officers that came for the purpose to apprehend him; but there was none so hardy as to do it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And some of them would have taken him,....
