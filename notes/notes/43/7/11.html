What can have prevented his coming to the feast? As he had formerly attended the principal feasts, and signalized himself by the miracles which he wrought, he had made himself the subject of much discourse and observation. <span class="ital">And there was much murmuring among the people </span>— <span class="greekheb">Γογγυσμος πολυς</span>, <span class="ital">much whispering: </span>many private debates, especially among those who were come from distant parts. The word <span class="ital">murmuring </span>is not proper in this place, as it conveys the notion of discontent and grumbling, which does not appear to be suggested by the original term. It expresses solely the secrecy and caution which the people found it convenient to use in speaking on this subject, being prompted not by their resentments but by their fears. And it stands opposed to <span class="greekheb">παρρησια</span>, <span class="ital">openly, </span>which occurs in the next verse. <span class="ital">For some said, He is a good man </span>— Eminently pious and benevolent; <span class="ital">others — </span>Being under the force of strong prejudices, and suspecting the worst; <span class="ital">said, Nay, but he deceiveth the people </span>— Seduces and misleads the ignorant populace, and the wiser part of the nation must see that he will undoubtedly at last draw his followers into ruin, as some other impostors have lately done.

Ungodly men sometimes undertake to counsel those employed in the work of God; but they only advise what appears likely to promote present advantages. The people differed about his doctrine and miracles, while those who favoured him, dared not openly to avow their sentiments. Those who count the preachers of the gospel to be deceivers, speak out, while many who favour them, fear to get reproach by avowing regard for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I go not up yet - Jesus remained until about the middle of the feast, <a href="/john/7-14.htm">John 7:14</a>. That is, he remained about four days after his brethren had departed, or until the mass of the people had gone up, so that his going might excite no attention, and that it might not be said he chose such a time to excite a tumult. We have here a signal instance of our Lord's prudence and opposition to parade. Though it would have been lawful for him to go up at that time, and though it would have been a favorable period to make himself known, yet he chose to forego these advantages rather than to afford an occasion of envy and jealousy to the rulers, or to appear even to excite a tumult among the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13.
