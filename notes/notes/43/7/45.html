Never any man spake with that wisdom, and power, and grace, that convincing clearness, and that sweetness, wherewith Christ spake. Alas, that many, who are for a time restrained, and who speak highly of the word of Jesus, speedily lose their convictions, and go on in their sins! People are foolishly swayed by outward motives in matters of eternal moment, are willing even to be damned for fashion's sake. As the wisdom of God often chooses things which men despise, so the folly of men commonly despises those whom God has chosen. The Lord brings forward his weak and timid disciples, and sometimes uses them to defeat the designs of his enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The officers - Those who had been appointed <a href="/john/7-32.htm">John 7:32</a> to take him. It seems that Jesus was in the midst of the people addressing them, and that they happened to come at the very time when he was speaking. They were so impressed and awed with what he said that they dared not take him. There have been few instances of eloquence like this. His speaking had so much evidence of truth, so much proof that he was from God, and was so impressive and persuasive, that they were convinced of his innocence, and they dared not touch him to execute their commission. We have here:<p>1. A remarkable testimony to the commanding eloquence of Jesus.<p>2. Wicked men may be awed and restrained by the presence of a good man, and by the evidence that he speaks that which is true.<p>3. God can preserve his friends. Here were men sent for a particular purpose. They were armed with power. They were commissioned by the highest authority of the nation. On the other hand, Jesus was without arms or armies, and without external protection. Yet, in a manner which the officers and the high priests would have little expected, he was preserved. So, in ways which we little expect, God will defend and deliver us when in the midst of danger.<p>4. No prophet, apostle, or minister has ever spoken the truth with as much power, grace, and beauty as Jesus. It should be ours, therefore, to listen to his words, and to sit at his feet and learn heavenly wisdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>45.

The same officers they sent to take him, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/7-32.htm">John 7:32</a>, returned to them without him; for though they were sent on that errand which they intended to have performed, yet they were not on the side of those who were for seizing him by force, nor of those who objected to his being the Messiah; but rather took part with those who affirmed he was the Messiah; or at least looked upon him to be some extraordinary prophet: <p>and they said unto them; that is, the chief priests and Pharisees said to the officers; the Syriac version reads, "the priests said unto them": <p>why have ye not brought him? They mention not the name of Jesus by way of contempt, and knowing that the officers would easily understand them; though the Persic version expresses it, reading the words thus, "why have ye not brought Jesus?" seeing them returned without him, they were transported with rage and fury, and fell upon them in a fierce and furious manner, for disobeying their orders, who had sat there waiting some time: and hoping, and not doubting, but they should have him in their hands, whose blood they were thirsting after: wherefore it was a great disappointment to them, and much enraged them to see them come without him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{17}</span> Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</span><p>(17) God scorns from heaven those who are his Son's enemies.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/7-45.htm" title="Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have you not brought him?...">John 7:45-46</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὖν</span>] <span class="ital">therefore</span>, seeing that no one, not even they themselves, had ventured to lay hands on Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ ὑπηρέται</span>] In accordance with the orders they had received (<a href="/john/7-32.htm" title="The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.">John 7:32</a>), they had kept close to Jesus, in order to apprehend Him.

An overwhelming impression was produced that the Speaker had a deep secret to disclose, vast treasure to bestow, unlimited power to meet the thirst of man, and even to make those who utterly yield to his influence the fountains of benedictions to others. An awe as of unseen things fell on the officers and the people. They could not resist the sense of benediction which, like some sacred perfume, some supernatural glamour, fell upon them in his reval words. "Never man thus spake." The whole experience is new and wonderful. "These sayings of the Prophet of Nazareth are more than words; they have living powers; they have confounded and disarmed us<span class="accented">."</span> </body></html>
