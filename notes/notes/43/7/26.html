They now saw him speaking boldly to the people without interruption from the rulers.<p>They concluded, therefore, that some change had taken place in the sentiments of the rulers in regard to him, though they had not yet made it public.<p>The rulers - The members of the Sanhedrin, or great council of the nation, who had charge of religious affairs.<p>Indeed - Truly; certainly.
