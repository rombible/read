(Comp. in this Gospel <a href="/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>; <a href="/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>; <a href="/john/12-44.htm" title="Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.">John 12:44</a>.) Here this feeling has been roused by another instance of their misapprehension, because they think of the outward appearance only, and therefore do not grasp the inner truth. They know whence He is; they had been taught that no man should know the Messiah’s origin, and therefore they think He is not the Christ. And this technical reason, the meaning of which they have never fathomed, is enough to stifle every growing conviction, and to annul the force of all His words and all His works! St. John is impressed with the fact that it was in the very Temple itself, in the presence of the priests and rulers, in the act of public teaching, that He uttered these words, and he again notices this, though he has told us so before (<a href="/john/7-14.htm" title="Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.">John 7:14</a>; <a href="/john/7-26.htm" title="But, see, he speaks boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?">John 7:26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am.</span>—He takes up their objection in order to refute it. There is, indeed, a sense in which it is true. Those features were well known alike to friend and foe. With minds glowing with the fire of love or of hate, they had gazed upon Him as He walked or taught, and His form had fixed itself on the memory. They knew about His earthly home and early life (<a href="/john/7-27.htm" title="However, we know this man from where he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows from where he is.">John 7:27</a>), but all this was far short of the real knowledge of Him. It is but little that the events of the outer life tell of the true life and being even of a brother man. Little does a man know even his bosom friend; how infinitely far were they, with minds which did not even approach the true method of knowledge, from knowing Him whom no mind can fully comprehend!<p><span class= "bld">And I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true.</span>—Once again He asserts that He claims no position of independence. He is the first great Apostle (comp. <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>), but He is not self-commissioned. Had He not been the Christ, their objection that they knew His origin might have had force. But sent by Him who is the really existent One, and whom they knew not, His origin is unknown to them, and their technical test is fulfilled. In the fullest sense, they neither knew Him nor from whence He came.<p>For the meaning of the word “true,” see Note on <a href="/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>. It is almost impossible to give the sense of the original except in a paraphrase. We must keep, therefore, the ordinary rendering, but bear in mind that it does not mean, “He that sent Me is truthful,” but “He that sent Me is the ideally true One.” “You talk of person, and of origin, of knowing Me, and from whence I came, but all this is knowledge of the senses, and in the region of the phenomenal world. Being is only truly known in relation to the Eternal Being. He that sent Me to manifest His Being in the world is the truly existent One. In Him is My true origin, and Him <span class= "ital">ye</span> know not.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/john/7-28.htm" title="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.">John 7:28</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then cried Jesus </span>— Probably with a loud and earnest voice, and with allusion to the words which they had just spoken in a private manner to each other, and which they imagined he could not have heard, as he taught in the temple at some distance from them; <span class="ital">Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am </span>— Or, as it seems the clause should rather be rendered, <span class="ital">Do you know both me, and know whence I am? </span>Thus it is read by Doddridge, Wesley, Wynne, and also by Campbell, who observes upon it, “As the words are plainly capable of being read as an interrogation, it is, in every respect, most eligible to translate them so in this place. In the way they are commonly rendered they contain a direct contradiction to what our Lord says, <a href="/john/8-14.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know from where I came, and where I go; but you cannot tell from where I come, and where I go.">John 8:14</a>; <a href="/john/8-19.htm" title="Then said they to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.">John 8:19</a>. Nor does it satisfy that both may be true in different senses, since these different senses do not appear from the context. Nay, in effect, he contradicts them in the same breath, inasmuch as he tells the people, that they know not him who sent him. When they said, <span class="ital">We know whence this man is, </span>the same thing was evidently meant as when they said, (<a href="/john/6-42.htm" title="And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he said, I came down from heaven?">John 6:42</a>,) <span class="ital">Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? </span>Now our Lord tells them plainly, that they did not know his father, and consequently could not tell whence (that is, of what parentage) he was. <span class="ital">And I am not come of myself </span>— With vain and false pretences to a divine mission; <span class="ital">but he that sent me </span>— And gives daily proof thereof, by the miracles which I perform in his name; <span class="ital">is true </span>— And therefore will not bear witness to a deceiver. Or, as the words may be paraphrased, “Though you pretend to know me and whence I am, it does not follow that I am destitute of the prophetical characters of the Messiah, and an impostor, come to you of my own accord. I am really sent to you by God, who is true in all the prophecies he uttered by his servants concerning the Messiah, for they are all fulfilled in me.” But him <span class="ital">you know not </span>— On the contrary, “You are wholly ignorant of his blessed perfections and gracious counsels, and have no inclination to obey his will.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:25-30 Christ proclaimed aloud, that they were in error in their thoughts about his origin. He was sent of God, who showed himself true to his promises. This declaration, that they knew not God, with his claim to peculiar knowledge, provoked the hearers; and they sought to take him, but God can tie men's hands, though he does not turn their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye know whence I am - You have sufficient evidence of my divine mission, and that I am the Messiah.<p>Is true - Is worthy to be believed.

Others think that it is an irony, or as a question, Do you know me so well?

Overhearing the reasonings of these men, however, knowing what they said; so the Persic version adds, "having secretly known this"; exalted his voice as he was teaching in the temple, and in the midst of his discourse, publicly before all the people, in the temple, spoke out with a loud voice, that all might hear: <p>saying, ye both know me, and ye know whence I am; some, as the Ethiopic version, read these words by way of interrogation, "do ye both know me, and do ye know from whence I am?" no; you do not. Or they may be considered as an ironical concession; yes, you know me, and you know whence I am; you know me to be Jesus of Nazareth, but you are wrong, I am not of Nazareth; you suppose I come, from Galilee, but that is your ignorance; you take me to be the real son of Joseph, to be begotten by him on Mary, but that is your mistake: such is your knowledge of me: you know me indeed who I am, and from whence I come. <p>And I am not come of myself; into this world, by incarnation, or the assumption of human nature, to work out the salvation of men; the Father called him to it, and he agreeing to do it, was in the fulness of time sent about it; this was not a device of his own, or an honour he took to himself; he was not alone in it; it was a mutual agreement between him and his Father, in consequence of which he was sent and came. <p>But he that sent me is true; to the covenant he made with Christ, and to the promises he made to the fathers of the Old Testament, concerning the mission of his Son; and he is true to be believed, in the testimonies he gave of him, particularly by a voice from heaven, declaring him his beloved Son. <p>Whom ye know not; so that notwithstanding all their boasted knowledge of him, they knew not his Father, from whence he came, and by whom he was sent; and notwithstanding also their boasted knowledge of the one, only, true, and living God, see <a href="/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17</a>; yet they knew him not in a spiritual sense; they knew him not in Christ, nor as the Father of Christ; they knew neither the Father nor the Son: and this their ignorance of both was the reason of their hatred of Christ, and of his followers, <a href="/john/15-21.htm">John 15:21</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{12}</span> Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span><p>(12) The truth of Christ does not depend upon the judgment of man.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/7-28.htm" title="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not....">John 7:28-29</a>.

John well remembers that moving cry in the Temple; the scene is still before him and he puts it before us, although neither ‘in the Temple’ nor ‘as He taught’ is needed for the narrative (see <span class="ital"><a href="/john/7-14.htm" title="Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.">John 7:14</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ye both know me</span>, &c.] Various constructions have been put upon this: (1) that it is a question; (2) that it is ironical; (3) a mixture of the two; (4) a reproach, i.e. that they knew His Divine nature and maliciously concealed it. None of these are satisfactory. The words are best understood quite simply and literally. Christ admits the truth of what they say: they have an outward knowledge of Him and His origin (<a href="/john/6-42.htm" title="And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he said, I came down from heaven?">John 6:42</a>); but He has an inner and higher origin, of which they know nothing. So that even their self-made test, for the sake of which they are willing to resist the evidence both of Scripture and of His works, is complied with; for they know not His real immediate origin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and I am not come of myself</span>] ‘Of Myself’ is emphatic; <span class="ital">and</span> (<span class="ital">yet</span>) <span class="ital">of Myself I am not come</span>. Comp. <a href="/john/8-42.htm" title="Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.">John 8:42</a>. The ‘and’ introduces a contrast, as so often in S. John: ‘ye know My person, and ye know My parentage; and yet of the chief thing of all, My Divine mission, ye know nothing. See on <span class="ital"><a href="/john/7-30.htm" title="Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.">John 7:30</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but he that sent me is true</span>] The word for ‘true’ here is the same as occurs <a href="/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a> in ‘the <span class="ital">true</span> Light’ (see note there): the meaning, therefore, is not ‘truthful’ but ‘real, perfect;’ <span class="ital">He that sendeth Me is a real sender</span>, One who in the highest and most perfect sense can give a mission But perhaps here and in <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things said he that is holy, he that is true, he that has the key of David, he that opens, and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens;">Revelation 3:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm" title="And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war.">Revelation 19:11</a> the distinction between the two words for ‘true’ is not very marked. Such refinements (the words being alike except in termination) have a tendency to become obscured.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/7-28.htm" title="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.">John 7:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔκραξεν</span>, <span class="ital">cried</span>) with great earnestness, for the salvation of men; also on account of the great number of His auditors. Christ cried by no means often; <a href="/matthew/12-19.htm" title="He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.">Matthew 12:19</a>, “He shall not strive, nor cry, neither shall any man hear His voice in the streets:” For which reason the cries, which He did utter, had a weighty cause in each instance.

The speech of the Jews had had two parts, <span class="ital">this man and the Christ</span>: in reply to which at <a href="/john/7-27.htm" title="However, we know this man from where he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows from where he is.">John 7:27</a>, the speech of our Lord has also two parts, the “<span class="ital">both Me</span>” “<span class="ital">and</span> [I am not come] <span class="ital">of Myself</span>.” The former makes a concession, and leaves the question of knowledge concerning Jesus and His birth, regarded from an external point of view, in some measure where he found it; for His wont is never Himself to bring it forward; comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/5-16.htm" title="Why from now on know we no man after the flesh: yes, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now from now on know we him no more.">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>, “Though we have known <span class="ital">Christ after the flesh</span>, yet now henceforth know we Him no more;” but He denies that they have a just [correct] knowledge of Himself as sent by the Father; comp. <a href="/john/7-33.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.">John 7:33</a>, etc., “I go unto Him that sent Me;” and <a href="/john/7-36.htm" title="What manner of saying is this that he said, You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come?">John 7:36</a>, “What manner of saving is this that He said, Ye shall seek Me and shall not find Me, and where I am, thither ye cannot come;” chap. <a href="/john/8-14.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know from where I came, and where I go; but you cannot tell from where I come, and where I go.">John 8:14</a>, “Ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.”—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀπʼ ἐμαυτοῦ</span>) and yet I am not come <span class="ital">of Myself</span>, as ye suppose.—<span class="greekheb">ἀληθινός</span>, <span class="ital">true</span>) This <span class="ital">truth</span> is of more consequence than that <span class="ital">truly</span>; “Do the rulers know <span class="ital">truly</span> that this is the Christ?”—<span class="greekheb">ὅν ὑμεῖς οὐκ οἴδατε</span>, <span class="ital">whom ye know not</span>) We must understand after this the clause which follows, <span class="ital">that I am from Him, and that He has sent Me</span>. The very demand of the Jews concerning Christ, expressed at <a href="/john/7-27.htm" title="However, we know this man from where he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows from where he is.">John 7:27</a>, was realized in Jesus, “When Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence He is.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore cried</span> - lifted up his voice in such a way as to cause wide astonishment. (The word is found in <a href="/john/1-15.htm">John 1:15</a> of John the Baptist, and ver. 37 and <a href="/john/12-44.htm">John 12:44</a>; but frequently in the synoptists and Acts, and very frequently in the LXX.) The trumpet peal sounded through the courts of the temple, and the crowds rushed in the direction from which it proceeded. He cried <span class="cmt_word">in the temple</span>. This clause is added, notwithstanding the statement of ver. 14, and it intimates a break in the discourse, a sudden and trenchant response to certain loudly uttered murmurs of the Jerusalem multitude. <span class="cmt_word">Ye both know me, and know whence I am.</span> Surely (with De Wette, Meyer, Westcott, Moulton) the Lord distinctly concedes to the men of Jerusalem a certain amount of superficial knowledge. It is lamentably defective in respect of that for which they imagine it all-sufficient; and yet this knowledge was highly significant and important as far as it went. Such knowledge of his birthplace and his family, his provincial training, his Galilaean ministry, were all proofs to them of his <span class="accented">humanity</span> - that he belonged to their race,  was bone of their bone, and sympathizing in their deepest sorrows, understood their noblest aspirations. Such a concession, moreover, repudiates the supposed docetic character of the Christ of the Fourth Gospel. Many commentators regard the exclamation its ironical and interrogatory (Grotius, Lampe, Calvin, Lucke, and even Godet), without sufficient warrant. Our Lord, however, soon shows that, though they are rightly informed about certain obvious facts, there were others of stupendous importance which could go a long way towards rcconciling their many-sided and conflicting ideas of Messiah, of which they were yet in ignorance. <span class="cmt_word">And yet</span> (all commentators show that there is a certain adversative force about this third <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>; see also ver. 30; <a href="/john/8-20.htm">John 8:20</a>; <a href="/john/9-30.htm">John 9:30</a>; <a href="/mark/12-12.htm">Mark 12:12</a>) <span class="cmt_word">I am not come from myself (</span>see <a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>). I have not risen upon the wings of my own ambition. It is not my mere human whim and purpose, or my desire for self-glorification, which brings me before you. You may know the home of my childhood; and watched as I have been by your eager spies, as you had full right to do, you may know all my public proceedings, and yet you have not fathomed the fact that I have not come on my own errand, nor does my humanity as you have grasped it cover the whole of the facts about me. There is a peculiarity, a uniqueness, about my coming that you have yet to learn. I have been <span class="accented">sent</span> to you; <span class="cmt_word">but he that sent me is real</span> - a reality to me, which makes it an absolute reality in itself. The use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is somewhat peculiar, and, unless with some commentators and Revisers we make it equal to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, and thus disturb the uniform usage of St. John, we must either imagine under the word a real "Sender," or one really answering to the idea already announced as of <span class="accented">One</span> competent to send. "He that sent me, the Father," of whom I spoke (<a href="/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>) when last we conversed together, is the overwhelming Reality in this case. <span class="cmt_word">Whom ye know not.</span> The Jerusalem multitudes were suffering grievously from the superstitious limitations of their own faith, from the traditions, the symbolism, the letter, the form, which had well nigh strangled, suffocated, the underlying truths. They had in many ways lost the God whose great Name they honoured. They failed to apprehend his awful nearness to them, his love to every man, his compassion to the world, the demand of his righteousness, the condition of seeing him, the way to his rest - "<span class="accented">Him ye know not."</span> This was a serious rebuke of the entire system which prevailed at Jerusalem. Not understanding nor knowing the <span class="accented">Father</span>, they were unable to see the possibility of his having sent to them, through the life and lips of a Man whom they knew, his last and greatest message. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Then (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., rightly, therefore, giving the reason for the succeeding words in Jesus' emotion awakened by the misconceptions of the people.<p>Cried (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="/mark/5-5.htm">Mark 5:5</a>; see on <a href="/mark/9-24.htm">Mark 9:24</a>.<p>As He taught (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Better, Rev., teaching.
