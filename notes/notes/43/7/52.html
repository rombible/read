They seek to pass from the matter of fact immediately before them to the question of authority. Their generalisation includes an historical error which cannot be explained away. Jonah is described in <a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm" title="He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.">2Kings 14:25</a> as of Gathhepher, which was a town of Zebulun, in Lower Galilee. Possibly Elkosh, the birthplace of Nahum, was also in Galilee, and Hosea was certainly a prophet of the Northern Kingdom, though not necessarily of Galilee. Adverse criticism would lay this error also to the charge of the Evangelist. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/john/7-42.htm" title="Has not the scripture said, That Christ comes of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?">John 7:42</a>, and <a href="/john/1-45.htm" title="Philip finds Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.">John 1:45</a>; <a href="/john/8-33.htm" title="They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?">John 8:33</a>.) But the obvious explanation is, that the Sanhedrin, in their zeal to press their foregone conclusion that Jesus is not a prophet, are not bound by strict accuracy; and it is not unlikely that, in the general contempt of Judæans for Galilee, this assertion had become a by-word, especially with men with so little of the historical sense as the later Rabbis. As compared with Judæa, it was true that Galilee was not a country of prophets, and by-words of this kind often rest on imperfect generalisations. We have seen that of the great prophets of Christianity all were Galileans. Judas Iscariot alone, of the Twelve Apostles, was probably a Judæan (Note on <a href="/john/6-71.htm" title="He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.">John 6:71</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:40-53 The malice of Christ's enemies is always against reason, and sometimes the staying of it cannot be accounted for. Never any man spake with that wisdom, and power, and grace, that convincing clearness, and that sweetness, wherewith Christ spake. Alas, that many, who are for a time restrained, and who speak highly of the word of Jesus, speedily lose their convictions, and go on in their sins! People are foolishly swayed by outward motives in matters of eternal moment, are willing even to be damned for fashion's sake. As the wisdom of God often chooses things which men despise, so the folly of men commonly despises those whom God has chosen.

To be a Galilean was a term of the highest reproach. They knew well that he was not of Galilee, but they meant to ask whether he also had become a follower of the despised Galilean.

The plain words can have no other meaning.

Inconsiderate zeal led the members of the Sanhedrim into historical erro; for, apart from the unknown birth-places of many prophets, Jonah at least, according to <a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm" title="He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.">2 Kings 14:25</a>, was of Galilee.[274] This error cannot be removed by any expedient either ertical[275] or exegetical; still it cannot be used as an argument aginst the genunieness of the Gospel (Bretschneider), for there was all the less need to add a correction of it, seeing that it did not apply to Jesus, who was not out of Galilee. This also tells against Baur, p. 169. The argument in <span class="greekheb">ὅτι προΦ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is from the general to the particular (“to say nothing of the Messiah!”), and is a conclusion from a negative induction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[274] Not <span class="ital">Elias</span> also, whose Thisbe lay in Gilead (see Thenius on <a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm" title="And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.">1 Kings 17:1</a>; Fritzsche on <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/1-2.htm" title="Who in the time of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was led captive out of Thisbe, which is at the right hand of that city, which is called properly Nephthali in Galilee above Aser.">Tob 1:2</a>; Kurtz, in <span class="ital">Herzog’s Encyhl</span>. III. p. 754). It is very doubtful, further, whether the Elkosh, whence <span class="ital">Nahum</span> came, was in Galilee or anywhere in Palestine, and not rather in Assyria (Michaelis, Eichhorn, Ewald, and most). Hosea came from the northern kingdom of Israel (Samaria); see <a href="/hosea/7-1.htm" title="When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief comes in, and the troop of robbers spoils without.">Hosea 7:1</a>; <a href="/hosea/7-5.htm" title="In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.">Hosea 7:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[275] By giving preference, namely, to the reading <span class="greekheb">ἐγείρεται</span>, according to which only the <span class="ital">present</span> appearance of a prophet in Galilee is denied (so also Tiele, <span class="ital">Spec. contin. annotationem in loc. nonnull. ev.

This <span class="greekheb">ἐγείρεται</span> would have its support and meaning only in the experience of history, because <span class="greekheb">προφήτης</span>, without the article, is quite general, and cannot mean the Messiah. This also in answer to Baeumlein.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/7-52.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee?

This remonstrance is exasperatingly true, and turns the bitterness of the Pharisaic party on Nicod mus, <span class="greekheb">μὴ καὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐγήγερται</span>. “Art thou also, as well as Jesus, from Galilee, and thus disposed to befriend your countryman?” <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/mark/14-70.htm" title="And he denied it again.

By this they betray that their own hostility was a merely personal matter, and not founded on careful examination. “Search and see, because [or ‘that’] out of Galilee there arises no prophet.” That is, as Westcott interprets, “Galilee is not the true country of the prophets: we cannot look for Messiah to come from thence”.

Jonah of Gath-hepher (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm" title="He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.">2 Kings 14:25</a>) was certainly of Galilee; Nahum of Elkosh may have been, but the situation of Elkosh is uncertain; Hosea was of the northern kingdom, but whether of Galilee or not is unknown; Abelmeholah, whence Elisha came, was in the north part of the Jordan valley, possibly in Galilee. Anyhow, their statement is only a slight and very natural exaggeration (comp. 4 <span class="ital"><a href="/john/7-29.htm" title="But I know him: for I am from him, and he has sent me.">John 7:29</a></span>). Judging from the past, Galilee was not very likely to produce a Prophet, much less the Messiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of the various questions which arise respecting the paragraph that follows (<a href="/john/7-53.htm" title="And every man went to his own house.">John 7:53</a> to <a href="/john/8-11.htm" title="She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn you: go, and sin no more.">John 8:11</a>) one at least may be answered with something like certainty,—that it is <span class="ital">no part of the Gospel of S. John</span>. (1) In both tone and style it is very unlike his writings. His favourite words and expressions are wanting; others that he rarely or never uses are found. (2) It breaks the course of the narrative, which runs smoothly enough if this paragraph be omitted; and hence a few of the MSS. which contain it place it at the end of the Gospel. (3) All the very serious amount of external evidence which tells against the passage being part of the Gospel narrative at all of course tells against its being by S. John, and in this respect is not counterbalanced by other considerations. So that the internal and external evidence when put together is overwhelmingly against the paragraph being part of the Fourth Gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With regard to the question whether the section is <span class="ital">a genuine portion of the Gospel history</span>, the internal evidence is wholly in favour of its being so, while the balance of external testimony is decidedly on the same side. (1) The style is similar to the Synoptic Gospels, especially to S. Luke; and four inferior MSS. insert the passage at the end of Luke 21, the place m the history into which it fits best. (2) It bears the impress of truth and is fully in harmony with Christ’s conduct on other occasions; yet it is quite original and cannot be a divergent account of any other incident in the Gospels. (3) It is easy to see how prudential reasons may in some cases have caused its omission (the fear of giving, as S. Augustine says, <span class="ital">peccandi impunitatem mulieribus</span>); difficult to see what, excepting its truth, can have caused its insertion. (4) Though it is found in no Greek MS. earlier than the sixth century, nor in the earliest versions, nor is quoted as by S. John until late in the fourth century, yet Jerome says that in his time it was contained ‘<span class="ital">in many Greek and Latin MSS</span>.’ (<span class="ital">Adv. Pelag.</span> ii. 17), and these must have been as good as, or better than, the best MSS. which we now possess.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The question as to <span class="ital">who is the author</span>, cannot be answered. There is not sufficient material for a satisfactory conjecture, and mere guesswork is worthless. The extraordinary number of various readings (80 in 183 words) points to more than one source.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>One more question remains. <span class="ital">How is it that nearly all the MSS. that do contain it</span> (several uncials, including the Cambridge MS., and more than 300 cursives) <span class="ital">agree in inserting it here?</span> This cannot be answered with certainty. <span class="ital">Similarity of matter</span> may have caused it to have been placed in the margin in one copy, and thence it may have passed, as other things have done, into the text of the Cambridge and other MSS. In chap. 7 we have an unsuccessful attempt to ruin Jesus: this paragraph contains the history of another attempt, equally unsuccessful. Or, the incident may have been inserted in the margin in illustration of <a href="/john/8-15.htm" title="You judge after the flesh; I judge no man.">John 8:15</a>, and hence have got into the text.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/7-52.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee?

They sought to fix a contemptuous country cousin sobriquet upon this distinguished man, instead of replying to his sensible inquiry. <span class="cmt_word">Search, and see, that out of Galilee</span> <span class="cmt_word">ariseth</span> <span class="cmt_word">no prophet.</span> The present tense has very nearly the force of the perfect, and denotes the general rule of the Divine providence in the matter. The prophetic order can scarcely be thought to have been recruited from the northern province. Even Hosea had his origin in Samaria. Amos was an inhabitant of Tekoah; twelve miles south of Jerusalem. Nahum the El-koshite cannot be proved to have sprung from the Galilaean town of Elkosh; though it is not impossible, it is at least probable, that Elkosh in Assyria, on the Tigris, two miles north of Mosul and south of Nineveh, was the place whence Nahum and his prophecies issued. Elijah the Tishbite, of the land of Gilead, cannot be claimed as a Gallilaean. The case is different with reference to Jonah of Gath-Hepher, of the tribe of Zebulon (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>), who, as a solitary and by no means morally impressive character, might almost as an exception prove the truth of the general statement. The historical error is far from difficult to account for in the stress of the discontent which these Pharisees were now manifesting towards everything Galilaean. Godet, on the authority of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, being the text, would have it that "there has not now arisen in the Person of Jesus a Prophet." Baumlein presses this still further, by making the "prophet" mean "the Messiah." There is no reasonable ground for charging on these Pharisees "an incredible ignorance or incomprehensible misunderstanding." Such a charge is more like one of the incomprehensible misunderstandings of the modern critical school whenever a chance opens of assailing the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Search<p>Compare <a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>.<p>Look (&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;)<p>Some render see, and translate the following &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, that, instead of for.
