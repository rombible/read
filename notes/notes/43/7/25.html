The popular belief that the immediate ancestry of the Messiah would be unknown when He came, cannot further be historically proved, but is credible, partly from the belief in His divine origin (Bertholdt, <span class="ital">Christol</span>. p. 86), and partly from the obscurity into which the Davidic family had sunk, and was supported, probably, by the import of many O. T. passages, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm" title="For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he has no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.">Isaiah 53:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm" title="He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.">Isaiah 53:8</a>, <a href="/micah/5-2.htm" title="But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall he come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a>, and perhaps also by the sudden appearance of the Son of man related in Daniel 7 (Tholuck), and is strongly confirmed by the description in the book of Enoch of the heavenly Messiah appearing from heaven (Ewald). The passages which Lücke and De Wette quote from Justin (<span class="ital">c. Tryph</span>. pp. 226, 268, 336, ed. Col.) are inapplicable, as they do not speak of an unknown <span class="ital">descent</span> of the Messiah, but intimate that, previous to His anointing by Elias, His Messiahship was unknown to Himself and others. The beginning of Marcion’s Gospel (see Thilo, p. 403), and the Rabbinical passages in Lightfoot and Wetstein, are equally inapplicable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/john/7-25.htm" title="Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?...">John 7:25-31</a>. <span class="ital">Opinion of inhabitants of Jerusalem regarding Jesus</span>.
