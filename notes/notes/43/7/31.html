This opinion was founded on such passages as <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, etc.: "Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped; then shall the lame man leap as an hart," etc. Jesus had given abundant evidence of his power to work such miracles, and they therefore believed that he was the Messiah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31. When Christ cometh, will he, &c.&#8212;that is, If this be not the Christ, what can the Christ do, when He does come, which has not been anticipated and eclipsed by this man?

For though John reports but a few miracles wrought by Christ, yet they were such as required a Divine power to produce; such as turning the water into wine, multiplying the loaves, raising Lazarus from the dead, &c. And John tells us, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/20-30.htm" title="And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:">John 20:30</a> <a href="/john/21-25.htm" title="And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.

From hence may be observed the falsehood of the later Jews, who deny that the Messiah is to work any miracles; for it is apparent from hence, that they had in our Saviour’s time a general expectation that great miracles should be done by the Messiah; and their expectation was truly founded upon <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm" title="Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.">Isaiah 35:5</a>,6</span>, as appeareth by <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/11-5.htm" title="The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.">Matthew 11:5</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And many of the people believed on him,.... Whilst some were displeased at his doctrine, others were induced by his miracles to believe on him, as an extraordinary person, if not the Messiah; and these were the common people, especially those that came out of the country; for the city Jews, and above all the rulers, were very averse to him: and it is easy to observe, that faith in Christ, and true religion, spread and flourish most among the meaner sort of people. <p>And said, when Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? referring not so much to the miracles many of them might have seen done by him in other parts of Judea, and in Galilee; nor only to those he had done in the preceding feasts at Jerusalem, but to those that were done by him now, though not recorded by the evangelist. The Jews expected many miracles to be wrought by the Messiah when he came, and they had good reason for it from <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>. To these Christ sends John the Baptist, and the Jews, for proofs of his being the Messiah, <a href="/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4</a>; and by these he was approved of God as such, <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>. And it is certain that the ancient Jews expected miracles in the days of the Messiah. <p>"Says R. Simeon to Eleazar his son, Eleazar, at the time that the King Messiah is raised up, how many "signs and other wonders" will be done in the world? a little after, from that day all the signs, and "wonders", and "mighty works", which the holy blessed God did in Egypt, he will do to the Israelites, as it is said, <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/7-15.htm">Micah 7:15</a>, "according to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt, will I show unto him marvellous things" (n).'' <p>So the Targumist on <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a> paraphrases thus, <p>"from afflictions and punishment he will deliver our captivity, and "the wonderful things" which shall be done for us in his days, who can tell?'' <p>It is true indeed that the modern Jews have laid aside such expectations, and pretend they were not looked for formerly. Maimonides says (o), <p>"let it not enter into thy heart, that the King Messiah hath need to do signs and wonders (as that he shall renew things in the world, or raise the dead, and the like; these are things which fools speak of); the thing is not so.'' <p>And he instances in Ben Coziba, who set up for the Messiah, of whom R. Akiba, and the rest of the wise men of that age, did not require a sign or miracle: yet this same writer elsewhere says (p), that <p>"all nations shall make peace with the Messiah, and serve him, because of his great righteousness, and the miracles which shall be done by him.'' <p>(n) Zohar in Exod. fol. 3. 4. &amp; 4. 2.((o) Hilchot Melakim, c. 11. sect. 3.((p) In Misn.

The question was like fire in touchwood. A conflagration might at any moment burst from the excitable throng which no decision of the Sanhedrin could repress. Something must at once be done to allay the excitement.
