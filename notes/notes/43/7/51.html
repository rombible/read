He, like they, is an expounder of the Law. The force of the question is in the word “Law,” which they had used but the moment before in their scorn for the people who knew not the Law. “Well, this Law, which we do know and understand, doth it judge without open investigation?” Did they in their blind zeal forget such passages as <a href="/exodus/23-1.htm" title="You shall not raise a false report: put not your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.">Exodus 23:1</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/1-16.htm" title="And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brothers, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.">Deuteronomy 1:16-17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>?

Never any man spake with that wisdom, and power, and grace, that convincing clearness, and that sweetness, wherewith Christ spake. Alas, that many, who are for a time restrained, and who speak highly of the word of Jesus, speedily lose their convictions, and go on in their sins! People are foolishly swayed by outward motives in matters of eternal moment, are willing even to be damned for fashion's sake. As the wisdom of God often chooses things which men despise, so the folly of men commonly despises those whom God has chosen. The Lord brings forward his weak and timid disciples, and sometimes uses them to defeat the designs of his enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Doth our law ... - The law required justice to be done, and gave every man the right to claim a fair and impartial trial, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15-16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1-2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/19-18.htm">Deuteronomy 19:18</a>. Their condemnation of Jesus was a violation of every rule of right. He was not arraigned; he was not heard in self-defense, and not a single witness was adduced. Nicodemus demanded that justice should be done, and that he should, not be condemned until he had had a fair trial. Every man should be presumed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty. This is a maxim of law, and a most just and proper precept in our judgments in private life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>51.
