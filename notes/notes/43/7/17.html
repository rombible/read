It is not deed, which is the outcome of faith; but will, which precedes it, that is here spoken of. This human will to do the divine will is the condition of knowing it. The words are unlimited and far-reaching in their meaning. Those who heard them would naturally understand them, as it was intended they should, of the divine will expressed in the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/john/7-19.htm" title="Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why go you about to kill me?">John 7:19</a>), but they include the will of God revealed, more or less clearly, to all men and in all times. Our thoughts dwell naturally on representative lives, such as those of Saul the Pharisee, Cornelius the centurion, Justin the philosopher; but the truth holds good for every honest heart in every walk of life. The “any man” of Christ’s own words excludes none from its reach, and the voice of comfort and of hope is spoken alike to all in our ignorance, fears, doubts—that he who in very deed willeth to do God’s will, shall not fail to know, now or in the life to come, of the teaching whether it be of God.

His doctrine is not his own finding out, but is from God's word, through the teaching of his Spirit. And amidst the disputes which disturb the world, if any man, of any nation, seeks to do the will of God, he shall know whether the doctrine is of God, or whether men speak of themselves. Only those who hate the truth shall be given up to errors which will be fatal. Surely it was as agreeable to the design of the sabbath to restore health to the afflicted, as to administer an outward rite. Jesus told them to decide on his conduct according to the spiritual import of the Divine law. We must not judge concerning any by their outward appearance, but by their worth, and by the gifts and graces of God's Spirit in them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If any man will do his will - Literally, if any man wills or is willing to do the will of God. If there is a disposition in anyone to do that will, though he should not be able perfectly to keep His commandments. To do the will of God is to obey His commandments; to yield our hearts and lives to His requirements. A disposition to do His will is a readiness to yield our intellects, our feelings, and all that we have entirely to Him, to be governed according to His pleasure.<p>He shall know - He shall have evidence, in the very attempt to do the will of God, of the truth of the doctrine. This evidence is internal, and to the individual it is satisfactory and conclusive. It is of two kinds.<p>1. He will find that the doctrines which Jesus taught are such as commend themselves to his reason and conscience, and such as are consistent with all that we know of the perfections of God. His doctrines commend themselves to us as fitted to make us pure and happy, and of course they are such as must be from God.<p>2. An honest desire to obey God will lead a man to embrace the great doctrines of the Bible. He will find that his heart is depraved and inclined to evil, and he will see and feel the truth of the doctrine of depravity; he will find that he is a sinner and needs to be born again; he will learn his own weakness, and see his need of a Saviour, of an atonement, and of pardoning mercy; he will feel that he is polluted, and needs the purifying influence of the Holy Spirit.<p>Thus, we may learn:<p>1. That an honest effort to obey God is the easiest way to become acquainted with the doctrines of the Bible.<p>2. Those who make such an effort will not cavil at any of the doctrines of the Scriptures.<p>3. This is evidence of the truth of revelation which every person can apply to his own case.<p>4. It is such evidence as to lead to certainty. No one who has ever made an honest effort to live a pious life, and to do all the will of God, has ever had any doubt of the truth of the Saviour's doctrines, or any doubt that his religion is true and is suited to the nature of man. They only doubt the truth of religion who wish to live in sin.<p>5. We see the goodness of God in giving us evidence of his truth that may be within every man's reach. It does not require great learning to be a Christian, and to be convinced of the truth of the Bible. It requires an honest heart, and a willingness to obey God.<p>Whether it be of God - Whether it be divine.<p>Or whether I speak of myself - Of myself without being commissioned or directed by God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

A principle of immense importance, showing, on the one hand, that singleness of desire to please God is the grand inlet to light on all questions vitally affecting one's eternal interests, and on the other, that the want of his, whether perceived or not, is the chief cause of infidelity amidst the light of revealed religion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here our Saviour seemeth to obviate an objection which the Jews would make, viz. How they should know that the doctrine which he preached was the doctrine of God? He indeed said so, but how should they have any evidence of it? How could he make it appear to them to be of God? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If any man</span> (saith our Saviour) <span class="bld">will do his will, </span>& c.; that is, If any man hath a heart truly disposed to know and embrace whatsoever shall be revealed to him to be the will of God, how contrary soever it be to the interest of his own lusts, and ready to do it in all things, and live according to the prescript and revelation of it, having a serious purpose of heart to obey God in every thing; if he seeketh for truth seriously, and in the fear of the Lord, laying aside all wrath, malice, hatred, and any corrupt passions or affections; God will reveal the truth to him, so as he shall know the doctrine that is of God; and that I do not speak of or from myself, but by authority from my Father. Now, from hence indeed followeth, that corrupt affections, passions, and prejudices, and an ill life, may prejudice, yea, and will prejudice, men from receiving of the free grace of God, spiritual illuminations, and the gift of faith; so as men that give way to such prejudices, or nourish such passions, or live such lives, shall be left of God to their native blindness, and to strong delusions, and not discern the truth in the light that openly shineth in their faces. But from hence it will not follow, that a moral life, and a study of and seeking after truth, are the cause of faith, or effective of it, with the working of our own will. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If any man will do his will,.... Meaning, not one that perfectly fulfils the law, which is the good, and perfect, and acceptable will of God; for there is no man that does this, or can do it; nor is it so said here, "if any man do his will", but "if any man will do" it; that is, is desirous of doing it; who has it wrought in him both to will and do, of the good pleasure of God, by his grace and Spirit; with whom to will is present, though, he has not power to perform, and so is a spiritual man; and who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, which is one branch of the will of God; and who depends upon the Spirit and grace of God, and acts from a principle of love to God, and in the exercise of faith on Christ: <p>he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself; not a man of mere natural knowledge and learning, or a man of theory and speculation, is a judge of doctrine; but he that leans not to his own understanding, and implores the assistance of the Divine Spirit, and who is for reducing doctrine into practice: he knows by the efficacy of the doctrine upon his heart, and the influence it has on his life and conversation; by its coming not in word only, but in power; and by its working effectually in him, whether it is divine or human, of God or of man. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>. <span class="ital">The condition of knowing this is</span> that <span class="ital">one be willing</span>—have it as the moral aim of his self-determination—<span class="ital">to do the will of God</span>. He who is wanting in this, who lacks fundamentally the moral determination of his mind towards God, and to whom, therefore, Christ’s teaching is something strange, for the recognition of which as divine there is in the ungodly bias of his will no point of contact or of sympathy; this knowledge is to him a moral impossibility. But, on the contrary, the bias towards the fulfilling of God’s will is the subjective factor necessary to the recognition of divine doctrine as such; for this doctrine produces the immediate conviction that it is certainly divine by virtue of the moral <span class="greekheb">ὁμοιότης</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὁμοιοπάθεια</span> of its nature with the man’s own nature.

Accordingly, we certainly have in this passage the <span class="ital">testimonium internum</span>, but not in the ordinary theological sense, as a thing for those who already believe, but for those who do not yet believe, and to whom the divine teaching of the Lord presents itself for the first time.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">θέλῃ</span> is not superfluous (Wolf, Loesner, and most), but is the very <span class="ital">nerve</span> of the relation; note the “suavis harmonia” (Bengel) between <span class="greekheb">θέλῃ</span> and <span class="greekheb">θέλημα</span>.

II</span>. p. 130, etc. <span class="ital">No one truly ever denied that some</span> knowledge of the truth <span class="ital">is required in him whose</span> will <span class="ital">is to be bent to better things. For instance, in this very passage, which is at present under discussion. Christ appeals to</span> His doctrine, <span class="ital">which had been set before the Jews. But what, I would ask, was the cause that they were not able more fully</span> to know <span class="ital">and embrace it</span> as divine? <span class="ital">Either I, for my part, have no discrimination at all, or else their perverse</span> will <span class="ital">was the hindrance that prevented them from being able to progress farther in the knowledge of the Divine truth. I confess that I feel in no small degree distressed when I find that abuses are attributed to that sentiment, whereby it is believed</span> that the knowledge of the truth is promoted by the existence of a good will [to obey it]. <span class="ital">Cæteris paribus</span>, the will <span class="ital">is no doubt emended</span> by the knowledge of the truth. <span class="ital">But that, in its turn</span>, a more intimate <span class="ital">access</span> to the truth <span class="ital">is thrown open by the obedience</span> of the will, <span class="ital">both this very declaration of the Divine Saviour, and the whole of Scripture besides, openly testify. That most established axiom</span>, that “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” <span class="ital">is superior to all the subtlety of all the learned. Nor can I think that their design is one to be laughed at, who profess that they are engaged in this or that</span> style of writing <span class="ital">with the view rather of bending</span> the will (fürs Herz, <span class="ital">for the heart</span>) <span class="ital">than of informing</span> the understanding (für den Verstand, <span class="ital">for the intellect</span>). <span class="ital">A greater or less degree of</span> knowledge, <span class="ital">to wit, being supposed, it is altogether possible to happen, nay, even it ought to be the result, that the</span> foolish in mind <span class="ital">should be stirred up to weigh the momentous realities of truth, of which they were not altogether ignorant before, and to overcome in faith the obstacles in the way, by that declaration</span>, “To Him that hath it is given.” <span class="ital">He who so lays out the first, as it were, stamina of knowledge, that he establishes it as a fixed principle with himself</span> to obey GOD, <span class="ital">will soon outstrip in the knowledge of the truth, so far as it conduces to salvation, many who, however extensively learned</span>, are unwilling <span class="ital">to give themselves up as servants to</span> GOD. <span class="ital">Comp. not. on</span> <a href="/john/6-69.htm" title="And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God.">John 6:69</a>; <a href="/john/10-38.htm" title="But if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works: that you may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.">John 10:38</a>. <span class="ital">Nor am I ashamed to repeat that saying</span> of Ambrose, “Do not understand, in order that you may believe, but believe, in order that you may understand. Understanding is the reward [wages] of faith.” <span class="ital">Moreover with these remarks it will be of use now for the reader</span>, who reverences GOD, <span class="ital">to compare the remarks which our illustr. Lord Chanc</span>., D. Reuss, <span class="ital">has briefly but spiritedly written in the Elam. Theol. Mor. c. v.</span> § 23, etc.—E. B.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - The moral test is then applied to the great dictum which he had just uttered. <span class="cmt_word">If any man willeth</span> - not merely desires, but performs the distinct act of willing - <span class="cmt_word">to do his will</span> - as his will - <span class="cmt_word">he shall know;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his intellectual faculty will be quickened into high activity by this moral and practical effort. If the Divine will concerning conduct meets the spontaneous act of the human will, if a man's will is set to fulfil the Divine will, to will and do what is revealed to him by God, the eye of the soul will be opened to see other things as well, and especially will have power to discern the all-pervading Divine element in this teaching of mine. <span class="cmt_word">He shall know concerning</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the teaching, whether it be of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">God, or whether I speak from myself</span> - from the simple ground of my own independent, self-taught humanity. The first and natural application of this mighty dictum and condition was a test by which the Jews might come at once to the understanding of his more than prophetic claim to teach - he having never learned in their rabbinical schools. It amounted to this: Your moral harmony with the will of God as already revealed to you will be the sure index and confirmation of the great fact I have just referred to. You will discern the Divine in my words, the absolutely true in my teaching. Here the Lord again refers to the great principle, "He that hath heard of the Father, and learned, cometh unto me;" "He that is of the truth heareth my voice." This moral submission to God will quicken all your powers to discern and come to an invincible assent as to my claims. This is not the deep subjective testimony of the inner intuition of those that already believe, by which a verbal assent becomes a fall consent, an unchangeable conviction, or "the full assurance of faith;" but it is addressed to <span class="accented">unbelievers</span>, and assures those who are bewildered by the novelty and sweep of his own words that, if they are set on doing the will of God, they will become perfectly satisfied that his own teaching, such as it is, is a stream of heavenly truth bursting from the very heart of God. The text has been cited by certain writers as the sum totel of the Christian revelation, almost as though it substituted practical obedience for true thinking, as though people might well be content with holy living, and might safely leave the decision of all difficult problems of thought and revelation to shift for themselves. Nothing could be further from its real meaning, either at the time or in any of its subsequent  or universal applications. The solemn utterance has a wide outlook, and is constantly establishing its own verity. A profound and voluntary desire to do the will of God is the best preparation for intuitively perceiving the Divine authority of Christ and of his religion. The desire for holiness of principle and life sees in Christ not only the loftiest ideal of perfection, but the surest satisfaction to its conscious weakness, and casts itself upon his promises of saving power. The faith which is satisfied with Christ is not merely a conclusion drawn by logical processes from satisfactory premisses, it is the consequence of a new nature or a moral regeneration. In other words, it is the more practical and expanded form of the truth first of all addressed to Nicodemus, and also lying at the heart of the Beatitudes: "Except a man be born anew [from above], he cannot see the kingdom of God." If he is born again he <span class="accented">will</span> see it. "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." "No man can come unto me except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him." The sentence presents the truth in a hopeful and positive form, and puts the criterion of the Divine informant within the reach of practical ethics. It is an appeal to the conscience as well as to the understanding. Apart from the subjective moral element, all other evidences of the presence of the Divine in nature, in history, in Christ, will be unimpressive and unimportant. A willingness to do the will of God is not a substitute for, but a condition of, true knowledge. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Will do his will (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>This is a notable illustration of the frequent blunder of the A.V. in rendering &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, to will or determine, as a mere auxiliary verb.
