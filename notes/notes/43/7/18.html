(See Notes on <a href="/context/john/5-41.htm" title="I receive not honor from men.">John 5:41-44</a>.) They contrast His position and that of His hearers. Professional teachers, they sought glory one from another, and regarded their teaching as of themselves, the special honour of their caste. In the pride of their own knowledge they willed not the glory of God, and so had not the faculty to know and receive His teaching. He sought the will of Him that sent Him, and therefore was true, in harmony with the eternal will of God. The effect of the submission of His will to the Father’s, and His seeking in word and work the Father’s glory, was that there was no possibility of unrighteousness in Him. This emphasis laid upon truth and righteousness has reference to the charges which they are plotting against Him, and which have already been expressed in the murmuring of the multitude (<a href="/john/7-12.htm" title="And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people.">John 7:12</a>). The words are clearly to be explained with special reference to their position and His, but the general form of the expressions, “He that speaketh of himself . . .” “He that seeketh His glory . . .” show that this is not the exclusive reference. They, too, hold good of every man who speaketh of himself, and of every man who seeketh the glory of Him that sent Him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:14-24 Every faithful minister may humbly adopt Christ's words. His doctrine is not his own finding out, but is from God's word, through the teaching of his Spirit. And amidst the disputes which disturb the world, if any man, of any nation, seeks to do the will of God, he shall know whether the doctrine is of God, or whether men speak of themselves. Only those who hate the truth shall be given up to errors which will be fatal. Surely it was as agreeable to the design of the sabbath to restore health to the afflicted, as to administer an outward rite. Jesus told them to decide on his conduct according to the spiritual import of the Divine law. We must not judge concerning any by their outward appearance, but by their worth, and by the gifts and graces of God's Spirit in them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That speaketh of himself - This does not mean about or concerning himself, but he that speaks by his own authority, without being sent by God, as mere human teachers do.<p>Seeketh his own glory - His own praise, or seeks for reputation and applause.

He is not an impostor. It is used in the same sense in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:10-12</a>. It is true that there was no unrighteousness, no sin in Jesus Christ, but that is not the truth taught here. It is that he was not an impostor, and the evidence of this was that he sought not his own glory, but the honor of God. This evidence was furnished:<p>1. in his retiring, unobtrusive disposition; in his not seeking the applause of people;<p>2. in his teaching such doctrines as tended to exalt God and humble man;<p>3. in his ascribing all glory and praise to God; <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. seeketh his own glory&#8212;(See on [1800]Joh 5:41-44).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here our Saviour giveth them another note, by which they might know that his doctrine was of God, because he spake not of himself, nor sought his own glory in what he delivered. No man doth an action of and from himself, but he maketh himself the end of his action; for to what purpose should a man devise and broach new notions, but for some selfish advantage, that he may get some profit, or some honour and applause from men? But if a man acts as servant to another, and seeketh only the honour and applause of another, he is true, and cannot be presumed to have spoken of and from himself, but of and from him whose honour and glory he seeketh to advance; and in reason ought to be judged sincere and faithful in the execution of the trust committed to him, and to be without fraud and deceit, having no unrighteousness in him; there being no just cause to be presumed which should move him to speak any thing that is false. Hence also may be learned a good rule or direction, which divines ordinarily make use of to help us to judge of the truth of doctrines. Those doctrines which most tend to the advancing the honour and glory of God, and least to the advancement of the creature, those are most likely to be of God. And this also much tendeth to confirm the reputation of holy writ, and the penmen of it; for it is manifest that the penmen of it sought not their own glory in their writings, but the honour and glory of God, taking all shame to themselves. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He that speaketh of himself,.....

There are also two different kinds of teachers: the one <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἑαυτοῦ λαλῶν</span>, speaks his own mind, teaches his own ideas, does not represent God and reveal His mind; because he <span class="greekheb">τὴν δόξαν τὴν ἰδίαν ζητεῖ</span>, “seeks his own glory,” which of course cannot be reached by representing himself to be merely the herald of another’s glory. The other style of teacher is described in the words <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ ζητῶν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἔστιν</span>. Plainly He who seeks the glory of Him whose ambassador He is, has no interest in falsifying matters to advance His own interests. If His aim is to advance the glory of Him who has sent Him, He will truthfully deliver His message; <span class="greekheb">ἀληθής ἐστι</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀδικία</span> … and injustice, dishonesty, is not in Him. The application of this general principle to Jesus was obvious.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. Proof almost in the form of a syllogism that He does not speak of Himself. It applies to Christ alone. Human teachers who seek God’s glory are not thereby secured from erroneous teaching. These verses (16–18) remind us, and might remind some of His hearers of an earlier discourse delivered in Jerusalem some seven months before: comp. <a href="/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19</a>; <a href="/john/5-30.htm" title="I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me.">John 5:30</a>; <a href="/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37</a>; <a href="/john/5-44.htm" title="How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?">John 5:44</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the same is true</span>] and therefore does not speak of himself, for whoever speaks what comes from himself is not true.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">no unrighteousness is in him</span>] Or, <span class="bld">unrighteousness is not in him</span>. S. John does not say ‘falsehood’ as we might expect, but uses a wider word which points out the moral root of the falsehood. Comp. <a href="/john/8-46.htm" title="Which of you convinces me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?">John 8:46</a>. Throughout S. John’s writings the connexion between truth and righteousness, falsehood and unrighteousness is often brought before us. Hence his peculiar phrases ‘to <span class="ital">do</span> the truth’ (<a href="/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a>), ‘to do a lie’ (<a href="/revelation/21-27.htm" title="And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defiles, neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.">Revelation 21:27</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-15.htm" title="For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.">Revelation 22:15</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no need to suppose that anything is omitted between 18 and 19, though the transition is abrupt.

But while it has numerous applications, its first use is to ratify the previous statements, and prepare the way for what is to follow. <span class="cmt_word">He that speaketh from himself.</span> This was an act which he, in his own case, disclaimed. The "himself" was here the personality which then was in question as a human Teacher. <span class="accented">He that speaketh from himself</span> as the Source of all his instructions. He who would take the credit of being the primal Cause and Orion of the message which he delivers is a man who <span class="cmt_word">seeketh his own glory,</span> his own reputation, at the expense of those who instructed him. The Jewish schoolmen were most anxious at all times to found their instructions on Rabbi "This," or "That," who had himself quoted from some more ancient father of their erudition. A man who should presume to teach in his own name would be one who was manifestly not seeking any higher end than his own glory. Ambition of personal glory and renown is the very thing the absence of which the multitude condemned in Christ's case. The brethren of Jesus had tauuted him with the lack of bold self assertion. Our Lord's own position just taken was that his teaching was not self-originated, but was the teaching or message "of him that sent him." <span class="cmt_word">But whoso</span> (he added) <span class="cmt_word">seeketh the glory of him that sent him</span>, whether the sender be a mortal man and earthly teacher, or be the Lord God of the whole world, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "whoso loses his own individual purpose in the will of God, and is content to be nothing so that God may be glorified," <span class="cmt_word">this person</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is true,</span> trustworthy; his message is not perverted by any of the contaminating influences of the self-hood, or flesh, <span class="cmt_word">and there is no unrighteousness</span> (<span class="greek_word">a)diki/a</span> is a stronger antithesis to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> than <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is.

It is a reply to the charge that "he deceiveth the people." It is a further challenge to those who are willing to do the will of God. It is a summons to proceed a step further, and recognize the fact that the glory of God, and not his own glory, was the sole end of his teaching, and that the direct command from him that sent him formed the substance of his doctrine, however much it might clash with their preconceived ideas or dominant prejudices. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>His own glory (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Literally, the glow which is His own; the second article throwing His own into sharp contrast with His that sent Him.
