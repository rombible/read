His business was to preach the gospel of the kingdom, and he readily did it in every time and place of concourse: and doubtless vast multitudes would be assembled in the temple on this occasion. <span class="ital">And the Jews who heard him marvelled </span>— Were amazed, both at the excellence and importance of the doctrines which he delivered, and at the clear, convincing, and forcible manner in which he declared them: <span class="ital">saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned </span>— How comes he to be so well acquainted with sacred literature, as to be able thus to expound the Scriptures with such propriety and gracefulness; <span class="ital">having never learned </span>— Seeing he hath never learned this at any place of education? <span class="ital">Jesus answered, My doctrine is not mine </span>— It is not the product of human wisdom: I have neither been taught it by masters, nor have I acquired it by my own study: <span class="ital">but his that sent me</span> — It is the doctrine of God, who has inspired me with it because I am his messenger. <span class="ital">If any man will do his will </span>— <span class="greekheb">Εαν τις θελη</span>, <span class="ital">if any man be willing, </span>especially if he be also desirous and determined, in dependance on divine grace, to do God’s will, as far as he is acquainted with it; <span class="ital">he shall know of the doctrine, </span>&c. — A universal rule this with regard to all persons and doctrines. They that are thoroughly willing and desirous to comply with the will of God, shall certainly have his will made known to them. Observe here, reader, who these are: they are such as are impartial and sincere in their inquiries concerning it, and are not biased by any carnal inclinations or interests; they are such as are convinced of the infinite importance of knowing and doing his will, in order to their eternal salvation, being persuaded that only those that know and do it shall enter the kingdom of heaven: <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm" title="Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 7:21</a>. They are such as carefully and diligently use the means which God has appointed to be used in order thereto; especially the means of prayer, for supernatural light, and of hearing, reading, and meditating on the word of God. Such shall know the doctrine of Christ, and the will of God; 1st, Because Christ has promised to give them that knowledge, namely, by opening the eyes of their understanding, which he is well able to do. Those who improve the light they have, and carefully walk according to it, shall, by divine grace, have that light increased, and be thereby secured against all destructive and hurtful errors. 2d, Because they are prepared to receive that knowledge. Those that are inclined to submit to the rules of the divine law, are disposed to admit the rays of the divine light. Those whose desire and care it is to resemble God, are in the fittest disposition to become acquainted with him. <span class="ital">Whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself </span>— Pious and good men can easily judge of any teacher, whether he and his doctrine come from God; not only because the divine wisdom and goodness are interested to secure such from capital errors, but because they themselves have no predominant evil inclinations to prejudice them against the truth when it appears; and because they can discern how far any doctrine is conformable to the principles of piety and virtue which they possess. <span class="ital">He</span> <span class="ital">that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory </span>— If one teaches what makes for the advancement of his own worldly interest, or for the gratification of his pride, or any other evil passion, the doers of the will of God will immediately know that such a teacher is an impostor. <span class="ital">But he that seeketh his glory that sent him, </span>&c. — Whereas, if a teacher proposes doctrines which have a tendency to reform men, and to advance the glory of God, without regard to the opinion of the world, or to his own temporal interest; <span class="ital">the same is true — </span>He must certainly be sent of God, and should not by any means be suspected of imposture; <span class="ital">and no unrighteousness is in him </span>— No falsehood, no design to deceive the world.

His doctrine is not his own finding out, but is from God's word, through the teaching of his Spirit. And amidst the disputes which disturb the world, if any man, of any nation, seeks to do the will of God, he shall know whether the doctrine is of God, or whether men speak of themselves. Only those who hate the truth shall be given up to errors which will be fatal. Surely it was as agreeable to the design of the sabbath to restore health to the afflicted, as to administer an outward rite. Jesus told them to decide on his conduct according to the spiritual import of the Divine law. We must not judge concerning any by their outward appearance, but by their worth, and by the gifts and graces of God's Spirit in them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>About the midst - Or about the middle of the feast.

For the rest, the discourses which follow, and the discussions onwards to chap. 10, are not (with Weizsäcker) to be ranked as parallel with the synoptical accounts of proceedings in Jerusalem, but are wholly independent of them, and must be attributed to the vivid recollections of the evangelist himself regarding a time unnoticed by the Synoptics. Over and above this, we must, as an historical necessity, expect to find many points of resemblance in the several encounters of Jesus with His Jewish opponents.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/john/7-14.htm" title="Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught....">John 7:14-36</a>. <span class="ital">He teaches, and discussions regarding Him are evoked</span>.—<a href="/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a> -end. <span class="ital">His manifestation on the last day of the Feast, and the consequent action of the Sanhedrim</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">about the midst of the feast</span>] Literally, <span class="ital">But now, when the feast was at the middle</span>, or <span class="ital">was half way past</span>; i.e. about the fourth day.
