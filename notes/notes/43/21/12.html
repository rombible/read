It is good for the disciples of Christ to be together in common conversation, and common business. The hour for their entering upon action was not come. They would help to maintain themselves, and not be burdensome to any. Christ's time of making himself known to his people, is when they are most at a loss. He knows the temporal wants of his people, and has promised them not only grace sufficient, but food convenient. Divine Providence extends itself to things most minute, and those are happy who acknowledge God in all their ways. Those who are humble, diligent, and patient, though their labours may be crossed, shall be crowned; they sometimes live to see their affairs take a happy turn, after many struggles. And there is nothing lost by observing Christ's orders; it is casting the net on the right side of the ship. Jesus manifests himself to his people by doing that for them which none else can do, and things which they looked not for. He would take care that those who left all for him, should not want any good thing. And latter favours are to bring to mind former favours, that eaten bread may not be forgotten. He whom Jesus loved was the first that said, It is the Lord. John had cleaved most closely to his Master in his sufferings, and knew him soonest. Peter was the most zealous, and reached Christ the first. How variously God dispenses his gifts, and what difference there may be between some believers and others in the way of their honouring Christ, yet they all may be accepted of him! Others continue in the ship, drag the net, and bring the fish to shore, and such persons ought not to be blamed as worldly; for they, in their places, are as truly serving Christ as the others. The Lord Jesus had provision ready for them. We need not be curious in inquiring whence this came; but we may be comforted at Christ's care for his disciples. Although there were so many, and such great fishes, yet they lost none, nor damaged their net. The net of the gospel has enclosed multitudes, yet it is as strong as ever to bring souls to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Come and dine - The word in the original means the meal which is taken in the morning, or breakfast. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-14. none &#8230; durst ask him, Who art thou, knowing it was the Lord&#8212;implying that they would have liked Him just to say, "It is I"; but having such convincing evidence they were afraid of being "upbraided for their unbelief and hardness of heart" if they ventured to put the question.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It was in the morning, and may as well be translated, Come and break your fasts, as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Come and dine.</span> They now knew it was the Lord, if not by his face and voice, yet by this miracle; therefore they durst not ask him, for fear of a sharp reproof, after he had by such a miraculous operation made himself known to them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus saith unto them, come and dine,.... One would think it should rather have been said, come and take a breakfast than a dinner, since it was so early in the morning: but Grotius has observed, out of Homer, that  is used for food taken in a morning; so that it may signify here, not what we properly call dining, but eating a morning's meal; and may be an emblem of that spiritual refreshment believers enjoy with Christ in his house and ordinances now, and of those everlasting pleasures they will partake with him in the resurrection morn: and it is to be observed, that he does not say go and dine, but come and dine; that is, along with himself: he does not send his disciples elsewhere for food, but invites them to come to him, to hear his word, which is food for faith, to wait in his house, where plenty of provision is made, and to attend on his ordinances, and in all to feed upon himself, and to feed with him; to all which they are heartily welcome. <p>And none of the disciples durst ask him, who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord: to ask such a question was altogether unnecessary, and would have been impertinent, and they might justly have been upbraided and rebuked for it: it would have looked like insolence, or unbelief, or both, and that greatly aggravated, when it was so clear a case that it was the Lord; who might be known by his voice and person, especially when they came near to him, and also by the miracles which he wrought: so at the last day, when every eye shall see him coming in the clouds of heaven, none will ask who he is; all will know him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine.

He calls them to the repast. He becomes once more their Host and their Minister. Even still, metaphorically, he washes their feet. He attends to their requirements. He feeds them from this strangely bestowed supply. He joins them in their hunger for souls. He inspires their methods. He shares in their victory, after painful fruitless toil. <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> <span class="cmt_word">not one</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not even Thomas - <span class="cmt_word">of the disciples durst inquire of him</span> - put to him the interrogatory - <span class="cmt_word">Who art thou</span>? <span class="cmt_word">knowing</span>, each one of them <span class="cmt_word">that it was the Lord</span>.

These they possessed. A feeling of awe and reverence possessed them. They were of one mind about the marvelous revelation of himself to them. Some strange emotion sealed their lips. He had not manifested himself to the world, but to his disciples, and to them by "the interpretations they were putting upon their own experience" (Westcott). They knew it was the Lord. They looked into that other world. They were lost in silent amaze, and received the revelation once more of their risen Master and Lord. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Dine (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Rather, breakfast. In Attic Greek &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; signified the mid-day meal; the evening meal being known as &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. The regular hour for the &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; cannot be fixed with precision. The drift of authority among Greek writers seems to be in favor of noon. The meal described here, however, evidently took place at an earlier hour, and would seem to have answered more nearly to the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, or breakfast of the Greeks, which was taken directly upon rising. Plutarch, however, expressly states that both names were applied to the morning meal, and says of Alexander, "He was accustomed to breakfast (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;) at early dawn, sitting, and to sup (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;) late in the evening." In <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-4.htm">Matthew 22:4</a>, it is an &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; to which the king's wedding-guests are invited.<p>Ask (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;.&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., inquire.

It occurs only three times in the New Testament; of Herod's command to search diligently for the infant Christ (<a href="/matthew/2-8.htm">Matthew 2:8</a>), and of the apostles' inquiring out the worthy members of a household (<a href="/matthew/10-11.htm">Matthew 10:11</a>). </body></html>
