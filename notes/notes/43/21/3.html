It is good for the disciples of Christ to be together in common conversation, and common business. The hour for their entering upon action was not come. They would help to maintain themselves, and not be burdensome to any. Christ's time of making himself known to his people, is when they are most at a loss. He knows the temporal wants of his people, and has promised them not only grace sufficient, but food convenient. Divine Providence extends itself to things most minute, and those are happy who acknowledge God in all their ways. Those who are humble, diligent, and patient, though their labours may be crossed, shall be crowned; they sometimes live to see their affairs take a happy turn, after many struggles. And there is nothing lost by observing Christ's orders; it is casting the net on the right side of the ship. Jesus manifests himself to his people by doing that for them which none else can do, and things which they looked not for. He would take care that those who left all for him, should not want any good thing. And latter favours are to bring to mind former favours, that eaten bread may not be forgotten. He whom Jesus loved was the first that said, It is the Lord. John had cleaved most closely to his Master in his sufferings, and knew him soonest. Peter was the most zealous, and reached Christ the first. How variously God dispenses his gifts, and what difference there may be between some believers and others in the way of their honouring Christ, yet they all may be accepted of him! Others continue in the ship, drag the net, and bring the fish to shore, and such persons ought not to be blamed as worldly; for they, in their places, are as truly serving Christ as the others. The Lord Jesus had provision ready for them. We need not be curious in inquiring whence this came; but we may be comforted at Christ's care for his disciples. Although there were so many, and such great fishes, yet they lost none, nor damaged their net. The net of the gospel has enclosed multitudes, yet it is as strong as ever to bring souls to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That night they caught nothing - This was so ordered in the providence of God that the miracle which was performed might appear more remarkable. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-6.

Though they were called to the work of the ministry, yet, churches not yet being gathered and constituted able to maintain them, they did not judge it unlawful to employ themselves in honest vocations, which might bring in something of a livelihood; no more did Paul afterward. The others resolve to go with Peter.

Which was his business before his conversion; and now having nothing to do, and his Lord and master having, as yet, no service for him in the ministry of the word, until the Spirit was poured down in an extraordinary manner, which was given to be expected, in the mean while he was inclined to, and resolved upon taking up his former employment; partly that he might not live an idle life, and partly to obtain a livelihood, which was now to be sought after in another manner, since the death of Christ; and these inclinations and resolutions of his he signifies to the rest of the disciples, who agreed with him: <p>they say unto him, we also go with thee; that is, a fishing; for it seems to have been the business and employment of them all formerly: the place they went to was the sea of Tiberias, as appears from <a href="/john/21-1.htm">John 21:1</a> a place free for any to fish at. This is said to be one of the ten traditions which Joshua delivered to the children of Israel, when he divided the land among them (z): <p>"that any man should be free to catch fish in the waters (or sea) of Tiberias; and he might fish with an hook only; but he might not spread a net, or place a ship there, except the children of the tribe to whom that sea belonged in their division.'' <p>But now these disciples, or the greater part of them at least, belonging to the tribe and division in which the sea was, had a right to carry a ship or boat thither, and make use of a net, as they did. Besides, there was another reason for fishing here, because there were no unclean fish; for the Jews say (a), that <p>"in a place of running water no clean fish goes along with unclean fish, and lo, the sea of Tiberias is  , "as running waters".'' <p>They went forth: from the house, town, or city where they were, whether Capernaum, or Bethsaida, or Tiberias itself: <p>and entered into a ship immediately; which was either one of their own, that belonged to some one of them before their call; which though they had left, had reserved their right and claim unto; see <a href="/luke/5-3.htm">Luke 5:3</a> or which they hired for their present purpose: the word immediately is not in the Vulgate Latin, nor in the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, nor in Beza's ancient copy: <p>and that night they caught nothing. They went out in the evening of the day, and fished all night, that being a proper time for such business, and the most likely to succeed in, but caught no fish, or very little: and so it is sometimes with Gospel ministers, who are fishers of men, though they take every opportunity, and the most proper methods to gain souls to Christ, yet sometimes do not succeed; which makes things look dark and gloomy in their apprehensions. <p>(z) Maimon.

The abruptness of the language addressed to six (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>) disciples, who seemed to be living as in one family, suggests a lengthened waiting, and some disappointment as to the effect upon their daily life of the great revelation. They are summoned by the most commanding spirit among them to resume what was, for some of them at least, their customary calling. He would seek in humble fashion, along the lines of ordinary duty to his family and himself, the supply of daily wants. According to some writers, Peter felt a presentiment of the coming of his Lord under scenes identical with those of his first call (<a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1-11</a>). According to others, Peter exhibited some of the heart-sickness of deferred hope. On either supposition we see a new illustration of, and testimony to, the character of the man who was so conspicuous an initiator. <span class="cmt_word">They say to him, We also come</span> (or, go) <span class="cmt_word">with thee.</span> They do not "follow" him, as they had been summoned once to follow their Lord; but they are willing, even eager, to accompany the strong-hearted man, and ready to take his lead. They share at once either in his presentiment or in the expression of his delayed hope. <span class="cmt_word">They went forth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the home which they had made for themselves on this well-remembered spot - from Capernaum, which was most probably the early home of Peter, and a spot to which he would naturally revert. <span class="cmt_word">And entered into the ship</span>; the veritable vessel that had often served them on that lake of storms. Though Peter and Andrew, James and John, had left their boats and nets and hired servants, it is not unlikely that members of their two families had retained them. <span class="cmt_word">And that night they took nothing</span>. Let the unusual word be noticed. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> occurs three times in this brief narrative and six times in the Gospel, in the sense of "laying hold," "taking possession of," but nowhere in the synoptists. It occurs, however, in <a href="/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>; Ecclus. 23. 21; and, what is more remarkable, in the sense of "taking animals" in <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); so the LXX. for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;</span> (<a href="/songs/2-15.htm">Song of Solomon 2:15</a>). The night was then, as now, the most convenient time for fishing, and the fruitless effort must have reminded them of the night described in <a href="/luke/5.htm">Luke 5</a>. Some critics have supposed this failure to be parabolic or symbolic of the comparatively barren results of the apostolic ministry to the Jews, while what followed was prophetic of the great success which should accompany their appeal to the Gentiles. But Peter's wonderful success on the Day of Pentecost and on subsequent occasions in dealing with Jews, contradicts this interpretation. The only analogy which offers itself to our minds is the limited success of all their endeavors until the apostles were veritably endowed with power from on high. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A ship (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., the boat; restoring the article, which indicates a familiar implement.
