It is good for the disciples of Christ to be together in common conversation, and common business. The hour for their entering upon action was not come. They would help to maintain themselves, and not be burdensome to any. Christ's time of making himself known to his people, is when they are most at a loss. He knows the temporal wants of his people, and has promised them not only grace sufficient, but food convenient. Divine Providence extends itself to things most minute, and those are happy who acknowledge God in all their ways. Those who are humble, diligent, and patient, though their labours may be crossed, shall be crowned; they sometimes live to see their affairs take a happy turn, after many struggles. And there is nothing lost by observing Christ's orders; it is casting the net on the right side of the ship. Jesus manifests himself to his people by doing that for them which none else can do, and things which they looked not for. He would take care that those who left all for him, should not want any good thing. And latter favours are to bring to mind former favours, that eaten bread may not be forgotten. He whom Jesus loved was the first that said, It is the Lord. John had cleaved most closely to his Master in his sufferings, and knew him soonest. Peter was the most zealous, and reached Christ the first. How variously God dispenses his gifts, and what difference there may be between some believers and others in the way of their honouring Christ, yet they all may be accepted of him! Others continue in the ship, drag the net, and bring the fish to shore, and such persons ought not to be blamed as worldly; for they, in their places, are as truly serving Christ as the others. The Lord Jesus had provision ready for them. We need not be curious in inquiring whence this came; but we may be comforted at Christ's care for his disciples. Although there were so many, and such great fishes, yet they lost none, nor damaged their net. The net of the gospel has enclosed multitudes, yet it is as strong as ever to bring souls to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They saw a fire ... - We have no knowledge whence this was produced - whether it was, as Grotius supposes, by a miracle, or whether it was a place occupied by other fishermen, where they also might cook the fish which they had caught.

In this one miracle there is a complication of miracles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That having fished all night and caught nothing, they should at Christ’s command throw out the net on the side of the ship next the shore, and so most unlikely to have plenty of fish, and catch so many. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That before their fish could be brought on shore, they should see a fish broiling on coals, and bread lying by. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That notwithstanding the multitude of fish, the net should not be broken. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus saith unto them,.... The disciples: <p>bring of the fish which ye have now caught: for they might have caught some before, though so few and small, as scarcely to be reckoned any; nor were they bid to bring all they had taken, only some of them, to add to these Christ had prepared for them on land; they being both indeed of a miraculous production, and the effects of his divine power. Christ's view in ordering to bring some of them, and put to those that lay upon the coals, was partly that they might have enough to make a meal of for them all; and also, that they might have a more perfect knowledge of the miracle wrought, by seeing the number and largeness of the fishes, and by bringing the net full of them to shore unbroken; and may be an emblem of the bringing of souls to Christ by the ministry of the word, thereby adding to those that are already gathered. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/21.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/21-10.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Bring of the fish which you have now caught....">John 21:10-11</a>. <span class="greekheb">ʼΕνέγκατε</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] for the completion, conformably to their needs, of the dish of fish already found upon the fire of coals.

On the allegorical interpretations of the number 153, see note after <a href="/john/21-14.htm" title="This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.">John 21:14</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/21-10.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Bring of the fish which you have now caught.">John 21:10</a>. But miracle is not gratuitously wrought; indeed, Weiss maintains there is neither miracle nor the appearance of one in this preparation. Accordingly Jesus says, <span class="greekheb">Ἐνέγκατε</span> … <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>. And in compliance <span class="greekheb">ἀνέβη</span> … <span class="greekheb">δίκτυον</span>. “Simon Peter went on board and drew the net on shore full of large fishes, 153, and though there were so many the net was not torn.” Mysteries have been found in this number. In Hebrew characters Simon Iona is equivalent to 118 + 35, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, 153. Some of the Fathers understood that 100 meant the Gentiles, 50 the Jews, 3 the Trinity. Jerome cites the authority of naturalists to prove that there were exactly 153 species of fish, and he concludes that the universality of the Gospel take was thus indicated. Calvin, with his usual robust sense, says: “quantum ad piscium numerum spectat, non est sublime aliquid in eo quaerendum mysterium”. Peter never landed a haul of fish without counting them, and John, fisherman as he was, could never forget the number of his largest takes. The number is given, because it was large, and because they were all surprised that the net stood the strain. The only significance our Lord recognises in the fish is that they were food for hungry men.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">fish</span>] The same word as in <span class="ital"><a href="/john/21-9.htm" title="As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.">John 21:9</a></span>, but in the plural.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">caught</span>] See on <span class="ital"><a href="/john/21-3.htm" title="Simon Peter said to them, I go a fishing.

The implication is that to the scanty meal already provided, the new supply was added, and that the Lord permitted his disciples to join his repast, and to rejoice with him at the success of their labor. They and he shared in the travail, and were satisfied therewith.
