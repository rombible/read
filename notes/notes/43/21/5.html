It is good for the disciples of Christ to be together in common conversation, and common business. The hour for their entering upon action was not come. They would help to maintain themselves, and not be burdensome to any. Christ's time of making himself known to his people, is when they are most at a loss. He knows the temporal wants of his people, and has promised them not only grace sufficient, but food convenient. Divine Providence extends itself to things most minute, and those are happy who acknowledge God in all their ways. Those who are humble, diligent, and patient, though their labours may be crossed, shall be crowned; they sometimes live to see their affairs take a happy turn, after many struggles. And there is nothing lost by observing Christ's orders; it is casting the net on the right side of the ship. Jesus manifests himself to his people by doing that for them which none else can do, and things which they looked not for. He would take care that those who left all for him, should not want any good thing. And latter favours are to bring to mind former favours, that eaten bread may not be forgotten. He whom Jesus loved was the first that said, It is the Lord. John had cleaved most closely to his Master in his sufferings, and knew him soonest. Peter was the most zealous, and reached Christ the first. How variously God dispenses his gifts, and what difference there may be between some believers and others in the way of their honouring Christ, yet they all may be accepted of him! Others continue in the ship, drag the net, and bring the fish to shore, and such persons ought not to be blamed as worldly; for they, in their places, are as truly serving Christ as the others. The Lord Jesus had provision ready for them. We need not be curious in inquiring whence this came; but we may be comforted at Christ's care for his disciples. Although there were so many, and such great fishes, yet they lost none, nor damaged their net. The net of the gospel has enclosed multitudes, yet it is as strong as ever to bring souls to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Children - A term of affection and friendship, <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>.<p>Any meat - This word (Greek) means anything eaten with bread.

Christ's children, true believers, are sometimes without spiritual food; there is always indeed enough in Christ, and he has an heart to give it; but either through prevailing iniquity they feed on something else, or do not go to him for food, or go elsewhere; but he will not suffer them to starve; for as he has made provisions for them in the ministry of the word and ordinances; and he himself is the bread of life; if they do not ask him for food, he will ask them whether they have any; will kindly invite them to the provisions he himself makes; will bid them welcome, and bless them to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat?

Yes, when He openly addresses them; but here He uses the word any stranger might use, and the rendering “children” retained even in R.V[98] is wrong.

Athenaeus and Plutarch both tell us that fish was so commonly used in this way that <span class="greekheb">προσφάγιον</span> came to mean “fish”. <span class="greekheb">ἔχετε</span> has its quasitechnical sense, “have ye caught?” For this sense, see Aristophanes, <span class="ital">Clouds</span>, 705 (723, 731), where Socrates asks Strepsiades under the blanket, <span class="greekheb">ἔχεις τι</span>; on which the Scholiast remarks, <span class="greekheb">χαριέντως τὸ ἔχεις τι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῇ τῶν ἀγρευτῶν λέξει χρώμενος</span>· <span class="greekheb">τοῖς γὰρ ἁλιεῦσιν ἢ ὀρνιθαγρευταῖς οὕτω φασὶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔχεις τι</span>.

Their listless manner showed that they had toiled in vain, and, perhaps with tone or gesture of unwillingness to confess their failure, they replied in the negative. <span class="cmt_word">Then he said</span> <span class="cmt_word">to them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship</span>; the side opposite to that on which they were dragging it along. Moreover, the "right hand," the "right eye," the "right ear," the "right side," are proverbially the more useful, fruitful, or honorable. The imagery is preserved throughout Scripture. <span class="cmt_word">And ye shall find.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they cast</span> <span class="accented">it<span class="cmt_word"></span>.</span> And in order to do this they would probably have had to haul a considerable portion of it into the boat for the necessary transference from left to right. They at once obeyed the summons, remembering what they had previously found to have been their experience (<a href="/luke/5.htm">Luke 5</a>.), <span class="cmt_word">and no longer were they able</span>, or had they strength, to draw it into the boat. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, is here quite a different process from the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 8, which describes the hauling, tugging, of the net to shore. The difficulty arose <span class="cmt_word">from</span> (or, <span class="accented">because of</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the multitude of the fishes</span>. The miracle here is a simple indication of the higher knowledge which the Lord possessed. This huge shoal may, humanly speaking, have been perceived in its approach; so that the event is more impressive in its analogical force than in its supernatural machinery. It suggests the surprising results that would accompany their labor when they should under the Lord's own injunction and inspiration, become veritable fishers of men. The parabolic teaching of this miracle is unusually obvious. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Children (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;)<p>Or, little children.
