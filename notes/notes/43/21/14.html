It is good for the disciples of Christ to be together in common conversation, and common business. The hour for their entering upon action was not come. They would help to maintain themselves, and not be burdensome to any. Christ's time of making himself known to his people, is when they are most at a loss. He knows the temporal wants of his people, and has promised them not only grace sufficient, but food convenient. Divine Providence extends itself to things most minute, and those are happy who acknowledge God in all their ways. Those who are humble, diligent, and patient, though their labours may be crossed, shall be crowned; they sometimes live to see their affairs take a happy turn, after many struggles. And there is nothing lost by observing Christ's orders; it is casting the net on the right side of the ship. Jesus manifests himself to his people by doing that for them which none else can do, and things which they looked not for. He would take care that those who left all for him, should not want any good thing. And latter favours are to bring to mind former favours, that eaten bread may not be forgotten. He whom Jesus loved was the first that said, It is the Lord. John had cleaved most closely to his Master in his sufferings, and knew him soonest. Peter was the most zealous, and reached Christ the first. How variously God dispenses his gifts, and what difference there may be between some believers and others in the way of their honouring Christ, yet they all may be accepted of him! Others continue in the ship, drag the net, and bring the fish to shore, and such persons ought not to be blamed as worldly; for they, in their places, are as truly serving Christ as the others. The Lord Jesus had provision ready for them. We need not be curious in inquiring whence this came; but we may be comforted at Christ's care for his disciples. Although there were so many, and such great fishes, yet they lost none, nor damaged their net. The net of the gospel has enclosed multitudes, yet it is as strong as ever to bring souls to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The third time - See the "Harmony of the Accounts of the Resurrection of Jesus." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Since he, moreover, refers his <span class="greekheb">τρίτον</span> only to the appearances that were made to the <span class="ital">circle</span> of disciples (not to individual persons), a wider scope is thereby given to harmonists; in no case, however, can they succeed in reconciling the three appearances with the statements of <span class="ital">Paul</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-5.htm" title="And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:">1 Corinthians 15:5</a> ff., especially as there <span class="greekheb">εἶτα</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἔπειτα</span> (in opposition to Wieseler) denote <span class="ital">chronological</span> sequence. The Apostle Paul is charged, on the supposition that his account is to be understood in an internal way, with a great arbitrariness, when it is asserted that the <span class="ital">three</span> appearances related by John are comprized in <span class="greekheb">εἶτα τοῖς δώδεκα</span> in Paul (Luthardt, Lange). Not even can <span class="greekheb">ὤφθη Κηφᾷ</span> in Paul be reconciled with John. To John, however, must be accorded the preference over the tradition followed by Paul, so far as the latter does not agree with the former.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> NOTE.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To the <span class="ital">draught of fishes</span>, to contest the historical truth of which, in a manner which evinced arbitrariness, and in part even malice, the similarity of the earlier history, <a href="/luke/5-2.htm" title="And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.">Luke 5:2</a> ff., afforded a welcome opportunity (Strauss, Weisse, Schenkel, and several others), a symbolical destination has, since the most ancient times (Chrysostom and his followers, Cyril, Augustine, and many others), been ascribed, and in general justly, since the word of Jesus, <a href="/matthew/4-19.htm" title="And he said to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.">Matthew 4:19</a>, parall., gives, naturally enough, the psychological solution why He, as the Risen One, performs, precisely in <span class="ital">this</span> fashion, a miraculous work in the presence of His disciples. The tradition in which, from the above word, the draught of fishes, Luke 5, took shape (see on <a href="/luke/5-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed on him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,">Luke 5:1</a> ff.), has, although pushing forward the later occurrence, nevertheless apprehended with right feeling the idea which it contained. The disciples themselves could not but find in the words of that first call, Matt. <span class="ital">loc. cit</span>., the key to the symbolical significance of the miraculous fact, in which that word, which Jesus had spoken at the beginning, was now, on the boundary of their earthly intercourse with Him, and before the restoration (a renewed calling, as it were) of Peter, set forth and sealed as a fact with the highest appropriateness. Only in respect of the interpretation of this symbolism, we have no right to go beyond <a href="/matthew/4-14.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,">Matthew 4:14</a>, and read more therein than the <span class="ital">rich blessing of the apostolical office</span>, of which the <span class="ital">men fishers</span> of Jesus were to be the possessors. To go further, and, with Augustine, to expound all the individual features of the history allegorically (so recently, especially Weitzel in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1849, p. 618 f., Luthardt, Lange, Hengstenberg), is groundless and arbitrary, and without any definable limits. Especially is an interpretation of the fish meal, which refers it to the heavenly supper,[282] “which the Lord prepares for His own with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of God” (Olshausen, after Augustine), all the less authorized, since this supper of the kingdom does not concern the apostles <span class="ital">as such</span>, and consequently something that is remote would be mixed up with the reference. It is certainly in the present passage only an <span class="greekheb">ἄριστον</span>, a breakfast, which was merely to serve as a handle for the appearance, and for the draught of fishes, as well as for the further scene with Peter. In a manner which serves as a special warning have the allegorical tendencies of the Fathers, in respect of the number of fishes, displayed themselves, as, <span class="ital">e.g</span>., Severus, Ammonius, Theophylact (also <span class="greekheb">τινές</span> in Euth. Zigabenus) see depicted in the 100 fishes the Gentiles, in the 50 the Jews, and in the 3 the Trinity; whilst Jerome, who is followed by Köstlin in the <span class="ital">Theol. Jahrb</span>. 1851, p. 195, and Hilgenfeld recognises in the 153 fishes, in spite of the fact that they were <span class="ital">large</span> ones only, <span class="ital">all genera piscium</span>, and thereby the <span class="ital">universality</span> of the apostolic activity,[283] which Ruperti derives from the text even by an arithmetical analysis[284] of the number; whilst Hengstenberg, on the other hand (after Grotius), thinks to find the key in the 153,600 strangers, <a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm" title="And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.">2 Chronicles 2:17</a>, so that John counts a fish for every thousand (with which the surplus of 600 falls away)!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That John <span class="ital">says nothing</span> regarding the symbolical determination of the draught of fishes, is sufficiently explained from the fact that <span class="ital">Jesus Himself</span> does not expressly declare it, but allows the thing to speak its silent symbolic language for itself, as He also has not Himself interpreted the symbolism of the withered fig-tree (<a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[282] Even the <span class="ital">Lord’s Supper</span> was found by Augustine to be signified, and he went so far as to say: “<span class="ital">piscis assus Christus est passus</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[283] Hilgenfeld in his <span class="ital">ZeitsChr.</span> 1868, p. 446: “The copious take …, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the <span class="ital">spiritual harvest from the Gentile world</span>, is now added to the provision of fish and bread already lying ready, I think, for the feeding of the <span class="ital">Jewish</span> people (comp. <a href="/john/6-12.htm" title="When they were filled, he said to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.">John 6:12</a>).” The fundamental thought is, he thinks, in <a href="/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[284] Recently <span class="ital">enigmatic numeration</span> has been attempted in the case of these fishes, so that according to the Hebrew numerical letters, 118 + 35 =שמען יובה is = <span class="greekheb">Σίμων ʼΙωνᾶ</span>. See Theol. Jahrb. 1854, p. 135; on the other hand: Ewald, Jahrb. vi. p. 161. Volkmar also (Mos. Prophetie, p. 61 f.) gives the enigmatic solution of the number as “Simeon Bar Jona Kepha.”—Calvin already correctly observes: “quantum ad piscium numerum spectat, non est sublime aliquod in eo quaerendum mysterium.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/21-14.htm" title="This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.">John 21:14</a>.

But in this ch. 21, when he thought it advisable to subjoin some particulars concerning Peter and John by way of an Appendix, he adds one appearance also, in order that of those appearances which were vouchsafed to <span class="ital">a number of the apostles together</span>, there might be <span class="ital">three</span> in all on record in this Gospel.—<span class="ital">Harm.</span>, p. 609.] Thomas also was present on two of these occasions.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is now</span> - or, as Meyer puts it, this time already is - <span class="cmt_word">the third time that Jesus was manifested</span> (passive, not active, as in ver. 1) <span class="cmt_word">to the</span> <span class="cmt_word">disciples, after that he was risen from the dead</span>; or, when he had been raised from the dead. The implication is that there had up to this time been no other manifestation to groups of his disciples than those which John had related. Therefore those other occurrences mentioned by Luke, Matthew, and Paul must be supposed to lie still in the future. That there were other manifestations is not obscurely hinted by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;</span>. The appearances to the women, to Cephas and James, are not of the class so carefully described by John. The <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5</a>, etc., might be regarded as this third manifestation to the disciples (Luthardt). Godet agrees that the two appearances in Luke (Emmaus and Peter) are not reckoned by John, any more than that made to Mary Magdalene. The statement, "to the disciples," is clearly the explanation. Paul mentions the appearance <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to Simon Peter; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> then to the twelve (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19, 26</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to the five hundred, at the head of whom may have been the eleven of <a href="/matthew/28-16.htm">Matthew 28:16-20</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> James; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the twelve (the ascension not described by John). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Since Luke and Paul (Godet) omitted the narrative before us, John is here repairing the omissions of tradition. It seems quite as reasonable to place this third revelation to a group of apostles as the third of Paul's enumerations. John is explicit in recording appearances to the special, combined, and chosen witnesses, while he not only implies, but mentions, other manifestations. Paul recites the special manifestations of various kinds, and gives most important details dropped by other traditions. The apocryphal ' Gospel according to the Hebrews,' as related by Jerome ('Cat. Script. Eccl. "Jacobus"'), quotes the passage which refers to the interview between James and the risen Lord. Gregory of Tours ('Hist. Francorum,' 1:21) refers to the tradition as though he had taken it from some analogous but not identical source (see a full discussion of the passage in Nicholson's 'Gospel according to the Hebrews,' pp. 62-68).
