The sins of Christians are the grief of Christ. We are not to confine our attention to Judas. The prophecy of his treachery may apply to all who partake of God's mercies, and meet them with ingratitude. See the infidel, who only looks at the Scriptures with a desire to do away their authority and destroy their influence; the hypocrite, who professes to believe the Scriptures, but will not govern himself by them; and the apostate, who turns aside from Christ for a thing of naught. Thus mankind, supported by God's providence, after eating bread with Him, lift up the heel against Him! Judas went out as one weary of Jesus and his apostles.

See the notes at <a href="/matthew/23-6.htm">Matthew 23:6</a>.<p>Whom Jesus loved - This was doubtless John himself. The evangelists are not accustomed to mention their own names when any mark of favor or any good deed is recorded. They did not seek publicity or notoriety. In this case the appellation is more tender and honorable than any mere name. John was admitted to special friendship, perhaps, because the natural disposition of our Saviour was more nearly like the amiableness and mildness of John than any of the other disciples (Robert Hall). The highest honor that can be conferred on any man is to say that Jesus loved him. Yet this is an honor which all may possess, but which none can inherit without his spirit and without loving him. It is an honor which cannot be won by wealth or learning, by beauty or accomplishments, by rank or earthly honors, but only by the possession of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price, <a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>; compare <a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23-26. there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved&#8212;Thus modestly does our Evangelist denote himself, as reclining next to Jesus at the table.<p>Peter &#8230; beckoned to him to ask who it should be of whom he spake&#8212;reclining probably at the corresponding place on the other side of Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Peter, knowing the particular affection that Christ had for John, maketh a sign to him, to ask of Christ which of them he meant, when he said, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">One of you shall betray me.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him,.... Peter perhaps lay at a distance from Christ, or in some such position, that he could not whisper to him himself; and besides, knew that John might use more freedom, as he was admitted to more familiarity with him; and being at some distance also from him, he beckoned to him; which was usually done at meals, when they could not, by reason of their posture, discourse together: this being the case,  , "they made signs", by nodding to one another (k); that is, as the gloss explains it, they pointed with their hands and fingers, and by nodding or beckoning; such a method Peter took, signifying his desire, <p>that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake: which he did not out of mere curiosity, but from an honest intention and pure zeal, that he, with the rest, might show their abhorrence of such a person, and avoid him; and do all that lay in their power to hinder him from putting his designs into execution, and that the innocent might be free from all suspicion. <p>(k) T.

The middle place was the seat of honour: Jesus was occupying it: above Him Peter, below Him John, seems to have had his place. There was a close intimacy between Peter and John, as appears from ch. <a href="/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a> [Mary Magdalene, after being at the empty tomb, “cometh to <span class="ital">Simon Peter</span>, and <span class="ital">to the other disciple whom Jesus loved</span>”]; <a href="/john/21-7.htm" title="Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord.

Westcott imagines that Peter was on the <span class="accented">left</span> side, in the place of real honor (?), though not in such proximity as, unobserved, to ask the question. Edersheim also speaks of the <span class="accented">left</span> side as the place of honor, but assigns no adequate reason for such a violation of universal usage and metaphor. The natural impetuosity of Peter would have induced him, if he had been so near, to have asked the question himself. It is more probable that Judas himself was there, judging from the language of <a href="/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a>, and from the act which follows. Either with T.R., <span class="cmt_word">He spake to him, to ask who it might be</span>; <span class="cmt_word">or, saith, Tell</span> (<span class="cmt_word">us</span>) <span class="cmt_word">who it is concerning whom he speaks</span>; as though Peter had rushed to the conclusion that John knew. This is singularly like Peter, and John may tacitly have been supposed to be better acquainted than the rest with the mind of Jesus. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Beckoneth (&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Literally, noddeth.<p>That he should ask who it should be (&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b7;)<p>The best texts read, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, and saith unto him, Tell us who it is. </body></html>
