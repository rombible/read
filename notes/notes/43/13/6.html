Those whom Christ loves, he loves to the end. Nothing can separate a true believer from the love of Christ. We know not when our hour will come, therefore what we have to do in constant preparation for it, ought never to be undone. What way of access the devil has to men's hearts we cannot tell. But some sins are so exceedingly sinful, and there is so little temptation to them from the world and the flesh, that it is plain they are directly from Satan. Jesus washed his disciples' feet, that he might teach us to think nothing below us, wherein we may promote God's glory, and the good of our brethren. We must address ourselves to duty, and must lay aside every thing that would hinder us in what we have to do. Christ washed his disciples' feet, that he might signify to them the value of spiritual washing, and the cleansing of the soul from the pollutions of sin. Our Lord Jesus does many things of which even his own disciples do not for the present know the meaning, but they shall know afterward. We see in the end what was the kindness from events which seemed most cross. And it is not humility, but unbelief, to put away the offers of the gospel, as if too rich to be made to us, or too good news to be true. All those, and those only, who are spiritually washed by Christ, have a part in Christ. All whom Christ owns and saves, he justifies and sanctifies. Peter more than submits; he begs to be washed by Christ. How earnest he is for the purifying grace of the Lord Jesus, and the full effect of it, even upon his hands and head! Those who truly desire to be sanctified, desire to be sanctified throughout, to have the whole man, with all its parts and powers, made pure. The true believer is thus washed when he receives Christ for his salvation. See then what ought to be the daily care of those who through grace are in a justified state, and that is, to wash their feet; to cleanse themselves from daily guilt, and to watch against everything defiling. This should make us the more cautious. From yesterday's pardon, we should be strengthened against this day's temptation. And when hypocrites are discovered, it should be no surprise or cause of stumbling to us. Observe the lesson Christ here taught. Duties are mutual; we must both accept help from our brethren, and afford help to our brethren. When we see our Master serving, we cannot but see how ill it becomes us to domineer. And the same love which led Christ to ransom and reconcile his disciples when enemies, still influences him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dost thou wash my feet? - Every word here is emphatic. Dost thou - the Son of God, the Messiah - perform the humble office of a servant - toward me, a sinner? This was an expression of Peter's humility, of his reverence for Jesus, and also a refusal to allow him to do it. It is possible, though not certain from the text, that he came to Simon Peter first. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-11. Peter saith &#8230; Lord, dost thou wash my feet?&#8212;Our language cannot bring out the intensely vivid contrast between the "Thou" and the "my," which, by bringing them together, the original expresses, for it is not good English to say, "Lord, Thou my feet dost wash?" But every word of this question is emphatic. Thus far, and in the question itself, there was nothing but the most profound and beautiful astonishment at a condescension to him quite incomprehensible. Accordingly, though there can be no doubt that already Peter's heart rebelled against it as a thing not to be tolerated, Jesus ministers no rebuke as yet, but only bids him wait a little, and he should understand it all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Christ in the performance of this ceremony cometh to Simon Peter; whether first, or last, it is not said; and therefore the papists argue ill from hence, to prove the primacy of Peter over the rest of the apostles. Peter looks upon it with a modest, but sinful and superstitions, indignation. Samuel of old determined, that obedience to God is better than sacrifice; it is then certainly better than a compliment. Peter in this case ought not to have contradicted his Master out of a compliment to him, but to have suffered him to go on in this act of ministration. There may be a voluntary humility, and pretended reverence to Christ, which is indeed but superstition, and can be no other, if contrary to any revelation of the Divine will. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then cometh he to Simon Peter,.... After having washed the feet of some of the disciples, as is thought by some interpreters, and particularly the feet of Judas, without any repulse; though others are of opinion that he began with Peter, who modestly, and out of reverence to him, refuses to be washed by him: <p>and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet! he speaks as one surprised and astonished that Christ should offer to do any such thing to him; that he, who was the Son of the living God, should wash the feet of such a sinful man as he was; that those hands, with which he had wrought such miracles, as the opening the eyes of the blind, cleansing lepers, and raising the dead, should be employed in washing his defiled feet, the meaner and inferior parts of his body; this he thought was greatly below his dignity and character, and too much to be done by him to such a worthless creature as he was. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/13-6.htm" title="Then comes he to Simon Peter: and Peter said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?...">John 13:6-9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔρχεται οὖν</span>] So that He then made a commencement with <span class="ital">another disciple</span>, not with <span class="ital">Peter himself</span> (so Augustine, Beda, Nonnus, Rupertius, Cornelius a Lapide, Maldonatus, Jansen, and other Catholics in the Romish interest; but also Baumgarten-Crusius, Ewald, Hengstenberg).

But Jesus puts before him a <span class="ital">threat</span> connected with the necessity of this feet-washing, which could only have its ground and justification in the <span class="ital">higher moral</span> meaning of which the act was to be the quiet symbolic language. Thus He intends what He now says not of the external performance as such in and by itself, <span class="ital">but</span> of the ethical contents which it is symbolically to set forth, after He had already indicated, <a href="/john/13-7.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.">John 13:7</a>, <span class="ital">that</span> something higher lay in this act. It is precisely John who has apprehended and reported in the most faithful and delicate manner how Jesus knew to employ the sensuous as a foil to the spiritual, and thus to ascend, first enigmatically, then more clearly, and ever higher, towards the very highest. He says: <span class="ital">If I shall not have washed thee, thou hast no part with me</span>. Thereby He undoubtedly means the <span class="ital">feet-washing</span> which He intended to perform (<span class="greekheb">τοὺς πόδας σου</span> was to be understood as a matter of course, according to the connection,—against Hofmann, II. 2, p. 323), yet according to the <span class="ital">ethical</span> sense, which it was to set forth symbolically, and impress in a way not to be forgotten. Washing is the old sacred picture of moral purification. Hence the thought of Jesus divested of this symbolical wrapping is: <span class="ital">If I shall not have purified thee</span>, just as I now would wash thy feet, <span class="ital">from the sinful nature still adhering to thee, thou hast no share with me</span> (in the eternal possession of salvation). When Hengstenberg here takes the washing as the symbol of the <span class="ital">forgiveness of sins</span> (according to <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm" title="Against you, you only, have I sinned, and done this evil in your sight: that you might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge.">Psalm 51:4</a>), this is opposed to <a href="/john/13-12.htm" title="So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said to them, Know you what I have done to you?">John 13:12</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Peter, as <a href="/john/13-9.htm" title="Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.">John 13:9</a> shows, did not yet understand the higher meaning of the Lord’s words; he could but take His answer in the external sense that immediately offered itself (<span class="ital">if, in disobedience to me, thou dost not suffer thyself to be washed by me, thou hast</span>, etc.). The thought, however, of being a man separated, by further resistance, from Jesus and His salvation, was sufficiently overpowering for His ardent love to make him offer forthwith not merely His feet, but also the remaining unclothed parts of His body, His hands and His head, to be washed; <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐν τῇ παραιτήσει καὶ ἐν τῇ συγχωρήσει σφοδρότερος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἑκάτερα γὰρ ἐξ ἀγάπης</span>, Cyril.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα</span>] <span class="ital">while eternity lasts</span>, spoken with passion.

This trait in Peter's character is wonderfully accurate, and corresponds with the portraiture of the same man in the synoptic narrative (see Introduction, p. 115.). There is here an analogous blending of reverence and self-will, of outwardness and forwardness - a new illustration of one who would distinguish himself by the greatness of his humility. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Dost thou wash (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)?
