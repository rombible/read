He spoke before of bread which was “of life,” characterised by life, producing life. He now speaks of this bread as “living,” containing the principle of life in itself. (Comp. <a href="/context/john/4-13.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again:">John 4:13-14</a>; <a href="/john/5-26.htm" title="For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;">John 5:26</a>). Once again, too, He answers their demand for bread “from heaven” (<a href="/john/6-31.htm" title="Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.">John 6:31</a>). The lifeless manna fell and lay upon the ground until they gathered it, and passed to corruption if they did not. Each day’s supply met the need of each day, but met that only. He is the bread containing life in Himself, coming by His own will and act from heaven, living among men, imparting life to those who eat by coming to and believing on Him, so that it becomes in them a principle of life, too, which cannot die, but shall live for ever.<p><span class= "bld">And the bread that I will give is my flesh.</span>—The following words, “which I will give,” should be, probably, omitted, and the whole clause should be read—<span class= "ital">And the bread that I will give is My flesh for the life of the world.</span> The words are in every way full of meaning, and the history of their interpretation is a long chapter in the history of Christian doctrine. Their connection with the words used at the institution of the Lord’s Supper will be dealt with in <span class= "ital">Excursus C: The Sacramental Teaching of St. John’s Gospel.</span> Their meaning for the immediate hearers is to be found in the thoughts which led up to them, and which they would suggest to a spiritually-minded Jew. They are, indeed, to be spiritually interpreted (<a href="/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.">John 6:63</a>), and many, even among the disciples, feel it is a hard saying which they cannot hear (<a href="/john/6-60.htm" title="Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?">John 6:60</a>); but the elements of the interpretation are to be sought in the Jewish mind. They have followed Him after a miracle which multiplied a few common barley loaves and fishes, and made them more than enough for thousands (<a href="/context/john/6-22.htm" title="The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one into where his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;">John 6:22-24</a>); He has rebuked the mere bread-seeking spirit, and declared to them the true food (<a href="/john/6-26.htm" title="Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.">John 6:26</a>; <a href="/john/6-29.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent.">John 6:29</a>); they have demanded a sign from heaven like the manna (<a href="/context/john/6-30.htm" title="They said therefore to him, What sign show you then, that we may see, and believe you? what do you work?">John 6:30-31</a>); He has answered that the manna was the Father’s gift, and that He is the true bread from heaven (<a href="/context/john/6-32.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.">John 6:32-35</a>); He has shown parenthetically the real ground of their unbelief (<a href="/context/john/6-36.htm" title="But I said to you, That you also have seen me, and believe not.">John 6:36-46</a>), and again returned to the thought of the bread of life which they have murmured at (<a href="/context/john/6-41.htm" title="The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.">John 6:41-42</a>), and which He has more fully explained (<a href="/context/john/6-47.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me has everlasting life.">John 6:47-51</a>). He now identifies the bread of which He has spoken with His flesh, and says that He will give that for the life of the world. This form of human flesh is, as bread, the means by which life is conveyed; it is the word by which the Eternal Spirit speaks to the spirit of man. (Comp. <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>, which is the only other passage in this Gospel, and <a href="/luke/24-39.htm" title="Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.">Luke 24:39</a>, of the resurrection body, which is the only other passage in the New Testament, where the word “flesh” is used of the person of Christ.)<p>These are the thoughts which have immediately led to these words; but many a chord in the Jewish mind ought to have vibrated to them. The emphatic “I will give,” whether it is repeated or not, refers perhaps to the contrast with Moses (<a href="/john/6-32.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.">John 6:32</a>), but certainly to a gift in the future, and, therefore, not to the Incarnation, but to the Crucifixion. The great Teacher, whom many of them had heard, realised that the human form they now looked upon was the “Lamb of God” of Isaiah’s prophecy (<a href="/john/1-36.htm" title="And looking on Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!">John 1:36</a>, Note). It was now the time of their Paschal Feast (<a href="/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>), when Jewish families were assembling to eat the flesh which told of the deliverance from Egyptian bondage and the birth of the nation’s life. Every day of Temple service told of flesh given in sacrifice for sin, and eaten in maintenance of the individual life. His words, uttered at this Passover, and fulfilled at the next, announce a gift of His own flesh as the true Paschal Lamb, as the sacrifice for the sins of the world, and as the sustenance of the true life of mankind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51</a></span>. <span class="ital">I am the living bread </span>— Because it was a matter of infinite importance to his hearers that they should form a just judgment of his ability to save them, and believe in him as the Saviour of the world, he affirmed a third time that he was himself the living bread, which came down from heaven to make and keep men alive to God. and render them immortal; and that all who did eat of it should live for ever, because he was about to give them his flesh to eat, by making it an expiation for the sins of the world. The intelligent reader will observe that there is a beautiful gradation in our Lord’s discourse. The first time that he called himself <span class="ital">the bread of life, </span>(<a href="/john/6-35.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst.">John 6:35</a>,) he assigned the reason of the name somewhat obscurely: <span class="ital">He that cometh to me shall never hunger, </span>&c. The second time he called himself <span class="ital">the bread of life, </span>(<a href="/john/6-47.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me has everlasting life.">John 6:47</a>,) he spake more plainly: <span class="ital">He that believeth on me hath everlasting life; </span>therefore, <span class="ital">I am the bread of life. </span>And by connecting this with the affirmation, (<a href="/john/6-46.htm" title="Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God, he has seen the Father.">John 6:46</a>,) that he was the only teacher of mankind that had ever personally seen, and conversed intimately with, the Father, he intimated that he gave life to men by his doctrine, being on that account also <span class="ital">the bread of life. </span>The third time he called himself <span class="ital">bread, </span>he added to the name the epithet of <span class="ital">living; </span>not only because he gives life to men by quickening their souls, raising their bodies from the dead, and making them eternally happy, but because he giveth them life in these senses, by means of his human nature, which was not an inanimate thing, like the manna, but a living substance. For he told them plainly, that the bread which he would give them was <span class="ital">his flesh, which he would give for the life of the world </span>— And spake of men’s <span class="ital">eating </span>it in order to its having that effect. But the meaning of this expression he had directed them to before, when, in calling himself <span class="ital">the bread of life, </span>he always joined <span class="ital">believing on him </span>as necessary to men’s <span class="ital">living by him. </span>Wherefore <span class="ital">to eat, </span>in the remaining part of this discourse, is <span class="ital">to believe. </span>See Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:47-51 The advantage of the manna was small, it only referred to this life; but the living Bread is so excellent, that the man who feedeth on it shall never die.

In this verse Jesus introduces the subject of his death and atonement. It may be remarked that in the language which he used the transition from bread to his flesh would appear more easy than it does in our language.

Here, for the first time in this high discourse, our Lord explicitly introduces His sacrificial death&#8212;for only rationalists can doubt this not only as that which constitutes Him the Bread of life to men, but as THAT very element IN Him which possesses the life-giving virtue.&#8212;"From this time we hear no more (in this discourse) of "Bread"; this figure is dropped, and the reality takes its place" [Stier]. The words "I will give" may be compared with the words of institution at the Supper, "This is My body which is given for you" (Lu 22:19), or in Paul's report of it, "broken for you" (1Co 11:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I am the living bread which came down from heaven: See Poole on "<a href="/john/6-33.htm" title="For the bread of God is he which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.">John 6:33</a>"</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/john/6-35.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst.">John 6:35</a>"</span>.

But as the atoning efficacy which this giving up of His flesh has, must be inwardly <span class="ital">appropriated</span> by faith, Christ’s <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>, according to the figure of the bread of life, inasmuch as He means to give it up to death, appears as the <span class="ital">bread</span> which He will give <span class="ital">to be partaken of</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὃν ἐγὼ δώσω</span>). In the repeated <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΏΣΩ</span></span></span> there lies the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἙΚΟΎΣΙΟΝ</span></span></span> of the surrender (Euthymius Zigabenus). But observe the difference of reference, that of the first <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΏΣΩ</span></span></span> to the giving up <span class="ital">for eating</span>, and that of the second <span class="ital">to</span> the giving up to <span class="ital">death</span>.[238] That eating is the <span class="ital">spiritual</span> manducatio,[239] the inward, real appropriation of Christ which, by means of an ever-continuing faith that brings about this appropriation, and makes our life the life of Christ within us (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>), takes place with regard to all the benefits which Christ “carne sua pro nobis in mortem tradita et sanguine suo pro nobis effuso promeruit.” <span class="ital">Forma Concordiae</span>, p. 744.

This explanation, which refers the words to Christ’s <span class="ital">propitiatory death</span>, is that of Augustine, Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, Beza, Aretius, Grotius, Calovius, Wetstein, Lampe, and most others, also of Kuinoel, Lücke, Tholuck, Ammon, Neander, J. Müller (<span class="ital">Diss</span>. 1839), Lange, Ebrard, <span class="ital">Dogma v. Abendm</span>. I. p. 78 ff.; Keim, in the <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. d. Theol</span>. 1859, p. 109 ff.; Weiss; comp. also Ewald, Kahnis (<span class="ital">Dogmat</span>. I. p. 624), Godet.[240] Others, following Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Basil, have understood by <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> <span class="ital">the entire human manifestation of the Logos</span>, which He offered up for the world’s salvation, <span class="ital">including</span> therein His death (so in modern times, in particular, Paulus, D. Schulz, <span class="ital">Lehre vom Abendm</span>., B. Crusius, Frommann, De Wette, Baeumlein; comp. Schleiermacher, <span class="ital">L. J</span>. p. 345, and Reuss). Not only is the future <span class="greekheb">δώσω</span> opposed to this view, but the drinking of the blood in <a href="/john/6-53.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.">John 6:53</a> still more distinctly points to Christ’s death as <span class="ital">exclusively</span> meant; because it would not be apparent why Jesus, had He intended generally that collective dedication of Himself, should have used expressions to describe the appropriation of it, which necessarily and directly point to and presuppose His death. That general consecration was already affirmed in <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ εἰμι ὁ ἄρτος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; the advance from <span class="ital">being</span> and <span class="ital">giving</span> now demands something else, a concrete act, viz. His atoning death and the shedding of His blood. This tells also against the profounder development of the self-communication of Jesus which is said to be meant here, and is adopted by Hengstenberg and Hofmann (<span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, p. 245 ff.), following Luther;[241] viz. that faith in the human nature of Jesus eats and drinks the life of God, or that His life-giving power is bound up in His flesh, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. in His actual human manifestation (Brückner). <span class="ital">Others</span>, again, have explained it <span class="ital">of the Lord’s Supper;</span> viz. Chrysostom, Cyril, Theophylact, Euthymius Zigabenus, most of the Fathers (among the Latin Fathers, Cyprian, Hilary, perhaps also Augustine, etc.) and Catholic writers, also Klee and Maier, further, Calixtus too, strongly opposed by Calovius; and among moderns, Scheibel, Olshausen, Kling in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1836, p. 140 ff.; Lindner, Köstlin, Delitzsch in Rudelbach’s <span class="ital">Zeitschrift</span>, 1845, ii. p. 29; Kaeuffer in the <span class="ital">Sächs. Stud</span>. 1846, p. 70 ff.; Kahnis, <span class="ital">Abendm</span>. p. 104 ff.; Luthardt; Richter in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1863, p. 250; further, while also calling in question the genuineness of the discourse, Bretschneider, Strauss, Weisse, Baur, Hilgenfeld, and many others. Thus, as <a href="/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a> refers to baptism, we have now, it is said, a reference to the second sacrament. This explanation[242] has already this against it, that the eating and drinking is regarded as <span class="ital">continuous</span> (<a href="/john/6-56.htm" title="He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.">John 6:56</a>); and, moreover, it can be maintained only by <span class="ital">surrendering the authenticity</span> of John. But if this be assumed, and the discourse be regarded as historical, Jesus could not Himself speak in the manner in which He here does of the Lord’s Supper. Had this been His reference, He would have spoken inappropriately, and in terms which differ essentially from His own mode of expression at the institution of the holy meal, irrespective of the fact that a discourse upon the <span class="ital">Lord’s Supper</span> at this time would have been utterly incomprehensible to His hearers, especially to the <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαίοι</span> who were addressed. Moreover, there nowhere occurs in the Gospels a hint given <span class="ital">beforehand</span> of the Supper which was to be instituted; and therefore, that this institution was not now already in the thoughts of Jesus (as Godet, following Bengel and others, maintains), but was the product of the hour of the Supper itself, appears all the more likely, seeing how utterly groundless is the assumption based on <a href="/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>, that Jesus, in the feeding of the multitude, improvised a paschal feast. To this it must be added, that the promise of life which is attached to the eating and drinking could apply only to the case of those who worthily partake. We would therefore have to assume that the <span class="ital">reporter John</span> (see especially Kaeuffer, <span class="ital">l.c.;</span> comp. also Weisse, B. Crusius, Köstlin, etc.) <span class="ital">had put</span> this discourse concerning the Lord’s Supper <span class="ital">into the mouth of Christ;</span> and against this it tells in general, that thus there would be on John’s part a misconception, or rather an arbitrariness, which, granting the genuineness of the Gospel, cannot be attributed to this most trusted disciple and his vivid recollections; and in particular, that the drinking of the blood, if it were, as in the Lord’s Supper, a special and essential part, would not have remained unmentioned at the very end of the discourse, <a href="/context/john/6-57.htm" title="As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me....">John 6:57-58</a>; and that, again, the evangelist would make Jesus speak of the Lord’s Supper in terms which lie quite beyond the range of the N. T., and which belong to the mode of representation and language of the apostolic Fathers and still later writers (see the passages in Kaeuffer, p. 77 ff.; Rückert, p. 274 f.; Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">Evang</span>. p. 278).[243] This is specially true of the word <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>, for which all places in the N. T. referring to the Lord’s Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-26.htm" title="And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.">Matthew 26:26</a> ff.; <a href="/mark/14-22.htm" title="And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.">Mark 14:22</a> ff.; <a href="/luke/24-24.htm" title="And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.">Luke 24:24</a> ff.; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:">1 Corinthians 11:23</a> ff.) have <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span>; so that here accordingly there ought to have been stated the identity, not of the bread and the <span class="ital">flesh</span> (which Baur in particular urges), but of the bread and the <span class="ital">body;</span> while with reference to the blood, the element identified (the <span class="ital">wine</span>) ought also to have been mentioned. Further, the passage thus taken would speak of the literal “<span class="ital">eating and drinking</span>” of the flesh and blood, which is a much later materializing of the N. T. <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> in the Lord’s Supper; and lastly, the absolute necessity of this ordinance,[244] which <a href="/john/6-53.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.">John 6:53</a> ff. would thus assert, is not once mentioned thus directly by the Fathers of the first centuries; whereas the N. T., and John in particular, make <span class="ital">faith</span> alone the absolutely necessary condition of salvation. Had John been speaking of the Lord’s Supper, he must have spoken in harmony with the N. T. view and mode of expression, and must have made Jesus speak of it in the same way. But the discourse, <span class="ital">as it lies before us</span>, if taken as referring to the Lord’s Supper, would be an unexampled and utterly inconceivable <span class="greekheb">ὕστερον πρότερον</span>; and therefore even the assumption that at least the same <span class="ital">idea</span> which lay at the root of the Lord’s Supper, and out of which it sprang, is here expressed (Olshausen, Kling, Lange, Tholuck, etc.; comp. Kahnis, Keim, Luthardt, Hengstenberg, Ewald, Godet), is only admissible so far as the appropriation of Christ’s life, brought about by faith in His death, which here is enjoined with such concrete vividness as absolutely necessary,[245] likewise constitutes the sacred and fundamental basis presupposed in the institution of the Supper and forms the condition of its blessedness; and therefore the <span class="ital">application</span> of the passage to the Lord’s Supper (but at the same time to baptism and to the efficacy of the word) justly, nay necessarily, arises. Comp. the admirable remarks of Harless, p. 130 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to Rückert (<span class="ital">Abendm</span>. p. 291 f.), the discourse is not intended by Jesus to refer to the Supper, but is so intended by John, through whose erroneous and crude method of apprehension the readers are supposed to be taught, whether they themselves believed in an actual eating of the flesh and drinking of the blood, or whether this was a stumbling-block to them. An interpretation this which is neither indicated by the text nor has any historical basis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Upon the history of the interpretation of our text, see Lücke, ed. 2, App. 2; Lindner, <span class="ital">vom Abendm</span>. p. 241 ff.; Tischendorf, <span class="ital">De Christo pane vitae</span>, 1839, p. 15 ff.; Mack, <span class="ital">Quartalschr</span>. 1832, I. p. 52 ff.; Kahnis, p. 114 ff.; Rückert, p. 273 ff. The exposition which takes it to refer to faith in the atoning death forms the basis of Zwingle’s doctrine of the Eucharist. See Dieckhoff, <span class="ital">evangel. Abendmahlslehre</span>, I. p. 440.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[237] Not that by the death of Jesus the barrier of the independent individuality existing between the Logos and the human being is destroyed. See against this explanation (Köstlin, Reuss), so foreign to John, Weiss, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr</span>. p. 65 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[238] The words <span class="greekheb">ἣν ἐγὼ δώσω</span> are wanting in B C D L T א, a few cursives, several versions (following Vulg. It.), and Fathers (even Origen twice), and are rejected by Lachm., Ewald, Tisch., Baeumlein, Harless. The preponderance of testimony is certainly against them; and in omitting them we should not, with Kling, take <span class="greekheb">ἡ σάρξ μου</span> as in apposition with <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἄρτος</span> (see, on the contrary, Rückert, Abendm. p. 259), but simply render it: “the bread which I shall give is my flesh for the life of the world” (the former is the latter for the life of the world). But this short pregnant mode of expression is so little like John, and the repetition of <span class="greekheb">ἣν ἐγὼ δώσω</span> is so completely Johannean, that I feel compelled to retain the words as genuine, and to regard their omission as a very early error, occasioned by the occurrence of the same words a little before. Following א, Tischendorf now reads, after <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἄρτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δὲ</span>: <span class="greekheb">ὃν ἐγὼ δώσω ὑπὲρ τῆς τοῦ κόσμου ζωῆς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ σάρξ μου ἐστίν</span>. This is manifestly an arrangement resorted to in order to asssign to the words <span class="greekheb">ὑπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ζωῆς</span> the place which, in the absence of <span class="greekheb">ἣν ἐγὼ δώσω</span>, seemed to belong to them. Baeumlein supposes that <span class="greekheb">ὑπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ζωῆς</span> is an ancient gloss.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[239] The expression “resurrection of the <span class="ital">flesh</span>” cannot be justified from John 6, as Delitzsch, <span class="ital">Psychol</span>. p. 460 [E. T. p. 541], supposes. If it cannot be justified by anything in St. Paul, which Delitzsch admits, it can least of all by anything in St. John. When, indeed, Delitzsch says (p. 339), “The flesh of Christ becomes in us a <span class="ital">tincture of immortality, which, in spite of corruption, sustains the essence of our flesh, in order one day at the resurrection to assimilate also His manifestation to itself</span>,” we can only oppose to such fancies, “<span class="ital">Ne ultra quod scriptum est</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[240] Who, however, attaches great importance to the corporeal side of the real fellowship of believers with Christ, by virtue of which they will become at the resurrection the reproduction of the glorified Christ, referring to <a href="/ephesians/5-30.htm" title="For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.">Ephesians 5:30</a>. The eating and drinking alone are figurative, while the not merely spiritual, but also bodily appropriation, must, according to him, be taken literally. This, however, is not required by the <span class="greekheb">ἀναστήσω αὐτὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., ver. 54, which we already had in ver. 39, and is not even admissible by ver. 63.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[241] “Therefore one eats and drinks the Godhead in His human nature.—This flesh does not carnalize, but will deify thee, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. give thee divine power, virtue, and work, and will take away sins,” and so on (<span class="ital">Pred. Dom. Oculi</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[242] A view which Luther decidedly opposed previous to the controversy regarding the Lord’s Supper. In the heading or gloss he says: “This chapter does not speak of the sacrament of the bread and wine, but of spiritual eating, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. of the belief that Christ, both God and man, hath shed His blood for us.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[243] Hilgenfeld calls the passages in Justin, <span class="ital">Apol</span>. i. 66; Ignatius, <span class="ital">ad Smyrn</span>. 7, <span class="ital">ad Romans 7</span>, an admirable commentary upon our text. They would, indeed, be so if our evangelist himself were a post-apostolic writer belonging to the second century.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[244] Its limitation to the <span class="ital">Contemtus</span> sacramenti (Richter) is a dogmatic subterfuge which has no foundation in the text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[245] “He makes it so that it could not be plainer, in order that they might not think that he was speaking of something else, or of anything that was not before their eyes; but that He was speaking of Himself.”—LUTHER.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51</a>. In <a href="/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51</a> Jesus adds two fresh terms in explanation of the living bread, which, however, through their want of apprehension, increased their difficulty. The first is <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ εἰμι</span> … <span class="greekheb">ζωῆς</span>. In giving this explanation He slightly alters the designation of Himself as the Bread: He now claims to be not “the bread of life,” but <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἄρτος ὁ ζῶν</span>, “the living bread”. Godet says: “The manna, as not itself living, could never impart life. But Jesus, because He Himself lives, can give life.” That is correct, but is not the full meaning. <span class="greekheb">ὁ ζῶν</span> contrasts the bread with the <span class="greekheb">βρῶσις ἀπολλυμένη</span>; and as “living water” is water running from a fountain in perpetual stream, and not a measured quantity in a tank, so “living bread” is bread which renews itself in proportion to all needs like the bread of the miracle. The second fresh intimation now made is <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἄρτος ὃν ἐγὼ δώσω ἡ σάρξ μου ἐστίν</span> … This intimation is linked to the foregoing by a double conjunction <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ ἄρτος δέ</span>, “and besides” indicating, according to classical usage, a new aspect or expansion of what has been said. The new intimation is at first sight an apparent limitation: instead of “I am the bread,” He now says “My flesh is the bread”. Accordingly some interpreters suppose that by “flesh” the whole manifestation of Christ in human nature is meant. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος σάρξ ἐγένετο</span>. Thus Westcott says: “The life of the world in the highest sense springs from the Incarnation and Resurrection of Christ. By His Incarnation and Resurrection the ruin and death which sin brought in are overcome. The thought here is of support and growth, and not of Atonement.” To this there are two objections. (1) If <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> is equivalent to the whole manifestation of Christ in the flesh, this is not a new statement, but a repetition of what has already been said. And (2) the <span class="greekheb">δώσω</span> compels us to think of a giving yet future. Besides, the turn taken by the conversation, <a href="/context/john/6-53.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you....">John 6:53-57</a>, seems to point rather to the atoning sacrifice of Christ. [So Euthymius: <span class="greekheb">τὴν σταύρωσιν αὐτοῦ προσημαίνει</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ δὲ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἣν ἐγὼ δώσω</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἑκούσιον ἐμφαίνει τοῦ τοιούτου πάθους</span>. So too Cyril: <span class="greekheb">Ἀποθνήσκω</span>, <span class="greekheb">φησὶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ πάντων</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα πάντας ζωοποιήσω διʼ ἐμαυτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀντίλυτρον τῆς ἁπάντων σαρκὸς τὴν ἐμὴν ἐποιησάμην</span>. Bengel says: “Tota haec de carne et sanguine Jesu Christi oratio passionem spectat”. Beza even finds in <span class="greekheb">δώσω</span> the sense “offeram Patri in ara crucis”.] The giving of His flesh, a still future giving which is spoken of as a definite act, is, then, most naturally referred to the death on the cross. This was to be <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῆς τοῦ κόσμου ζωῆς</span>, “for the sake of the life of the world”. <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span> when used in connection with sacrifice tends to glide into <span class="greekheb">ἀντί</span>; see the <span class="ital">Alcestis</span> of Eurip. <span class="ital">passim</span> and Lampe’s note on this verse. Here, however, the idea of substitution is not present. It is only hinted that somehow the death of Christ is needed for the world’s life. This statement, however, only bewilders the crowd; and the next paragraph, <a href="/context/john/6-52.htm" title="The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?...">John 6:52-59</a>, gives expression to and deals with this bewilderment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">51</span>. <span class="ital">the living bread</span>] Not merely the Bread of life (<span class="ital"><a href="/john/6-48.htm" title="I am that bread of life.">John 6:48</a></span>), the life-giving Bread, but the living Bread, having life in itself, which life is imparted to those who partake of the Bread.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which came down</span>] At the Incarnation. Now that the Bread is identified with Christ, we have the past tense of what took place once for all. Previously (<a href="/john/6-33.htm" title="For the bread of God is he which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.">John 6:33</a>; <a href="/john/6-50.htm" title="This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.">John 6:50</a>) the present tense is used of what is continually going on. In one sense Christ is perpetually coming down from heaven, in the other He came but once: He is ever imparting Himself to man; He only once became man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he shall live for ever</span>] Just as ‘living Bread’ is a stronger expression than ‘Bread of life,’ so ‘live for ever’ is stronger than ‘not die.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the bread that I will give</span>] The precise wording of this sentence is somewhat uncertain, but the best reading seems to be: <span class="ital">and the Bread that I will give is</span> <span class="bld">My Flesh for</span> <span class="ital">the life of the world</span>. That in Christ’s mind these words looked onwards to the Eucharist, and that in thus speaking to believers throughout all time He included a reference to the Eucharist has already been stated to be highly probable. (See above, Introduction to 26–58). But that the reference is not exclusively, nor even directly, to the Eucharist is shewn from the use of ‘Flesh’ (<span class="ital">sarx</span>) and not ‘Body’ (<span class="ital">sôma</span>). In all places where the Eucharist is mentioned in N.T. we have ‘Body,’ not ‘Flesh;’ <a href="/matthew/26-26.htm" title="And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.">Matthew 26:26</a>; <a href="/mark/14-22.htm" title="And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.">Mark 14:22</a>; <a href="/luke/22-19.htm" title="And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.">Luke 22:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm" title="And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.">1 Corinthians 11:24</a> ff. Moreover the words must have had some meaning for those who heard them at Capernaum. Evidently they have a wider range than any one Sacrament. Christ promises to give His Flesh (by His bloody death soon to come) for the benefit of the whole world. But this benefit can only be appropriated by the faith of each individual; and so that which when offered by Christ is His Flesh appears under the figure of bread when partaken of by the believer. The primary reference, therefore, is to Christ’s propitiatory death; the secondary reference is to <span class="ital">all</span> those means by which the death of Christ is appropriated, especially the Eucharist. Not that Christ is here promising that ordinance, but uttering deep truths, which apply, and which He intended to apply, to that ordinance, now that it is instituted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">51–58</span>. <span class="ital">Further definition of the identification of the Spiritual Bread with Christ as consisting in the giving of His Body and the outpouring of His Blood</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <span class="ital"><a href="/context/john/6-35.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst....">John 6:35-50</a></span> Christ in His <span class="ital">Person</span> is the Bread of Life: here He is the spiritual food of believers in the Redemptive <span class="ital">work</span> of His Death.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ζῶν</span>, <span class="ital">the living</span>) This participle acts both as a means of giving increased weight to His speech, and as a declaration, by which it is shown that His speech is not concerning ordinary bread.—<span class="greekheb">δώσω</span>, <span class="ital">I will give</span>[150]) ought to be read.—<span class="greekheb">ἡ σάρξ μου</span>, <span class="ital">My flesh</span>) A new step in the discourse. The <span class="greekheb">δὲ ἐπιτατικόν</span> [intensive], <span class="ital">indeed</span>, and the <span class="ital">I will give</span> in the Future, are in accordance with this: for heretofore there had been no mention made in this discourse <span class="ital">of flesh</span>; then at <a href="/john/6-53.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.">John 6:53</a>, also of blood. The Father giveth <span class="ital">the true bread</span>, <a href="/john/6-32.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.">John 6:32</a>, which is Christ Himself: <a href="/john/6-35.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst.">John 6:35</a>, “I am the bread of life.” Christ giveth <span class="ital">the living bread</span>, His own flesh. The portion of the discourse concerning <span class="ital">the bread</span> is rather allegorical, in accommodation to the miracle that precedes it: that concerning <span class="ital">the flesh and blood</span> is literal.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῆς τοῦ κόσμου ζωῆς</span>, <span class="ital">for the life of the world</span>) and so, for many, <a href="/mark/14-24.htm" title="And he said to them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.">Mark 14:24</a>, “This is My blood of the New Testament, which is shed <span class="ital">for many</span>.” Jesus framed His words so skilfully, that immediately at the time, and at all times subsequently, they would indeed apply in their strict literal sense to the spiritual enjoyment of Himself: and yet that afterwards the same words should by consequence be appropriate to express the most august mystery of the Holy Supper, when that should be instituted. For He applied to the Holy Supper[151] the thing itself which is set forth in this discourse; and of so great moment is this sacrament, that it may readily be thought possible that Jesus, as He foretold the treachery of Judas at <a href="/john/6-71.htm" title="He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.">John 6:71</a>, and His own death in this ver., so also foretold, one year before, the institution of the Holy Supper, concerning which He most surely thought within Himself whilst speaking these words: and with this object, in order that the disciples might afterwards remember His prediction. The whole of these words concerning His flesh and blood have in view the passion of Jesus Christ, and along with it the Holy Supper. Hence arises the separate mention <span class="ital">of the flesh</span> and <span class="ital">of the blood</span> so invariably: for in His passion the blood was drawn out of His body, and the Lamb was thus slain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[150] <span class="ital">However both the margin</span> of both Editions, <span class="ital">and the</span> Germ.

With this verse We see, instead of monotony, a threefold advance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> In place of the life-giving Bread, he declares himself to be as Bread, yet a living Person, possessing therefore in himself the essential principle and energy of life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Instead of <span class="accented">coming down</span>, used characteristically or universally, he points to a definite, concrete, historic fact - "that has come down out of heaven." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Instead of saying, "he may not die," we find the glorious assertion, "he <span class="accented">will live forever</span>." The kind of eating of which he speaks becomes clearer; the kind of food, the kind of death, the kind of life, all burst into light which points back to the first great word of this discourse, viz. "Labour tot that food which endureth unto eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you, for this one the Father, even God, hath scaled." "The miraculous feeding of yesterday was but the metaphor by which I was conveying this thought, that I was providing an inexhaustible supply for the eternal life of that humanity which I have assumed." In the last clause of the verse he made a yet further advance: <span class="cmt_word">Yea, and the bread which I shall give is my flesh</span> (<span class="cmt_word">which I shall give</span>) <span class="cmt_word">for</span> <span class="cmt_word">the life of the world.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> of the commencement of the clause show a continuation of the thought with a new departure, coordination, and progress, "Yea, and the bread which I shall give is my flesh." Though the word "flesh" is often described by some of its frequent characteristics and qualities, and might be and has been regarded as the bodily and sensuous nature, and also as the seat of sin, it is,  both by Paul and John, used for the <span class="accented">nature of man</span> as a creature - its totality regarded on its earthly side, the entire "humanity" which Christ assumed, the common antithesis to "spirit" viewed as the Divine supernatural gift to man. He was (<a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>) "manifest in the flesh," in "the likeness of sinful flesh" (<a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>) - in a flesh free from all sin. He came "in the flesh" (<a href="/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2</a>). This humanity of his he gives, or rather, when he spake these words, he would give, <span class="accented">to be eaten</span>, to be assimilated by faith; and, having reached this point, he added (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. if we retain the questioned clause, which, with Meyer and Godet, we see no sufficient reason for discarding), which flesh,which humanity of his, he will further give to be slain and sacrificed for the sake of, or on behalf of, the world. This clause, which the Vatican Codex, etc., reject, proceeds clearly on the supposition that Christ advances here to the prediction and promise of his death. It is so worded as all the more to justify the emphasis he subsequently lays upon the death itself as essential to a full participation in himself. In this verse and closing utterance he prepares for further disclosures, and the flesh of Christ receives explanation from the rich and varied reference to it in the final words of the discourse, where the <span class="accented">flesh</span> is the great metaphor of his Divine humanity, and the <span class="accented">blood</span> is the expressive description of his awful sacrifice. He, the Life-giver, the Living One, the Bread of life, the living Bread, will give himself to what men call death, that they, apprehending fully, adequately accepting the greatness of the Divine gift, may, like himself, transform death (so called death) into the portal of eternal life. These words are the new starting point for this great disclosure. The very inner thought of Jesus seems to shape itself as we read. The Paschal sacrifice, eaten at that season as the sign that the theocratic nation had been chosen to covenant and eternal relation with Jehovah, must have been present to his mind. His own approaching death and sacrifice, by which he would bind those who receive him into an eternal covenant with himself, his relation to the whole world, the gift of the Father to him, the gift of himself to the world by the Father, - all are presented to him, and the movements of his great heart reveal themselves as he proceeds. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The living bread (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Literally, the bread the living (bread).
