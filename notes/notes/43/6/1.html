Quickly after the passover was ended, Christ departed from Jerusalem, and went into Galilee, and preached in the several cities and towns in those parts, and wrought many miracles: and after these things, in process of time, <p>Jesus went over the sea of Galilee; the same with the lake of Gennesaret, <a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1</a>; <p>which is the sea of Tiberias; and is frequently so called by the Jewish writers (x), who often make mention of  , "the sea of Tiberias"; and by other writers, it is called the lake of Tiberias (y); Pliny, who calls it the lake of Genesara (z), says, <p>"it was sixteen miles long, and six broad, and was beset with very pleasant towns; on the east were Julias and Hippo, and on the south Tarichea, by which name some call the lake, and on the west Tiberias, wholesome for the hot waters.'' <p>And these are the waters which the Jews call , or,   the hot baths of Tiberias (a); and from the city of Tiberias built by Herod, and called so in honour of Tiberius Caesar, the sea took its name. <p>(x) T.

The discrepancies in matters of detail are immaterial, and bear witness to the independence of John’s account. The author of this narrative, according to Baur, must have appropriated synoptical material for the purpose of his own exposition, and of elevating into a higher sphere the miracle itself, which in the Synoptics did not go beyond the supply of temporal needs. The <span class="ital">historical connection</span> with what precedes is not the same in John and in the Synoptics, and this must be simply acknowledged. To introduce more or less synoptical history into the space implied in <span class="greekheb">μετὰ ταῦτα</span> (Ebrard, Lange, Lichtenstein, and many), is not requisite in John, and involves much uncertainty in detail, especially as Matthew does not agree with Mark and Luke; for he puts the mission of the disciples earlier, and does not connect their return with the Miraculous Feeding. To interpolate their mission and return into John’s narrative, inserting the former at chap. <a href="/john/5-1.htm" title="After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 5:1</a>, and the latter at <a href="/john/6-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.">John 6:1</a>, so that the disciples rejoined Jesus at Tiberias, is very hazardous; for John gives no hint of it, and in their silence concerning it Matthew and John agree (against Wieseler and most expositors). According to Ewald, at a very early date, a section, “probably a whole sheet,” between chap. 5 and 6, was <span class="ital">altogether lost</span>. But there is no indication of this in the text, nor does it form a necessary presupposition for the succeeding portions of the narrative (as <a href="/john/7-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.">John 7:21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μετὰ ταῦτα</span>] after these transactions at the feast of Purim, chap. 5.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπῆλθεν</span>] from Jerusalem; whither? <span class="greekheb">πέραν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θαλ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., tells us.

Added to describe the sea more exactly, especially for the sake of foreign readers. Another slight indication that this Gospel was written outside Palestine: inside Palestine such minute description would be less natural. Perhaps we are to understand that the <span class="ital">southern</span> half of the lake is specially intended; for here on the western shore Tiberias was situated. The name Tiberias is not found in the first three Gospels. The town was built during our Lord’s life time by Herod Antipas, who called it Tiberias out of compliment to the reigning Emperor; one of many instances of the Herods paying court to Rome. Comp. Bethsaida Julias, where this miracle took place, called Julias by Herod Philip after the infamous daughter of Augustus. The new town would naturally be much better known and more likely to be mentioned when S. John wrote than when the earlier Evangelists wrote.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/6-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.">John 6:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μετὰ ταῦτα</span>, <span class="ital">after these things</span>) John intimates, that here the history of many months is to be sought from the other Evangelists.

Chronological difficulties beset our  treatment of this miraculous narrative with its varied consequences and results. Many curious and even violent measures have been resorted to with a view to solve them. Some have supposed that ch. 5. and 6. have been inverted in order, and that thus the presence of our Lord in Galilee, mentioned in ch. 4, would account for the statement of ch. 6:1 and the journey to Jerusalem of ch. 5:1, be brought into closer relation with ch. 7. We cannot see the faintest indication or evidence whatever of any such treatment of the Gospel by the authors of the manuscripts or the quotations or versions. The evangelist has just completed his record of the conflict between Jesus and the recognized leaders of the people in Jerusalem. He had introduced our Lord's own vindication (based on the highest grounds) of his own right to deal with the rabbinical restrictions upon sabbath duty. These grounds were the eternal relations of his own inner nature and consciousness with the Father's. On no occasion had Christ made the uniqueness of his personal claims and powers more explicit. He called for entire obedience to his word as the condition of eternal life, and as the key to the Scriptures of God. If we had no synoptic tradition to give a closer historical setting of the narrative which here follows, we might take Meyer's view, and say that the "after these things" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) of ver. 1 referred to the discourse of the previous chapter, and that the "departed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) referred to Jerusalem as its starting point; and, notwithstanding the extreme awkwardness of the expression, we might have supposed that "the other side" of the sea was the other side of it from Jerusalem (cf. <a href="/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40</a>; <a href="/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>). Some commentators appear to have a morbid fear of reducing a difficulty, or seeing a harmony, between these four narratives. One thing is dear, that they are independent of one another, are not derived from each other, do each involve side views of the event distinct from the rest, and yet concur in the same general representation. The synoptists, however, place the "feeding of the multitudes" in the midst of a group of most remarkable and varied events. It is for them one page out of many descriptive of the Galilaean ministry, and which ultimately led to grievous departure from and diminution of the temporary popularity of the great Prophet. It would seem that bitter hostility, as well as excited enthusiasm, was checkering his early ministry. The synoptics take pains to show the combined effect of his self-revelations <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> on his own fellow townsmen (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a>; <a href="/mark/6-1.htm">Mark 6:1-6</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> upon his own family (<a href="/mark/3-19.htm">Mark 3:19-21, 31-35</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> upon the populace (<a href="/matthew/15-31.htm">Matthew 15:31</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> upon Herod Antipas (<a href="/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14-16</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> upon the twelve disciples (<a href="/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13-28</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> upon John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/11-3.htm">Matthew 11:3</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> upon the Father in heaven (<a href="/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1-13</a> and parallel passages). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The canvas is crowded with scenes, the signs and wonders of healing and teaching are abundant. The blind see, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the daemons are exorcised. The twelve apostles are chosen the sermon on the mount is delivered, the twelve are sent forth in every direction with the proclamation of the coming of the kingdom and with the call to repentance, and an excitement produced by the mission of the twelve had proved to be extensive. The crowds throng him; they have no time even to eat bread. And we judge from <a href="/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10</a> that this very excitement, amounting to feverish self-glorification on their part, appears to have been one at least of our Lord's motives for the temporary withdrawal of his disciples from the multitudes. Another event of singular significance contributed to the same result. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/14-12.htm">Matthew 14:12</a>) takes the opportunity of describing the tragic close of John's imprisonment, and relates how John's "disciples came to tell Jesus" of the bloody deed. A sudden panic was felt by the multitude. A crisis had arrived. The great Prophet must avenge his forerunner's death or lose his hold upon the affections of the fickle mass. The people appeared to the eyes of Jesus (<a href="/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34</a>) "as sheep without a shepherd." He had compassion on them, but he must make them understand the nature of the royalty as well as of the realm of the Messianic King. The true grounds for Christ's retirement are not incompatible, but mutually explanatory. The death of the renowned forerunner, of the idol of the multitude brought vividly to the mind of the Lord his own death - the  foreseen sacrifice of himself. The conviction that he must give himself to a violent death - give his flesh to the hungry and starving multitude, made the decadence of his popularity in Galilee a certain consequence of any right apprehension of his mission or claims. This mastery over the powers of nature which his compassion for others prevailed on him to manifest would be misunderstood. The moral and mystic meaning of it was far more important than the superficial inferences drawn by the Galilaeans. The real lesson of the miracle would grievously offend them. But it sank deeply into the apostolic mind, and hence the various aspects which it presents in the fourfold narrative. John selects this one specimen of the Galilaean ministry on account of its typical character, and records the high and wonderful results which the Lord educed from this high and striking manifestation of his power. There is, moreover, remarkable correspondence between the fifth and sixth chapters in this respect, that Galilee, like Jerusalem, recoils from the highest claims of Jesus, and developed an antagonism or an indifference as deadly if not as malignant as that which has displayed itself in the metropolis. "He came to his own, and his own received him not." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After these things</span> (see note on John 5:1; not <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, which would mean after this particular scene in Jerusalem) - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. after a group of events, one of which may have been this visit to the metropolis, but which included also the early Galilaean ministry as presented in the synoptic narrative, and with which John and his readers were familiar - Jesus departed from the side of the sea on which he was, and as we may judge (ver. 24) from Capernaum, now known to be his chief resting place, most probably the home of his mother, brothers, and nearest friends, <span class="cmt_word">to the other side of the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias</span>; or, <span class="accented">of the Galilaean sea of Tiberias</span>. It does not follow that the evangelist had the southernmost portion of the lake in his mind (as Meyer suggests). Tiberius was the showy city built by Herod Antipas on the western shore of the lake. Herod called the place after the name of Tiberius Caesar, and conferred upon it many Gentile characteristics. From the time of Antipas to that of Agrippa it was the chief town of the tetrarchy. After the destruction of Jerusalem it became for centuries the site era celebrated school of Hebrew learning, and one of the sacred cities of the Jews. Jewish tradition makes it the scene of the last judgment and the resurrection of the dead. It was a modern city, which may account for the omission of its name in the synoptic narrative. Christ never visited it that we know cf. He preferred the fishing village of Bethsaida, or the more thoroughly Hebrew aspect of Capernaum. Nevertheless, "Tiberias" gave to Gentile cars the best and least dubious designation of the lake. So Pausanias (5, 7, 3) calls it the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> ("the lake Tiber"). Luke (<a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1</a>) calls it the "Lake Gennesaret<span class="accented"></span>," and Matthew and Mark "the Sea of Galilee" without any other epithet. John (<a href="/john/21-1.htm">John 21:1</a>) calls it "the Sea of Tiberias." This multiplicity of lake names, due in the first instance to some peculiarity of the including shores, finds easy parallels in Derwentwater and Keswick Lake, and in the "Lake of the Four Cantons," called also" Lake of Luzern," etc. Christ sought retirement from the surging crowd, and for himself and his excited disciples a time of rest and communion with the Father, who had accepted, as part of his Divine plan, the awful sacrifice of the life of John the Baptist. He went "by ship," says Matthew (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13</a>) to a desert place. In Luke's account this solitary place was towards or near (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) a city called "Bethsaida." It is difficult to believe that this is the familiar Bethsaida or "fishing town," situated a little south of Capernaum, because we are met in the account of Mark (<a href="/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45</a>) with the statement that, after the miracle, the disciples were urged to go to the other side of the lake (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>) towards Bethsaida. This, compared with ver. 17, is obviously in the same direction as Capernaum. Indeed, the term, "Bethsaida of Galilee," referred to in ch. 12:21 (as the Apostle Philip's residence), seems used with the view of distinguishing it from some other place of the same name. Now, Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:02, 1) mentions a <span class="accented">Bethsaida Julias</span> situated on the northeastern extremity of the lake. The "ruins of this city may be still seen on the rising hilly ground which here retires somewhat from the river and the lake. It was situated in <span class="accented">Gaulonitis</span>, in the tetrarchy of Philip, and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of Herod, yet not far from the road into Peraea by which the Galilaean pilgrims to the metropolis might be expected to travel. The silence of these hills provided the opportunity of retirement. But it was frustrated by the eager excitement of the multitude. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The sea<p>See on <a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18</a>. </body></html>
