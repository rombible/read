Or, will not that convince you of the truth of my having come down from heaven? Will it not show you, likewise, that I never intended you should eat my flesh in a corporeal manner? It is very probable that what Christ here says of his ascension, was, partly at least, intended to intimate to them the necessity of taking his discourse in a figurative sense, as it would so soon be evidently impossible to eat his flesh, which was to be received into heaven. <span class="ital">It is the Spirit </span>— The spiritual meaning of these words; <span class="ital">that quickeneth </span>— By which God giveth spiritual life. <span class="ital">The flesh </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The bare, carnal, literal meaning; <span class="ital">profiteth nothing.

As without the soul of man the flesh is of no value, so without the quickening Spirit of God all forms of religion are dead and worthless.

It was applied to the followers of Christ because they were taught by him. It does not imply, of necessity, that those to whom it was given were real Christians, but simply that they were under his teaching, and were professed learners in his school. See <a href="/matthew/17-16.htm">Matthew 17:16</a>; <a href="/mark/2-18.htm">Mark 2:18</a>; <a href="/john/9-28.htm">John 9:28</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a>. It is doubtless used in this sense here. It is, however, often applied to those who are real Christians.<p>This is an hard saying - The word "hard" here means "offensive, disagreeable" - that which they could not bear. Some have understood it to mean "difficult to be understood," but this meaning does not suit the connection.

It does not refer to any particular part of the discourse, but includes the whole.<p>Who can hear it? - That is, who can hear it patiently - who can stay and listen to such doctrine or believe it. The effect of this is stated in <a href="/john/6-66.htm">John 6:66</a>. The doctrines which Jesus taught that were so offensive appear to have been:<p>1. that he was superior to Moses.<p>2. that God would save all that he had chosen and those only.<p>3. that he said he was the bread that came from heaven.<p>4. that it was necessary to partake of that; that it was necessary that an atonement should be made, and that they should be saved by that.<p>These doctrines have always been among the most offensive that men have been called on to believe, and many, rather than trust in them, have chosen to draw back to perdition. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>61, 62.

The interpretation of the ancient Church, which referred the words to <span class="ital">the corporeal ascension in and by itself</span> (so also Olshausen, Lindner, Maier, Ebrard, Kahnis, p. 120, Hilgenfeld, Hofmann, Hengstenberg, Baeumlein, Godet, Harless), would require us of logical necessity to supply, not the supposed <span class="ital">increase</span> of offence (Baeumlein), but a question expressing <span class="ital">doubt</span> or <span class="ital">denial:</span> “would ye still take offence then?” Comp. <a href="/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>. But this import of the aposiopesis, which even Ewald and Brückner adopt, though not explaining the words merely of the ascension, has the <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> itself decidedly against it, instead of which <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> would be logically required; and the reference to the ascension as such, <span class="ital">as an event by itself</span>, is totally without analogy in the discourses of Jesus, and quite un-Johannean.[247] So also the <span class="greekheb">θεωρῆτε</span>, in particular, is against this view; for, with the <span class="ital">Present</span> participle <span class="greekheb">ἀναβαίνοντα</span>, it would describe the ascension <span class="ital">expressly</span> as a <span class="ital">visible</span> event (in answer to Luthardt’s observations, who explains it of the ascension, but with Tholuck regards its visibility as a matter of indifference, so far as the present passage is concerned), though its <span class="ital">visible</span> occurrence is attested by no apostle, while in the non-apostolic accounts (<a href="/mark/16-19.htm" title="So then after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.">Mark 16:19</a>; <a href="/luke/24-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.">Luke 24:51</a>; <a href="/acts/1-9.htm" title="And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.">Acts 1:9</a>) only the disciples in the <span class="ital">narrower</span> sense, the twelve, who are just those not meant by the “ye” in our text, are represented as the eye-witnesses. On the other hand, the opinion that there lies in <span class="greekheb">θεωρ</span>. only the <span class="ital">possibility</span> of those present being eye-witnesses (Kahnis, Hofmann)[248] is nothing more than a subtle evasion, unsupported by the <span class="greekheb">ἐάν</span> (comp. <a href="/john/12-32.htm" title="And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.">John 12:32</a>, <a href="/john/14-3.htm" title="And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.">John 14:3</a>, <a href="/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7</a>), and no better than Hengstenberg’s assertion (comp. Tholuck): “those who were present at the ascension were the <span class="ital">representatives</span> of the collective body of the disciples.” Parallel with <span class="greekheb">ἀναβαίνειν</span> is the designation of the death of Jesus as <span class="ital">a going to God</span>, <a href="/john/7-33.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.">John 7:33</a>, <a href="/john/13-3.htm" title="Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;">John 13:3</a>, <a href="/john/14-12.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father.">John 14:12</a>; <a href="/john/14-28.htm" title="You have heard how I said to you, I go away, and come again to you.

II. 1, 517, and Godet). Jesus there is speaking <span class="ital">after</span> His death, when that blessed <span class="ital">end</span> was still future, in reference to which <span class="ital">before</span> His death he was wont to describe that event as a departure and an ascension to the Father. There, accordingly, He could not avoid mentioning the ascension <span class="ital">alone</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[248] “For they would certainly see Him die, but they would see Him ascend only if they remained His disciples,” Hofmann. The former is as incorrect as the latter. For Jesus is speaking to His <span class="ital">Galilean</span> disciples, and, indeed, to His disciples in the <span class="ital">wider</span> sense (ver. 67), of whom therefore we cannot say that they would certainly he present at His death in Jerusalem; while the witnesses of the ascension were not those who remained faithful to Him generally, but the <span class="ital">apostles</span>. According to Harless, Christ means to say that they must not think of His flesh and blood in His state of humiliation, but of both in His state of glory. But flesh and blood is the contradictory of <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>. The <span class="ital">glorified</span> body of Christ in the form of <span class="ital">flesh and blood</span> is <span class="ital">inconceivable</span> (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-49.htm" title="And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly....">1 Corinthians 15:49-50</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[249] The meaning is not that <span class="ital">“we immediately substitute another subject”</span> (Beyschlag, <span class="ital">Christol</span>. p. 29); but, in harmony with the witness of Jesus regarding Himself elsewhere in John, we have given us a <span class="ital">more definite</span> mention of the state wherein the Son of man had His pre-existence in heaven. That He had this <span class="ital">as the Son of man</span>, as Beyschlag, p. 85, explains (understanding it of the eternal divine image, whose temporal realization Jesus, by an intuition given Him on earth, knew Himself to be), the text does not say; it says: “the Son of man, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the Messiah, will ascend up where He was before.” There can be no doubt, if we will follow John, <span class="ital">in what form of existence</span> He previously was in heaven. Neither is there any doubt if we ask Paul, who speaks of the pre-existence of <span class="ital">Jesus</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν μορφῇ θεοῦ</span>. See on <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Php 2:6</a>; comp. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/8-8.htm" title="I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love....">2 Corinthians 8:8-9</a>. He does not there mean that He pre-existed <span class="ital">as Jesus</span>, but as the <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεοῦ</span>. For the rest, comp. ver. 46, <a href="/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a>, <a href="/john/7-5.htm" title="For neither did his brothers believe in him.">John 7:5</a>, <a href="/john/1-8.htm" title="He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.">John 1:8</a>. If it be true, as Keim says (<span class="ital">Geschichtl. Chr</span>. p. 102, ed. 3), that “not one particle of the self-consciousness of Jesus reaches back beyond His temporal existence,” the fundamental Christological view not only of the fourth Gospel, but of Paul also, is based upon a great illusion. As to the Synoptics, see on <a href="/matthew/11-27.htm" title="All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.">Matthew 11:27</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/6-61.htm" title="When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, Does this offend you?">John 6:61</a>. This apparently was said out of the hearing of Jesus, for <a href="/john/6-61.htm" title="When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, Does this offend you?">John 6:61</a> says <span class="greekheb">εἰδὼς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐν ἑαυτῷ</span>, “Jesus knowing in Himself,” that is, perceiving that they were murmuring, He intuitively understood what it was they were stumbling at, and said <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο ὑμᾶς</span> … <span class="greekheb">πρότερον</span>; “Does this saying stumble you? If then ye see the Son of Man ascending where He was before—” What are we to supply? Either, Will you not be much more scandalised? Or, Will you not then be convinced? According to the former, the sense would be: If now you say, how can this Man give us His flesh to eat? much more will you then say so when His flesh wholly disappears. But the second interpretation gives the better sense: You will find it easier to believe I came down from heaven, when you see me returning thither. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>; <a href="/john/13-3.htm" title="Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;">John 13:3</a>. You will then recognise also in what sense I said that you must eat my flesh. <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα ἐστι τὸ ζωοποιοῦν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ σὰρξ οὐκ ὠφελεῖ οὐδέν</span>. It was therefore the spirit animating the flesh in His giving of it which profited; not the external sacrifice of His body, but the spirit which prompted it was efficacious. The acceptance of God’s judgment of sin, the devotedness to man and perfect harmony with God, shown in the cross, is what brings life to the world; and it is this Spirit men are invited to partake of. It is therefore not a fleshly but a spiritual transaction of which I have been speaking to you. [Bengel excellently: “Non sola Deitas Christi, nec solus Spiritus sanctus significatur, sed universe <span class="ital">Spiritus</span>, cui contradistinguitur <span class="ital">caro</span>”.] <span class="greekheb">τὰ ῥήματα</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐστιν</span>, His entire discourse at Capernaum, and whatever other sayings He had uttered, were spirit and life. It was through what He said that He made Himself known and offered Himself to them. To those who believed His words, spirit and life came in their believing. By believing they were brought into contact with the life in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">61</span>. <span class="ital">knew in himself</span>] Again He appears as the reader of the heart.
