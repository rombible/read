These are called the flesh and blood of Christ, because they are purchased by the breaking his body, and the shedding of his blood. Also, because they are meat and drink to our souls. Eating this flesh and drinking this blood mean believing in Christ. We partake of Christ and his benefits by faith. The soul that rightly knows its state and wants, finds whatever can calm the conscience, and promote true holiness, in the redeemer, God manifest in the flesh. Meditating upon the cross of Christ gives life to our repentance, love, and gratitude. We live by him, as our bodies live by our food. We live by him, as the members by the head, the branches by the root: because he lives we shall live also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is meat indeed - Is truly food.

Not in a corporeal, but in a spiritual sense; and the same is said of his blood: <p>and my blood is drink indeed, &amp;c. that is, they are both "truly" meat and drink, as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions render it; or are "true" meat and drink, as the Arabic version: in opposition to what was typical meat and drink; as the manna in the wilderness, the water out of the rock, the flesh and wine at the passover, the meat and drink offerings under the law, or any other meats and drinks under that dispensation; and which, though not when Christ said these words, yet now are abolished, being unprofitable, and not to be fed upon. Moreover, these phrases may denote the reality, substance, and solidity of that spiritual food believers have in Christ, in opposition to the imaginary food of sensual sinners, who feed on ashes and bread of deceit; and to that of self-righteous persons, who spend their labour and money for, and live upon that which is not bread, even upon their works of righteousness; and to the superficial tastes of hypocrites and formal professors; and to the charge of enthusiasm; and even to the outward elements of bread, and wine, in the Lord's supper, since instituted; and as it may be attended upon by persons destitute of the grace of God. And these words may also be expressive of the virtue, efficacy, and excellency of this food, it being soul quickening, nourishing, strengthening, satisfying, and delightful food, as well as spiritual and savoury; not to carnal persons, or outward professors, but to new born babes, and true believers; and which, by them, may be had, and to the full, and that in due season, even every day, and is what will abide for ever. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/john/6-55.htm" title="For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed....">John 6:55-56</a>.

The satisfying, genuine character of Christ as the bread consists especially in this, that <span class="greekheb">ὁ τρώγων</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐμοὶ μένει κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτῷ</span>. He becomes as truly assimilated to the life of the individual as the nourishing elements in food enter into the substance of the body. The believer abides in Christ as finding his life in Him (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>); and Christ abides in the believer, continually imparting to him what constitutes spiritual life. For in Christ man reaches the source of all life in the Father (<a href="/john/6-57.htm" title="As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.">John 6:57</a>), <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἀπέστειλέ με ὁ ζῶν πατὴρ</span> … <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἐμέ</span>. The living Father has sent Christ forth as the bearer of life. He lives <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸν πατέρα</span>, not equivalent to <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ πατρός</span>, through or by means of the Father, but “because of,” or “by reason of the Father”. The Father is the cause of my life; I live because the Father lives. [Beza quotes from the <span class="ital">Plutus</span> of Aristoph., 470, the declaration of Penia that <span class="greekheb">μόνην Ἀγαθῶν ἁπάντων οὖσαν αἰτίαν ἐμὲ Ὑμῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἐμέ τε ζῶντας ὑμᾶς</span>.] The Father is the absolute source of life; the Son is the bearer of that life to the world; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/john/5-26.htm" title="For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;">John 5:26</a>, where the same dependence of the Son on the Father for life is expressed. The second member of the comparison, introduced by <span class="greekheb">καί</span> (see Winer, p. 548; and the <span class="ital">Nic.

(The two <span class="accented">active</span> verbals are adopted, "eating," "drinking;" but <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> are used very frequently by the Attic writers for "food" and "drink<span class="accented"></span>," as well as for the processes of eating and drinking.) That is, Christ's flesh and blood stand in the same relation to the true life of man that food and drink do to the physical life of earth; and so, unless we duly and fully assimilate Divine humanity, we have no life in us. If we cannot assimilate food, we die. It must become part of our life blood and permeate our system; so "the coming and believing" must mean such an acceptance of the Christ that the love of God penetrates our whole being, "even the joints and marrow of soul and spirit;" unless it does so, we have no life in us. Lange, even here, presses the idea of the flesh and blood of Christ as being true food, seeing that by <span class="accented">believing historic</span> contemplation we participate in the "historic form of his manifestation," and by <span class="accented">spiritual</span> contemplation and <span class="accented">fervent faith</span> we drink in the blood which is the life. The difference between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> is nearly that between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The former is the antithesis of the merely apparent food; the latter would have meant genuine food answering to the ideal of food. "The true food" is the food for the inner man - food <span class="accented">in all reality</span>. The Lord was speaking to them of a unique relation which he sustained to the human race, and which cannot be explained away into some mere euphemism for the blessedness and stimulating character of the gospel message. This is made still more evident by his next words - <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Indeed (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Literally, truly.
