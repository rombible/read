The observations they made are described under <span class="greekheb">ἰδών</span>, which never finds its verb, but is resumed in <span class="greekheb">ὅτε οὖν εἴδεν</span> of <a href="/john/6-24.htm" title="When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.">John 6:24</a>; and their consequent action is described in the main verbs of the sentence <span class="greekheb">ἐμέβησαν</span> (<a href="/john/6-24.htm" title="When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.">John 6:24</a>) <span class="greekheb">καὶ ᾖλθον</span>. With the unconscious but accurate observation of a fishing population in such matters, the crowd had noticed that there was only one boat lying on the beach at that point, and further that the disciples had gone away in it and had not taken Jesus with them. But in the morning, having presumably passed the night in the open air, and having gathered at the lake-side below the scene of the miracle, they found that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there. Apparently they expected that the disciples would have returned for Jesus, and that they might find both Him and them on the shore. Disappointed in this expectation, and concluding that Jesus had returned by land as He had come, or had left in one of the Tiberias boats, they themselves entered the boats from Tiberias, which had been driven ashore by the gale of the previous night, and crossed to Capernaum. This account of the movements and motives of the crowd seems to give each expression its proper force. The fact parenthetically introduced, <a href="/john/6-23.htm" title="(However, there came other boats from Tiberias near to the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)">John 6:23</a>, that boats from Tiberias had put in on the east shore, is an incidental confirmation of the truth that a gale had been blowing the night before. What portion of the belated crowd went back to Capernaum in these Tiberias boats we do not know.—<span class="greekheb">εὑρόντες αὐτὸν πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης</span>, having found Him on the other side of the lake, that is, on the Capernaum side, <span class="greekheb">εἶπον</span> … <span class="greekheb">γέγονας</span>, “they said to Him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?” “Quaestio de tempore includit quaestionem de modo” (Bengel).

On the contrary, if these had been fictitious, we may be sure that they would have been much simpler. Indeed a forger would never have thought of relating how the crowd got across the sea at all. We see the natural partiality with which the Evangelist dwells upon scenes with which he is familiar. He had been a fisherman on the sea of Galilee himself. He knew the boats of Tiberias from those of Capernaum and the other cities, and had probably friends or relations in that very crowd.” S. pp. 126, 127.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/6-22.htm" title="The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one into where his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;">John 6:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰδών</span>, <span class="ital">having seen</span>) This is repeated with some slight change of the words, after <a href="/john/6-23.htm" title="(However, there came other boats from Tiberias near to the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)">John 6:23</a> (which does not depend on <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, but forms a parenthesis), at <a href="/john/6-24.htm" title="When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.">John 6:24</a>, and is connected with the word <span class="greekheb">ἐνέβησαν</span>, <span class="ital">they embarked in</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-59.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">The sequel of the signs</span>. The discussion which follows is closely linked with these two great miracles of power and love. It naturally arises out of them, and refers with great explicitness to the former of them and to its true meaning. The discussion does unquestionably alter its scope as it proceeds, and at vers. 41 and 52 "the Jews" take up a controversy which had previously been conducted by a portion of the crowd who witnessed his mighty works. Jesus declared <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he is himself the Bread of God - the Bread of life for a starving world; then <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that his "flesh," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. his wondrous <span class="accented">humanity</span> - the veritable abode of the Word of God - will constitute the food of man; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the death of the Divine humanity, the separation of his blood and flesh, must be appropriated by men; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that only by this acceptance and entire assimilation - not only of his mission, but of his incarnation; not only of his incarnation, but of his sacrificial death - will men receive him, or live because he lives. Before the evangelist proceeds to relate this great discourse, he portrays the historical platform, the audience to which it is addressed, and this in a sentence which is unusually involved and perplexed in its construction. The first clause with its verb, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, is not completed until two or three parenthetical ideas are introduced; and then in ver. 24 the sentence is taken up or recom-menced, after which the main affirmation follows, viz. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, etc. The whole sentence is intended to explain the regathering of the crowd on the seashore at Capernaum,  and that excited state of baulked curiosity with which they encountered the Lord. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The next day, the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea,</span> near the site of the great miracle, amazed at the departure of the disciples and the separation between them and Jesus, <span class="cmt_word">and saw that there was only one little boat</span> <span class="cmt_word">there</span>  - or "none other little boat there save one," and this was too small for it to be the boat which brought Jesus and his disciples thither or took the latter away - and saw <span class="cmt_word">that Jesus did not enter with his disciples into the boat</span> in which they were accustomed to move about the lake, <span class="cmt_word">but that his disciples departed alone</span> (<span class="cmt_word">Howbeit</span>  <span class="cmt_word">there came boats from Tiberias,</span> the principal station on the lake, the boatmen hoping to secure numerous ferry freights, <span class="cmt_word">near to the place where they did eat bread after that the Lord had given thanks,</span> associating the marvellous gift with the holy thanksgiving of the wondrous Host). He does not say that Tiberias was near to the place where, etc., but that the boats from Tiberias came near to the place, etc. This parenthesis makes it clear that this one little boat was the only one belonging to the desert place, and could not have conveyed Jesus away. <span class="cmt_word">When then the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples</span> - the latter had gone and not returned, and Jesus could not be found on the mountain side or summit or hollows (not until we reach this statement does the writer give the principal verb of the sentence) - <span class="cmt_word">they themselves embarked in the little boats, and came to Capernaum seeking for Jesus</span>. This does not mean that the entire multitude took shipping. Such an exaggeration, contrary to the nature of even the most extravagant legend, some (Strauss) have tried to foist into the story for the sake of discrediting it. The geographical relation of the two places shows that there were other ways of passing from one spot to the other than by ship. That some should return by the head of the lake, and others should cross its northern are by boat to Capernaum, reveals a simple and interesting fact, which is incidentally conveyed by the synoptists, viz. that Capernaum was the customary dwelling place of our Lord during his Galilaean ministry (cf. <a href="/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5</a>; and see also <a href="/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>; <a href="/luke/4-24.htm">Luke 4:24</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Which stood (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Having remained daring the night near the scene of the miracle, and being there still.<p>Boat (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Diminutive: little boat.<p>That - whereinto His disciples were entered<p>Omit, and read as Rev., save one. </body></html>
