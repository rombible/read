They had seen miracles and had felt their force as wonders; what they had not done was to enter into the spiritual significance, and see in them signs of the eternal truth.

It was to them nothing more than an eating yesterday, which may be repeated to-day; or it may be He will allow them to take Him and make Him King now, though He did not then.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:22-27 Instead of answering the inquiry how he came there, Jesus blamed their asking.

To seek him because they had seen them, and were convinced by them that he was the Messiah, would have been proper; but to follow him simply because their wants were supplied was mere selfishness of a gross kind. Yet, alas! many seek religion from no better motive than this. They suppose that it will add to their earthly happiness, or they seek only to escape from suffering or from the convictions of conscience, or they seek for heaven only as a place of enjoyment, and regard religion as valuable only for this. All this is mere selfishness. Religion does not forbid our regarding our own happiness, or seeking it in any proper way; but when this is the only or the prevailing motive, it is evident that we have never yet sought God aright. We are aiming at the loaves and fishes, and not at the honor of God and the good of his kingdom; and if this is the only or the main motive of our entering the church, we cannot be Christians. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. Ye seek me, &c.&#8212;Jesus does not put them through their difficulty, says nothing of His treading on the waves of the sea, nor even notices their question, but takes advantage of the favorable moment for pointing out to them how forward, flippant, and superficial were their views, and how low their desires. "Ye seek Me not because ye saw the miracles"&#8212;literally, "the signs," that is, supernatural tokens of a higher presence, and a divine commission, "but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled." From this He proceeds at once to that other Bread, just as, with the woman of Samaria, to that other Water (Joh 4:9-15). We should have supposed all that follows to have been delivered by the wayside, or wherever they happened first to meet. But from Joh 6:59 we gather that they had probably met about the door of the synagogue&#8212;"for that was the day in which they assembled in their synagogues" [Lightfoot]&#8212;and that on being asked, at the close of the service, if He had any word of exhortation to the people, He had taken the two breads, the perishing and the living bread, for the subject of His profound and extraordinary discourse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/john/6-25.htm" title="And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when came you here?">John 6:25</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus answered them and said,....

The Discourse on the Son as the Support of Life<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>God’s revealed word and created world are unhappily alike in this; that the most beautiful places in each are often the scene and subject of strife. This marvellous discourse is a well-known field of controversy, as to whether it does or does not refer to the Eucharist. That it has no reference whatever to the Eucharist seems incredible, when we remember (1) the startling words here used about eating the Flesh of the Son of Man and drinking His Blood; (2) that just a year from this time Christ instituted the Eucharist; (3) that the primitive Church is something like unanimous in interpreting this discourse as referring to the Eucharist. A few words are necessary on each of these points. (1) Probably nowhere in any literature, not even among the luxuriant imagery of the East, can we find an instance of a teacher speaking of the reception of his doctrine under so astounding a metaphor as eating his flesh and drinking his blood. Something more than this must at any rate be meant here. The metaphor ‘eating a man’s flesh’ elsewhere means to injure or destroy him. <a href="/psalms/27-2.htm" title="When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes, came on me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.">Psalm 27:2</a> (<a href="/john/14-4.htm" title="And where I go you know, and the way you know.">John 14:4</a>); <a href="/james/5-3.htm" title="Your gold and silver is corroded; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. You have heaped treasure together for the last days.">James 5:3</a>. (2) The founding of new religions, especially of those which have had any great hold on the minds of men, has ever been the result of much thought and deliberation. Let us leave out of the account the Divinity of Jesus Christ, and place Him for the moment on a level with other great teachers. Are we to suppose that just a year before the Eucharist was instituted, the Founder of this, the most distinctive element of Christian worship, had no thought of it in His mind? Surely for long beforehand that institution was in His thoughts; and if so, ‘Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man and drink His Blood, ye have no life in you’ cannot but have some reference to ‘Take eat, this is My Body,’ ‘Drink ye all of it, for this is My Blood.’ The coincidence is too exact to be fortuitous, even if it were probable that a year before it was instituted the Eucharist was still unknown to the Founder of it. That the audience at Capernaum could not thus understand Christ’s words is nothing to the point: He was speaking less to them than to Christians throughout all ages. How often did He utter words which even Apostles could not understand at the time. (3) The interpretations of the primitive Church are not infallible, even when they are almost unanimous: but they carry great weight. And in a case of this kind, where spiritual insight and Apostolic tradition are needed, rather than scholarship and critical power, patristic authority may be allowed the very greatest weight.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But while it is incredible that there is <span class="ital">no</span> reference to the Eucharist in this discourse, it is equally incredible that the reference is solely or primarily to the Eucharist. The wording of the larger portion of the discourse is against any such exclusive interpretation; not until <span class="ital"><a href="/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51</a></span> does the reference to the Eucharist become clear and direct. Rather the discourse refers to <span class="ital">all</span> the various channels of grace by means of which Christ imparts Himself to the believing soul: and who will dare to limit these in number or efficacy?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To quote the words of Dr Westcott, the discourse “cannot refer primarily to the Holy Communion; nor again can it be simply prophetic of that Sacrament. The teaching has a full and consistent meaning in connexion with the actual circumstances, and it treats essentially of spiritual realities with which no external act, as such, can be extensive. The well-known words of Augustine, <span class="ital">crede et manducasti</span>, ‘believe and thou <span class="ital">hast</span> eaten,’ give the sum of the thoughts in a luminous and pregnant sentence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“But, on the other hand, there can be no doubt that the truth which is presented in its absolute form in these discourses is presented in a specific act and in a concrete form in the Holy Communion; and yet further that the Holy Communion is the divinely appointed means whereby men may realise the truth. Nor can there be any difficulty to any one who acknowledges a divine fitness in the ordinances of the Church, an eternal correspondence in the parts of the one counsel of God, in believing that the Lord, while speaking intelligibly to those who heard Him at the time, gave by anticipation a commentary, so to speak, on the Sacrament which He afterwards instituted.” <span class="ital">Speaker’s Commentary</span>, ii. p. 113.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The discourse may be thus divided; i. 26–34, Distinction between the material bread and the Spiritual Bread; ii. 35–50 (with two digressions, 37–40; 43–46), Identification of the Spiritual Bread with Christ; iii. 51–58, Further definition of the identification as consisting in the giving of His Body and outpouring of His Blood.
