If it is retained here, it must, however, be noted that it is a compound of the word rendered “life” at the close of the verse. “It is the spirit that giveth life . . . the words . . . are spirit and are life.” These words are immediately connected with the thought of the Ascension, which was to precede the gift of the Spirit.

The Messiah's kingdom was not of this world; and they were to understand by faith, what he had said of a spiritual living upon him, and his fulness. As without the soul of man the flesh is of no value, so without the quickening Spirit of God all forms of religion are dead and worthless. He who made this provision for our souls, alone can teach us these things, and draw us unto Christ, that we may live by faith in him.

The word "Spirit," here, evidently does not refer to the Holy Spirit, for he adds, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit." He refers here, probably, to the doctrine which he had been teaching in opposition to their notions and desires. "My doctrine is spiritual; it is fitted to quicken and nourish the soul. It is from heaven. Your doctrine or your views are earthly, and may be called flesh, or fleshly, as pertaining only to the support of the body. You place a great value on the doctrine that Moses fed the body; yet that did not permanently profit, for your fathers are dead. You seek also food from me, but your views and desires are gross and earthly."<p>Quickeneth - Gives life.

The bread that Moses gave, the food which you seek, would not be of real value to man's highest wants.<p>They are spirit - They are spiritual. They are not to be understood literally, as if you were really to eat my flesh, but they are to be understood as denoting the need of that provision for the soul which God has made by my coming into the world.<p>Are life - Are fitted to produce or give life to the soul dead in sins. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>63. the flesh profiteth nothing&#8212;Much of His discourse was about "flesh"; but flesh as such, mere flesh, could profit nothing, much less impart that life which the Holy Spirit alone communicates to the soul.<p>the words that I speak &#8230; are spirit and &#8230; life&#8212;The whole burden of the discourse is "spirit," not mere flesh, and "life" in its highest, not its lowest sense, and the words I have employed are to be interpreted solely in that sense.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As it is not the bread or flesh that a man eateth for the sustenance of his animal or natural life, that doth the main work, but the soul of a man within him, which putteth forth its virtues and powers in causing the digestion, concoction, and alteration of it, without which it nourisheth not the body; so the flesh of Christ eaten carnally can be of no profit for the nourishment of the soul: nor can the flesh of Christ considered alone, or by any virtue in it, profit; it only profiteth by virtue of the Divine nature, which being personally united to the human nature, addeth all the virtue and merit to the sufferings and actions of the human nature; so as the human nature of Christ hath all its quickening virtue from the Divine nature. It is not therefore the carnal eating of my flesh that I intended, that is a very gross conception of yours; nor can any such thing as that do you good: but the words that I speak to you, they are spiritual, and such by the belief of which you may obtain a spiritual and eternal life; for by believing those words, and obeying them, you shall come to believe in me, which is that eating my flesh and drinking my blood which I intended, not any corporeal or carnal eating. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It is the Spirit that quickeneth,.... It is the spirit of man that quickens him; or which being breathed into him, he becomes a living soul; for the body, without the spirit, is dead; it is a lifeless lump: and it is the Spirit of God that quickens dead sinners, by entering into them as the spirit of life, and causing them to live: and it is spiritual eating, or eating the flesh, and drinking the blood of Christ in a spiritual sense, which quickens, refreshes, and comforts the minds of believers; it is that by, and on which they live, and by which their spiritual strength is renewed: unless, by spirit, is meant the divine nature of Christ, by which he was quickened and raised from the dead, and ascended up into heaven, and was declared to be the Son of God with power: <p>the flesh profiteth nothing; the human nature of Christ, though profitable, as in union with the Son of God, to be given for the life of his people, and to be an offering, and a sacrifice for their sins, yet not as alone, or as abstracted from the divine nature; nor would his flesh and blood, corporeally eaten, could, or should it be done, be of any avail to eternal life; nor is any other flesh, literally understood, profitable of itself for life; for man lives not by bread, or meat, or flesh alone, but by the word and blessing of God upon it, and along with it; nor flesh, in a figurative sense, as creature acts and performances, self-righteousness, obedience to the ceremonial law, carnal descent, and birth privileges: <p>the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life; the doctrines which Christ had then been delivering concerning himself, his flesh and blood, being spiritually understood, are the means of quickening souls. The Gospel, and the truths of it, which are the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ, are the means of conveying the Spirit of God, as a spirit of illumination and sanctification, into the hearts of men, and of quickening sinners dead in trespasses and sins: the Gospel is the Spirit that giveth life, and is the savour of life unto life, when it comes not in word only, or in the bare ministry of it, but with the energy of the Holy Ghost, and the power of divine grace. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{14}</span> It is the <span class="cverse3">{x}</span> spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, <i>they</i> are spirit, and <i>they</i> are life.</span><p>(14) The flesh of Christ therefore quickens us, because he that is man is God: and this mystery is only comprehended by faith, which is the gift of God, found only in the elect.<p>(x) Spirit, that is, that power which flows from the Godhead causes the flesh of Christ (which is otherwise nothing but flesh) both to live in itself and to give life to us.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life....">John 6:63-64</a>.

Comp. Hofmann, II. 2, p. 252. Note once again that <span class="greekheb">ἡ σάρξ οὐκ ὠφελεῖ οὐδέν</span> does not contradict what was previously said of the life-giving participation in the flesh of Jesus; for this can take place only by the appropriating of the <span class="ital">spirit</span> of Christ by means of faith, and apart from this it cannot take place at all. <a href="/romans/8-2.htm" title="For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.">Romans 8:2</a>; <a href="/romans/8-6.htm" title="For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.">Romans 8:6</a>; <a href="/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

The flesh, therefore, which “profiteth nothing,” is the flesh <span class="ital">without the Spirit;</span> the Spirit which “quickeneth” is the Spirit whose <span class="ital">dwelling-place</span> is the flesh, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the corporeal manifestation of Christ, the corporeity which must be offered up in His atoning death (<a href="/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51</a>), in order that believers might experience the full power of the quickening Spirit (<a href="/john/7-39.htm" title="(But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)">John 7:39</a>). When Harless, following Luther, understands by the flesh which profiteth nothing, the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> of Christ in His <span class="ital">humiliation</span>, and by the quickening Spirit, “<span class="ital">the spirit which perfectly controls the flesh of the glorified Son of man</span>,” he <span class="ital">imports</span> the essential point in his interpretation, and this, too, in opposition to the N. T., according to which the conception of <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> is quite alien to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣῶΜΑ Τῆς ΔΌΞΗς</span></span></span> of the Lord, <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Php 3:21</a>; see <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.

In no form is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΆΡΞ</span></span></span> ever ascribed to the <span class="ital">exalted</span> Lord. The antithesis here is not between carnal flesh and glorified flesh, but simply between flesh and spirit. According to others, <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span> is the human <span class="ital">soul</span>, which makes the <span class="ital">body</span> to have life (Beza, Fritzsche in his <span class="ital">Nov. Opusc</span>. p. 239). But <span class="greekheb">ζωοποιοῦν</span> must, according to the import of the preceding discourse, be taken in a <span class="ital">Messianic</span> sense. Others say: <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span> is the spiritual <span class="ital">participation</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ σάρξ</span> the material (Tertullian, Augustine, Rupertius, Calvin, Grotius, and most others; also Olshausen, comp. Kling and Richter); but thus again the peculiar element in the exposition, viz. the partaking of the <span class="ital">Lord’s Supper</span>, is foisted in.[251] Others, interpolating in like manner, interpret <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span> as the spiritual, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΣΆΡΞ</span></span></span> as the unspiritual, sensuous <span class="ital">understanding</span> (Chrysostom, Theophylact, Euthymius Zigabenus, Mosheim, Lampe, Klee, Ammon, etc.[252]); comp. Tholuck. Others differently still.[253] “Quantopere sit hic locus variis expositionibus exagitatus, vix credibile est,” Beza.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὰ ῥήματα ἃ ἐγὼ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] This does not mean that we are to hold to His <span class="ital">words</span> instead of to His corporeal <span class="ital">flesh</span> (Rückert, Keim), His words which remain as a compensation to us after His death (Lücke, De Wette, B. Crusius). It stands (seeing that <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> has already its full antithesis in what precedes) in close connection with the following <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ εἰσὶν ἐξ ὑμῶν τινες οἱ οὐ πιστ</span>., and therefore a comma only is to be placed after <span class="greekheb">ζωή ἐστιν</span>. “<span class="ital">The words which I have spoken unto you</span>” (meaning the discourse in the synagogue just ended[254]), “so far from containing any real ground for <span class="greekheb">σκάνδαλον</span>, <span class="ital">are</span> rather <span class="ital">spirit and life, i.e.</span> containing and revealing the divine spirit in me, and the Messianic life brought about by me; but the real guilt of the offence lies with <span class="ital">you, for among you are many who believe not</span>.” He, namely, who does not believe in Him as the true Messiah, who secures by His death the life of the world, but expects Messianic salvation by His corporeal manifestation alone, which is not to die, but to triumph and reign—to him who is such a <span class="greekheb">μαθητὴς</span> of Jesus the discourse concerning feeding upon His flesh and blood can only be a stumbling-block and an offence.

On this last point, see the note following <a href="/john/6-70.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?">John 6:70</a>. Were we, with Lange and Weiss, to render: “<span class="ital">from the beginning of their unbelief</span>,” this would apply only to disciples in constant intercourse with Him, whom He always could observe with heart-searching eye,—a limitation, however, not justified by the text, which rather by the very example of Judas, as the sole unbeliever in the immediate circle of His disciples, indicates a range beyond that inner circle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[250] Godet, according to his rendering of ver. 62: “which you will see to vanish at my ascension.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[251] Kahnis (<span class="ital">Abendm</span>. p. 122) has explained the passage in this sense seemingly in a manner most in keeping with the words: “What imparts the power of everlasting life to them who feed upon my flesh, is not the flesh as such, but the spirit which pervades it.” According to this view, the glorified flesh of Christ, which is eaten in the Supper, would be described as the vehicle of the Holy Spirit, and the latter, not the flesh itself, as that which gives life. Comp. also Luthardt. But it is self-evident that the thought of glorified flesh has to be imported from without.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[252] So also Luther: “Ye must indeed have the Spirit likewise, or obtain a spiritual understanding, because it is too high and inconceivable for the flesh.” See the striking remarks of Calovius against this interpretation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[253] Wieseler, on <span class="ital">Gal</span>. p. 446, takes <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> in the sense of original sin; sinful human nature can do nothing for man’s salvation; the Spirit of God produces this. But <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> must take its stricter definition <span class="ital">from the foregoing discourse;</span> and if it were intended as in <a href="/john/3-6.htm" title="That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.">John 3:6</a>, <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ὠφελεῖ οὐδέν</span> would be far too little to say of it. This also tells against the similar interpretation of Hengstenberg: “The <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> is the Spirit represented through Christ, and incarnate in Him, and the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> humanity destitute of the Spirit.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[254] The usual but arbitrarily general rendering brought with it the reading <span class="greekheb">λαλῶ</span>. Tholuck and Ebrard have the right reference.

Even Christ’s flesh in this sense ‘profiteth nothing.’ (Comp. <a href="/john/3-6.htm" title="That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.">John 3:6</a>.) Probably there is a general reference to their carnal ideas about the Messiah: it is “in our Lord’s refusal to assume the outward insignia of the Messianic dignity, and in His persistent spiritualisation of the Messianic idea” that we must seek “the ultimate cause” of the defection of so many disciples.

The antithesis between "flesh" and "spirit" occurs frequently in the Gospel, and is one of the great points of Pauline doctrine. The Lord does not introduce the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>. The statement is generalized, though having special reference to himself, or to the spirit and flesh of the Son of man. "Flesh," in neither St. Paul nor St. John, means the sensuous nature as opposed to the intellectual nature; nor does it mean the "body" as antithetic to the "soul" - the organized material frame, to which the Jews were attributing so much and felt to be the guarantee and seal of his spiritual efficiency (Meyer) - but the "creaturely nature," the "humanity" <span class="accented">per se</span> in all its parts. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." Christ <span class="accented">qua</span> his humanity was fashioned by the Spirit, and the Spirit dwelt upon him with iron measurable potence. "The Logos became flesh," but that flesh itself was so ordered and prepared by the Holy Spirit as that it should sustain this lofty companionship.  Christ's own flesh, his nature, his humanity <span class="accented">per se</span>, and apart from the fulness of the Spirit, profiteth nothing. The mere human life, however spotless and ideal, could not be "eaten," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. could not be assimilated, though to some extent it might be imitated; but imitation is not faith. The "glory" that the apostles saw "of the Only Begotten of the Father, the fulness of grace and truth," in and through that wondrous life of Christ, was the glory given to his humanity by the creative Spirit. Apart from this consideration, a manducation of his flesh, even were it physically possible, was useless. It was not possible to participate in his humanity save through the Holy Spirit which generated him and regenerates us. The sentence doubtless points back to the original constitution of man, the specialty of whose life is that it was inbreathed by the Lord God himself. The use of the saying here was to make it still more clear that he gave his flesh to eat, not through any physical process, not through any sacramental rite, but through the Spirit to our spirit. Mr. Sadler, who takes the strong sacramental view of the entire passage, says, however, wisely and forcibly here, "Even flesh cannot be given to a corpse." We receive the gift, we know the love of God, whether sacramentally or not, through the Spirit. Christ does not deny or retract the statement, "Except ye eat the flesh," etc. He simply shows in what sense he meant the <span class="accented">whole mutual indwelling of himself and his people to be understood</span>. The Spirit is the Quickener. The Spirit is the life-fashioning, life-pre-serving Energy. The flesh, the human manifestation, apart from the Spirit which makes that human life the centre of Divine effluence, the focus for its Divine energy, profiteth nothing. Some have taken these words (like Chrysostom) as a contrast between a spiritual and literal interpretation of Christ's words. Luther and many Lutherans have urged the contrast between a right celebration and a merely material use of the sacrament. So more or less Augustine and Olshausen. Canon Westcott seems to limit the original meaning of "flesh" and "spirit," the one to the visible, temporal, corporeal only, and the other to the unseen eternal order of things, and he does not give to "flesh" here the fulness of meaning which it bears in the New Testament; but he says that this utterance is not limited to either of the views just referred to, though it may include them. Archdeacon Watkins remarks, "They think of a physical eating of his flesh, and this offends them; but what if they, who have thought of bread descending from heaven, see his body ascending into heaven? They will know then he cannot have meant this. The descent of the Spirit will follow the ascent of the Son." <span class="cmt_word">The words that I have</span> <span class="cmt_word">spoken</span>  <span class="cmt_word">unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">you are spirit and are life.</span> The <span class="accented">words</span> which I have now uttered, these teachings of mine concerning myself, are (not merely "spiritual" or "life-giving," but) <span class="accented">spirit</span> and <span class="accented">life, i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the way and method in which the <span class="accented">Spirit</span> can convey to you the <span class="accented">life eternal</span>. The words which I have spoken at all times have been the effulgence of my glory, the effluence of my Spirit. The seed of the kingdom is the Word of God. The contact of the Divine Spirit with the human spirit is not through teeth and palate, but through mental and moral processes. "Thou hast the <span class="accented">words</span> of eternal life," said Peter (ver. 68). Christ thus works his way back again to the receptivity of the mind and heart of his disciples. Believing is not only "coming," but, as he has before implied, it is the identical process which he has called "eating his flesh and drinking his blood." Christ's words are the ministry of himself, because the chief method of communicating his life-giving Spirit. In <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4, 7</a> the Lord used both expressions, "I" and "my words," in identical relations: "Abide in me, and I in you;" "If ye abide in me, and <span class="accented">my words</span> abide in you," etc. </body></html>
