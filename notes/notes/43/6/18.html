There may be perils and afflictions of this present time, where there is an interest in Christ. Clouds and darkness often surround the children of the light and of the day. They see Jesus walking on the sea. Even the approaches of comfort and deliverance often are so mistaken, as to become the occasions of fear. Nothing is more powerful to convince sinners than that word, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest; nothing more powerful to comfort saints than this, I am Jesus whom thou lovest. If we have received Christ Jesus the Lord, though the night be dark, and the wind high, yet we may comfort ourselves, we shall be at the shore before long.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this miracle of walking on the sea explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22-33</a>.

Mark adds the graphic and touching particular, "He saw them toiling in rowing" (Mr 6:48), putting forth all their strength to buffet the waves and bear on against a head wind, but to little effect.
