Their "following" had not been by ship, but round the head of the lake, and across the ford of the Jordan, which is still situated about two miles from the point where the river flows into the Sea of Galilee. The multitudes would easily learn the direction of the well known boat with its solitary sail, and would be, some of them, ready at the landing place, to greet the Lord on his arrival. Many hours might elapse before the crowd had reached such vast proportions as we subsequently find. It may easily have been swollen by curious and inquisitive pilgrims, or by the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages, intent on a sight of the Prophet who had preached the sermon, who had spoken in wondrous parables, who had given such striking proof that "God was with him." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Multitude (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>.<p>Followed (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Imperfect tense, denoting not merely the following on this occasion, but generally.<p>Saw (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., beheld.
