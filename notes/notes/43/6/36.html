Therefore, your infidelity proceeds not from want of evidence, as you pretend, (<a href="/john/6-30.htm" title="They said therefore to him, What sign show you then, that we may see, and believe you? what do you work?">John 6:30</a>,) but from the perverseness of your own disposition. <span class="ital">All that the Father giveth me shall come to me </span>— Nevertheless, though you reject me, yet I shall not be universally rejected, nor shall the purposes of my mission be entirely frustrated; for all that hearken to the teaching of my Father, and in consequence thereof see themselves to be in a lost estate, guilty, depraved, weak, and wretched, and therefore follow the drawings of his grace, (see <a href="/context/john/6-44.htm" title="No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day....">John 6:44-45</a>, where our Lord’s meaning is explained,) <span class="ital">will come to me </span>— By faith: such as these the Father in a peculiar manner giveth to the Son. <span class="ital">And him that cometh to me </span>— Being thus convinced of sin, humbled, and penitent; <span class="ital">I will in no wise cast out </span>— I will give him pardon, holiness, and happiness, and even heaven, if he <span class="ital">continue in the faith, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel. </span>Thus our Lord encouraged his disciples, who had already believed on him; and at the same time invited those who were disposed to believe, from the consideration that he would not reject them, however low their circumstances might be, however vile they might appear in their own eyes, or however much they might have formerly injured him, by speaking evil of him and opposing him. “The expression, <span class="greekheb">ου μη εκβαλω εξω</span>, is extremely beautiful and emphatical. It represents an humble supplicant, as coming into the house of some prince, or other great person, to cast himself at his feet, and to commit himself to his protection and care. He might fear his petition would be rejected, and he be thrust out of doors: but our Lord assures him to the contrary.

The Father's will is, that not one of those who were given to the Son, should be rejected or lost by him. No one will come, till Divine grace has subdued, and in part changed his heart; therefore no one who comes will ever be cast out. The gospel finds none willing to be saved in the humbling, holy manner, made known therein; but God draws with his word and the Holy Ghost; and man's duty is to hear and learn; that is to say, to receive the grace offered, and consent to the promise. None had seen the Father but his beloved Son; and the Jews must expect to be taught by his inward power upon their minds, and by his word, and the ministers whom he sent among them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But I said unto you - This he said, not in so many words, but in substance, in <a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26</a>.

But although God and this perfect satisfaction were brought so near them, they did not believe: <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ εἶπον</span> … <span class="greekheb">πιστεύετε</span>.

Euthymius, preferably, says <span class="greekheb">εἰκὸς τοῦτο ῥηθῆναι μὲν</span>, <span class="greekheb">μὴ γραφῆναι δέ</span>. Lampe gives the alternatives without determining. Undoubtedly, although the reference may not be directly to <a href="/john/6-26.htm" title="Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.">John 6:26</a>, the <span class="greekheb">ἑωράκατε</span> means seeing Jesus in the exercise of His Messianic functions, doing the works given Him by the Father to do. But seeing is not in this case believing. It was found very possible to be in His company and to eat the provision He miraculously provided, and yet disbelieve. If so, what could produce belief? Might not His entire manifestation fail to accomplish its purpose?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">36</span>. <span class="ital">I said unto you</span>] When? no such saying is recorded. Ewald thus finds some slight evidence for his theory that a whole sheet of this Gospel has been lost between chapters 5 and 6. But the reference may easily be to one of the countless unrecorded sayings of Christ, or possibly to the general sense of <a href="/context/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape....">John 5:37-44</a>. In the latter case ‘you’ must mean the Jewish nation, for those verses were addressed to Jews at Jerusalem. See on <a href="/john/10-26.htm" title="But you believe not, because you are not of my sheep, as I said to you.">John 10:26</a>, where there is a somewhat similar case.

Some difficulty has arisen from our not being able to find, in the previous dialogue, the exact words here quoted. Some have supposed it to refer to an unrecorded conversation (Alford, Westcott), or even to some written sentence which is now a lost fragment of the discourse. Meyer says (without answering the suggestions of Olshausen, Hengstenberg, Godet, and others), that there is no such statement in the context, and proposes to translate <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (as he says it is not unfrequently found in Greek tragedians, as if it were equivalent to <span class="accented">dictum velim</span>) "I would have you told;" but there is no such usage in the New Testament, and <a href="/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a> does not seem a parallel ease. It is not at all probable that Jesus was referring to the language of <a href="/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>, words which were addressed to a different audience - to "Jews" at Jerusalem, and uttered many months before (Lucke and De Wette). But ver. 26 shows that Galilaeans had come to see him, and had come without belief in the great sign of his spiritual nature and claims which he had already granted. They had <span class="accented">seen</span> him and his great miracles, it is true; but they simply longed in consequence for "more bread" and "more healing," not for himself. In ver. 30 he draws from them a confession that they had not seen enough to believe him. This thought recurs not infrequently. "Have I been so long with you, and yet hast thou not known <span class="accented">me, Philip?"</span> "Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed" (<a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>). The setting forth of himself ought to have induced belief apart  even from works. He is so intensely conscious of the Divine reality himself, that he marvels at the unbelief of his hearers. Let them think as he does, and immediately the lifelong hunger and thirst of their souls would be satisfied. Seeing, however, is not believing in their ease; and he has already urged them to consider this lamentable spiritual blindness of theirs. The exclamation of this verse recites the obvious inference of the verses we have referred to, condenses into a sentence the spirit of what he had said, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>But<p>Though you have seen as you asked, I repeat what I said to you that you have seen and do not believe. </body></html>
