As without the soul of man the flesh is of no value, so without the quickening Spirit of God all forms of religion are dead and worthless.

It was applied to the followers of Christ because they were taught by him. It does not imply, of necessity, that those to whom it was given were real Christians, but simply that they were under his teaching, and were professed learners in his school. See <a href="/matthew/17-16.htm">Matthew 17:16</a>; <a href="/mark/2-18.htm">Mark 2:18</a>; <a href="/john/9-28.htm">John 9:28</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a>. It is doubtless used in this sense here. It is, however, often applied to those who are real Christians.<p>This is an hard saying - The word "hard" here means "offensive, disagreeable" - that which they could not bear.

The effect of this is stated in <a href="/john/6-66.htm">John 6:66</a>. The doctrines which Jesus taught that were so offensive appear to have been:<p>1. that he was superior to Moses.<p>2. that God would save all that he had chosen and those only.<p>3. that he said he was the bread that came from heaven.<p>4. that it was necessary to partake of that; that it was necessary that an atonement should be made, and that they should be saved by that.<p>These doctrines have always been among the most offensive that men have been called on to believe, and many, rather than trust in them, have chosen to draw back to perdition. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>60-65.

R.

In like sense the phrase is used here; and the allusion may be to food that is hard of digestion, since Christ had been speaking of himself under the metaphors of bread and meat. As some of the doctrines of Christ are comparable to milk, which is easy of digestion; others are like to strong meat, which belongs to those of full age, and cannot be digested by children, by babes in Christ, and much less be received, ate, and digested, with ease and pleasure, by carnal minds; who therefore say, as these Capernaites did, <p>who can hear it? this saying, or doctrine, concerning eating the flesh, and drinking the blood of Christ; or "him" Christ, who delivered this doctrine: such preaching, and such a preacher, are intolerable; there is no hearing, nor bearing them: hence we afterwards read, that these withdrew from the ministry of Christ, <a href="/john/6-66.htm">John 6:66</a>. <p>(z) Misn.

By this—whether they rightly understood it or not—they felt sorely perplexed and wounded. The <span class="ital">bloody</span> death, which was certainly the condition of the eating and drinking, was an offence to them, just as in that lay the lasting offence of the Jews afterwards, <a href="/john/12-34.htm" title="The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ stays for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?">John 12:34</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-11.htm" title="And I, brothers, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased.">Galatians 5:11</a>; comp. also <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.">Matthew 16:21</a> ff.

But it was not the <span class="ital">arrogant</span>, it was the lowly and suffering, Messiah that was a <span class="greekheb">σκάνδαλον</span> to the Jew.

The synoptists tell us of much labour already done in this neighbourhood, and a considerable harvest of souls reaped, so far as a general acknowledgement of his claims and an expectation that he was the Messiah was involved: <span class="cmt_word">When they heard it</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the entire instruction given in open synagogue), <span class="cmt_word">said, This is a hard saying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> cannot or need not be confined to any one of these <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, but may easily embrace them all).

It does not mean "hard to be understood," but difficult to accept or be content with. Luthardt here reiterates his conviction that there is no reference in it to the death of Christ, and that the disciples were simply unwilling to accept the idea of his supreme claims and his constant return to the. eating and drinking of his flesh and blood and identification of this eternal life with participation in his corporality. But surely Meyer and Wcstcott, etc., are far nearer to the truth in referring the expression to their unwillingness to accept the bloody death of their Messiah, or to entrust themselves to a Divine Personality whose most distinctive act would be his sacrifice. This was the gross and terrible offence which made the cross a stumbling block to the Jew (see <a href="/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-2.htm">Matthew 16:2</a>l, etc.).
