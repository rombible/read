These are called the flesh and blood of Christ, because they are purchased by the breaking his body, and the shedding of his blood. Also, because they are meat and drink to our souls. Eating this flesh and drinking this blood mean believing in Christ. We partake of Christ and his benefits by faith. The soul that rightly knows its state and wants, finds whatever can calm the conscience, and promote true holiness, in the redeemer, God manifest in the flesh. Meditating upon the cross of Christ gives life to our repentance, love, and gratitude. We live by him, as our bodies live by our food. We live by him, as the members by the head, the branches by the root: because he lives we shall live also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is that bread ... - This is the true bread that came down.

This is that bread, &c.&#8212;a sort of summing up of the whole discourse, on which let this one further remark suffice&#8212;that as our Lord, instead of softening down His figurative sublimities, or even putting them in naked phraseology, leaves the great truths of His Person and Office, and our participation of Him and it, enshrined for all time in those glorious forms of speech, so when we attempt to strip the truth of these figures, figures though they be, it goes away from us, like water when the vessel is broken, and our wisdom lies in raising our own spirit, and attuning our own ear, to our Lord's chosen modes of expression. (It should be added that although this discourse has nothing to do with the Sacrament of the Supper, the Sacrament has everything to do with it, as the visible embodiment of these figures, and, to the believing partaker, a real, yea, and the most lively and affecting participation of His flesh and blood, and nourishment thereby of the spiritual and eternal life, here below).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There is no more said in this verse than <span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/6-49.htm" title="Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead....">John 6:49-51</a></span>: <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/john/6-49.htm" title="Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.">John 6:49</a>"</span>, and following verses to <span class="bld"><a href="/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51</a></span>. From this whole discourse it is as evident as the light, that the justification of the soul depends upon believing; and the spiritual life of the soul floweth not from love or obedience to the works of the law, but from faith in Jesus Christ: though it be true, that true faith cannot be without works, and no man without obedience in sincerity (though not in perfection) to the will of God, shall ever obtain eternal life and salvation; but this obedience is not faith, nor doth it enter into the justification of the soul, but is the certain and necessary product of that faith which justifieth, which cannot be justified as true and saving without obedience. In all this discourse here is no mention of love, or obedience, as that to which the promises of life everlasting and a joyful resurrection are so often made; but only of eating Christ; eating his flesh and drinking his blood; eating him as the bread which came down from heaven, &c.; which are phrases no way expressive of obedience to the works of the law, but of believing, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/6-47.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me has everlasting life....">John 6:47-49</a></span>.
