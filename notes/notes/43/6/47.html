He there declared the Father’s will, that every one seeing the Son and believing on Him may have eternal life. No man had ever seen the Father, but the Son was then standing in human form before them, and this will was being accomplished, and for the believer eternal life was not only of the future but of the actual present, “He hath eternal life.” (Comp. <a href="/john/3-15.htm" title="That whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.">John 3:15</a>; <a href="/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:47-51 The advantage of the manna was small, it only referred to this life; but the living Bread is so excellent, that the man who feedeth on it shall never die. This bread is Christ's human nature, which he took to present to the Father, as a sacrifice for the sins of the world; to purchase all things pertaining to life and godliness, for sinners of every nation, who repent and believe in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not that any man hath seen the Father - Jesus added this, evidently, to guard against mistake. He had said that all who came to him were taught of God. The teacher was commonly seen and heard by the pupil; but, lest it should be supposed that he meant to say that a man to come to him must see and hear God, visibly and audibly, he adds that he did not intend to affirm this. It was still true that no man had seen God at any time. They were not, therefore, to expect to see God, and his words were not to be perverted as if he meant to teach that.<p>Save he which is of God - Jesus here evidently refers to himself as the Son of God. He had just said that no man had seen the Father. When he affirms that he has seen the Father, it implies that he is more than man. He is the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, <a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>; the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; God over all, blessed forever, <a href="/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>. By his being of God is meant that he is the only-begotten Son of God, and sent as the Messiah into the world.<p>Hath seen - Hath intimately known or perceived him. He knows his nature, character, plans. This is a claim to knowledge superior to what man possesses, and it cannot be understood except by supposing that Jesus is equal with God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>47-51.
