John indicates nothing further, not even that the Lord wished to provide <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ δόξῃ φαντασία τις τὸ γενόμενον</span> (Euthymius Zigabenus, Erasmus, and most others).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[226] Luther’s translation, “as much as <span class="ital">He would</span>,” rests upon an unsupported reading in Erasmus, edd. 1 and 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[227] By Ewald (<span class="ital">Gesch.

This is incompatible with the personal recollection and testimony of John, whom Hase, indeed, supposes by some accident to have been absent from the scene. With equally laboured and mistaken logic, Schleiermacher (<span class="ital">L.

Weizsäcker leaves the fact, which is here the symbol of the blessing of Jesus, in perfect uncertainty; but the description by an eye-witness of the work effected in its miraculous character, which only leaves the <span class="ital">how</span> unexplained, does not admit of such an evasion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/6-10.htm" title="And Jesus said, Make the men sit down.

The moral ground for the miracle being thus prepared Jesus at once says, <span class="greekheb">ποιήσατε τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἀναπεσεῖν</span>. [For the form of speech <span class="ital">cf.</span> Soph., <span class="ital">Philoct.</span>, 925, <span class="greekheb">κλύειν</span> … <span class="greekheb">με</span> … <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖ</span>.] This order was given for two reasons: (1) that there might be no unseemly crowding round Him and crushing out of the weaker; and (2) that they might understand they were to have a full meal, not a mere bite they could take in their hand in passing. Obedience to this request tested the faith of the crowd. They trusted Jesus.—<span class="greekheb">ἦν δὲ χόρτος πολὺς ἐν τῷ τόπῳ</span>, “now there was much grass in the place,” contrasting with the corn-lands and olive-yards of the opposite shore, where the large crowd could not easily have found a place to lie down. Mark rather brings out the contrast between the colours of the dresses and the green grass (<a href="/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.">John 6:39</a>): <span class="greekheb">ἐπέταξεν αὐτοῖς ἀνακλῖναι πάντας συμπόσια συμπόσια ἐπὶ τῷ χλωρῷ χόρτῳ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀνέπεσαν πρασιαὶ πρασιαί</span>, like beds of flowers.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνέπεσον</span> [better <span class="greekheb">ἀνέπεσαν</span>] <span class="greekheb">οὖν οἱ ἄνδρες</span> … the men reclined, not counting women and children (<span class="greekheb">χωρὶς γυναικῶν καὶ παιδίων</span>, <a href="/matthew/14-21.htm" title="And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.">Matthew 14:21</a>), in number about five thousand; the women, though not specified, would take their places with the men.

S.

The men <span class="cmt_word">sat down</span> (reclined), <span class="cmt_word">in number</span> - the matter of the "number" is here put into the "accusative of closer definition" (Meyer) - <span class="cmt_word">about five</span> <span class="cmt_word">thousand</span>. Luke says, "in groups of fifty."
