There seems to have been some connexion between S. Andrew and S. Philip (<a href="/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>, <a href="/john/12-22.htm" title="Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.">John 12:22</a>).

Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</span> The spokesman is here specially indicated. On other occasions Andrew is singled out as the brother of Simon and friend of Philip (<a href="/john/1-44.htm">John 1:44</a>; <a href="/john/12-22.htm">John 12:22</a>). This repeated reference to the illustrious brother of Simon is a refutation of the ill-natured charge against the author of the Gospel, that he aimed at the depreciation of the character of the great apostle. Moreover, it is interesting to remember that in the <span class="accented">Muratorian</span> fragment on the Canon, "Andrew" is specially mentioned as being one of those present with John in Ephesus, who urged him to write his Gospel (see Introduction, IV. 2 (3)). <span class="cmt_word">There is</span> <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">lad</span> <span class="cmt_word">here</span> (possibly a lad who was brought with themselves, or who had attached himself to the twelve) <span class="cmt_word">who has five barley loaves</span>, the bread of the poorest classes. Of this there is ample proof ('Sotah,' 2:1, quoted by Edersheim, vol. 1:681): "While all other meat offerings were of wheat, that brought by the woman accused of adultery was to be of <span class="accented">barley</span>, because, as her deed is that of the animals, so her offering is of the food of animals." If this lad was conveying the food stock of the Lord and his apostles, it is an impressive but accidental hint that "for our sakes he became poor," and classed himself socially with the humblest. <span class="cmt_word">And two fishes</span>. The use of this word is peculiar to our Gospel (Luke, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>; Mark, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, the ordinary word for "fish; "but John uses the word <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, the diminutive of the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which means "savoury," eaten with bread). This opsarion mostly consisted of small fishes caught in the lake, which were dried, salted as "sardines" or "anchovies" are with ourselves for a similar purpose. This habit belonged locally to the neighbourhood of the lake, and reveals the Galilman origin or associations of the writer. The Aramaic word, <span class="accented">ophsonim</span>, is derived from the Greek <span class="accented">opson</span>, and that of <span class="accented">aphjain</span>, or <span class="accented">aphiz</span>, is the name for a small fish caught in the lake, the drying of which was a lucrative source of industry.  Edersheim reminds us that the fish laid on the charcoal fire (<a href="/john/21-9.htm">John 21:9, 10, 13</a>) was "<span class="accented">opsarion</span>," and that of this the risen Lord, on the shore of this very lake, gave to his disciples to eat, though he guided them at that time to a shoal of <span class="accented">great fishes</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and bade them add some of these to the <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, which he was content to use still. The use of this word on these two occasions shows that, at the last, our Lord reminds his disciples of the miraculous feeding by the shore of the lake; and both narratives breathe the air of the northern parts of Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">But what are these among so many?</span> The same lesson of the insufficiency of human resources to meet great human needs is suggested by <a href="/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21-23</a>. Our resources at the very best are quite exhausted. Our best, our all, avails little - an expression which would apply to the numberless offers of our poor humanity and of our limited faculties to meet the moral starvation of the world. Take the Old Testament: how can the dispensation of all its provision satisfy <span class="accented">per se</span> the need of mankind as a whole? Greek philosophy, even if it satisfy the few, the leisurely, the cynical, the learned, the wise men of the West, what will it do for the poor, the broken hearted, the consciously guilty? The good things of this life are equally powerless, and the proposals of even truth itself, apart from the gracious operations of the Spirit, would fail to meet the wants or necessities of the unbelieving. </body></html>
