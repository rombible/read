She has expressed her woe, and turns aside again to weep, when she sees another form. Weighed down by her sorrow, not looking intently, it may be, or seeing indistinctly through tear-filled eyes, she does not recognise her Lord. We know not what the appearance was. Figure, feature, clothing, there must have been; but these differing, in this as in other manifestations, from those with which they had been familiar. She, perhaps, hardly looked at all, but supposed that the only person there at that early hour would be the keeper of the garden.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/20-14.htm" title="And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus....">John 20:14-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when she had thus said, she turned herself back </span>— Probably hearing a sudden noise behind her, and being affrighted; <span class="ital">and saw Jesus standing </span>— Near her; <span class="ital">but knew not that it was Jesus </span>— His habit being changed, her eyes also overflowing with tears, and her mind being so far from any expectation of his appearance, and so much distressed, that she probably did not so much as look up to the face of the person who appeared; <span class="ital">Jesus saith </span>— With his usual tone of voice and accent; <span class="ital">Woman, why weepest thou? </span>— These were probably the first words Christ spoke after his resurrection. <span class="ital">Why weepest thou? </span>— I am risen. The resurrection of Christ has enough in it to allay all our sorrows, to check the streams, and dry up the fountains of our tears. Here we may observe, Christ takes cognizance, 1st, Of his people’s griefs, and inquires why they weep? 2d, Of his people’s cares, and inquires whom or what they seek, or what they would have; when he knows they are seeking him, yet he will know it from them; they must tell him whom they seek. <span class="ital">She, supposing him to be the gardener </span>— The person employed by Joseph to dress and keep his garden, who she thought was come hither thus early to his work; <span class="ital">saith, Sir, if thou have borne him hence </span>— If, for any unknown reason, thou hast taken him away from this place, where the master of the sepulchre saw fit so honourably to lay him but a few hours ago; <span class="ital">tell me where thou hast laid him </span>— Where I may find his corpse; <span class="ital">and I will take him away — </span>Will take effectual care that his corpse shall be removed and decently interred elsewhere. Here we may observe, 1st, That her taking Jesus for the gardener intimates, that there was nothing very splendid in his dress: accordingly when he appeared to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus they seem to have taken him for a person of a rank not superior to their own. 2d, That she accosts this stranger in respectful language, even when she took him for a servant, prudently reflecting, that an error on that hand would be more excusable than one on the other, supposing he should prove a person of superior rank in a plain dress. 3d, That she does not name Jesus, but speaks in indefinite terms; <span class="ital">If thou have borne him hence </span>— Intimating that he was the one person of whom her own thoughts and heart were so full, that she took it for granted every one must know whom she meant. 4th, She seems to have supposed, that this gardener disdained that the body of a person who was ignominiously crucified should have the honour of being laid in his master’s new tomb, and that therefore he had removed it to some sorry place which he thought fitter for it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:11-18 We are likely to seek and find, when we seek with affection, and seek in tears. But many believers complain of the clouds and darkness they are under, which are methods of grace for humbling their souls, mortifying their sins, and endearing Christ to them. A sight of angels and their smiles, will not suffice, without a sight of Jesus, and God's smiles in him. None know, but those who have tasted it, the sorrows of a deserted soul, which has had comfortable evidences of the love of God in Christ, and hopes of heaven, but has now lost them, and walks in darkness; such a wounded spirit who can bear? Christ, in manifesting himself to those that seek him, often outdoes their expectations. See how Mary's heart was in earnest to find Jesus. Christ's way of making himself known to his people is by his word; his word applied to their souls, speaking to them in particular. It might be read, Is it my Master? See with what pleasure those who love Jesus speak of his authority over them. He forbids her to expect that his bodily presence look further, than the present state of things. Observe the relation to God, from union with Christ. We, partaking of a Divine nature, Christ's Father is our Father; and he, partaking of the human nature, our God is his God. Christ's ascension into heaven, there to plead for us, is likewise an unspeakable comfort. Let them not think this earth is to be their home and rest; their eye and aim, and earnest desires, must be upon another world, and this ever upon their hearts, I ascend, therefore I must seek the things which are above. And let those who know the word of Christ, endeavour that others should get good from their knowledge.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knew not that it was Jesus - She was not expecting to see him.

But why did she turn? Was she not conscious of a presence near her which she had not seen? The blind are Often aware of the presence of unseen persons, when no footfall is heard and no word spoken. <span class="cmt_word">And beholdeth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Jesus standing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, perfect participle), as though for some time he had been standing there, watching her (cf. that which he had said to the eleven (<a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>), "I will see you"). But strange, mysterious, unutterably wonderful, entirely and absolutely inconsistent with the hypothesis, to which we have often referred, that this book is a theological romance, John, on Mary's own authority, adds, <span class="cmt_word">She knew not that it was Jesus.</span> This is one of those remarkably vivid and autoptic touches that carry conviction of truth, whatever may be the explanation or the conclusion to be drawn from it. How far was this lack of recognition due to her, and how far to this the first manifestation made of "spiritual body" to human ken? Some have frigidly taken a commonplace explanation. Her eyes were blinded with continuous weeping; or the darkness of the morning; or Jesus may have stood in the shadows of the city wall, as the glare of the first beam of sunrise broke out of the purple mists on the Moab hills; or Christ's appearance was so changed by the agony through which he had passed, and by the recovery and reconstitution of his humanity, that the signs of his identity were obscured. He could not have clothed himself with the glittering garments of the Transfiguration, or with the dazzling robes of angels; for she mistook him for the keeper of the garden, either for Joseph of Arimathaea himself or his steward. "She knew not that it was Jesus." Human eyes are often holden so that they do not see the Lord, even when by some objective manifestation he makes it possible to do this thing. Thus (<a href="/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a>), "Manoah knew not that it was the angel of the Lord." And several other of the theophanies of the Old Testament, encountering the blindness of human vision, slowly dawn upon even prophetic intelligence. Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Samuel, are all instances. And we find that in <a href="/matthew/28-16.htm">Matthew 28:16, 17</a>, "some doubted" the Resurrection, even when the vision led others to adore (<a href="/luke/24-16.htm">Luke 24:16</a>). The eyes of Cleophas and his friend were holden, even though their hearts were burning. Those who traveled with Paul to Damascus saw a light and heard a sound, but they did not see nor did they hear what the apostle saw and heard. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> of the risen Jesus was not, according to Mark (<a href="/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12</a>), always the same. For the vision and perception of this mode of being, the eye needs special training and preparation. Though the eyes of love are the quickest to discern these wondrous realities, yet the vision tarries, and is for an appointed time, and even they who ultimately see have to wait for it. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/20.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Turned herself back<p>Canon Westcott, with that beautiful subtilty of perception which so eminently characterizes him, remarks: "We can imagine also that she became conscious of another Presence, as we often feel the approach of a visitor without distinctly seeing or hearing him.
