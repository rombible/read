but a band of true worshippers was being gathered, and some were then following Him.<p><span class= "bld">The true worshippers.</span>—Her distinction of place was of the accident, but the essence was the nature of the worship. What could any worship be to a God who saw the impurity of the heart, and the contradiction of thought and word? What could <span class= "ital">she</span> know of the worship of which she speaks? Yes; and the temple at Jerusalem was a house of merchandise, instead of one of prayer; what did priest and Levite, scribe and Pharisee, know of true worship?<p><span class= "bld">In spirit and in truth.</span>—The link between human nature and the divine is in the human spirit, which is the shrine of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a>). All true approach to God must therefore be in spirit. (Comp. <a href="/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>, and <a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a>.) Place, and time, and words, and postures, and sounds, and all things from without, are important only in so far as they aid in abstraction from the sensible world, and in elevation of the spirit within. The moment they distract they hinder true worship. Ritual cannot be discussed without risk of spiritual loss. The words “in truth,” already expressed in <span class= "ital">true</span> worshippers, and repeated in the following verse, are more than “truly.” Sincerity is not a test of acceptable worship, though it is a requisite. Bigots sincerely think they do God’s service. Worship which is “in truth” is in harmony with the nature of the God whom we worship. To think of God in hearing His truth, to kindle the soul by hymns of praise, to realise the earlier portions of collects and prayers which utter His attributes, are necessary to the truth of the petitions, and thanksgivings, and adorations of worship. The model prayer of Christianity brings home to the heart the Fatherhood of God in its first words.<p><span class= "bld">For the Father seeketh such to worship him.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">for such the Father also seeketh His worshippers to be.</span> The word “such,” <span class= "ital">i.e., of this character,</span> is emphatic. The “also” expresses that the worship, on the part of the true worshippers, is in accordance with the divine will: “the Father also (on His part) . . .” The reader will not fail to note the emphasis in this reply on the word “Father” (<a href="/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21</a> and twice in this verse). This name of God, which we teach children to lisp in earliest years, came to her, it may be, now for the first time. He is not Vengeance to be appeased, nor Power to be dreaded, but Love to be received. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>.) It is when men learn to think of God as Father that merely local and material worship must cease. The universal desire and practice of worship is the witness to a universal object of worship. The yearning of the human spirit is that of a child seeking the author of his being. The seeking is not human only. The Father also seeketh His child, and seeth him when he is a great way off (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm" title="And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.">Luke 15:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/john/4-23.htm" title="But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.">John 4:23</a></span>. <span class="ital">But the hour cometh and now is </span>— The fixed and stated time, concerning which it was of old determined when it should come, even the <span class="ital">accepted time </span>and <span class="ital">day of salvation. </span>And when our Lord thus spoke, it was coming in its full strength, lustre, and perfection. As if he had said, The thing you are chiefly concerned to know is, that a dispensation of religion is now beginning, under which all languages, countries, and places being sanctified, men are to worship God, not in Jerusalem, but in their hearts, and by their lives; by offering the sacrifice, not of beasts, but of themselves; the thing signified by every sacrifice and service enjoined in the law, and what alone was acceptable to the Father, even under the legal dispensation; <span class="ital">when the true worshippers </span>— And what does it avail to be a <span class="ital">false </span>worshipper? <span class="ital">shall worship the Father </span>— Shall worship God as a <span class="ital">Father, </span>even as a reconciled Father in Christ, who hath made them his children through faith in him, (<a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a>,) by adoption and regeneration, see note on <a href="/matthew/6-9.htm" title="After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.">Matthew 6:9</a>; <span class="ital">in spirit and truth </span>— In <span class="ital">spirit, </span>and therefore in <span class="ital">truth: </span>that Isaiah , 1 st, In our spirit, or inwardly in our minds and hearts, adoring his majesty, revering his power, humbled before his purity, confiding in his mercy, praising him for his benefits, loving him for his unspeakable love to us; being subject to his sway, obedient to his will, resigned under his dispensations, devoted to his glory, and aspiring after a closer union with him, and a more full conformity to him. And all this, 2d, Through the illuminating, quickening, and comforting influences of his Spirit; without which our worship is but a shadow without substance, a form without power, a body without a soul: the lifeless image of worship, without truth and reality: nay, a mere <span class="ital">lie. </span>For when we ask blessings, which we do not sincerely desire and expect to receive; thank God for favours for which we feel no gratitude; sit down to hear that word of which we neither intend nor desire to be <span class="ital">doers, </span>our worship is hypocrisy and a lie: as it is also when we have not within us, during our pretended worship, affections and dispositions suited to his divine attributes, and the relations in which he is pleased to stand to us. For to worship him without <span class="ital">reverence </span>and <span class="ital">humility, </span>is to say, in effect, that he is not great and glorious, just and holy; to do it without <span class="ital">confidence </span>and <span class="ital">gratitude, </span>is saying in our spirit that he is not merciful, kind, and beneficent; to worship him without love and obedience, subjection and resignation, is to deny his love to us, and his authority over us, as our Creator, Preserver, Benefactor, Redeemer, Saviour, Friend, and Father; and the wisdom, justice, and goodness of his dispensations: that is, it is to worship him <span class="ital">in a lie. </span>For whether we say, by our spirit and conduct, that he possesses these perfections or not, it is certain he does possess them, and our not acknowledging it, and being properly influenced thereby, is, in effect, to deny it, and to affirm he is not the being that he is, and does not possess the attributes that he does possess. <span class="ital">For the Father seeketh such to worship him </span>— Desires and approves of such worshippers, and sends his word and Spirit, his gospel and his grace, to form such. The expression implies, 1st, That such worshippers are very rare, and seldom found. The gate of spiritual worship is strait. 2d, That such worship is necessary, and what the God of heaven requires and insists upon. When God comes to inquire for worshippers, the question will not be, <span class="ital">Who worshipped at Jerusalem? </span>but, who worshipped in spirit and truth? That will be the touchstone, or test, whereby men’s religion will be tried, and whereby they will stand or fall in the day of final accounts.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:4-26 There was great hatred between the Samaritans and the Jews. Christ's road from Judea to Galilee lay through Samaria. We should not go into places of temptation but when we needs must; and then must not dwell in them, but hasten through them. We have here our Lord Jesus under the common fatigue of travellers. Thus we see that he was truly a man. Toil came in with sin; therefore Christ, having made himself a curse for us, submitted to it. Also, he was a poor man, and went all his journeys on foot. Being wearied, he sat thus on the well; he had no couch to rest upon. He sat thus, as people wearied with travelling sit. Surely, we ought readily to submit to be like the Son of God in such things as these. Christ asked a woman for water. She was surprised because he did not show the anger of his own nation against the Samaritans. Moderate men of all sides are men wondered at. Christ took the occasion to teach her Divine things: he converted this woman, by showing her ignorance and sinfulness, and her need of a Saviour. By this living water is meant the Spirit. Under this comparison the blessing of the Messiah had been promised in the Old Testament. The graces of the Spirit, and his comforts, satisfy the thirsting soul, that knows its own nature and necessity. What Jesus spake figuratively, she took literally. Christ shows that the water of Jacob's well yielded a very short satisfaction. Of whatever waters of comfort we drink, we shall thirst again. But whoever partakes of the Spirit of grace, and the comforts of the gospel, shall never want that which will abundantly satisfy his soul. Carnal hearts look no higher than carnal ends. Give it me, saith she, not that I may have everlasting life, which Christ proposed, but that I come not hither to draw. The carnal mind is very ingenious in shifting off convictions, and keeping them from fastening. But how closely our Lord Jesus brings home the conviction to her conscience! He severely reproved her present state of life. The woman acknowledged Christ to be a prophet. The power of his word in searching the heart, and convincing the conscience of secret things, is a proof of Divine authority. It should cool our contests, to think that the things we are striving about are passing away. The object of worship will continue still the same, God, as a Father; but an end shall be put to all differences about the place of worship. Reason teaches us to consult decency and convenience in the places of our worship; but religion gives no preference to one place above another, in respect of holiness and approval with God. The Jews were certainly in the right. Those who by the Scriptures have obtained some knowledge of God, know whom they worship. The word of salvation was of the Jews. It came to other nations through them. Christ justly preferred the Jewish worship before the Samaritan, yet here he speaks of the former as soon to be done away. God was about to be revealed as the Father of all believers in every nation. The spirit or the soul of man, as influenced by the Holy Spirit, must worship God, and have communion with him. Spiritual affections, as shown in fervent prayers, supplications, and thanksgivings, form the worship of an upright heart, in which God delights and is glorified. The woman was disposed to leave the matter undecided, till the coming of the Messiah. But Christ told her, I that speak to thee, am He. She was an alien and a hostile Samaritan, merely speaking to her was thought to disgrace our Lord Jesus. Yet to this woman did our Lord reveal himself more fully than as yet he had done to any of his disciples. No past sins can bar our acceptance with him, if we humble ourselves before him, believing in him as the Christ, the Saviour of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the hour cometh, and now is - The old dispensation is about to pass away, and the new one to commence.

One is that God sought it, or desired it. He had appointed the old mode, but he did it because he sought to lead the mind to himself even by those forms, and to prepare the people for the purer system of the gospel, and now he sought or desired that those who worshipped him should worship him in that manner. He intimated his will by Jesus Christ. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. hour cometh, and now is&#8212;evidently meaning her to understand that this new economy was in some sense being set up while He was talking to her, a sense which would in a few minutes so far appear, when He told her plainly He was the Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Under the gospel, and the kingdom of the Messiah, which is yet further coming, and is already began in the world, the true worshippers of God shall not worship him, as you Samaritans, who worship you know not what, without any rule or prescript of the word; nor yet as the hypocritical Jews, who rest upon their sacrifices and ritual performances, as if they should purge away their sins, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/50-8.htm" title="I will not reprove you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.">Psalm 50:8</a> <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11</a> 66:3 <a href="/micah/6-7.htm" title="Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?">Micah 6:7</a></span>; no, nor yet as the more sincere Jews, who indeed do truly and with their hearts worship God; but, <span class="ital">while the</span> <span class="ital">first tabernacle was yet standing, which was a figure for the time</span> <span class="ital">then present, </span> by <span class="ital">sacrifices that could not make him that did</span> <span class="ital">the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience, —by meats</span> <span class="ital">and drinks, and divers ordinances, imposed on them until the time</span> <span class="ital">of reformation, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/hebrews/9-8.htm" title="The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:...">Hebrews 9:8-10</a></span>.

There is this great distinction between Jew and Samaritan, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἔρχεται ὥρα</span> … <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀληθείᾳ</span>, but notwithstanding that it is to the Jews God has especially revealed Himself as Saviour, the hour has now come when the ideal worshippers, whether Jew or Samaritan, shall worship the one universal Father in <span class="ital">spirit</span>, not in either Gerizim or Jerusalem, and in <span class="ital">truth</span>, not in the symbols of Samaritan or Jewish worship, <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι καὶ ἀληθείᾳ</span>. Two defects of all previous worship are aimed at; all that was local and all that was symbolic is to be left behind. Worship is to be (1) <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span> [on <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> here, see Winer, 528], in the heart, not in this place or that. The essential thing is, not that the right place be approached, but that the right spirit enter into worship. And (2) it is to be <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀληθείᾳ</span>, in correspondence with reality, both as regards the object and the manner of worship. The Samaritans had not known the object of their worship: the Jews had employed symbolism in worship. Both these defects were now to be removed. <span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ γάρ</span> is not merely equivalent to <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>, but must be rendered, “For of a truth”. The characteristics of the ideal worshippers have been declared; and now, in confirmation, Jesus adds, “For of a truth the Father seeks such for His worshippers”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">the hour cometh</span>] As before, <span class="ital">there cometh</span> <span class="bld">an</span> <span class="ital">hour</span>.

Not that such limitations are wrong; but they are not of the essence of religion, and become wrong when they are mistaken for the essence of religion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in truth</span>] (Omit ‘in’) i.e. in harmony with the Nature and Will of God. In the sphere of intellect, this means recognition of His Presence and Omniscience; in the sphere of action, conformity with His absolute Holiness. ‘Worship in spirit and truth,’ therefore, implies prostration of the inmost soul before the Divine Perfection, submission of every thought and feeling to the Divine Will.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the Father seeketh</span>, &c.] Better, <span class="bld">for such the Father also seeketh for His worshippers</span>. ‘Such’ is very emphatic; ‘this is the character which He also desires in His worshippers.’ The ‘also’ must not be lost. That worship should be ‘in spirit and truth’ is required by the fitness of things: moreover God Himself desires to have it so, and works for this end. Note how three times in succession Christ speaks of God as <span class="ital">the Father</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21</a>; <a href="/john/4-23.htm" title="But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.">John 4:23</a></span>): perhaps it was quite a new aspect of Him to the woman.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/4-23.htm" title="But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.">John 4:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀλλʼ</span>, <span class="ital">but</span>) Jesus does not account it enough to have preferred the Jewish worship, knowledge, and religion, to Samaritanism, <span class="ital">but</span> further He shows this, that a worship superior not merely to that which was practised on that <span class="ital">mountain</span>, but even to that which was practised at Jerusalem, is at hand.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ νῦν ἐστίν</span>, <span class="ital">and now is</span>) This [which was not added at <a href="/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21</a>] “The hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain,” etc. is now added, lest the woman should think that in the meantime she must seek a settlement in Judea.

But "spirit" here does not refer to the Holy Spirit, but to the spirit of man - that part of man's constitution through which he most especially bears the image of God, and with which the Divine Spirit deals, and in which he dwells (<a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>). The worship in spirit is worship contrasted with all mere carnal concomitants, all mere shadows of the good things to come, all mere ritual, all specialties of place, or time, or sacrament, or order. It need not be in despite of a genuine reverence for days, or seasons, or postures, or washings, but in absolute independence of them, and they, without this, will be actually valueless. <span class="accented">And in truth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as dealing with reality, the adequate and veracious expression of genuine desires and veritable emotions; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="accented">nam et</span> (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">For indeed also the Father seeketh such to be his worshippers.</span> Luthardt and Meyer differ as to the emphasis. Meyer insists that the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> lays stress on the word which immediately follows, and he refers to <a href="/1_corinthians/14-8.htm">1 Corinthians 14:8</a> as not contradicting the rule. He would render, "For the Father also on his part seeketh," etc. Luthardt says that the new thought is to be found in <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, and therefore upon this the emphasis is laid. Westcott, by many passages, such as <a href="/matthew/8-9.htm">Matthew 8:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>; <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="/luke/6-32.htm">Luke 6:32</a>, etc., urges that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> "alleges a reason which is assumed to be conclusive from the nature of the case." The whole sentence is therefore covered by the expression, "For the Father also on his part seeketh those as worshippers of him who worship him in spirit and in truth." A slight contrast is felt between the regimen of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> with accusative, here again introduced, following upon that with dative in the first clause. Moulton would render the first clause, "offer worship to the Father," and the second by "worship him." The Father is now seeking, by the ministry of his Son, by the gift of his Spirit, for those who approach him with deeply felt need and true affection, in spirit, not in ceremony, in truth, not in hypocritical or heartless profession. This is another indication of the high truth taught in the prologue (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 9</a>; <a href="/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>; <a href="/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>, see notes) that there are vast differences among men, even anterior to their reception of the perfect revelation of the Father's heart in Christ Jesus. "The life is the light of men." There are those who "do the truth" and are "of the truth," who "worship God in spirit and in truth." The whole gospel dispensation is a search for these. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>And now is<p>This could not be added in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a>, because local worship was not yet abolished; but it was true as regarded the true worship of the Father by His true worshippers, for Jesus was already surrounded by a little band of such, and more were soon to be added (<a href="//biblehub.com/john/4-39.htm">John 4:39-42</a>).

The phrase in spirit and in truth describes the two essential characteristics of true worship: in spirit, as distinguished from place or form or other sensual limitations (<a href="/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a>); in truth, as distinguished from the false conceptions resulting from imperfect knowledge (<a href="/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>). True worship includes a spiritual sense of the object worshipped, and a spiritual communion with it; the manifestation of the moral consciousness in feelings, motions of the will, "moods of elevation, excitements," etc. It includes also a truthful conception of the object. In Jesus the Father is seen (<a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>) and known (<a href="/luke/10-22.htm">Luke 10:22</a>). Thus the truthful conception is gained. He is the Truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). Likewise through Him we come to the Father, and spiritually commune with Him. No man can come in any other way (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).
