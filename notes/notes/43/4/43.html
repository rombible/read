Honours and titles are no security from sickness and death. The greatest men must go themselves to God, must become beggars. The nobleman did not stop from his request till he prevailed. But at first he discovered the weakness of his faith in the power of Christ. It is hard to persuade ourselves that distance of time and place, are no hinderance to the knowledge, mercy, and power of our Lord Jesus. Christ gave an answer of peace. Christ's saying that the soul lives, makes it alive. The father went his way, which showed the sincerity of his faith. Being satisfied, he did not hurry home that night, but returned as one easy in his own mind. His servants met him with the news of the child's recovery. Good news will meet those that hope in God's word. Diligent comparing the works of Jesus with his word, will confirm our faith. And the bringing the cure to the family brought salvation to it. Thus an experience of the power of one word of Christ, may settle the authority of Christ in the soul. The whole family believed likewise. The miracle made Jesus dear to them. The knowledge of Christ still spreads through families, and men find health and salvation to their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Into Galilee - Into some of the parts of Galilee, though evidently not into Nazareth, but probably direct to Cana, <a href="/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Joh 4:43-54.

So also usually in Greek writers, from Homer downwards. The words give the <span class="ital">reason</span> why He did not hesitate to return to Galilee. The gist of the reason lies in the antithetical reference of <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ ἰδίᾳ πατρίδι</span>. If, as Jesus Himself testified, a prophet had no honour <span class="ital">in his own country</span>, he must seek it <span class="ital">abroad</span>. And this Jesus had done. Abroad, in Jerusalem, He had by His mighty works inspired the Galilaeans who were there with that respect which they were accustomed to deny to a prophet at home. Thus He brought the prophet’s honour with Him <span class="ital">from abroad</span>.[199] Accordingly (<a href="/john/4-45.htm" title="Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.">John 4:45</a>) He found a reception among the Galilaeans also, because they had seen His miracles in <span class="ital">Jerusalem</span> (<a href="/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23</a>). It is therefore obviously incorrect to understand <span class="greekheb">Γαλιλαίαν</span> specially of <span class="ital">Upper</span> Galilee, as distinct from <span class="ital">Lower</span> Galilee, where Nazareth was situated. So Lange, in spite of the fact that <span class="greekheb">Γαλιλ</span>. here must be the universal and popular name for the whole province, as distinct from Samaria (<span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖθεν</span>), whether we retain <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀπῆλθεν</span> as in the Elzevir or not. It is further incorrect, and an utterly arbitrary gloss, to interpret <span class="greekheb">πατρίς</span> as meaning <span class="ital">Nazareth</span>, and <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> as referring to the <span class="ital">fact</span> that He had gone, indeed, to Galilee, <span class="ital">but not to Nazareth</span> (Chrysostom and even Euthymius Zigabenus: to Capernaum). So Cyril, Nonnus, Erasmus, Beza, Calvin, Aretius, Grotius, Jansen, Bengel, and many; also Kypke, Rosenmüller, Olshausen, Klee, Gemberg in <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1845, I.; Hengstenberg, Bäumlein. It is also incorrect, because not in keeping with the context, nor with the general view, which is also that of John, which regards Galilee as Christ’s home (<a href="/john/1-46.htm" title="And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.">John 1:46</a>, <a href="/john/2-1.htm" title="And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:">John 2:1</a>, <a href="/john/7-3.htm" title="His brothers therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that your disciples also may see the works that you do.">John 7:3</a>; <a href="/john/7-41.htm" title="Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?">John 7:41</a>; <a href="/john/7-52.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee rises no prophet.">John 7:52</a>), to take <span class="greekheb">πατρίς</span> as denoting <span class="ital">Judea</span>, and <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> as stating the reason (in the face of the quite different reason already given, <a href="/context/john/4-1.htm" title="When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,...">John 4:1-3</a>) why Jesus had <span class="ital">left</span> Judea (Origen, Maldonatus, B. Bauer, Schwegler, Wieseler, B. Crusius, Schweizer, Köstlin, Baur, Hilgenfeld, and formerly also Ebrard); whence some, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Origen and Baur, take <span class="greekheb">πατρίς</span> in a higher sense, as signifying the native land of the <span class="ital">prophets</span>,[200] and therefore of the Messiah also, and most, like Hilgenfeld, as having reference to the <span class="ital">birth at Bethlehem</span>. Lücke has rightly, in his 3d ed., abandoned this interpretation; but, on the other hand, he takes <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span> as equivalent to <span class="ital">namely</span>, and explains it as referring not to what precedes, but <span class="ital">to what follows</span> (so substantially also Tholuck, Olshausen, Maier, de Wette), so that <a href="/john/4-44.htm" title="For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.">John 4:44</a> gives an explanation in passing on the point: “that the Galilaeans on this occasion received Jesus well, but only on account of the miracles which they had seen in Jerusalem” (de Wette). It is against this, however, that though in the classics <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span> explicative often precedes the sentence to be explained (see Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell</span>. I. p. 467; Bäumlein, <span class="ital">Partik</span>. p. 75 ff.), especially in parenthesis (see Bremi, <span class="ital">ad Lys</span>. p. 66; Ellendt, <span class="ital">Lex. Soph</span>. I. 338), yet this form of expression is quite without precedent in the N. T. (<a href="/romans/14-10.htm" title="But why do you judge your brother? or why do you set at nothing your brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.">Romans 14:10</a>, <a href="/hebrews/2-8.htm" title="You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.">Hebrews 2:8</a>, are not instances in point), and especially would be quite foreign to John’s simple progressive style of narration; moreover, the <span class="ital">“indeed,—but only,”</span> put into <a href="/john/4-45.htm" title="Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.">John 4:45</a>, is quite obtruded on the words, inasmuch as John wrote neither <span class="greekheb">μέν</span> after <span class="greekheb">ἐδέξ</span>., nor thereafter a <span class="greekheb">μόνον δέ</span>, nor any such expression.[201] According to Brückner, Jesus came to Galilee <span class="ital">because</span>, (but see <a href="/context/john/4-1.htm" title="When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,...">John 4:1-3</a>) He had supposed that He would find no honour there, and consequently with the intention of <span class="ital">undertaking the conflict</span> for the recognition of His person and dignity. According to Luthardt, whom Ebrard now follows (comp. Hofmann, <span class="ital">Weissag. u. Erf</span>. II. 88, also <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span> II. 1, p. 171), the words imply the hope entertained by Jesus of <span class="ital">being able to remain in rest and silence in Galilee</span> more easily than anywhere else. But both explanations are incompatible with the following <span class="greekheb">ὅτε οὖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., which certainly means that the Galileans received Him with honour, as He was called immediately thereafter to perform a miracle. We should certainly expect <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΈ</span></span></span> or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛΆ</span></span></span> (comp. Nonnus) to introduce the statement, and not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὖΝ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> In what follows, moreover, regarding the residence in Galilee, we are told neither about conflict nor about the repose of Jesus, but simply of the healing at a distance of the nobleman’s son. Lastly, it is contrary to the words (because <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΕ ΟὖΝ ἮΛΘΕΝ</span></span></span> in <a href="/john/4-45.htm" title="Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.">John 4:45</a> directly resumes the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΓΑΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> of <a href="/john/4-43.htm" title="Now after two days he departed there, and went into Galilee.">John 4:43</a>, and admits of no interval), when Hauff, in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1849, p. 117 ff., makes the train of thought to terminate with <a href="/john/4-44.htm" title="For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.">John 4:44</a>, and takes <a href="/john/4-44.htm" title="For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.">John 4:44</a> itself as a general description of the result of Christ’s Galilean ministry. Thus <span class="greekheb">ἐδέξαντο</span> is said to indicate <span class="ital">that He did and taught much there</span>; which is clearly a gloss <span class="ital">foisted</span> into the text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[198] See Ewald, <span class="ital">Jahrb</span>. X. 1860, p. 108 ff. He agrees for the most part with my rendering; comp. also his <span class="ital">Johann. Schr</span>. I. p. 194; in like manner Godet, who, however, without the slightest hint of it in the text, supposes a purpose on the writer’s part, in connection with <a href="/john/3-24.htm" title="For John was not yet cast into prison.">John 3:24</a>, to correct the synoptical tradition. John wishes “constater l’intervalle considérable qui sépara du baptême de Jésus son retour définitif et son établissement permanent en Galilée.” In <a href="/john/3-24.htm" title="For John was not yet cast into prison.">John 3:24</a> he states the fact, and here he gives the motive. Scholten puts the emphasis which prompts the following <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span> upon <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖθεν</span>, a word which is quite unessential, and might just as well have been omitted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[199] Baeumlein urges, against my explanation: “We cannot believe that, after the words ‘He betook Himself <span class="ital">to Galilee</span>,’ there should follow the reason why He had before <span class="ital">left Galilee</span>.” This, however, is not the logical connection at all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[200] So also B. Crusius, who compares <a href="/john/7-52.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee rises no prophet.">John 7:52</a>. Quite erroneously, when the general and proverbial character of the statement is considered. After <a href="/john/4-3.htm" title="He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.">John 4:3</a>, however, the reader can expect no further explanation of the reason why Jesus did not remain in Judea. Schwegler and B. Bauer suppose that here Judea is meant as the native land of Jesus, and make use of this as an argument against the genuineness and historical truth of the Gospel. Comp. also Köstlin in the <span class="ital">Theol. Jahrb</span>. 1851, p. 186. Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">Evang</span>. p. 266: “a remarkable inversion of the synoptical statement, wherein the Gospel appears as a free compilation by a post-apostolic author” (<span class="ital">Zeitschr</span>. 1862, p. 17). Schweizer also finds it such a stumbling-block, that he regards it as proving the following narrative to be a Galilean interpolation. Gfrörer, <span class="ital">heil. Sage</span>, II. 289, rightly indeed understands the words as referring to <span class="ital">Galilee</span>, but considers that we should supply the following: “<span class="ital">save very slowly and reluctantly, for</span>,” etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[201] Weizsäcker also, in the <span class="ital">Jahrb. F. Deutsche Theol</span>. 1859, p. 695, regards <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> not as introducing a reason, but as demonstrative. John intimates that he will not narrate much of Christ’s ministry in Galilee; he refers to that saying as if shrinking from unpleasant recollections. But this is not in the text, nor is it compatible with the connection in ver. 45, and the history that follows. Weizsäcker, indeed, thinks (comp. his <span class="ital">Unters. üb. d. ev.

They are silent with reference to these earliest witnesses to his method and varied specimens of his work. Just as in the Revelation of St. John we have a proem, and a series of visions which rehearse the entire development of the kingdom and glory of the Lamb of God until the day of his triumph, his wrath, and his great glory; so in these earlier chapters of the Fourth Gospel we have an anticipation of the entire ministry of Messiah. Specimens and illustrations are given of his creative might, of his purifying energy, of his forecast of the cross, of his demand for inward and radical renewal of his promise and gift of life. We can read in these events his principles of judgment and his  revelation of the Father, his mission to mankind as a whole, and his victory and drawing of souls to himself. We see, moreover, his relation to the theocracy and to the outlying world, to the learned rabbi and to the woman that was a sinner.. We see the Lord in his glory and in his humiliation. A very brief hint is given in the following verses of the character of his Galilaean ministry, Wherein mighty works and words alternate, and the first storm of direct opposition to him begins to make its appearance, upon which, while much light is cast by the narrative of ch. 5, we have no indistinct trace in the synoptic narrative. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 43-45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now after the two days</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the two days of our Lord's sojourn in Sychar (ver. 40) - <span class="cmt_word">he went</span> <span class="cmt_word">forth</span>  <span class="cmt_word">thence</span> <span class="cmt_word">into Galilee.</span> Here the author takes up the narrative of ver. 3. The delay in Samaria was parenthetical to the chief end of his journey, which was to leave Judaea and commence his ministry in Galilee. He now enters it a second time from Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country, When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans willingly received him, having seen all things whatsoever he did in Jerusalem, at the feast: for they themselves also went to the feast.</span> These words bristle with difficulties, and hardly two commentators entirely agree in their interpretation of them. Christ's visit to Galilee is here accounted for by the principle embodied in the proverb, or <span class="accented">a part at least</span> of the proverb, which he used (according to the synoptic narrative) with reference to his visit to and reception in Nazareth, about this some period in his career. Apart from that reference, the most simple explanation of the quotation would be that our Lord regarded Jerusalem and Judge, as in one sense, and a very deep one, "his country," not simply his birthplace, and which he felt at twelve years of age was to contain his Father's house and kingdom and work; and of which he afterwards said, "O Jerusalem, that killest the prophets,... how oft would I...  but ye would not!" The Fourth Gospel records our Lord's various Judaean ministries with such striking incidents and impressive discourse, that his claim upon the loyalty of the metropolis was repeatedly urged and as repeatedly rejected. True that in vers. 1-3 we are told that our Lord left Judaea because the Pharisees, the influential religious party, were in a hostile sense comparing his ministry with that of the Baptist. This may only be another way in which the comparative unfruitfulness of his early ministry in Judaea is stated. "The prophet hath no honour in his own country." If this was the meaning of Christ's recurrence to the proverb, then we can understand the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 45, as well as the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> of ver. 44, The Galilaeans who had been up to Jerusalem, and been favourably impressed - perhaps more so than any Judaeans, having formed the bulk of those who received baptism at his hands - received him graciously on his entrance into Galilee. The whole passage thus would hang together; a subsequent and similar and more acute experience where he was best known by face, in Nazareth, drew from him an expanded form of the proverb, in sad and melancholy iteration, "A prophet is not without honour save in his own country, <span class="accented">and amongst his kindred, and in his own house"</span> (<a href="/mark/6-4.htm">Mark 6:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-57.htm">Matthew 13:57</a>). [In Luke's enlarged account of the visit to Nazareth (Luke 4:16-30), possibly an event which is perfectly distinct from the visit to his "own country" cited by Matthew and Mark, the proverb appears in its shorter form.] This interpretation is that preferred by Origen, Maldonatus, Wieseler, Baur, etc., formerly by Ebrard and Lucke, and now by Westcott, Moulton, and Plummer. In my opinion it is the most satisfactory and least encumbered interpretation. It does not seem satisfactory to Meyer and others, who urge that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> can only mean what it obviously does in the synoptic narrative, viz. Galilee as represented by Nazareth. Meyer also interprets the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> as introducing a reason, not only for our Lord's present return to Galilee, but for his <span class="accented">earlier departure from Galilee to Judaea</span>; and Meyer supposes that he must have uttered the words <span class="accented">then.</span> On this supposition, the Galilaeans in the first instance must have failed to appreciate his prophetic claims. Christ had gone to Jerusalem and Judaea, and there acquired the fame of a prophet, and subsequently these Galilaeans were ready to recognize it second hand, on the occasion of his return. Godet adds to this the joyful emotion that was felt when the plan of Jesus had been successful as far as the Galilaeans were concerned. Moreover, he gives a pluperfect sense to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "he had testified." Against this we observe that our Lord must have soon found that, in a narrower and closer sense, his  nearest friends and neighbours had learned nothing by their journey to the feast; and that the author of the Fourth Gospel must have been ignorant of the kind of reception so soon accorded to our Lord at Nazareth. Bruckner and Luthardt suppose by the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> that Jesus either sought the struggle with his unbelieving compatriots or the solitude induced by the absence of sympathy. There is not the faintest trace of this in the narrative. Then, again, Cyril, Calvin, Bengel, Olshausen, Hengstenberg, suppose that by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> is meant his own <span class="accented">city</span>, Nazareth, which is here contrasted with Galilee in general, including Capernaum, which became the missionary centre of his early ministry. These commentators suppose that, when we are told "he went to Galilee," it means (as we see from ver. 46) he went to Cana, "for he testified," etc.; and therefore that in this forty-fourth verse comes the tragic scene described in <a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a>. Lange has supplemented this theory by another that removes part of the difficulty, viz. that by <span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x1fde;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> was meant <span class="accented">Lower</span> Galilee, including Nazareth, and by the Galilee of ver. 44 was meant <span class="accented">Upper</span> Galilee and the neighbourhood of the lake, including Capernaum, to which we find that, after his cruel treatment at Nazareth, he retired. So Geikie. Now, there are difficulties in either of these views, which give great awkwardness to the expression, "So he came to Cana again," in ver. 46. Tholuck, De Wette, Lucke, in various ways, urge that the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> of ver. 44 may mean <span class="accented">namely, that is to say</span>, etc., pointing onwards to the kindly reception which the Galilaeans gave him being due to the <span class="accented">signs</span> which they beheld, and not to the words of life which he had spoken. Every view seems to us far-fetched and inconsistent, with the exception of the first interpretation. The only objection that is at all urgent, arises from the fact that, in the synoptic narrative, Nazareth is spoken of as his country. But if this were so, we do but see in the reception accorded to him in Nazareth a further illustration of the very same spirit which was shown to him in the metropolis. In both places "he came to his own, and his own received him not." There is nothing improbable, if so, that in both places Jesus should have appealed to the homely proverb. On the second occasion he added to it, "his kindred and his home," as well as "his country." </body></html>
