See <a href="/mark/2-22.htm">Mark 2:22</a>; <a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a>. Though he feared not death and did not shrink from suffering, yet he did not needlessly throw himself into danger or provoke opposition.

This motion of our Saviour’s into Galilee, is reported by Matthew in <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/4-12.htm" title="Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;">Matthew 4:12</a></span>, and also by Mark in <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/1-14.htm" title="Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,">Mark 1:14</a></span> and Luke in <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/4-14.htm" title="And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.">Luke 4:14</a></span>. The two former give another reason of his motion, viz. his hearing that John was cast into prison; of which, and the cause of it, see <span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/14-3.htm" title="For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife....">Matthew 14:3-6</a></span>; so as after that he publicly preached no more, which might possibly augment the number of Christ’s disciples; John’s disciples following him. Both these causes probably concurred, to cause this motion. John, who by preaching and baptizing had laid the foundation of a gospel church in Galilee, was imprisoned; and our Saviour knew that, the number of his disciples increasing upon John’s confinement, an information had been carried against him to the Pharisees; this made him, knowing that his time was not yet come, withdraw himself out of the province of Judea into that of Galilee, as well to supply the want there (John being in prison) as to provide for his own security. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He left Judaea,....

And now upon thee Pharisees being made acquainted with his success in these parts, he leaves them; not through fear of them, but because he would not irritate and provoke them, and stir up their malice and envy against him, which might put them upon measures to seek to take away his life; whereas his time was not yet come, and he had other work to do elsewhere: <p>and departed again into Galilee; where he had spent the greatest part of his time, in private life; from whence he came to Jordan unto John to be baptized by him; and after that went thither again, where he wrought his first miracle: and now having been in Judea some time, he removes to Galilee again; and of this journey of his thither, after the imprisonment of John, an account is given, in <a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12</a>.

But it should be observed that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> is a very peculiar word for a simple departure. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> is used when <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> might have been expected (Westcott). The word means "to leave a thing to itself," to its own ways, to treat it as no longer exercising an influence on the mind. (It is, with the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, used for "forgive," "forgiveness," of sins.) Jesus left Judaea, which had so imperfectly accepted his claims. The word suggests that his departure was a consequence of the action of the Pharisees; <span class="accented">And he departed again.</span> This refers to the first departure  after the early testimonies of John, when Jesus went to Cana and Capernaum (<a href="/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43</a>). Whether this journey corresponded with that mentioned in Matthew and Mark, as following the baptism and temptation of Jesus, or not, it is not to be confounded with the journey which John had already recorded. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He left (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;)<p>The verb means literally to send away, dismiss.
