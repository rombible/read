Each of the Evangelists has given us a narrative of the trial and death of our Lord. The narrative of each naturally differs by greater or less fulness, or as each regarded the events from his own point of view, from that of all the others. It is only with that which is special to St. John that the notes on his narrative have to deal. The general facts and questions arising from them have already been treated in the notes on the parallel passages.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">He went forth with his disciples</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> He went forth from the city.

The name is formed from a Hebrew word which means “black.” The torrent was the “Niger” of Judæa, and was so called from the colour of its turbid waters, or from the darkness of the chasm through which they flowed. The name seems to have been properly applied not so much to the torrent itself as to the ravine through which it flowed, on the east of Jerusalem, between the city and the Mount of Olives. Its sides are for the most part precipitous, but here and there paths cross it, and at the bottom are cultivated strips of land. Its depth varies, but in some places it is not less than 100 feet.

He might retire to this private place, not only for the advantage of secret devotion, but also that the people might not be alarmed at his apprehension, nor attempt, in the first sallies of their zeal, to rescue him in a tumultuous manner. Cedron, or Kedron, was (as the name signifies) a dark, shady valley, on the east side of Jerusalem, between the city and the mount of Olives, through which a little brook ran, which took its name from it.

It was also called Kidron and Kedron. In summer it is almost dry. The word used here by the evangelist -  &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  cheimarrou - denotes properly a water-stream (from &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  cheimo&#772;n, shower or water, and &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  reo&#772;, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  roos, to flow, flowing), and the idea is that of a stream that was swollen by rain or by the melting of the snow (Passow, Lexicon). This small rivulet runs along on the east of Jerusalem until it is joined by the water of the pool of Siloam, and the water that flows down on the west side of the city through the valley of Jehoshaphat, and then goes off in a southeast direction to the Dead Sea. (See the map of the environs of Jerusalem.) Over this brook David passed when he fled from Absalom, <a href="/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a>. It is often mentioned in the Old Testament, <a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-14.htm">2 Chronicles 30:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>.<p>Where was a garden - On the west side of the Mount of Olives. This was called Gethsemane. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36</a>. It is probable that this was the property of some wealthy man in Jerusalem - perhaps some friend of the Saviour. It was customary for the rich in great cities to have country-seats in the vicinity. This, it seems, was so accessible that Jesus was accustomed to visit it, and yet so retired as to be a suitable place for devotion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 18<p>Joh 18:1-13.

Our evangelist saith, he went over the brook Cedron into a garden. The others say nothing of a garden, but mention his coming to a place called Gethsemane. It is probable that this village was at the foot of Mount Olivet; and the garden mentioned was a garden near that village, and belonging to it (for they had not their gardens within their towns, but without): now the way to this was over the brook Cedron; of which brook we read, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/15-23.htm" title="And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.">2 Samuel 15:23</a></span>; David passed over it when he fled from Absalom; and <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/2-37.htm" title="For it shall be, that on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, you shall know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be on your own head.">1 Kings 2:37</a></span>, where it is mentioned as Shimei’s limit, which he might not pass. This brook was in the way towards the mount of Olives; which being passed, he with his disciples went into a garden belonging to the town Gethsemane. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When Jesus had spoken these words,.... Referring either to his discourses in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a>, in which he acquaints his disciples with his approaching death; comforts them under the sorrowful apprehension of his departure from them; gives them many excellent promises for their relief, and very wholesome advice how to conduct themselves; lets them know what should befall them, and that things, however distressing for the present, would have a joyful issue: or else to his prayer in the preceding chapter, in which he had been very importunate with his Father, both for himself and his disciples; or to both of these, which is highly probable: <p>he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron; the same with "Kidron" in <a href="/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a>; and elsewhere: it had its name, not from cedars, for not cedars but olives chiefly grew upon the mount, which was near it; and besides the name is not Greek, but Hebrew, though the Arabic version renders it, "the brook" , "of Cedar": it had its name either from the darkness of the valley in which it ran, being between high mountains, and having gardens in it, and set with trees; or from the blackness of the water through the soil that ran into it, being a kind of a common sewer, into which the Jews cast everything that was unclean and defiling; see <a href="/2_chronicles/29-16.htm">2 Chronicles 29:16</a>. Particularly there was a canal which led from the altar in the temple to it, by which the blood and soil of the sacrifices were carried into it (m). This brook was but about three feet over from bank to bank, and in the summer time was quite dry, and might be walked over dry shod; and is therefore by Josephus sometimes called the brook of Kidron (n), and sometimes the valley of Kidron (o): in this valley were corn fields; for hither the sanhedrim sent their messengers to reap the sheaf of the firstfruits, which always was to be brought from a place near to Jerusalem (p); and it is very likely that willows grew by the brook, from whence they might fetch their willow branches at the feast of tabernacles; for the Jews say (q), there is a place below Jerusalem called Motza, (in the Gemara it is said to be Klamia or Colonia,) whither they went down and gathered willow branches; it seems to be the valley of Kidron, which lay on the east of Jerusalem, between that and the Mount of Olives (r); it had fields and gardens adjoining to it; see <a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4</a>. So we read of a garden here, into which Christ immediately went, when he passed over this brook. The blood, the filth and soil of it, which so discoloured the water, as to give it the name of the Black Brook, used to be sold to the gardeners to dung their gardens with (s). It was an emblem of this world, and the darkness and filthiness of it, and of the exercises and troubles of the people of God in it, which lie in the way to the heavenly paradise and Mount of Zion, through which Christ himself went, drinking "of the brook in the way",  <a href="/psalms/110-7.htm">Psalm 110:7</a>; and through which also all his disciples and followers enter into the kingdom of heaven: it may also be a figure of the dark valley of the shadow of death, through which Christ and all his members pass to the heavenly glory. And I see not why this black and unclean brook may not be a representation of the pollutions and defilements of sin; which being laid on Christ when he passed over it, made him so heavy and sore amazed in the human nature, as to desire the cup might pass from him. Once more let it be observed, that it was the brook David passed over when he fled from his son Absalom; in this David was a type of Christ, as in other things: Absalom represented the people of the Jews, who rejected the Messiah, and rebelled against him; Ahithophel, Judas, who betrayed him; and the people that went with David over it, the disciples of our Lord; only there was this difference; there was a father fleeing from a son, here a son going to meet his father's wrath; David and his people wept when they went over this brook, but so did not Christ and his disciples; the sorrowful scene to them both began afterwards in the garden. This black brook and dark valley, and it being very late at night when it was passed over, all add to that dark dispensation, that hour of darkness, which now came upon our Lord; yet he went forth over it of his own accord, willingly and cheerfully; not being forced or compelled by any; and his disciples with him, not to be partners of his sufferings, but to be witnesses of them, and to receive some knowledge and instruction from what they should see and hear: <p>where was a garden into which he entered; and his disciples: there were no orchards nor gardens within the city of Jerusalem, but rose gardens, which were from the times of the prophets (t); all others were without; and this was a very proper place for gardens, where so much dung was near at hand. Whether this garden belonged to one of Christ's friends, is not certain; but since he often resorted hither, no doubt it was with the leave, and by the consent of the proprietor of it. However, so it was, that as the first Adam's disobedience was committed in a garden, the second. Adam's obedience to death for sin, began here; and as the sentence of death, on account of sin, was passed in a garden, it began to be executed in one. <p>(m) Misn. Middot, c. 3. sect. 2.

The inference is that both names were current, the Hebrew having given birth to a Greek name of different meaning but very similar sound. Kedron or Kidron = ‘black,’ and is commonly supposed to refer to the dark colour of the water or the gloom of the ravine. But it might possibly refer to the black green of cedar trees, and thus the two names would be united. This detail of their crossing the ‘Wady’ of the Kidron is given by S. John alone; but he gives no indication of a “reference to the history of the flight of David from Absalom and Ahitophel” (<a href="/2_samuel/15-23.htm" title="And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.">2 Samuel 15:23</a>). ‘Brook’ is misleading; the Greek word means ‘winter-torrent,’ but even in winter there is little water in the Kidron. Neither this word nor the name Kedron occurs elsewhere in N.T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a garden</span>] Or, orchard. S. Matthew and S. Mark give us the name of the enclosure or ‘parcel of ground’ (<a href="/john/4-5.htm" title="Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.">John 4:5</a>) rather than ‘place,’ of which this ‘garden’ formed the whole or part. Gethsemane = oil-press, and no doubt olives abounded there. The very ancient olive-trees still existing on the traditional site were probably put there by pilgrims who replanted the spot after its devastation at the siege of Jerusalem. S. John gives no hint of a comparison between the two gardens, Eden and Gethsemane, which commentators from Cyril to Isaac Williams have traced. See on <a href="/mark/1-13.htm" title="And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.">Mark 1:13</a> for another comparison.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and his disciples</span>] Literally, Himself <span class="ital">and His disciples</span>, Judas excepted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/18.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/18-1.htm" title="When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.">John 18:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐξῆλθε</span>, <span class="ital">He went forth</span>) straightway. Therefore He had spoken in the city the words which have been written in the preceding chapters.—<span class="greekheb">τῶν Κέδρων</span>) It is called by the Hebrews <span class="greekheb">קדרון</span>. The Latin Vulgate has Cedron, not Cedrorum. Therefore we regard the <span class="greekheb">τῶν</span> as inserted by transcribers.[376] The Greeks inflected several Hebrew nouns so as to accord with the sounds of their own language, as Hiller shows in the Onom., p. 715: therefore in this way <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῶΝ ΚΈΔΡΩΝ</span></span></span> might have place.

Alex., have <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ χειμάῤῥῳ τοῦ Κέδρων</span>. In other cases the LXX. are wont to say, without an article, <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ χειμάῤῥῳ Χοῤῥάθ</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν χειμάῤῥουν Κεισῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

The stream rises north of Jerusalem, and separates the city on its eastern side from Scopas and the Mount of Olives. It reaches its deepest depression at the point where it joins the Valley of Hinnom near the well of Rogel, contributing to the peculiar physical conformation of the city. The stream is in summer dry to its bed, and Robinson, Grove, and Warren conjecture, in agreement with an old tradition, that there is, below the present surface of its bed, a subterraneous watercourse, whose waters may be heard flowing. The stream takes a sudden bend to the southeast at En-Rogel, and makes its way, by the convent of Saba, to the Dead Sea. It is not without interest that this note of place given by St. John alone - for the three other evangelists simply speak of "the Mount of <span class="accented">Olives"</span> <span class="accented">- brings</span> the narrative into relation with the story of David's flight from Absalom by the same route, and also the Jewish expectation (<a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>), and Mohammedan prediction, that here will take place the final judgment (Smith's 'Dictionary,' art. "<span class="accented">Kedron</span>," by Grove; 'Pictorial Palestine,' vol. 1; Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 1:269: Winer's 'B. Realworterbuch,' art.

Wilson, <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1</a>. and 5.). <span class="cmt_word">Where was a garden</span>. This reference is in agreement (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36</a>; <a href="/mark/14-32.htm">Mark 14:32</a>) with the synoptic description of the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "parcel of <span class="accented">ground</span>," small farm, or olive yard, enclosed from the rest of the hillside, and called "Gethsemane"  (<span class="accented">gath-shammi</span>, press for oil). The traditional site of the garden dates back to the time of Constantine, and may be the true scene of the agony described by the synoptists. There are still remaining "the eight aged olive trees," which carry back the associations to the hour of the great travail. It is certain that the general features of the scene still closely correspond with what was visible on the awful night ('Pictorial Palestine,' 1:86, 98). Patristic and mediaeval writers, with Hengstenberg and Wordsworth, see parallels between the garden of Eden lost by man's sin, and the garden of Gethsemane where the second Adam met the prince of this world, and bore the weight of human transgression and shame, and regained for man the paradise which Adam lost. It is still more interesting to notice a further touch recorded by John: <span class="cmt_word">Into which</span> - into the quiet retreat and partial concealment of which - <span class="cmt_word">he</span> (Jesus) <span class="cmt_word">entered himself, and his disciples</span>. We know from the other Gospels that they were separated -eight remained on watch near the entrance, and Peter and James and John went further into the recesses of the garden, and again, "about a stone's cast," in the depth of the olive-shade, our blessed Lord retired to "pray." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-30.htm">Matthew 26:30</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36-46</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/14-26.htm">Mark 14:26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/14-32.htm">Mark 14:32-42</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39-46</a>.<p>Brook (&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>From &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, winter, and &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, to flow.

There is some uncertainty as to the exact meaning of the word cedar, which occurs frequently, some supposing it to be a general name for the pine family. A tree of dark foliage is mentioned in the Talmud by the name of cedrum. The ravine of Kidron separated the Mount of Olives from the Temple-Mount. Westcott cites from Derenbourg ("On the History and Geography of Palestine") a passage of the Talmud to the effect that on the Mount of Olives there were two cedars, under one of which were four shops for the sale of objects legally pure; and that in one of them pigeons enough were sold for the sacrifices of all Israel. He adds: "Even the mention of Kidron by the secondary and popular name of 'the ravine of the cedars' may contain an allusion to a scandal felt as a grievous burden at the time when the priests gained wealth by the sale of victims by the two cedars." The Kidron is the brook over which David passed, barefoot and weeping, when fleeing from Absalom (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23-30</a>). There King Asa burned the obscene idol of his mother (<a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>). It was the receptacle for the impurities and abominations of idol-worship, when removed from the temple by the adherents of Jehovah (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-16.htm">2 Chronicles 29:16</a>); and, in the time of Josiah, was the common cemetery of the city (<a href="/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>).
