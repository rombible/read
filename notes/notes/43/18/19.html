In these questions there was a great deal of art. For, as the crime laid to our Lord’s charge was, that he set himself up for the Messiah, and deluded the people, they expected he would claim that dignity in their presence, and so, without further trouble, they would have condemned him on his own confession. But, to oblige a prisoner to confess what might take away his life, being an unjust method of procedure, Jesus complained of it with reason, and bade them prove what they laid to his charge, by witnesses. <span class="ital">Jesus answered, I spake openly, </span>&c. — What I have taught has been delivered in the most public manner. <span class="ital">I ever taught in the synagogue </span>— As I had opportunity; <span class="ital">and in the temple, whither the Jews resort </span>— In the greatest numbers; <span class="ital">and in secret have I said nothing </span>— Even to my most intimate friends, but what has been perfectly agreeable to the tenor of my public discourses. <span class="ital">Why askest thou me — </span>Whom thou wilt not believe? It was greatly to the honour of our Lord’s character, that all his actions were done in public, under the eye even of his enemies; because, had he been carrying on any imposture, the lovers of truth and goodness would thus have had abundant opportunities to have detected him. With propriety, therefore, in this defence, he appealed to that part of his character; nevertheless, his answer was thought disrespectful. For, <span class="ital">when he had spoken, one of the officers </span>— Belonging to the court; <span class="ital">struck Jesus, saying, Answerest thou the high- priest so? </span>— With so little reverence? <span class="ital">Jesus answered </span>— With his usual mildness; <span class="ital">If I have spoken evil </span>— Any thing false or improper; <span class="ital">bear witness of the evil </span>— Show wherein it lies; <span class="ital">but if well, why smitest thou me</span> — Can reason be answered by blows? Or, can such a sober appeal to it deserve them? Thus Jesus became an example of his own precept, (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm" title="But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;">Matthew 5:44</a>,) bearing the greatest injuries with a patience that could not be provoked. <span class="ital">Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest </span>— The evangelist mentions that Jesus was sent to the high-priest, because he had before said that he was sent first to Annas, the high-priest’s father-in-law. Moreover, he takes notice that he was sent bound, to show the inhumanity of the officer who struck him in that condition. Of what took place while Jesus stood before the high-priest, see the notes on <a href="/context/matthew/26-59.htm" title="Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;...">Matthew 26:59-68</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:13-27 Simon Peter denied his Master. The particulars have been noticed in the remarks on the other Gospels. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. The sin of lying is a fruitful sin; one lie needs another to support it, and that another. If a call to expose ourselves to danger be clear, we may hope God will enable us to honour him; if it be not, we may fear that God will leave us to shame ourselves. They said nothing concerning the miracles of Jesus, by which he had done so much good, and which proved his doctrine. Thus the enemies of Christ, whilst they quarrel with his truth, wilfully shut their eyes against it. He appeals to those who heard him. The doctrine of Christ may safely appeal to all that know it, and those who judge in truth bear witness to it. Our resentment of injuries must never be passionate.

The charge on which they wished to arraign him was that of sedition, or of rebellion against Caesar. To make that plausible, it was necessary to show that he had made so many disciples as to form a strong and dangerous faction; but, as they had no direct proof of that, the high priest insidiously and improperly attempted to draw the Saviour into a confession. Of this he was aware, and referred him to the proper source of evidence - his open, undisguised conduct before the world.<p>His doctrine - His teaching. The sentiments that he inculcated. The object was doubtless to convict him of teaching sentiments that tended to subvert the Mosaic institutions, or that were treasonable against the Roman government. Either would have answered the design of the Jews, and they doubtless expected that he - an unarmed and despised Galilean, now completely in their power - would easily be drawn into confessions which art and malice could use to procure his condemnation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19-21.

What particular questions he propounded to him we do not read; only in general he inquired about the doctrine he had preached, and the disciples he had sent out, which was one and the same cause, to see if he could bring him under the guilt of a false prophet; for that, and blasphemy, and idolatry, were three principal causes that fell under the cognizance of this court, as appeareth from <span class="bld">Deu 13</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The high priest then asked Jesus,.... Being now brought from Annas to Caiaphas, who was the high priest and mouth of the sanhedrim, and to whom it appertained to hear and try a cause relating to doctrine. And what he did was by putting questions to him, instead of opening the charge against him, and calling for witnesses to support it. The person he interrogated was a greater high priest than himself; was that prophet Moses spoke of, to whom the Jews were to hearken, and no other than the Son of God, and King of Israel; who, when at twelve years of age, asked the doctors questions, and answered theirs, to their great astonishment. He first inquires <p>of his disciples, not so much who they were, and what they were, and how many they were, and where they were now, as for what purpose he gathered them together; whether it was not with some seditious views to overturn the present government, and set up himself as a temporal prince; and this he did, that he might be able to send him, with a charge against him, to the Roman governor: he did not ask for his disciples to come and speak on his behalf, if they had anything to say for him, which, by their canons (p), was allowed and encouraged: <p>"if any of the disciples (of the person accused) says, I have a crime to lay to his charge, they silence him; but if one of the disciples says, I have something to say in his favour, they bring him up, and place him between them; nor does he go down from thence all the day; and if there is anything in what he says, , "they hearken to him".'' <p>The Jews indeed pretend (q) that after Jesus was found guilty, a herald went before him forty days declaring his crime, and signifying, that if anyone knew anything worthy in him, to come and declare it; but none were found: but this is all lies and falsehood, to cover their wickedness; no disciple of his was allowed to speak for him. The high priest next asked Jesus <p>of his doctrine; not for the sake of information and instruction, nor to see whether it was according to the Scriptures; but if it was a new doctrine, and his own, and whether it tended to idolatry or blasphemy, and whether it was factious and seditious, that so they might have wherewith to accuse him; for though they had got his person, they were at a loss for an accusation; and yet this self-same man that put these questions, and was fishing for something against him, had before given counsel to put him to death, right or wrong: all this was doing, and these questions were put to Jesus, whilst Peter was denying him. <p>(p) T.

Tholuck dismisses the idea of Annas altogether, and, by inverting the place of Ver. 24 or treating the  <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span> as pluperfect, suppose that Annas <span class="accented">had</span> sent the Lord to Caiaphas (so Calvin, De Wette, Hase, and others), who thus commenced his interrogatory. But the text of Ver. 24, now recovered, will not admit of this rendering. We find it far more satisfactory to accept this less formal examination, under the presidency of Annas, at which an attempt is made to put the Lord, if possible, to a test which will incriminate him. Keim says, "If Caiaphas were the acting high priest, and at the same time the soul of the movement against Jesus, it was for him and not for his father-in-law to take knowledge of the matter and report to the Sanhedrin." We must choose between two difficulties: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Caiaphas is first spoken of as "high priest," who, as we know from the synoptists, conducted the examination-in-chief, and then that Annas, as conducting a preliminary examination, is also styled "high priest" without any explanation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> or we must admit the supposition that after Caiaphas had asked these incriminating questions, <span class="cmt_word">Annas</span> (who was not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>), sent Jesus bound <span class="accented">to Caiaphas the high priest</span>. The former hypothesis is the easier. <span class="cmt_word">The high priest then asked Jesus concerning his disciples</span>, the extent of his following, the number of his accomplices, the ramifications of the society or kingdom he professed to have founded, and <span class="cmt_word">concerning his doctrine,</span> the secret teachings that held his followers together. He evidently knows the claims of Jesus well enough; his spies and officers have continually been dogging the steps of Jesus, and hitherto he has failed to gain evidence positively incriminating him. And as his representatives a few days ago were utterly foiled, notwithstanding their clever design, he hopes by his own ingenuity to entrap the Lord in his talk. Our Lord, anxious not to endanger his disciples, points to the publicity of his ministry, and appeals to all and sundry who have heard him. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Asked (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Or, questioned.<p>Doctrine (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., better, teaching. </body></html>
